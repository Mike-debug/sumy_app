4376094,103480,2020-09-24T09:50:06-04:00,"LendingClub is fighting an existential threat from the pandemic, as higher borrower defaults chased many investors out of the market for personal loans.
        LendingClub's originations have grinded to a near-halt.
        The company now depends almost wholly on servicing revenues in order to keep the business going.
        There is little visibility into when (or if) LendingClub can return to normal.","Once a fintech darling that was called one of the most innovative tech companies to revolutionize consumer finance, LendingClub (LC) has taken a stark fall from grace this year. Already struggling with slowing investor demand before the pandemic, LendingClub got hit hard by a spike in defaults (largely expected across the industry, as smaller lenders like LendingClub and the biggest banks in the U.S. both got hit hard) and suffered a further capital flight from the investors that drive LendingClub's business. In its private days, LendingClub was once worth up to $3.8 billion. With shares down ~70% year to date, LendingClub's ~$320 million market cap is now only a shadow of what it was once worth in the past. It's fair to say, in my view, that LendingClub is shrinking - not just from a valuation perspective, but also in the scope of its business. We'll take you through the most recent quarterly results shortly, but the high-level themes are this:In recognition that investor demand is weak and that LendingClub has to rely almost exclusively on servicing revenues to sustain itself, the company has done a good job at slashing expenses and preserving liquidity. So the bottom line on LendingClub is this: while LendingClub's emergency reactions to maintain liquidity mean that there is no near-term risk of a flameout in this company, neither do we see a path to normalization. Servicing can't be the entirety of this company forever - as loans retire/borrowers default, the portfolio will shrink and LendingClub will have to turn on the originations machine again, if it can win back investors' trust. With no signals that this will happen in the near future, I'm still content to sit this stock out from the sidelines.Let's at least start with some of the good news: liquidity maintenance and cost cuts.Despite a challenging Q2 with near-zero revenue, LendingClub managed to enforce its cost cuts, hitting its target of reducing operating expenses by ~$70 million (versus Q4, which LendingClub refers to as its last non-pandemic quarter) by virtually cutting all marketing expenses, reducing discretionary spending, reining in its real estate footprint, cutting 460 employees out of the workforce, and reducing compensation for senior executives, the CEO, and board members. We can see the impacts of these cost cuts in the charts below. Origination and servicing costs, plus sales and marketing costs (which for LendingClub can be thought of the ""cost of goods sold"" that are netted out pre-gross margin) have fallen to $22.5 million in Q2, a ~$46 million sequential reduction and a ~$65 million reduction from Q4. Figure 1. LendingClub cost trendsSource: LendingClub Q2 earnings deckLikewise, LendingClub's cash operating costs (excluding stock comp, depreciation/amortization, and other non-cash/one-time items) benefited from the company's headcount reduction and salary cuts, and these operating expenses are down ~$11 million sequentially and ~$13 million from Q4 to $49.0 million.Figure 2. LendingClub operating cost trendsSource: LendingClub Q2 earnings deckSo despite revenue pressure, LendingClub managed to preserve its liquidity. As of the end of Q2, LendingClub calculates its liquidity at $554 million versus $550 million as of the end of Q1. I'd also consider this asset mix to be of a higher quality than in Q1, because the company managed to reduce its loans held for sale by ~$50 million and pump more into cash and cash equivalents. Figure 3. LendingClub Q2 liquidity walkSource: LendingClub Q2 earnings deckSo the bottom line here: with about ~$71.5 million in combined cash costs (add up $22.5 million of origination/servicing sales and marketing costs from the first chart, to $49.0 million of operating costs in the second chart), LendingClub's ~$554 million in liquidity leaves it in a good position to weather the current crisis. These stringent cost cuts, however, were a stark necessity when the business is completely shrinking. As you can see in the chart below, LendingClub originated only $326 million in new loans in Q2 - a 90% y/y reduction versus $3.13 billion in 2Q19. As I mentioned previously, originations used to be the primary driver for the business, with total transactional revenues making up ~80% of the company's overall revenue.Figure 4. LendingClub originations trendsSource: LendingClub Q2 earnings deckWe can attribute the originations decline both to internal and external factors. Recognizing that credit quality was of the utmost importance, LendingClub itself stopped originating to its most speculative segment of borrowers, and the average LendingClub borrower now has a FICO score of 721 and annual income of ~$108k, a substantial improvement versus 708/$93k in 2019. But at the same time, LendingClub has also seen a capital flight from institutional money, which finances the loans it originates. You can see in the chart below that institutional investors, which historically have provided ~20% of LendingClub's loan funding, has completely exited the picture in Q2. And while the chart below suggests that banks have taken a heavier hand in LendingClub's originations, note that the mix-based chart below doesn't take volumes into account. Banks' 68% share of $326 million in Q2 originations is still only ~$222 million, versus 45% of $3.13 billion last year amounting to a much bigger $1.41 billion contribution from banks. Figure 5. LendingClub investor mixSource: LendingClub Q2 earnings deckScott Sanborn, LendingClub's CEO, noted that investors are slowly coming back to the table - but as can be seen from the originations trends above, normalization is still a long ways off. A bit more context from Sanborn's prepared remarks on the Q2 earnings call:The prime issue here is that LendingClub is expecting its pre-COVID loan ""vintages"" to return only ~3%, which is barely above government/high-grade corporate bonds - far from enough to compensate investors for the risk associated with unsecured personal loans. So for now, LendingClub has been reduced to relying on its servicing portfolio. Servicing drove $44.4 million of adjusted revenue in Q2, or about ~60% of the company's ongoing expenses. That's fine for now, but note that LendingClub's servicing portfolio is shrinking, down -6% y/y in Q2 (the first time over the past year that the portfolio has shrunk). Figure 6. LendingClub servicing trendsSource: LendingClub Q2 earnings deckTurnover is rapid in LendingClub loans, especially in a time with frequent borrower defaults. It's clear here that even with servicing fees providing the bulk of LendingClub's current revenue, LendingClub will need to stimulate new originations demand in order to keep the portfolio afloat.LendingClub is a very messy business right now, especially as the company plows ahead with its acquisition of Radius Bank in the attempt to become a bank and collect deposits to finance its loans. Given the uncertainty as well as sharply lower originations trends, I'm still content to stay out of LendingClub."
4376305,75025,2020-09-25T09:17:35-04:00,"Loan data filed with the SEC shows that the number of approved loans is rising and could even top the company's outlook.The average FICO score of LC's pre-approved loans has declined a bit, which is compensated by a slightly higher interest rate.The communicated Radius Bank synergies are to be taken with a grain of salt.At a pro-forma P/TB ratio of 0.75, I continue to value the stock at $5.","The share price of LendingClub (LC) is down another dollar since the last time that I started writing an article about it. Given that my price target has been breached, it is a good time to publish an update and conclude this successful bearish recommendation.I want to caution investors however, that though the stock is cheap and looks like a cyclical rebound story, there are several problems. First of all, its originations will still be down severely YoY in Q3. Second, LC still attracts the same borrower profile. Third, while the acquisition of Radius will probably help, it is not a silver bullet to all of the company's problems.The one worry that a short or bear would have is the accommodative policy of the Federal Reserve. It is reasonable to assume that the massive monetary stimulus will find its way to LC’s loan buyers who will use the liquidity to purchase short-term loans.LendingClub has to file all pre-approved loans it offers to investors under the Standard Program with the SEC. These end up in 424B3 filings (example) that contain credit score, income, and several other interesting data points.In the first four days after Labor Day weekend of September 2019, the company logged 260 MB worth of 424B3 filings with the SEC. In 2020, this was just 36 MB, or 14% of 2019. Taking a different week does not make a lot of difference; the prior week had 37MB of applications. The 36 MB filing volume represents approximately $40m worth of pre-approved loan volume according to my sample of 8 filings. In fiscal Q3 last year, originated loan volume was about $260 million per week ($3,350m divided by 13 weeks) of which about $180m (=2343/13) was under the Standard Program as shown below. So if LC originated every pre-approved loan, it will get close to 22% of last year’s origination (=40/180) level, which would be $670m based on the September sample.Source: LC 10-Q.The quarterly total will probably be less, as we should also take into account that the Custom Program (that contains higher risk borrowers and is excluded from the SEC data) originations collapsed by 99%. Another datapoint is that September is a rather ‘full’ month, regarding filings. For July, I estimate that pre-approvals were closer to $30m per week.Source: LC 10-Q.So what we have for Q3 is perhaps 20% of last year’s $2,343m, or $470m for the standard program plus $30m for the custom program (this is a shot in the dark), which takes us to $500m. Then we have other loans, which could be 75% of last year’s level, which would be $140m for a grand total of $640m, which I regard as the high-end of the probable range. This is in-line with the company’s guidance of $500m-$600m but shows that there could be a little upside.Whatever happens, it will take time for LC to get out of the woods. Consensus EPS for 2021 is $-0.75, or put a different way: a huge loss for a stock trading at $4.50. The consensus for next quarter is $-0.57, which is below my own forecast. But who can blame analysts for being bearish after shooting too high twice in a row?Source: Seeking Alpha.In both Q1 and Q2, revenue estimates were also materially higher than actual revenue.An important question is how the borrower profile has developed at LC since earlier this year. The company has been quite vocal about raising its standards, saying that it prioritizes credit quality in this environment.A positive for credit quality (but a negative for operating expenses) is that LendingClub is checking a lot more borrower incomes than before. Pre-pandemic, I calculated based on a random sample, that 6.8% of incomes of pre-approved loans were checked. Based on a sample from September, this appears to have risen to 70%. The September average verified annual income was $83,000, while the average unverified income was $90,000. That difference isn’t too large and could be the result by people rounding their income up a bit and a little bit of statistical confidence interval. Either way, I don’t regard it as material.In my first LC article, I thought that many of LC’s clients were dishonest on their applications as the income was so much higher than the national median. It looks I was wrong on that and that LC successfully targets high income borrowers who have a mediocre credit score. So the typical borrower doesn’t struggle with her income, but rather with his own spending habits and saving money in general. The high incomes suggest that they are less likely to work in industries that are hit by the pandemic, as that has hurt primarily low-wage industries. This is a credit positive for all of LC’s issued loans. Of course, the low number of personal bankruptcies, driven by federal income support also helps.On the other hand, LC’s borrowers will have a big problem if they lose their income that they (on average) rely so heavily upon. A risk is that as the pandemic drags on, the economic fallout shifts from a limited number of sectors to the broader economy.The next question is how the average FICO score has developed. I used the following chart in my first article.FICO score distribution of the Standard Program based on a random sample of 1160 pre-approved borrowers taken in January 2020. The data is borrower-weighted. Source: author’s own calculations.Using a random sample of 5 filings from Sept 4th to September 18th, I made an updated chart below. To me, it stands out that the median FICO score is now deeper within the 681-700 range while the higher score groups have been downsized. The January sample had an average FICO score of 705, but this has dropped to 701 in September.So I would conclude that upping the creditworthiness of clients has not happened, but this is not too surprising as 660-720 FICO borrowers are LC’s core customers for several reasons. First, people with a high credit rating don’t apply for many loans because they have their finances in order. Second, lenders target different groups and LC faces more competition in other customer groups. Third, LendingClub is mostly used to refinance credit card debt and in my world, most people pay off their balances every month. The last point connects to the first, but it is also a matter of targeting and finding a profitable market niche.FICO score distribution of the Standard Program based on a random sample of 326 pre-approved borrowers taken in September 2020. The data is borrower-weighted. Source: author’s own calculations.While FICO scores of new loans have slightly deteriorated, the average interest rate has moved up by 25 to 50 basis points between January and September according to my sample data. On a risk-adjusted basis, I don’t think that much has changed. This is probably why investors are not yet rushing to return to fund loans.A much-discussed problem with LendingClub is that it is quite vulnerable to the economic cycle. Unlike some optimists say, the global economy is not out of the woods yet. US jobless claims are still significantly higher than pre-COVID, as the WSJ reported the other day. Mounting sovereign debt levels are also quite detrimental to future growth and stimulus is finite, as Bill Gross pointed out. I don’t expect originations to return to pre-pandemic levels soon, given that fiscal stimulus is needed to support the economy.Apart from its cyclical nature, a problem that LendingClub has is that it has never turned an annual profit despite being in business for 10 years. Management came to terms with reality and decided to become a bank by buying one.There are some owners of LC equity who believe that the $80m projected synergies will flow straight to pre-tax income. That approach would earn them an ‘F’ on an investor’s exam. The company laid out the benefits of the merger well, but it has not fully quantified opportunity costs and added expenses it has to bear.As calculated my last article, the combined pre-merger 2019 loss of Radius and LC is $25m. This means that synergies should exceed $25m for the company to break-even in a good year such as 2019. I trust that the company can increase net interest margin of Radius by 100bps and extract another $12m in net synergies, but that will bring LC to zero, not a sustainable profit. I highly doubt whether LC can put many personal loans on the balance sheet of the bank with great ease. Unsecured personal loans require a lot of Basel capital and the ROE is likely not to be that much higher than that of the existing loans on the balance sheet of Radius.The real point is this: do the loans by LC offer such an attractive risk/return that they are a steal? As I explored in my first LC article, the risk/return compared to personal loans that major banks carry is sub-par. But to outside investors with excess cash it is quite acceptable amid the low rate environment. If the loans were really that attractive, investors would bid up the prices and LC would’ve been profitable years ago. Its brand, platform, scale and efficiency are the real strengths of LendingClub and this is what I have been paying attention to in my last articles.When looking at the book value, we have to account for the price that LC wants to pay for Radius as well as the likely losses up to that point. Acquiring Radius will reduce tangible book value by $60m (price paid for Radius minus its equity) and I expect LC to lose another $80m before the acquisition. I continue to value LC at 0.75 times its book value at the time of acquisition, which is $5 per share. I think that there are funding and branding synergies between Radius and LendingClub that justify a P/TB ratio of 0.75, which is slightly higher than banking peers, as I pointed out in my last article.Excluded from this picture is the dilution from issuing stock worth $46m to pay for 25% of Radius. This is an overhang that represents 10 million shares at the current market price, which is 14% of free float and 11% of the total outstanding (adjusted for Shanda’s locked shares). This logically scares off investors as it dilutes the tangible book value per share.Despite all of my negativity about business fundamentals, I think it is quite possible that LC will beat consensus by topping its origination volume guidance. It also helps that its valuation is undemanding after the stock lost 65% YTD, underperforming just about every benchmark."
4370845,75025,2020-08-26T09:46:21-04:00,"Q2 was a nightmare with originations down 89% vs. Q4.The next quarter will be better, but I still expect the company to lose $45m on its operations.LendingClub is still committed to becoming a bank.Valuing the company as if it is a bank shows a very tough path towards further upside.","It has been some time since I published my last update on LendingClub (LC) just after its Q1 results. Since then, Q2 results have been posted and it looks like the company underperformed my modest expectations.On the bright side: visibility improved somewhat. The company made an estimate of Q3 originations that I used to do some forecasting and it reaffirmed its commitment to purchase Radius Bank.I remain of the view that LendingClub's plan of becoming a bank will not solve its fundamental problem of not having a substantially profitable loan platform. Instead, it creates just more uncertainty for investors. While LC has now underperformed the S&P 500 by 85% since my initial sell call in March, I still do not think it is cheap enough to make the stock attractive.Loan originations were not the big surprise of the quarter, as LC already said it expected a 90% decline. But it is still interesting to illustrate what happened in the chart below.Source: author's own calculations based on company reportsIt was primarily investors (loan supply) that scaled back their activity, as foreseen. Institutional investors (other than banks) even stopped buying loans altogether.The table below shows the results for the past three quarters and my estimates for Q2. Curious readers can find the drivers behind the estimates in my previous article.Source: author's own estimates and calculationsTransaction fees have taken a serious nosedive in Q2. As a percentage of originations, these fees shrank to 1.2% versus a usual 5%. The quarterly earnings release points to prepayments that have increased back to pre-COVID-19 levels. Higher prepayment levels negatively affect the fee prepayment reserve that is designed to pay back customers when loans are prepaid early. Though this reserve is small, it is big compared to the extremely low amount of fees earned in Q2.Investor fees have taken a nosedive for the same underlying reason. Prepayments have reduced the value of the servicing asset which was reflected in the investor fees line item.Prepayments are the main driver on the revenue side that affected my estimates to be off, but they should be non-recurring. This also puts the Q1 figures into perspective as fees were inflated by lower prepayment assumptions. Of course, the company did not mention that effect at all in its Q1 press release. Based on the amount of serviced loans still outstanding and the fee level of Q4, normalized investor fees should amount to $26m per quarter with further downside as the servicing portfolio is shrinking rapidly.Cost savings have taken place, but have been somewhat obscured by $17m of restructuring costs. Ideally, we would have seen a higher beta in costs that is also more permanent. The majority of cost savings are in Sales & Marketing and a part of the fixed cost savings comes from senior management salary reductions for this year only.A positive in the quarter is that loan portfolio performance did well. I forecasted defaults to hit the portfolio and captured this in NII (highlighted in the table above), but that has not happened (yet). This is logically fueled by government transfers as well as enrollment of many borrowers in hardship programs. The question remains how this is going to develop in the coming quarters.The company also provided some originations outlook for Q3. Specifically, it said that origination volume should be in the $500m to $600m range. I have once again taken the liberty to fill in the blanks for the next quarter. Assuming originations coming in at the high end of expectations and no further impairments, an operating loss of $45 million should be doable.Source: author's own estimatesNote that interest income is also set to decline as LendingClub is planning on selling loans in preparation of the capitalization of the bank. I also anticipate balance sheet equity to shrink to $700m by the end of the current quarter.There was one interesting quote in the Q2 earnings transcript that caught my eye:It seems strange that this company, a FinTech with a novel approach to online consumer lending, explicitly says it wants to become a bank by acquiring one. I can recommend this American Banker article to readers who want to know more about the softer parts of the deal. Either way, it shows that the company remains fully committed to acquiring Radius Bank and that this should be incorporated into the valuation.LC agreed to pay $185m for the shares. From the latest FDIC Call report, I found that Radius has equity of about $125m, meaning LC is paying close to 1.5x book value for a bank.If we take the $700m Q3 equity estimated earlier and deduct $185m, add $125m, then we're at $640m pro-forma equity, excluding the losses between Q3 and the Radius acquisition. Let's assume those losses are another $40m, and we have a bank with an equity position of $600m. This is a P/B ratio of 0.80 to 0.85. Recall that the market cap of LC is about $500m now but has shown dips to $400m in the past couple of months.Let us now add up the earnings of the peak year 2019 of the companies to get a sense of a price/earnings ratio. In 2019, Radius Bank had a net income of $5m, while LendingClub lost $30m. This year will obviously be worse and it will take time to recover. While I do think that synergies can make a difference, I doubt whether they can fill a hole of $25 million. Radius had a net interest income of $38m in 2019 and increasing the net interest margin by 100bps would result in additional income of $13m. LC can use cheap deposits to fund personal loans but excluding pass-through interest, LC spent only $33m on interest in 2019 so it is questionable how much more cheap deposits can save.Aside from the 'how', it remains questionable 'if' they can really go far with putting all personal loans on the balance sheet of Radius. Banks are highly regulated and must maintain a solid common equity tier 1 ratio (CET1 ratio). Radius was at 11% at the end of last year, and this leaves little room for more risk-taking in my view. Additional equity must come from LC. Then there is the potential for saving a million here or there on IT or G&A expenses but the bottom line remains that it is tough to model the synergies without knowing the exact capital outcomes. I think it's hard to reach the profitability that justifies a reasonable valuation.As a comparison, I looked up the first five regional banks (in descending market cap order) with a market cap of just below $500m. As the table below shows, a P/E of 15 is about as good as it gets. For LC, this implies net earnings of $30m.Source: Seeking AlphaIt is possible to get sufficiently profitable when one employs a lot of imagination and normalization assumptions but it remains a stretch. On the other hand, the company has ample equity to fall back on and this could form the basis for its valuation. However, four out of the five banks above also trade at a discount to book, with the highest P/E bank, HarborOne Bancorp (HONE), trading at a modest P/B of 0.7.It is quite possible that LC's platform will earn it a premium P/E, but why would an investor accept such uncertainty to come out even in the best-case scenario? With a bit of optimism, I value LC at 0.75 times its $600m book value calculated in this article, which comes down to $450m, or $5 per share.LendingClub had a nightmarish second quarter and is now working through a third quarter that will be better but still terrible. The company hopes to finalize its acquisition of Radius Bank in the first half of 2021 and this will be a transformative acquisition. Unfortunately, valuing LC like a bank just doesn't look pretty.At this point we have a reasonably clear visibility on how tough the remainder of the COVID-19 crisis will be. Beyond that, LC is simply a shot in the dark that is not worth taking."
4351541,103480,2020-06-02T13:50:46-04:00,"LendingClub offered a brand-new promotion to retail investors promising a 50bps bonus for new deposits to LendingClub in Q2.Investors, both retail and institutional, have backed off LendingClub due to the perceived risk of consumer debt amid a pandemic that has laid off millions of workers.At LendingClub's ~$2.5 billion Q1 originations pace, a 50bps discount applied to all investors would result in ~$10 million of costs, or a roughly 8 point impact to Q2 margins.LendingClub's liquidity looks thin as it is without additional costs.","Almost the entire market rallied in May, especially small cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 advancing 11% during the month. One major exception, however, is LendingClub (LC). The once-innovative and market-leading fintech company, which focuses on providing unsecured consumer debt to borrowers, has been pressured into an existential crisis by the coronavirus. LendingClub's Q1 earnings, released in early May, showed a company that was preparing to see originations grind down to near-nothing, while the company tightened its belt and laid off one-third of its employees.Shares are currently trading close to 52-week lows, and have lost more than 55% year to date.Data by YChartsThis article will serve as an update to my prior article on LendingClub, with a specific update on LendingClub's crisis-management strategy: as a platform investor myself in LendingClub Notes, I was very recently alerted to an offer that LendingClub is proposing to retail investors in the months of June, July, and August. The company is planning to offer a 50bps bonus for all new deposits by investors, highlighting that the company is having issues funding new loans.As a refresher, the core bearish thesis for LendingClub hinges on the following points:And a look as well at how originations have trended so far this year:Figure 1. LendingClub originations trends by funding sourceSource: LendingClub Q1 earnings deckIn short: the latest bonus offer from LendingClub is a major sign of desperation. Resist the temptation to catch a falling knife and protect your capital by investing elsewhere.Here's the marketing details on the bonus offer that LendingClub is currently offering to retail investors:Figure 2. LendingClub bonus offerSource: LendingClub email promotionIt's a very simple promo: deposit new money into LendingClub and invest it in Notes (it can't just be sitting as uninvested cash in the account), and receive a 50bps bonus payment (here's a link to the full T&C's of the offer if you're curious). The company has been known to issue promos in the past, but few in the form of cash. Several years ago, LendingClub partnered with United Airlines (UA) to offer 1 MileagePlus mile (worth roughly $0.01) for every $1 invested on the LendingClub platform. Technically that would have been a 100bps promo at the time, but it wasn't a cash payment - and United was certainly footing a part of that bill. From time to time the company also offers referral-type bonuses - but in general, attracting investment dollars to fund loans from retail investors isn't in LendingClub's normal modus operandi, as the company focuses primarily on banks and institutional investors (which made up roughly two-thirds of originations funding in 2019).Retail investors make up the smallest portion of LendingClub's originations (roughly 4-5% of total volumes). To me, LendingClub's directed outreach to get more funding dollars is a sign of how desperate LendingClub is to attract fresh capital - in its investor presentation in May, LendingClub posited that ""loan volumes expected to be down approximately 90% reflecting current loan environment,"" largely as a result of platform investors taking steps to protect their capital from risky investments.This offer is very recent, having only been implemented on June 1. We don't know if LendingClub plans to do anything similar for banks and institutional investors. If applied only to retail investors, this program will cost very little for LendingClub - retail investors' ~4% contribution to Q1 originations of $2.5 billion amounted to only ~$100 million. Assuming Q2 originations keep the same pace as Q1 (which is highly unlikely), retail investors' 50bps credit would cost LendingClub less than $1 million.The risk is if this promo has any spillover effect to other sources of capital. Perhaps in seeing the consumer offer that LendingClub has put out, institutional investors and banks will also demand a discount. At the other extreme end, if LendingClub were to credit all of its outside funding sources with 50bps (80% of $2.52 billion in originations in Q1), the company could spend up to ~$10 million to attract new capital in Q2 alone, again assuming flat originations volumes (though as originations fall, so does revenue, and promo costs as a percentage of revenue would along with it). Q1 revenues, meanwhile, were only $120.2 million, so this could be up to an eight-point hit to operating margins (though as I previously said, this is the other end of the extreme, and it's unlikely that banks and institutional investors would receive as sweet of a deal as retail investors).As a refresher, LendingClub's liquidity picture already isn't incredibly healthy, so added costs of any magnitude will be adverse. As of the end of Q1, LendingClub had $294 million of cash left on its balance sheet against $110 million of debt drawn on its revolver, making for $184 million in net cash. As I calculated in my prior article, LendingClub's cash operating expenses amount to roughly $128 million per quarter, while servicing fees (that don't rely on new originations) bring in ~$50 million of revenue per quarter.Investors should closely monitor how LendingClub is reacting to the unprecedented bind that it's in. The company's brand-new deposit promotion advances the idea that demand for LendingClub's originations is very low, and requires bonuses to stimulate. Further and more dramatic actions may be needed in order for LendingClub to maintain anywhere near the same pace of originations as it has in prior quarters.With no light at the end of the tunnel for LendingClub yet, investors should continue to stay on the sidelines."

        Originations volumes swung negative, and the company warned that investor demand has soured amid deteriorating consumer credit conditions.
        With third-party investors in its loans diminishing, LendingClub has had to finance a greater portion of its originations from its own balance sheet, increasing credit exposure.
        LendingClub also took a $102 million markdown on expected defaults on loans held in its portfolio.","LendingClub (LC), the online consumer lender, is facing unprecedented difficulties as the impacts of the coronavirus on consumer credit are becoming more and more transparent. Initially hailed as an efficient marketplace to channel funds from savers and investors to creditworthy consumers, LendingClub is facing the prospects of both souring credit on its balance sheet plus a constricted environment to generate new loans, from which the origination fees form the bulk of the company's revenue.LendingClub's presented its bleak new reality when it revealed its first-quarter earnings (and subsequently yanked its full-year guidance), with shares falling sharply as a result. The stock has lost about half of its value since the start of the year, but I believe even more pain is to come.Prior to LendingClub's earnings, I highlighted the two key risks for LendingClub that investors should be aware of:LendingClub's latest earnings update has proven both risks true, and now we can offer an update on the magnitude of those twin factors. All in all, there's still no light at the end of the tunnel for LendingClub - as more and more of its risky loans unwind throughout the course of the year, the stock will see continued turmoil.First, an update on originations. As most seasoned LendingClub watchers know, LendingClub's business lives and breathes by new originations. Last year, just under 80% of LendingClub's ~$750 million in revenue was generated by transaction fees; while servicing fees and net interest income made up the remainder. Unfortunately, with consumer credit risks spiking and investors of all types scrambling to raise cash and mitigate portfolio risk, appetite for LendingClub's unsecured debt has understandably soured.As shown in the chart below, LendingClub's originations slowed -8% y/y to $2.52 billion in Q1, a fifteen-point deceleration relative to 7% originations growth in Q4 (and earlier in FY19, originations growth had been in the high teens).Figure 1. LendingClub originations trendsSource: LendingClub Q1 earnings presentationLendingClub expects the situation to become much worse, however. To maintain credit quality, LendingClub has tightened the eligible pool of borrowers (average FICO scores are now 723, versus 708 in 2019) and raised interest rates to compensate investors for the additional risk. And though LendingClub has withdrawn its full-year outlook, the company published a ""near term outlook"" that called for loan volumes to fall 90%. A situation like this would rob LendingClub of the majority of its revenue. And though LendingClub highlighted the fact that servicing fees drove $51.4 million in revenue in Q1, it's not even near enough to offset the loss of origination fees.Figure 2. LendingClub near-term outlookSource: LendingClub Q1 earnings presentationHere's how CEO Scott Sanborn describes LendingClub's current situation, per the earnings press release:Perhaps equally worrisome to the drop in originations expectations is the fact that what little LendingClub is able to originate may have to come out of its own pockets. In the originations chart in the prior section, we can see that the percentage of originations funded by LendingClub's own balance sheet rose to 20%, double what it was in 1Q19. As banks and institutional investors pull back their participation, LendingClub has had to put more of its balance sheet on the line to support ongoing loan issuance. Even without the added pressure from new loans, LendingClub's existing balance sheet is already a major cause for concern. In my prior article, I highlighted that typical charge-off rates in the LendingClub Notes portfolio tends to be around ~7%, and if charge-off rates rose by three points, LendingClub's inventory of ~$1.8 billion Notes held on the balance sheet would see about $185 million of principal risk.This quarter alone, LendingClub has marked down the value of its portfolio of Notes by $101.7 million, with further markdowns possible if A) credit conditions deteriorate or B) LendingClub continues to absorb more of its originations on its own balance sheet. This markdown is the primary reason that LendingClub's pro forma EPS of -$39.2 million, or -$0.44 per share, heavily missed Wall Street's expectations of just -$0.06.We worry about LendingClub's solvency amidst a period of low originations as well. Though the company has been unsentimental in reducing operating expenses - laying off 30% of its headcount, pausing most advertising spend - and reduced $70 million in costs out of its quarterly expense structure, its operating expense run-rate in Q1 still ran at $168.0 million on a GAAP basis. Even after netting out $40.1 million in stock-based comp, depreciation/amortization, legal/restructuring, and other non-cash non-recurring charges, this is substantially more than the ~$50 million in quarterly revenue that servicing fees can bring in, suggesting that LendingClub will be in cash-burn mode for the foreseeable future.To its credit, LendingClub has $294 million of cash left on its balance sheet against $110 million of debt drawn on its revolver, making for $184 million in net cash. In addition to this, the company has an additional ~$365 million of net liquidity through the Notes and other investments on its balance sheet that could be converted to cash if unloaded (shown in the table below).Figure 3. LendingClub liquidity bridgeSource: LendingClub Q1 earnings presentationThis does suggest that LendingClub has sufficient liquidity to sit through several quarters of zero or near-zero originations, all else equal. However, if LendingClub has to dedicate more of its balance sheet to financing whatever new loans it's able to originate (a 90% reduction on originations volumes still means a quarterly run-rate of ~$250 million in new originations), and if it runs into problems unloading the loans it already holds on its balance sheet, the company could be in for a liquidity crunch.LendingClub has done an admirable job of acting quickly to preserve its business throughout a difficult macro environment - slicing down operating expenses and payroll, while tightening credit standards to minimize future loan losses. However, the main risks for LendingClub are completely beyond its control:Q1 has shown us that LendingClub's fortunes have turned rather quickly, and with the expectation of near-zero originations and mounting defaults to come, we can't yet call the bottom on LendingClub's stock."
4353347,25941,2020-06-11T13:13:58-04:00,"LendingClub's stock is down 50% YTD, making it one of the few stocks that hasn't participated in the overall market rally.The near-term outlook is bleak, with the company guiding for Q2 loan originations to decrease 90% from the previous quarter.If your view is that the economy continues to improve through 2020 and into 2021, LendingClub's stock has tremendous upside.","LendingClub (NYSE:LC) is a peer-to-peer platform that connects borrowers with investors. Borrowers go to LendingClub's website, fill out their information, and in a day or two, they receive their loan. Investors can then log onto LendingClub's website and choose loans in which they wish to fund.The peer-to-peer lending model works best when economic conditions are good, credit is flowing freely, and peer-to-peer investors are willing and able to purchase loans. With today's conditions, there is obviously added uncertainty to the business model. Peer-to-peer platforms, like LendingClub, haven't been through a recessionary cycle. LendingClub was born out of the previous recession as institutions were reluctant to extend credit to borrowers.With loan originations decreasing, LendingClub has an uphill battle to fight. Additionally, yield spreads to peer-to-peer investors are wider than they have ever been, but it still may not be enough. If LendingClub is unable to sell their loans, they will be forced to keep them on their books and potentially take sizable losses.LendingClub's stock is no doubt one of the more riskier plays; high-yield unsecured consumer debt and a recession generally isn't the greatest recipe. However, we believe that these risks have been more than fairly priced into the stock's value. We view LendingClub as a potential investment opportunity for more speculative investors.Data by YChartsLendingClub earns money through origination fees that range between 2% and 6%. Additionally, they collect servicing fees on monthly principal and interest delivered to investors of 1% each month. As a result, revenue is highly correlated with the amount of loan originations that the company is able to churn out.Since reaching a peak in the 3rd quarter of 2019, originations have slowed over the previous two quarters. Further, the company is forecasting for a 90% reduction in quarter-over-quarter loan volume in Q2.As a result of declining originations, revenue has decreased from $175mm to $99mm during that same time period. Also contributing to the decrease was a $64mm revaluation of loans held on their balance sheet.Data by YChartsLendingClub is sacrificing origination volume for quality, which should come as no surprise. From the latest earnings call transcript,As a result, investors should see this as a positive, and not a negative. Financial institutions are doing the same thing. As economic conditions improve, loan originations will likely recover. The main concern for potential investors in LendingClub is whether or not they have enough liquidity to survive.At the end of Q1, LendingClub estimated that they have ~$550 million of net liquidity on their balance sheet, which they built up at the beginning of 2020. The company believes that it has enough liquidity to last through the end of 2021 in a variety of stress scenarios.If the economy continues to improve throughout 2020, it appears that investors have nothing to worry about from a going concern perspective. If the economy takes longer to bounce back, LendingClub may be forced to sell additional loans at sizable losses, negatively affecting earnings and eroding book value.We don't believe the latter to be the case. Last week's unexpectedly strong jobs report and the widening of the yield curve show promise of strong recovery. Jamie Dimon has also voiced his opinion, saying that the economy looks like it's headed for a fairly rapid recovery.The bottom line for investors is that revenue and earnings are likely to continue to suffer in the near term, as originations continue to slow, and charge-offs pile up. However, LendingClub's current valuation more than reflects that. Currently, the stock trades at 0.57x tangible book value. The market clearly is pricing in large losses in the future.Data by YChartsIf you believe that the economy will continue to recover, LendingClub appears to be an attractive opportunity. No doubt that there are higher risks associated with the stock compared to other companies or financials in general. LendingClub's exposure is to high-yield unsecured consumer debt. However, the stock may be worth a deeper look for investors with a higher risk tolerance."
4321142,75025,2020-02-04T07:44:13-05:00,"LendingClub originates unsecured personal loans it then sells to investors.Credit losses on its loans are steep and it looks like the company is worse than banks at underwriting.The stock is relatively cheap, which compensates for most of the poor performance of the platform and business cyclicality.","My first encounter with Lending Club (LC) was when I analyzed LendingTree (TREE) several months ago. Because I was finally out of other ideas to pursue, I wanted to take a look into this stock. What grabbed my attention was that it seems a disrupting FinTech that appears cheap (1.15x book value) and has traded higher in the past while its financials are improving, so it could be a turnaround. Furthermore, others have argued that the company has considerable cash balances that should be taken into account in the valuation of the stock.Over the past 12 months, LC has been a terrible investment, lagging the S&P by over 40%-pts. This could prove to be an opportunity for a contrarian investor to scoop up the discounted shares.Source: Seeking Alpha.However, my investigation has discovered that the company does not create value after being in business for well over 10 years. It is disappointing that such a mature FinTech with a large market share in a rising industry fails to do as well in its field as a bank.In a nutshell, LC is a Fintech that provides unsecured loans to consumers and small businesses though the internet. The loans are sold to investors, which include retail as well as professional investors, greatly reducing the credit risk to LC. In order for LC to thrive it must be better at banking than an ordinary bank. It can do so by cheap funding, superior underwriting or a low cost structure. It seems that LC has chosen for the latter.As I started analyzing Lending Club, I found out that most of their revenue came from loan origination. This means that the company has a strong incentive to increase loan production. At the same time, the company sells most of the credit risk to investors. Because a good risk/reward balance is usually a detractor of origination volume, it could be logical for the company to cut corners there and take on loans with poor credit quality. Unsurprisingly, the misalignment of interests has caused LC a lot of (legal) trouble in the past, but it changed its ways.This is why it surprised me that a large part of the investor type mix consists of banks. Banks are not the type of investors to take on poor risk/reward loans and know how to analyze credit. Also, they have grown their business with LC over the past years, which is a positive for competitive advantage sign. This is, however a negative sign for cheap funding as retail investors have reduced their loan funding. The credit quality question intrigued me most, so credit quality was the first focus of my investigation into Lending Club.The table below shows that Fintech companies such as LC have a different customer type than Banks or traditional finance companies (payday lenders) do. It seems that FinTechs are trying to capture the middle of the market, leaving the lowest risk clients for banks but the most dicey borrowers to specialized finance companies.Source: TransUnion.It is interesting that credit unions have a customer risk profile that is similar to FinTech’s. According to the National Credit Union Association, credit unions charge an average of 9.36% for 36 months unsecured fixed-rate loans. Though credit unions are particular organizations and are not always available to anyone, it could tell that they are competitive and have a lower risk borrower profile than FinTech’s.Using a $20m sample of actual loan data filed with the SEC, I was able to reconstruct the current credit profile of LendingClub’s customers in the Standard Program. This includes customers that are pre-approved by the platform for a loan and for whom an interest rate is determined. The Custom Program targets mostly lower quality credit borrowers and is responsible for about 26% of origination volume.Origination value weighted average FICO scores of LendingClub’s loan programs. Below prime is a score of less than 660 (and includes the estimate of Custom Program loan volume based on 2019 YTD data), Prime is 661-720, Prime plus is 721-780, and Super prime is above 781. Source: author’s own estimates, SEC filings from Jan 13 and Jan 14, totaling 1293 observations.A caveat is that LC uses FICO scores, while the industry average scores by TransUnion uses VantageScore 3.0. The latter has a lower average than FICO, according to Nerdwallet, so the comparable credit rating of LC’s customers is perhaps lower.According to a recent presentation by FICO, the average score is 706 and about 50% of Americans have a FICO above 720. However, only 32% of the borrowers in the Standard Program of LC have a credit score over 720, which drops to 25% if we also include the Custom Program in the company total.The pie chart below shows a more retailed distribution of FICO scores and this shows once again that the median for the Standard Program is certainly below 700. I calculated the average FICO for the Standard Program to be 705.FICO score distribution of the Standard Program based on the aforementioned sample taken in January 2020. The data borrower-weighted. Source: author’s own calculations. It seems that though the cutoff point for the Standard Program is 660, its FICO is still about the same as the national average, so the Standard Program is heavily geared towards borrowers with FICO scores that are just below average. There is less data available about the Custom Program, which according to the company contains both super prime loans and subprime loans.The loan tape also contains income information and strangely, there is only a very weak correlation between credit score and income. We have to keep in mind that it is the borrower who enters data on income, occupation, purpose of the loan during the application process. The company doesn’t check a lot and only 88 out of 1293 incomes in my sample were verified by LC, that is 6.8%, which must contain a margin of error still as the annual gross income figures are often still rounded. The lack of actual income verification is probably also why LC reports that its borrowers have incomes that are twice the U.S. median (p. 27 of the 2017 investor presentation). In the Standard Program, it appears that pre-approved borrowers have a gross annual median income of $72k and an average income of $87k. Of course, the truth is that income data is not reliable at all and probably heavily inflated.The company provides quarterly updates concerning net charge-off rates on both of its programs. It looks like the high charge-off rates for the Custom Program in the table shown below confirms my suspicion that it overwhelmingly lends to below prime borrowers. Overall, the charge off-rates that LC’s loans are facing are steep. A loan type with a net charge-off rate of over 6% is rare for banks.Source: LendingClub Q3 2019 10-Q.It is also interesting to take a look at the charge-off rates per vintage. 2016 is the worst performing vintage yet, which is perhaps to be expected considering the issues that started to surface in that year and the steps taken since. Nevertheless, it looks like 2017 and 2018 vintages are firmly within the bounds of 2015 and 2016 vintages.Source: LendingClub Q3 2019 10-Q.Please don’t be misled by the downward bend of the 2018 vintage in the chart above. This is a result of how LC measures defaults and doesn’t reflect a relative improvement in the vintage. To illustrate this, I have added the chart below which shows the same phenomenon (in red circle) for the 2017 vintage in the 2018 10-K. But as we can see in the chart above, the 2017 vintage remained close to the 2016 vintage between 12 to 18 months from origination.Source: LendingClub 2018 10-K. Red circle added by author for emphasis. To complete the picture, I added the 5-year Standard Program charge-off chart below. This program has relatively consistent charge-off rates over the past couple of years that seem to be heading towards the charge-off rates of the 2012 vintage. Overall, it seems that 60 month loans are much riskier than 36 month loans. While the 2016 vintage has a charge off rate of 8.5% for 36 month loans, it is well over 15% for 60 month loans after the first 36 months have passed.Source: LendingClub Q3 2019 10-Q.It looks like this data on charge-off rates conflicts with the annualized charge-off rates in the table. These loans run for multiple years, so the annual charge off rates should be a third or a fifth of the total percentages displayed in the charts, right? That is not really true because the loans amortize over time, causing their duration to be about half of the loan maturity. So by the end of year 2 of a 36 month loan, most of the balance has been paid off if it isn’t in arrears. Another issue is that prepayments are free while borrowers whose income or credit score are improving are most likely to prepay. The result is annualized charge off rates that approach 7%. The reported charge-off rates could be positively impacted by the growing loan book as most charge-offs are taken in the second year.All things considered, this borrower data is interesting but we should really find out what the returns are that investors can expect to see how attractive the product is when credit losses spike.Using multiple data sources, I constructed the waterfall chart below that shows loan return dynamics for Institutional and retail investors. In this calculation I have not taken into account that LC may give institutional investors better loan allocation. The interest rate of 12.75% is recent LC data. Figures such as fees to LC and FV adjustments are estimates based on my analysis of LC financial statements. The chart below is meant to reflect recent loan originations.Source: author’s own calculations for Standard Program personal loans. All figures are annualized. Institutional investors (including banks) should count on a return in the 5.5% area while retail investors will have to do with a quarter less. It could be less still. An academic study has found evidence of non-random allocation in favor of big investors. Considering that institutional investors and banks keep on funding LC’s origination, while making decent returns, we can assume that they will continue to do so in this environment. From their perspective they are in a favorable position: the duration of the loans is short and they can easily stop buying/funding loans at any moment. For LC this is a risk as the platform continues to cost money to support in absence of originations.The million dollar question remains what comparable loans do for banks. A total annualized loan revenue of 16% may seem high, but charge-offs of 7% are high as well. How good is LC really at originating loans with a favorable risk-return profile?This is not a very straight forward question to answer as the most banks have a higher quality borrower type and because unsecured personal loans are a tiny portion of bank’s business. Banks typically charge close to 10% for 2-year loans according to Federal Reserve data.Source: Fed. The problem is making it comparable, as it is hard to find reliable charge-off data for the market. PNC Financial (PNC) does publish data on personal loans, and its 2018 annual report reveals that it had a charge-off rate of 1.98% for this category of loans.The best availability of data consists of loans on credit cards and also, many LC customers say they use their loans to refinance or consolidate credit card debt.An interesting piece of information is captures by the chart below. The market for unsecured personal loans is growing and this is purely fueled by FinTech lenders. Meanwhile, other lenders, while losing share, all managed to maintain or even increase their absolute loan origination. The increase in market size logically comes from other credit types, and credit cards are a prime suspect.Source: TransUnion Consumer Credit Database, source file.Interestingly, LC had an origination volume of $8bn in the first 9 months of 2018 while total originations were under $80bn. This is consistent with the 10% self-reported market share over 2018. It also means that LC has over 25% market share within the FinTech category. We may safely conclude that LC is a large and mature player in this niche market.Now we can take the 7% charge-off rate of LC in mind and compare that to recent charge-off rates of bank credit cards. Data by the Federal Reserve shows that banks take annualized net charge-offs of 3.7% in Q3 2019.Source: Compiled by author using Federal Reserve data.The interest rate charged to people using the credit is a more difficult matter. According to the Fed, average assessed interest was 15% in Q3 2019, but this isn’t representative of all balances, on some of which no interest is charged. As an alternative, I will take Citigroup (C) branded card business. Citi’s Q4 financial supplement (found on this page) shows that net margin was 7.36%, after accounting for net credit losses of 3.1%.It appears that LC is undercutting banks to gain market share, which is not a big surprise, given its market share gains and studies that essentially show that FinTech lenders underprice their loans (by an average of 164 basis points in the case of Prosper).This must be a nuisance to banks which offer credit cards. An example is Citi Retail Services, which handles private label credit cards. These cards had a FICO profile that is roughly similar to that of LC as you can see from the table below.Source: Citigroup 2018 10-K.Interestingly, these credit cards faced net credit losses of almost 5% in H2 2019, which is still a lot lower than the losses at LC over the same period. At the same time, Citi recorded a yield on outstanding balances of about 18% in 2019. These clients would be cheaper off at LC, or other personal loan providers for that matter, as the data below by ValuePenguin suggests.Source: ValuePenguin.It seems that LC doesn’t have the pricing power or credit analysis capabilities that more traditional financial intermediaries have. Part of the problem is heavy competition by other FinTech lenders. Even Goldman Sachs (GS) has set up an online personal loan lender called Marcus (which doesn’t charge origination fees).Its platform is an important aspect of the narrative that LC tries to bring across to investors. A low-cost platform is also an important source of competitiveness in absence of superior origination versus others. Retail investors are shrinking as part of the overall origination mix. This is unfavorable as they pay higher servicing fees to LC than banks for example. In relative terms, retail has shrunk from 10% in Q1 2018 to 4% in Q3 2019, in absolute term it declined from about $230m to $130m per quarter.Source: chart compiled by author based on LC SEC filings. Let’s have a look at the bottom line for LC. How much does it make on originating loans and selling these to mostly institutional investors? My findings suggest that it isn’t that much. The platform has always been loss-making but had its best quarter in Q3 of 2019 with a loss of just 0.8% on loan balance originated in that quarter. It is encouraging that LC is able to show some cost control in the past few quarters, but it is difficult to discern how much is due to economies of scale and what is attributable to the relocation of half the workforce to Salt Lake City over the course of 2019.*Includes loan servicing fees (which show a flat trend) plus all revenues directly tied to loan origination and sale. Operating profit/loss excludes ‘other revenue’. Source: author’s own calculations based on LC SEC filings. Gross income on loans held includes gross interest income from loans on balance sheet.Even though platform losses as a percentage of origination may seem to have slid substantially in Q3, the trend in previous quarters is much weaker. Also, origination growth deflates platform losses as a percentage of origination even if actual losses remain stable. In absolute terms, the platform seems to have a long way to go to profitability. Based on YoY cost growth, I optimistically estimate that origination has to grow by at least 28% for the platform to break-even before interest income. I would be very curious to see what the company will manage to do in Q4 but getting the platform to profitability in 2020 or 2021 should be a top priority.Another thing that stands out is that net interest income on loans LC holds on its balance sheet support the company’s operating profit. Given that the company can’t grow its loan book profitably without turning a profit or issuing equity, this isn’t a source of growth. However, it could hurt growth as these loans are working capital that needs to grow as LC’s business grows.The core of being a FinTech is doing what traditional lenders do but better or cheaper. Given that the loans it originates are sold at fair market value and the company is losing money on its platform, it looks like the company isn’t efficient enough. Either it must improve underwriting or become more efficient.One element about LC that is certainly attractive is its low price to book value. The company holds a large volume of loans (‘Loans held for sale’ on the balance sheet below) and asset-backed securities (‘Securities available for sale’) on its own books for operational purposes. This is working capital, but it provides some yield for the company.Source: LC 10-Q.The total equity of the company is $888m -the vast majority of which is tangible and liquid- which makes for a P/B ratio of about 1.15 considering the $1bn market capitalization. According to data provided by Seeking Alpha, consensus EPS for 2020 is $0.40, making the 2020e P/E 29.4. This is a rather steep P/E but could be acceptable if we see a good prospects for profitable growth. It also helps that the company is turning itself around. The expected $0.40 EPS of 2020 is a sharp contrast to the small loss expected for 2019.I think that an EPS of $0.40 is quite optimistic but not completely out of reach if momentum holds. If the platform manages to break-even, quarterly earnings will be around $0.20 per share. The company is still far from that point. At the other hand, retail as a share of investors is declining and so is the yield on the loans held on balance sheet.Though it is likely that LC’s efficiency improves over time, it is more likely that a recession hits before its platform reaches a decent level of profitability and an annual EPS of $1, which would make the stock very attractive to many investors and I could see the market prepared to pay 20 times earnings for a growing cyclical company like LC. If that recession hits, personal loan origination plummets while credit losses pile up as borrowers can’t refinance and lose income. This will clearly destroy LC’s bottom-line.Taking a bearish view, including bankruptcy risk in a severe recession, the stock is worth much less. In that case, I would take a 10% discount on fair value of loans ($96m) the company holds and also write down intangibles ($15m), property, equipment & software ($117m) as well as loan servicing assets ($83m). Dividing the resulting $577m book value by 88 million shares leaves $6.50 per share in this very bearish scenario, a downside of 45%.Nevertheless, LC has set-up an infrastructure and brand that both have some value in this environment. To me, the current P/B of 1.15 looks to be within the range of reasonableness if LC can continue its slow progress.On a side note: the company tries to get investors to focus on EBITDA, which is wrong for a financial company as interest income and expense are operating expenses. GAAP EPS is the best underlying cash flow proxy available for LC.The market for personal loans has been growing and this growth has been fueled by FinTech lenders such as LC. The bottom line is that LendingClub has been benefitting from this perfect environment as well with low interest rates and low credit losses. An important factor that LC cannot control is investor appetite for its loans which could change rapidly when investors expect an increase in credit losses.Though this environment is likely to continue, and it is possible that LC can adapt when needed, it is not wise to bet on it. I think that the stock is not too far from fair value and don’t consider this stock a buy at its current valuation."
4374734,41921,2020-09-24T08:00:00-04:00,"LendingClub is trading near all-time lows and the company is at an inflection point.  Irrational fear for this Fintech company creates significant alpha opportunity.The bear case against LendingClub centers around how it will perform in a recession.  The bear case is unraveling before our eyes but the market has not caught on.Data is available, but not widely reported, showing how strong the loan portfolio is performing and that lending to new customers is recovering quicker than expected.The inflection point is the combination of a fact driven rebuttal of the Bear Case along with LendingClub's acquisition of a 100% digital bank (Radius Bank).The synergies from the bank acquisition, increasing yields for investors in a no-yield environment, and a digital business model with recurring revenue make this a massively undervalued opportunity that could double.","I am in firmly in the camp that a great rotation into value stocks is coming. In the universe of stocks I follow, very few have been completely left behind as the market has recovered. LendingClub (LC) is my highest conviction buy on the coming value rotation and it has been completely left behind. The stock currently sits near its all-time lows and has effectively sat out the recovery seen from the broader stock market. What excites me most is this is a value stock, that will return to being a growth stock, with a technology pedigree in the FinTech industry, that benefits from the digitization of banking that is leaping forward as a result of COVID-19. Effectively, there is something here for everyone in terms of why they should like LendingClub.There is a simple question that should be on your mind and that is on my mind. Why has LendingClub been left out of the recovery and what is going to change? If you can commit 10 minutes to reviewing the due diligence presented here I believe you will agree that the risk-reward, the opportunity to generate alpha, is massive with this opportunity.The reward could be a short-term doubling of the stock price on the back of an economic recovery and the long-term reward could be a multi-bag opportunity on the back of successfully executing on the purchase of Radius Bank.The risk is extremely limited. Trading at just over $5 a share with a market cap of $360M, and a book value of $750M, LendingClub is trading for less than .5x book value. When I say the risk is extremely limited you don't have to trust me you can trust the market. It was just recently announced that On Deck Capital (ONDK) would be acquired by Enova for $90M. As of its latest earnings report, On Deck had a book value of $219M and was thus acquired at .41x book value. On Deck was in very bad shape when it agreed to be acquired by Enova. You want to compare On Deck and LendingClub? There is no comparison. On Deck was a structurally failing model in the time of COVID-19 with its primary borrower being small businesses. The over 15-day delinquency rate at On Deck was 39.5% as of its latest earnings report. At LendingClub, over 95% of the borrowers were not on a hard-ship plan and paying on time during the same period when On Deck had a 39.5% delinquency rate. If you want to know your risk you can use the beaten down On Deck name as your likely worst-case scenario. And that would imply less than 20% downside to achieve the same valuation at which On Deck was purchased at in a lifesaving fire-sale.LendingClub is poised to re-rate significantly higher with multiple catalysts on the horizon. The likely continuing economic recovery, market awareness that consumer loans are performing better than expected, awareness that the company is actively lending to new customers again, and awareness that the company has recently increased its expected IRR for its portfolio of loans. This is the opportunity to buy the stock before the market rotates into value and then the herd stampedes into this name finding it is value and so much more.Preemptively Rebutting the Bear CaseThe bear case is simple. LendingClub will collapse during a recession. Borrowers won't pay their loans and LendingClub will be stuck holding the bag (and loans) while investors will not have an appetite to buy loans and generate fees for LendingClub.Unless you live in a cave you realize we are likely in, or maybe already in and out of, an actual recession. Loan performance at LendingClub has been incredibly strong. The company marked down the carrying value of its loans initially in the March/April time-frame with complete uncertainty during COVID-19. During the August Q2 2020 earnings call, the company noted that they were now selling those same loans at prices above where they were marked down. The loans are performing, and this hurts the Bear case.But the Bears are not weak, and so they throw more stuff at the wall in a futile effort to support their case even as it begins to wobble. They claim that the strong loan performance is:Again, the Bear argument doesn't take the time to look at the facts. The first public fact that most should know is that this is what a LendingClub borrower looks like:Source: Company Q2 2020 Earnings PresentationWhat the table above should tell you is that the LendingClub borrower is generally not getting government stimulus in the form of a one-time check. The borrower is also not as likely to have been employed in a service/hospitality industry most impacted by the COVID-19 job losses if they are making over $90K per year.But, if the Bear argument still believes this is all luck and government stimulus, then we can look to the data. The extra government stimulus in the form of additional unemployment benefits stopped paying out in July. We have access to a phenomenal data source from DV01. This company is a data analytics company with access to almost $20B of personal loan data. The latest report can be found at A Hub Between Lenders and Capital Markets | dv01 and is fascinating. This big data hub on personal loan performance is a large part of the reason you should own LendingClub and not listen to the Bear arguments. Some key points from the report are shown below:Source: DV01.co September 2020 updateWe have the fastest recession in US history, with a once in a generation Pandemic, and delinquency rates are below historical averages.While this seems impossible, the reality is the borrowers taking on personal loans generally have good incomes and low debt-to-income. They also have good credit as shown by the LendingClub profile of over a 700 credit score. These are typically 36-month loans. Put that all together, and this borrower is not going to wreck their good credit they have worked so hard to build. This is a real industry, with good borrowers, and it is performing better than anyone expected during a recession.I rest my recession case - the Bear should go into hibernation.Portfolio Performing Strongly and Lending Has ResumedEach quarter LendingClub typically provides an investor update, both for stock investors and those who invest in loans on its platforms. At the onset of the pandemic LendingClub provided an update that they would be severely curtailing the issuance of new loans and also raising the rates they charge to buyers given enhanced risk in lending. Rates were increased by 2 to 4% depending on the riskiness of the borrower.LendingClub has also provided guidance that it expects the loans most impacted by COVID-19, those not quite yet at the point of being paid off and those originated right before the pandemic, to generate a 3% IRR. For most of us, we don't get out of bed to earn a 3% IRR. But when the 3-year treasury is yielding .16% a 3% IRR in the pandemic is not that bad.What has not yet been reported, and is a big part of the story, is that LendingClub quietly made a material announcement on what they are targeting to generate as far as investor returns going forward. As recently as early August, the targeted return was 5.06% as seen in this company post on August 11th. Fast forward only 8 days to August 19th and the company provided another update on targeted returns. This time, they boosted the targeted returns by over 10% to 5.6%. Looking back over years of updates LendingClub has rarely adjusted their return outlook that quickly. Why the change? The answer is pretty simple. The borrowers are performing and the company is seeing the benefit of charging higher rates.In a world of no yield, remember the .16% yield on a 3-year treasury, a 5.6% return is extremely attractive. These are short duration loans. Would you rather lend your money on a 72-month car loan at 4%? How about a 30-year mortgage paying less than 3%? The security of those assets would be pointless in a major economic downturn. What is attractive to investors is the ability to earn a strong yield with a short maturity like you find with the personal loans offered at LendingClub.LendingClub purposely curtailed new loan issuance in the most recent quarter during the height of the pandemic as seen below:Source: Company Q2 2020 Earnings PresentationOriginations fell from a run-rate of over $3B per quarter in 2019 to ~$330M in Q2 2020. The company also noted on the last earnings call that most of its lending was focused on the over 3M members, or previous LendingClub customers. These customers are very valuable in the sense that they continue to use the service offered and the company has prior data on them giving greater insight on their ability and willingness to perform.Guidance given on the earnings call was for originations in Q3 to approach $500-600M. Five of the top Ten investors had returned to the platform and were lending money but the bulk of the loans in Q3 were again expected to go to prior borrowers or members.Alternative data that is not being discussed would lead us to believe that the company has seen a material acceleration in new loans issued during Q3. The data below is from PeerCube, a site that aggregates public data of loans listed on the LendingClub platform:Source: www.Peercube.comWhat we can see from the data above is that loans on the platform have steadily risen since a bottom in April. In fact, the loan volume on the platform in August 2020 reached levels seen as recently as Q4 2019 and Q1 2020 (pre-COVID-19). The data is directional as not all loans are made available and picked up in this data. A segment of loans is sold directly to 3rd party investors and would not appear here. The above graph is not meant to say loan issuance has returned to previous levels. But it does give a sense of the continued stair step higher in the recovery.Another data point comes from SEMRUSH which is a website analytics site that provides data on organic and paid website visits. LendingClub had previously noted that they had paused all paid advertising as a cost savings initiative given they did not want to lend to new borrowers in an uncertain time. On the last earnings call, they did not imply that they were ready to start lending to new borrowers. The data from SEMRUSH shows us that they are once again paying for digital advertising as seen below:Source: www.semrush.comThe blue line represents the level of digital advertising. You can see it drop to zero from April through July and then begin again in August. Nothing earth shattering, but again I believe this is a quicker recovery than the market is expecting as you don't advertise to bring in new customers if you are not prepared to lend to them. Lending to new customers would validate the recovery and the return to normalcy for LendingClub. The image below shows a Google search for ""personal loan"" done on 9/11/20. Again we can see that LendingClub shows up as the top paid advertisement for this search term.Source: www.google.comIn summation, the portfolio is performing strong enough to both raise expectations for investors (higher projected returns) and to begin marketing again for new borrowers. This is flying completely under the radar and should have a very positive impact when the market figures it out or the company explains it on their next earnings call.The Inflection Point: Acquiring Radius BankEarlier this year LendingClub announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire Radius Bank. Radius is a 100% digital bank that was voted best online bank by Bankrate in 2020. The acquisition price is $185M (75% cash and 25% stock).The acquisition is a game changer. If you want to read a fascinatingly detailed article on why it is a game changer I suggest you read this one. From an investment point of view, LendingClub acquires an asset base (over $1B in deposits) and the ability to make significantly more money. This will come in multiple ways:Source: Company PresentationRadius represents an $80M pre-tax opportunity for LendingClub with about $40M of that being realized almost immediately after the acquisition is closed. In addition, there are certainly other synergies from development costs and people costs that the company will benefit from as well.What the market seems to be forgetting is that LendingClub achieved GAAP profitability for the first time in Q4 2019. For what is effectively still a start-up company in a burgeoning industry the GAAP profitability milestone was a big deal. In FY 2019 they also generated almost $800M of revenue (~10% growth YoY) and adjusted EBITDA of over $130M. LendingClub was in a strong position prior to COVID-19. LendingClub had been growing its total loan issuance at an astounding clip with a focus on growth over profits as seen in the graphic below:Source: Company WebsiteTotal loan issuance had grown from less than $5B in 2013 to almost $60B by June of 2020. Achieving GAAP profitability while also scaling the business was an impressive feat.Company management noted on the last earnings call that their most important task right now was ensuring they make decisions that will allow them to gain regulatory approval to complete the Radius transaction. To that end, they are not using LendingClub cash to warehouse any new loans on their balance sheet. In fact, in an environment where most companies were burning cash at an alarming rate LendingClub saw an increase in net liquidity QoQ during the worst time of the pandemic:With over $550M of liquidity LendingClub is in great shape to acquire Radius and capitalize the bank.A final point with regards to the business model is that LendingClub also has a significant recurring revenue stream from its servicing portfolio. When a 3rd party investor funds a loan on the LendingClub platform, LendingClub issues the loan and collects the payments in return for a servicing fee. Prior to COVID-19, the servicing portfolio had reached almost $16B as seen below:This recurring revenue stream had, and will have again in the future, the potential to generate almost $200M in recurring revenue for the company on an annual basis. In a world where recurring revenue is valued at a premium the market is giving no value whatever to this valuable revenue stream.The Final Take-AwayLendingClub is undervalued. It is very hard to argue that fact when you use the On Deck example previously given. On the flip side, there are countless examples of significant valuation in the space.Upgrade is effectively no different than LendingClub, except they have significantly less members and make significantly less money. What they do have is the founder of LendingClub as their CEO (who resigned from LendingClub for violating company policies). The Upgrade CEO is one of the founders of the entire FinTech personal loan industry and it would seem his pedigree alone has given Upgrade a $1B valuation.You then have Credit Karma which was purchased by Intuit for $7.1B. Credit Karma had 37M active members at the time they were acquired. Intuit paid $191 per active member. LendingClub has over 3M members. If you applied that same valuation to LendingClub the company would be worth almost $575M (60% more than the company is valued by the market today). I also have a high degree of confidence that a LendingClub member and the revenue generated from their loan is worth significantly more than a Credit Karma member who is just shopping for credit scores and loan information. LendingClub has issued almost $60B in loans since inception and the data it has on valuable borrowers is worth a lot of money.Next you have Affirm. Affirm is a FinTech company that lends at the point of sale. You want to buy that fancy gadget, Affirm might have partnered with the retailer to loan you the money for the transaction. The addressable market is obviously huge and so is the rumored IPO valuation of over $10B. The Affirm IPO will also likely rekindle the flame for FinTech in general.With all that being said, the market clearly has no problem valuing FinTech companies that it perceives to be winners. I truly believe the Radius acquisition will make LendingClub one of those winners. While the acquisition is scheduled to be completed in early 2021, I am not waiting for the run. I have purchased shares at just over $5 and I believe I am sitting on a powder keg that is ready to explode higher. LendingClub will participate in a sector rotation to value and into banks. The company traded at a price to book value over 1x Pre-COVID-19 just after announcing the Radius acquisition.Data by YChartsI expect to see LendingClub stock to potentially double and trade back up towards 1x book value over the next 6 months as the market realizes this is not a broken story. Longer term, the Radius acquisition alone is potentially worth $80M of EBITDA on an annual basis. Combine that with the $130M of adjusted EBITDA LendingClub generated in 2019 and you get the formula for much more than a doubling of the stock price.There is plenty of good news out there if you find it and hopefully you can use the information here to find Alpha before Mr. Market does."
4312604,22148,2019-12-15T19:29:07-05:00,"LendingClub trades near the yearly lows despite generating substantial EBITDA improvements.
        The company has moved 48% of the direct and indirect workforce outside of San Francisco to substantially reduce costs.
        The stock trades at ~3x EV/EBITDA estimates for 2019.","LendingClub (LC) still fails to get any respect from the stock market. The company grew adjusted EBITDA by over 40% in the last quarter and the market just yawned. My investment thesis remains very bullish despite the stock not moving on very positive numbers questioning what catalyst will ever move the stock higher. My biggest frustration with the fintech is that the leadership isn't very dynamic. The company hasn't driven the platform to its ultimate potential and visibility in the marketplace. While not fully satisfied with the 10%+ revenue growth rate of the online lending platform, the management team has made some very wise decisions regarding costs. As investors look at these key metrics from Q3, one can see the impressive improvements of EBITDA growring 43% YoY to $40.0 million on only 11% revenue growth. In addition, LendingClub improved the bottom line by an incredible $15.3 million. Nearly all of the additional $20.3 million in revenues fell to the bottom line while the company has hidden income. Source: LendingClub Q3'19 earnings releaseThe prime reason is that the company made the smart decision to move operations outside of the very expensive San Francisco area to Salt Lake City. At the end of Q3, LendingClub has 528 full time equivalent employees in Salt Lake City or 48% of the workforce outside of San Francisco. A big part of this amount is 19% of the workforce outsourced to lower unit costs and make costs match with variable loan processing totals. For Q3, total operating expenses were only $205.1 million versus $197.7 million last Q3. These expenses included about $8 million to $9 million in legal, regulatory and impairment costs each year normally excluded by firms when calculating adjusted net income. The important point was the ability of the fintech to generate $20 million in additional revenues while limiting expense growth to about half of the revenue growth. No guarantee exists that the market will ever realize the extreme valuation here, but the company has $736 million in cash. The stock only has a market valuation of $1.1 billion now with the stock stuck below $15 for months. The enterprise value isn't even $400 million now. Investors can squabble about the fintech having $710 million in loans held for sale on the balance sheet. These amounts are held for a short period in order to contribute to various loan programs sold to investors outside of direct investing in individual loans. The financial asset balance is up nearly $50 million from the lows in the March quarter. Source: LendingClub Q3'19 earnings releaseThe worse case scenario is LendingClub getting stuck with these loans and taking a 10% or even 20% hit. Investors are free to use a $150 million discount to cash balances for this reason, but either way it's not a reason to completely ignore the financial assets of the fintech. The stock only trades at about 3x EV/EBITDA forecasts for the year of $130 million to $135 million. In addition, LendingClub had about $18.1 million in quarterly stock-based compensation expense that if excluded from the net income calculation would place adjusted net income closer to $26.9 million or $0.31 per share.For the year, the company expects roughly breakeven net income, but the SBC estimates would add $76 million to the total. With diluted shares outstanding at 87.6 million, LendingClub would approach a roughly $1 per share estimate with a true adjusted net income per share total. The key investor takeaway is that investors will rarely find another stock with 10% revenue growth trading with an EV of only 3x current year EBITDA estimates. Growth in 2020 only adds to the cheap value of LendingClub.The market appears united that the fintech will see operations take a hit in the next recession, but at this point the stock would rally once this risk is removed from the equation. LendingClub remains far too cheap as the market has completely missed the improvements in EBITDA and net income measurements leading to the increased financial asset balance."
4343649,75025,2020-05-06T13:25:58-04:00,"LC posted a disappointing Q1 with low loan origination volume.
        The company saw the value of its loans sink and its financial assets dwindle.
        Still, LC gave away $50m to one shareholder.
        The company forecasts a 90% drop in originations for Q2.","On Tuesday, LendingClub (LC) published its results for Q1. These were clearly below expectations, but there are still four remarkable things that I learned this quarter that I think are important to any investor involved with LC.In case readers want to learn more about LC's business model, I would like to refer them to my first LC article. Since that article, I have become quite bearish due to my conviction that LC will not do well in this economic environment. The latest earnings and four points discussed in this article solidified this conviction. My fresh price target for LC is $5.Fair value adjustments is the line item in the income statement that captures the losses borne by LC on loans it sells to investors. Of course, the worse the credit environment (risk appetite by investors), the higher the (negative) adjustments will be.Source: LC Q1 2020 earnings release. Emphasis added by author. Last quarter’s FV adjustments were particularly bad at $102m. This compares to $43m in Q4 of 2019. The company doesn’t tell us how and when exactly these losses were realized, but it is reasonable to assume that the excess of about $60m over 4Q19 is attributable to the last weeks of the quarter. One can only imagine what will happen going forward.The company's collection of loans, ABS securities, and (restricted) cash is often referred to by LC bulls as cash. It isn’t cash, but operating assets in my opinion, just like loans on the balance sheets of banks are operating assets. Nevertheless, it is relatively liquid and is somewhat of a proxy for the net tangible assets of the company and therefore a useful metric. LC has provided a fair overview of it for the past eight quarters and clearly 1Q20 shows a severe hit.Source: Q1 presentation.As you can see in the figure above, the development over the 7 quarters prior to the last one has been slow. An investor paying attention to LC’s income statement might say that rising financial assets mark quite an achievement because LC has posted negative earnings over that period. However, the company issues roughly $18m quarterly in stocks to fund its stock-based compensation expense. These issuances add to the net financial assets of LC because they conserve cash. If LC would’ve made no losses, it would logically be able to build its net financial assets up to $805m by 1Q20 ($678m + 7x $18.25m), yet it was at $602m. Over half of the difference was caused by the terrible Q1 of this year, the remainder by prior operating losses.Over 15% of LC’s financial assets evaporated during Q1 and this $112m is equivalent to 19% of LC’s $600m market cap (89m shares x $6.69). If this was caused by a bad month of March, one can only imagine what will happen in Q2. An ameliorating factor is perhaps that $50m of the decline in Q1 was caused by a special dividend.Shareholders who read the last paragraph above may think: ‘a special dividend? Great news, maybe I missed it’. Don’t bother checking your account as the $50 million went to only one shareholder. LC’s largest shareholder, struck a deal with LC to exchange its shares for fully convertible preferred stock and got $50m for it. To be fair, this deal isn’t really news as it was already flagged in an 8-K filing. The table below summarizes the transaction quite well and it was included in the Q1 earnings release.Source: LC Q1 2020 release.If you think about it, a $50m dividend is disproportionate, considering the number of shares involved. Effectively, the shareholder gets $2.56 for each of its 19,562,881 shares and the only thing it has to forfeit is its voting rights as long as it retains its stake.The share is at $6.69 at close before Q1 earnings. While most shareholders have been taking a severe beating, the favored one was able to receive a dividend equal to 38% of the value of its shares. The shares were somewhat more expensive when the deal was struck, but this does not change the fact that each incremental dollar retained by the company is perhaps more important now than it was two months ago because harsh times are ahead.As you may be aware, I’m a little bit pissed-off by this transaction despite the fact that I'm not a shareholder. This transaction shows -in my opinion- extremely poor judgement by management. I believe that they would have refrained from this transaction if governance was at the top of their the priority list.The transaction was supposed to clear the way for regulatory approval of the acquisition of Radius Bank. A fun fact is that 51% of this bank's loan book involves yachts or commercial real estate. It will also be an expensive deal and though LC has not expressed intention of dropping the deal, I don’t really see them spending the $139m in cash and $46m worth of shares on a bank that may be in an as questionable shape as LC itself in about a year from now. So I can see why LC may want to get out of the deal, which makes the $50m an even bigger waste. LC can certainly get out of that acquisition as the termination fee is just $5m (see p. 71, Termination). But for now it looks like LC is in the 'wait and see' mode as this transaction was an important part of its strategy. For the second quarter, the company forecasts loan originations to drop by 90%. This is a mind-blowing figure to anyone, I think. On March 20, my forecast range for Q2 was -50 to -90%, as expressed in my article at the time.On the Q1 earnings call, management said that the 90% forecasted drop was caused by both low investor funding and LC's tightened credit standards. They could originate a lot more if they dropped credit standards. However, they did not tell if that also involved taking steeper fair value adjustments.The company also said that it can cut $70m compared to the expense base of Q4 2019. Coincidentally, I forecasted $73m in the -75% scenario in my last article. Below shows my updated Q2 operating profit estimate in which I incorporated the new information, but kept operating expense estimates the same.Source: author’s own estimates.I assume the FV adjustment shock was a one-off because the worsening credit environment came as a surprise to the company. It has had time to adequately adapt its borrower risk profile and interest rates. For Q2 I forecast zero interest income as I expect that to be fully absorbed by credit losses. As a bear, I feel very comfortable with this $68m Q2 loss estimate. There is plenty of downside left as the company owns a loan & ABS portfolio of $1bn on which is can suffer steep unanticipated credit losses.Bulls often point towards the cash position of LC to justify a high valuation. Or as a fellow contributor aptly put it 5 days after I published my previous LC article:Source: comment section of my previous LC article. I removed the avatar and name of the user from the snapshot.For the record, the stock returned -23.28%, while the S&P was up 24.45% since publication. Nevertheless, the commenter has a point. Financial assets or perhaps tangible equity are probably the best tools to value LC.Equity on LC's balance sheet is around $800m, of which at least $100m intangibles ($90m loan servicing assets in Q4 plus $13.7m net intangible assets). So tangible equity is below $700m. The next problem is that the $115m of property plant and equipment on LC’s balance sheet has a questionable value as it has never produced an (annual) profit for the company. PP&E is the infrastructure of the business and I think its resale value is close to zero. If the platform was able to generate a positive income over time, I would have a different opinion about this. So perhaps it is reasonable to just look at net financial assets. We can take the company’s $600m here.The market cap is $600m and this seems to add up with the value of net financial assets. In a normal market, given that the company’s platform doesn’t generate earnings, this would be a fair value for the company. However, I believe that the company will lose more money in the remainder of 2020 and I think that $100m would be a very conservative estimate in that regard. Personally, I also think that the company should trade at a discount to its net financial asset value, just like many banks do right now. At least most banks are profitable in 9 out of 10 years. The same cannot be said about LendingClub, which has never turned an annual profit.A 25% discount on the $600m leaves us with $450m if we ignore the remaining losses of 2020. Divided by 90 million shares outstanding, that is $5 per share.This quarter has uncovered plenty of shaky elements in LC’s business model. Fair value adjustments shoot up, financial assets are leaking from the company, not all shareholders are treated equally, and the worst part is that the future looks worse than the terrible Q1. In my opinion, the shares are worth $5 a piece and I would not advise anyone to buy them at their current market price."
4333316,75025,2020-03-20T14:12:22-04:00,LC has been doing better over the past years thanks to a sanguine economic environment.I fully expect funding of LC’s loans to dry up as investors have other places to spend their risk budget and banks will focus on their own volumes.LC already announced that it is scaling back approval rates for riskier clients.I forecast steep losses for Q2 if the credit environment does not improve soon.,"Just six weeks ago, I wrote an article about LendingClub (LC) in which I argued that the stock had its issues but was fairly valued. A lot has changed since that time - to say the least. The coronavirus has swept the world and is about to push the US into a recession.The new environment also affects my opinion about LendingClub, which oddly has outperformed the S&P 500 by 8% since my last article. That completely counters logic, as LC’s Q4 was sub-par and current financial conditions will hurt its business badly.LendingClub essentially provides loans to consumers and then sells these loans to investors. LC has two customer types: its users (borrowers) who request loans and investors who fund the loans. LC typically charges a borrower a 5% origination fee over the value of the loan, paid from the initial loan balance, and that is its main source of revenue.LC also takes loans on its balance sheet before they are sold and it retains loans as well. The business model looks like that of a bank that relies on securitization to fund its originations.The loans that LC provides often carry double-digit interest rates and have average charge-off rates of 7% (Standard Program loans in Q4 2019). Maturities of personal loans provided by LC are either three years or five years.The company announced the acquisition of a small bank (company slides). It is anticipated it can take another 12 to 15 months to close the $185m deal, which will be paid for by 75% in cash and 25% shares. I think that it was a good step at the time. LC has so many elements of a bank already and it would eliminate the need for a third party bank to handle the actual loan issuance, which LC technically may not do itself. It is to be seen how the target, Radius Bancorp, will perform over the next months and what will happen to the merger. An interesting fact is that a combined 51% of that bank’s loans (~$550m) are for yachts or commercial real estate.While the merger is pending, we can spend time on analysing the Q4. A big disappointment was that LC originated less loans in Q4 2019 than it did in the prior quarter. This is not part of a particular seasonal pattern, and therefore a clear negative. The company performed almost in-line with its own guidance but revenue was a disappointment, driven by modest origination volume.Source: LC Q4 2019 earnings presentation. I cut out the adjusted figures for your convenience.In my last article, I included a table that hammered down the investment case to its essence: profitability of the loan platform. The updated version is shown below. As it seems, lower origination volumes have hurt platform profitability. Instead of getting closer to a quarter in which the company makes money on the core platform, it drifted further away from that goal in Q4.Source: author’s own calculations.Feel free to reconcile these figures above with the raw data shown below. The item 'other revenue' is the most important reason why Q4 showed a GAAP profit. This consists of referral revenue and also of sublease revenue of its San Francisco office space.Source: LC 2019 10-K.Overall, the company performed reasonably well on managing expenses, especially marketing, which was 2.18% of originations versus 2.31% average in 2019. The combination of lower revenue and relatively lower marketing expenses reveals to me that LC had a harder time finding lenders than it did finding borrowers.Most investors are not retail lenders, but institutions, especially banks. Over the past two quarters, banks have already reduced their business with LC and Q4 was a particularly disappointing quarter for origination volume.Data source: company releases.Worse is that financial conditions are tightening right now. Many bank stocks have slid over the past weeks, which is a symptom of worse financial conditions for banks. In recessionary times, banks are most vigilant about their liquidity, loan quality and capital position. Risky personal loans from third parties probably ranks last on the list on which banks want to spend their available capital and liquidity. I suspect that the banks that buy LC loans will have more than enough loan applications themselves.Or as the WSJ nicely phrases it in a March 19 article: Consumers face a massive credit crunch. Another article by the same paper points out that investors seek liquidity. I agree, as the stock market rout is not just a reflection of estimated future earnings, but also of discount rates and risk aversion. There are many investors that hold stocks that need liquidity for risk management or cash flow reasons. They are selling their shares to investors that have cash and lower stock prices are a tool to get the investors with cash to hand it over to the investors who hold shares.A further vicious cycle is that many of LC’s customers have a less than prime credit rating and it will be harder for that group to refinance loans that they already have. For that reason alone, I expect defaults to increase and I don’t see why any investor would want to expose capital to such a market that is capital-constrained.Let's put the turn as I describe into perspective versus the past. Over the past years, modest interest rates and a lack of risk aversion have created an environment in which FinTechs captured a lot of market share in the personal loan market.Source: TransUnion Consumer Credit Database, source file.I fully expect credit unions, banks and traditional finance companies to retake market share from FinTechs as the market turns because the traditional lenders have proprietary funding sources and full control over the credit profile of their customers. The charge-off rates of LC are at the high side and I don’t think that any lender on its platform really wants to know what happens to the 7% charge-off rate if the economy deteriorates quickly as it does right now.Last week, LC released an 8-K report, saying that it tightened credit conditions for borrowers. This is what they say:The company says it wants to enhance the resiliency of its portfolio and has taken three important steps.Firstly, LC will be reducing approval rates for higher-risk borrower populations. LC specifically mentions credit grade C & D, which were responsible for 37% of loan originations in 2019 under the Standard Program. The company did not mention the Custom Program specifically but that program mostly services borrowers that have a lower credit score than those in the Standard Program.The second step is increasing verification requirements. This includes verification of income. Previously, a small percentage of loan applicants were checked. In my last article, I took a sample of loan data and found that 6.8% of incomes were checked. LC doesn’t usually check income data because it is costly and may deter customers. Clearly, it thinks that it is necessary now and seems less worried about scaring off potential borrowers.Third, the company is adjusting marketing channels. This is explained as adjusting marketing mix to focus on channels where they have most flexibility to control volume and credit quality. In other words: LC is reducing the marketing budget in response to anticipated lower investor demand while also adjusting credit mix as low credit borrowers will be least in demand of all.Other than that, LC mainly touted its crisis readiness, and tried to convey that they are highly flexible and closely watching the macroeconomic environment.Regarding flexibility, there is a thing we should worry about. Many loans that LC sells to investors are first held on its balance sheet. These loans, when sold to large investors from LC’s balance sheet, are then oftentimes sold at a discount to fair value, hence the ‘Net fair value adjustment’ line item in LC’s financial statements. In Q4, net fair value adjustments were 1.38% of total origination volume. A risk is that when financial conditions tighten, either discounts go up, or LC is stuck with more loans.The company seems to take the current macroeconomic environment very seriously and is scaling back loan applications.I think that a 50% to 90% initial drop in originations is not unrealistic. To get an idea of what the impact may be, I created the table below that shows Q4 actuals versus Q2 2020 estimates under two scenarios: -50% originations and -75% originations.Source: author’s own estimates.On the revenue side, I expect transaction fees as a percentage of originations to remain the same, which still means a big revenue hit. Investor fees are earned from loans sold in the past, so that item should remain relatively stable.On the operating expenses side, sales and marketing will go down sharply as I expect the company will have less trouble finding customers. The only reason why I did not take it to zero in the -75% origination scenario is because it also includes sales and staff costs. I think that the company can also cut back on that, but my $12m estimate seems very low for the scenario already.As a sidestep, it may be interesting to consider what this dynamic will do to LendingTree (TREE), of which personal loan platforms like LC are an important customer group. LC purchases leads from TREE at relatively good margins to TREE and personal loans have been an area of growth over the past years for TREE. LendingTree's revenue of personal loans will probably be hurt worse than that of LendingClub.The cost of originations will likely go down as well when originations plummet. The costs for servicing will go up because servicing on existing loans will become more expensive due to collection expenses. Checking incomes on the origination side is also costly and this should be factored in as a mitigating factor on origination cost savings. Though in absolute terms, origination and servicing costs may decline, they will go up as a percentage of originations. Furthermore, I expect that the company can cut back on IT and other general and administrative expenses, though we have seen that these expenses have remained remarkably stable over the past 8 quarters.I also expect a credit hit to its roughly $1bn portfolio of loans and retained asset-backed securities that could well run over a few percentage points. For that reason, I eliminated net interest income completely. This is probably not conservative enough, but it also depends on whether or not LC can sell its current loans at reasonable valuations in Q1.If my dark scenario plays out, LC could face pre-tax losses of well over $60m in Q2, even when assuming it can sharply cut on expenses. A big problem is that LC has never shown substantial GAAP profits, despite the fact that it has been profiting greatly from the favorable economic environment of the past years. The market cap of LC was $840m as of March 19 and every quarter of negative $60m earnings will obviously hurt badly. It is also not said and done that if the coronavirus is gone by the end of the year, everything will instantly return to normal. It seems reasonable to think that credit conditions will remain tighter than they have been in 2019 for the foreseeable future.The scenario above is at odds with the 2020 outlook and guidance that the company issued with its Q4 earnings announcement. The guidance for Q1 will probably not be off by that much, but the improvement expected in the rest of the year seems very unlikely in my view.Source: LC Q4 2019 presentation.It remains to be seen what the company will do with its guidance, but I can’t imagine it will remain the same, given that the company is already scaling back approval rates. The Q1 earnings announcement is coming close, which could serve as a downward catalyst as the company will have to announce its new guidance for 2020.LC has been riding the high tide over the past years, but that has come to a hard stop last week. Even though I think that LC will be hit harder than most companies in this environment and also despite the fact that it had a disappointing Q4, the stock has outperformed the S&P 500 since my rather nuanced article about it. I think that this is a great opportunity to either sell LendingClub, or perhaps to take a short position. The time has never been as good as it is now at the brink of what may well be its worst Q2 ever."
4286926,104952,2019-08-20T16:24:53-04:00,"LendingClub is at an inflection point. Its recent progress shows that it has been on the right track to achieve profitability in Q3 for the first time in 13 years.LendingClub is still the leader in the US P2P lending space. In 2018, it generated just under 50% of all $138 billion personal loan volume.LendingClub's strategy shift towards bringing in more institutional lenders in turn brings greater concern about the viability of the P2P consumer lending model in general.","LendingClub (LC) has just had an overall good Q2. Despite guiding to lower overall EPS for the rest of the FY 2019 and having missed out on its revenue guidance by $1.24 million, LC has shown that it has been on the right track to achieve profitability in Q3.(Source: Seeking Alpha. LC’s EPS Surprise & Estimates by Quarter)In the last few consecutive quarters all the way until Q2, LendingClub has consistently beaten EPS estimation by a reasonable margin. Taking what we have learned from its recent quarterly performances and its commitment on more responsible revenue growth and profitability for FY 2019 last year, we think that LendingClub presents an interesting opportunity for investors to get strong exposure to the technology-driven lending market before it potentially reaches profitability sometime in Q3. At this time, we believe that LendingClub might be at an inflection point where the upcoming questions arising in the next few quarters might not be about addressing when or how it should be profitable but more about whether it could maintain its profitability going forward. That being said, the main disclaimer here is that LendingClub’s core P2P consumer lending business is not what has been driving the profitability of its platform.As of Q2, the overall improvements made by LendingClub in its operations on both cost and revenue sides have brought in a 2.9% PPS increase in its EBITDA margin, which has expanded to 17.4%. Comparing LendingClub’s numbers for Q2 2019 vs. the same time last year, it appears that one of the primary drivers for its profitability has been its strong execution ability to reduce and maintain its expenses. In its effort in driving down the cost for Loan Servicing and Origination, LendingClub has moved some of its operations to a Utah-based BPO (Business Process Outsourcing).(Source: LendingClub’s 10-Q)As its revenue increased by almost 8% YoY in Q2 2019, LendingClub has been able to reduce its origination and servicing expenses by approximately 2.8% YoY. Over the last year, the company has also seemed to maintain its sales and marketing expense at a quite exceptional level, where overall it has increased by only 0.4%, which we think is negligible for a company at LendingClub’s scale. To venture investors like us, such achievement is what we typically expect from a technology company that is reaching strong economies of scale. This execution ability somehow gives us a conviction that the company could deliver on its promise to achieve profitability starting in Q3 2019.On the revenue generation side of the drivers, we think that overall increases in both loan origination volume and transaction fees have played important roles.(Source: LendingClub Q2 2019 Earning Call Slides.)In Q2 2019, we have seen that LendingClub has been able to increase its loan origination volume by 12% YoY while at the same time increasing its transaction fees take rate off the loan principal amounts by 0.1 PPS to 4.9%. Such an increase has shown two things. First, it shows that the company has been able to generate higher demands towards the loan inventories in its marketplace from the lenders' side, especially from institutional investors such as banks. Second, it also shows that it has been able to gradually charge closer to its upper-range guidance of transaction fees which ranges from 0% to 6%.Some interesting ideas have been ongoing in LendingClub’s platform in recent times. As the company looks to target more institutional investors from the demand side, we are gradually seeing products more relevant to such segments, such as higher premium loans and tradable structured products. Its CLUB certificate products, for instance, have generated over $2 billion of transaction volume. Furthermore, we believe that the company’s offering of newer products such as auto refinancing and patient solutions will also increase higher interests from these institutional investors looking for upcoming structured products outside ones based off unsecured personal loans.(source: LendingClub’s website. Total Loan Issuance)With over $50 billion of loans having been originated through LendingClub’s platform, we feel that LendingClub provides one of the most interesting ways for investors to tap into the overall modern US lending market. With a record of over $138 billion of personal loans disbursed in 2018, LendingClub’s number shows that it approximately has originated almost half of all US personal loans last year alone. From that perspective, it has been proven that LendingClub has stayed true to its premise as a two-sided marketplace platform that could reduce cost through better technology.On the other hand, however, given the fact that LendingClub’s loan volume today has been dominated by mostly institutional investors, we think that there is still a big question on whether the actual P2P (peer-to-peer) consumer lending is a viable business model in and even outside the US. We think this is an important question given the lack of personal credit scoring system like the one based on FICO score outside the US will potentially limit LendingClub’s upside once it thinks of a geographical expansion strategy organically or through acquisition. As it stands, we have seen how the P2P consumer lending model has not worked too well in other huge markets such as China. Following a massive regulatory crackdown in China, half of the P2P lending players have disappeared as of 2018, which resulted in the P2P consumer lending market shrinking by 85%. There was also an overall scale-down from its biggest player, Lufax, in its P2P consumer lending business segment.In Q2 2019 alone, we have seen that LendingClub has somehow shifted away to serving more institutional investors as it generated from self-directed investors only $155 million loan amount or effectively lower than 5% off total loans generated in its platform. That figure has also been its lowest amount in terms of loan generated YoY.At 1.62 TTM P/S and a market cap of $1.2 billion, we think that LendingClub, at the circumstance it is in today, could be attractively priced for investors. Comparing LendingClub to On Deck (ONDK), which trades at 1.06 TTM P/S and is an online platform for SME financing, we saw that there is a higher growth expectation for LendingClub, though it is almost 6 times larger than On Deck in terms of size. Historically, over the last 3 years, LendingClub has also grown its top-line revenue faster at 12.77% CAGR, compared to On Deck’s 10.13%.(Source: Seeking Alpha. Moving averages of LendingClub’s price action)In addition to our underlying thesis that LendingClub’s profitability outlook should increase its EPS and therefore overall stock price starting in Q3, we have also noticed that it is trading at approximately 5% to 13% below its entire moving average metrics. At $13.75 per share today, this could be a good entry point as well for investors considering the opportunity.We assess that LendingClub has proven to be the market leader in two-sided US technology-driven lending marketplace sector, which presents investors interesting opportunities to get exposure to unsecured personal loan market which is poised to grow at approximately 20% YoY.Additionally, its recent progress towards expected bottom-line profitability in Q3 should create a strong conviction for investors that LendingClub is currently at an inflection point today. We also believe that its two-sided lending platform works and is something that has created noticeable demands from institutional investors due to reduced costs. On a side note, however, looking at overall macro-dynamics of the P2P consumer lending market globally, there is a question whether its initial core P2P consumer lending model could even be viable as the profitability driver in addition to its currently profitable two-sided institutional-driven lending model."
4312049,105040,2019-12-11T23:53:53-05:00,"LendingClub's price has remained depressed even as fundamentals have improved.Management has raised guidance multiple times and plans to break even in 2019.Operating leverage is likely to continue and should help grow earnings substantially over the next few years.Management also has plans to boost growth without substantially increasing costs.Valuation is low, and much of the market cap is cash.","It has been a while since we last covered LendingClub (LC). Since our last article was published, the stock has corrected somewhat (our timing was pretty horrible). The company has reported two more quarters of results, and it has conducted a reverse stock split, bringing the stock price above $10. While two quarters have passed, our conviction in the bull case remains strong, and we think LC will do well over the long term.(Source: Google Images)We had always thought that LC's new management is top-notch, and the two previous quarters confirm our thoughts. All targets have been met, and adjusted EBITDA results frequently exceed or hit the top range of guidance.(Source: Q3 2019 presentation)There really isn't much to say - KPIs like loan origination volume continue to break fresh records, and while revenue growth has been quite slow, profitability has improved drastically, with LC guiding for breakeven in 2019 as management continues to focus on growing the bottom line.Instead of looking too much at the most recent quarter, we'll take a more longer-term view of LC. We think the long-term bull case around LC revolves around operating leverage driving growth in both adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income.Adjusted EBITDA has grown far faster than revenue in the last few quarters, as the company saw far slower expense growth compared to revenue growth. This has driven adjusted EBITDA margins to nearly 20% compared to 15% a year ago, and management continues to expect further growth, guiding for adjusted EBITDA margins to hit 25% by the end of 2021. Considering its past track record, we're confident that management can hit this target.While adjusted EBITDA has grown at double digits, SBC and D&A have remained quite stable and actually declined YOY in the most recent quarter. This has contributed to strong improvements in adjusted net income growth.Doing the math, we estimate adjusted EBITDA CAGR for the next two years will be around 25-30% and adjusted net income will grow much faster, from breakeven this year to around $70-80 million in 2-3 years.Even though management has been focused on improving profitability, it hasn't completely neglected growth. The number of loan applications and the conversion time has improved substantially over the past few quarters, much faster than overall revenue growth.Management continues to believe there is an opportunity to expand horizontally to leverage the company's data on consumers to help out each debt-laden consumer more. It has created a club which currently has 3 million members and 500k MAUs, up 30% YOY.This is an initiative we are really watching closely, as it has the potential to massively increase revenues with minimal costs given it just offers incremental services to existing customers. Management seems very optimistic, expecting to double LC's auto origination volume next year, and we look forward to seeing how this will evolve through the next few quarters.We should also mention that the company plans to get a bank charter, which management believes will help both the top and bottom line significantly through attracting more customers, further vertical integration and providing funding. This is another interesting initiative that should be assessed over the next couple of quarters.LC is quite cheap for a company showing strong operating leverage and growing adjusted EBITDA at 30-40% rates. It currently trades at an EV/adjusted EBITDA of just 4.7x due to its large cash balance. Admittedly, many similar companies like OnDeck (ONDK) and GreenSky (GSKY) are similarly cheap, trading near single-digit P/E multiples, so the pessimism seems to be industry-wide. We're not sure what's causing this pessimism, but we think the long-term fundamentals of the fintech industry are sound and that multiples should recover in the long run.While we do like LC a lot, there are a few factors keeping us from buying. Firstly, there has been insider selling at prices not much higher than current prices, and there hasn't been much insider buying. We do think LC is cheap, but it is quite odd how insiders aren't buying the stock, especially since the company is near all-time lows. Secondly, we are very hesitant about buying LC at what we think is the top of an economic cycle. There are many indicators that the economy is faltering, and we don't want to be long a company so exposed to consumer credit when the collapse inevitably happens.Because of these factors, and because we see so many much more attractive opportunities, we haven't gone long LC, though we continue to have it on our watchlist.LC is just another forgotten growth story tucked away at the edges of the market. Despite the fundamental improvements in the company's business model and the excellent execution of management, the stock price has moved sideways for 3.5 years now. While we are skeptical about stock price performance in the short to medium term due to macro factors, we are very confident that LC should perform well in the long run."
4340674,103480,2020-04-28T15:48:21-04:00,"LendingClub's ability to originate new loans will be constricted by waning investor demand for risk in 2020.Bank earnings have foreshadowed deep losses in unsecured consumer debt.Even before the coronavirus hit, LendingClub was seeing originations volumes decelerate. Q4 originations were up only 7% y/y, vs. 16% y/y in Q3.The expectations of higher defaults will sap institutional investor demand that funds LendingClub's originations, while also threatening LendingClub's own balance sheet.","LendingClub (LC) is in a tight spot at the moment. The coronavirus has forced an unprecedented global shutdown that many businesses have called the worst crisis they've ever faced - and even as some states look to re-open parts of the economy over the coming weeks and months, the economic damage from the past few months will reverberate throughout the economy for many more quarters.Shutdowns and layoffs affect lower and middle-income consumers the most - which is exactly the type of customer profile that signs up for LendingClub's loans. Already, newspaper headlines have reported consumers skipping or negotiating credit card payments, as well as missing other critical payments like rent. Though we haven't yet seen the underlying performance of LendingClub's credit portfolio, we can directionally say for certain that these loans are going to nosedive.Accordingly, shares of LendingClub have shed more than 45% since the start of the year:Data by YChartsNow trading near 52-week lows, losses in LendingClub accelerated over the past several weeks as investors digested disappointing bank earnings. Among the biggest themes from banks this quarter is that they've been building up massive reserves for credit losses, especially in consumer credit cards. For example, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the nation's largest bank by deposits, allocated $3.8 billion in credit card loss reserves in Q1, out of $4.4 billion for the consumer division as a whole (spanning auto and mortgage loans) and just $6.8 billion for the entire bank, including corporate clients. The main message here: the deepest credit losses will be borne in the unsecured consumer debt space, which is LendingClub's entire book of loans.The risk to LendingClub is twofold. First, investors' lowered risk appetite for consumer debt will stifle LendingClub's originations, directly impacting LendingCLub's already-weak revenue growth rates. Second, the loans that LendingClub holds on its own balance sheet and doesn't securitize out to third-party investors now poses substantial credit risks.In short, resist the temptation to catch a falling knife in LendingClub. The market still doesn't have a grasp on the scale of the pending consumer debt crunch, and LendingClub is directly exposed.Unfortunately for LendingClub, origination volumes were already weak to begin with, even before the coronavirus hit the U.S.Figure 1. LendingClub origination volume trendsSource: LendingClub Q4 earnings deckAs seen in the chart above, the pace of Q4 originations slowed down to just 7% y/y growth, decelerating nine points versus the prior quarter. Transaction fees make up the bulk of LendingClub's revenue (79% of LendingClub's FY19 revenue), and so a slowdown in LendingClub's originations will have a nearly parallel impact on revenue.What's equally concerning is that, at least as of Q4, lower-grade originations were growing faster. LendingClub grades its unsecured consumer ""Notes"" from A to D, with A being those of the highest credit quality (in an effort to improve credit quality, LendingClub has stopped originating Notes of grades E-G). In Q4, D-graded notes grew 16% y/y, while A and B notes grew 8% y/y and 9% y/y, respectively; and C notes contracted by -3% y/y.This year, as investors expect defaults to rise on unsecured consumer debt, demand for LendingClub's Notes-based securitization will fall - impacting the company's ability to extend credit and generate loans. Institutional investors make up the bulk of LendingClub's funding sources. As shown in the chart below, banks and institutional investors account for just under 60% of LendingClub's Q4 origination funding:Figure 2. LendingClub funding sourcesSource: LendingClub Q4 earnings deckRight now, banks are under pressure to lend directly to consumers and small businesses. Institutional investors, as well as fund managers controlling ""managed accounts"", may be put off both by the increased default expectations plus competition from other high-yield debt offerings that have recently floated the market. For example, Carnival Corporation (CCL) just floated a bond offering yielding ~12%, which is more attractive than the 6.1% average return offered by a D-graded LendingClub note, per LendingClub's historical returns data. Investors are asking themselves what's really riskier, unsecured consumer debt or junk bonds from companies with billion-dollar market caps.Either way, due both to competition from high-yield alternatives as well as default expectations, investor demand for LendingClub securities will dampen this year, which will likely swing LendingClub's originations growth negative.As seen in the chart above, LendingClub has also trended toward holding nearly a quarter of its originations on its own balance sheet. If third-party institutional demand suffers this year, LendingClub may need to fund more of its originations out of its own balance sheet - but either way, its present inventory of Notes is cause enough for concern.As of the end of the fourth quarter, LendingClub's most recently-reported period, the company held $1.85 billion of loans on its balance sheet, including $0.72 billion that is held for sale (unloading these notes may be more difficult given present circumstances).Figure 3. LendingClub Q4 balance sheetSource: LendingClub 10-KHistorical charge-off rates for LendingClub have trended between 7-12%, as shown in the chart below (though the good news is that about three-quarters of LendingClub's loan investor is held in its ""standard"" program with lower ~7% charge-offs)Figure 4. LendingClub charge-off historySource: LendingClub 10-KMacroeconomic pressures are almost certain to drive charge-off rates higher in 2020. As a point of reference, if we assume LendingClub's core portfolio sees charge-off rates increase three points to ~10%, then about ~$185 million is at risk for LendingClub. That's quite a substantial figure against a company whose market cap has sunk to just under $500 million.There's no doubt that LendingClub is facing unprecedented challenges at the moment. The fact that the company has recently announced a layoff of 460 heads (roughly 30% of its headcount) and instituted 25% executive pay cuts is an indicator of its present struggles. We expect higher loan defaults to present both a direct risk to LendingClub's balance sheet as well as harm the company's already-flailing originations potential.Resist the temptation to catch a falling knife here; LendingClub's problems aren't likely to resolve in the near term even as some parts of the U.S. reopen."
4267703,105014,2019-05-31T17:51:05-04:00,Revenue growth is decelerating due to demand from investors for improved credit quality.Expense and expense growth are not commensurate with revenue level and decelerating growth.Business model is not robust through an economic cycle.,"I investigated LendingClub (NYSE:LC) because it is a ""Fintech"" company and a ""Platform"" company that may have a long runway of growth by bringing together investors and borrowers in low friction transactions. What I found is a company whose growth is decelerating and a company that has a bloated cost structure. Its business model is one where it takes a slice of the economic benefit when it helps a borrower to consolidate and refinance his credit card debt. When I get to the gist of the business model, I concluded that it is not a robust model through an economic cycle, especially for a company that is burdened with a bloated cost structure.In its 10-K filing, LendingClub describes itself as an online marketplace, connecting borrowers and investors. Figure 1 is a graphical representation of the LC business model.Figure 1: LendingClub business model. Source: Company 10-K.Qualified consumers and small business owners borrow through LC to lower the cost of their credit and enjoy a better experience than traditional bank lending. The most common product is an unsecured loan. Investors use LendingClub to earn attractive risk-adjusted returns. Figure 2 shows the mix of investor type and how the mix has evolved over the last 3 years.Figure 2: LendingClub investor mix by percent of loans invested by quarter. Source: Company 10-Qs and 10-KsWhile LC has been described as a P2P lending platform by some, Figure 2 shows that the self-directed investors has been a small and declining portion of its investor mix. Banks and other institutional investors have become the most important investor groups for LC. The company discloses that its largest investor, probably a bank, invested in 36% of its loans in the latest quarter. Starting 3Q2017, LC takes portions of the loan onto its balance sheet. It securitizes these loans and resells them to investors. As a result, it shows an inventory of loans on its balance sheet at the end of each subsequent quarters.On the demand side, LC does not lack potential borrowers. The primary demand-facing product is an unsecured loan targeted at borrowers who want to consolidate their credit card debt at a lower rate. In its latest Investor Day Presentation, the company showed that less than 6% of all loan applications resulted in a loan origination. The primary reason is the demand from its investor base for higher credit quality borrowers to contain loan loss risks. The higher credit quality demand filters out the bulk of the applicants. This is a major factor that leads to the decelerating growth.LendingClub generates revenue on both sides of its platform. LendingClub charges its borrower a transaction fee, averaging about 5% of the loan originated. This transaction fee represented 78% of its total revenue in 1Q2019. The other 22% of revenue is generated from the investor side of its platform, from fees charged to its investors for servicing the loans, from interest spread and gains from capital transactions.Figure 3 shows the YoY growth of loan origination and revenue. Since the largest part of LC's revenue comes from transaction fees levied on loan origination, it is not surprising that revenue and loan origination track quite closely.Figure 3: Loan origination and total revenue growth, YoY. Source: 10-Q and 10-K.Before 2016, loan origination grew at rates of close to 100% YoY. By early 2016, default rate on loan increased dramatically, resulting in losses by investors. In hindsight, it was clear that growth was driven by loose credit standard. Investors balked at doing business and loan origination declined on a YoY basis in 2016. A new management team came on board beginning late 2Q of 2016 and worked to rebuild investor trust.It also became clear to the new management team that a more stable and sophisticated investor group is key to its long-term growth. Management pivoted from individual investors and managed accounts to banks and institutional investors (see Figure 2). Banks and Institutional investors have more robust credit models and risk management. They opt to lend to higher credit quality borrowers. As a result, LC has to focus on the ""prime"" borrowers and be more stringent in the scoring of borrower attributes, resulting in a smaller served available market (SAM).Figure 4: YoY total revenue growth in the last 5 quarters. Source: 10-Q and 10-K.Figure 4 shows the revenue decline over the last year. Figure 4 shows clearly that the YoY growth rate of revenue decelerated rapidly last year, from 27% in 2Q2018 to 15% in 1Q2019. Management guides full year 2019 growth rate to be 12.3% at the midpoint. This means that YoY growth will continue to decelerate as the year progresses. My belief is that competition for this group of ""prime"" borrowers is intense, and it is increasingly difficult for LC to grow its market share.LendingClub has been working on expanding its products. It has made focused investment in developing a product for the refinancing of auto loans. It has been testing this product since 2017. In the 4Q2018 earnings CC, management indicated that the auto product will not contribute meaningfully in 2019 and 2020. The primary reason is that LC needs to validate the credit model and the credit performance with a larger set of loans and with more investors.Meanwhile, LC is working with other potential investors to lend to borrowers with lower credit rating. The credit and profitability models have to be developed and tested. I do not expect this product line to be widely launched soon.The bottom line is that in the next 2 years, the primary revenue growth driver will be the existing unsecured loan product marketed to ""prime"" borrowers, a market segment that is extremely competitive.LendingClub has a bloated expense structure that is not commensurate with its revenue. Figure 5 shows the operating expense as a percent of its revenue in the last 3 years. I have excluded goodwill impairment and class action and other legal expenses. Figure 5 shows that LC's operating expenses far exceed it revenue, with no signs of closing of the gap.Figure 5: Operating expense as percent of revenue, excluding goodwill impairment and class action and other litigation expenses. Source: 10-Q and 10-K.Rate of growth of expenses has been comparable to the rate of growth of revenue as can be seen in Figure 6. The company has not been able to get leverage from its revenue growth.Figure 6: Expense growth vs revenue growth. Expense excludes goodwill impairment and class action and other litigation expenses. Source: 10-Q and 10-K.Figure 6 shows that expense growth accelerated since late 2017. The company recently started to rein in the rapid growth. LC capitalizes a portion of the Engineering and Product Development expense as well as a portion of the other G&A expense. The capitalization of these expenses may very well be justified, but it just underscores the issue of its expense structure.The company started to address the cost issue in 2H2018. It has started to outsource some of its engineering and product development work. It has started to move some jobs from San Francisco to Lehi, UT. It also has started to outsource some of the loan servicing and support work. The company has not provided a target for expense growth reduction. My assessment is that the effort so far will not get LC to GAAP profitability. I suspect that more drastic restructuring will be required to get the cost structure in line with its growth potential. More importantly, LC needs to prepare itself for the scenario of a weak economy that will come sooner or later. In a weak economy, investors will demand even higher credit quality from its borrowers, which may result in further revenue growth deceleration or even revenue decline.Figure 7 is a very simplified view of the business model and serves to illustrate its weakness through a cycle. Figure 7 illustrates the economic benefits accrued to the different parties in a loan origination transaction. Every party in the transaction has to accrue a benefit in order for a loan origination to take place. Recall that LC's revenue is directly tied to loan origination. By looking at Figure 7, we can understand why LC's revenue growth is decelerating and how it could decelerate rapidly in a slowing economy.Figure 7: Economic benefits accrued to the different parties in an LC loan origination, assuming a 3-year loan. Source: assumptions by author and 10-Q.In this simplified view, a ""prime"" borrower refinances his credit card balance with LC, he gets a reduction of interest rate of 2.8%. LC takes a cut of 5% of the origination. On a 3-year loan, that translates to 1.7% annually. LC reported that the charge off rate for such a loan is typically 7%. An investor pockets 4.5% on a 3-year asset, not bad in today's low interest rate environment.While grossly simplified, Figure 7 shows why only the ""prime"" borrowers are the potential SAM. For lower credit quality borrowers, the charge-off rate is higher. If the charge-off rate for ""sub-prime"" borrowers exceeds 9%, a ""sub-prime"" borrower accrues no economic benefit incentive to refinance.If and when the economy slows or goes into a recession, default rate will rise even for the ""prime"" cohort, resulting in a higher charge off rate. If the investor continues to demand 4.5% return and LC continues to keep its 1.7%, the benefit for the borrower diminishes rapidly. With a 2%-3% increase in a charge-off rate, there is no longer any benefit for even a ""prime"" borrower to refinance his credit card debt, rapidly shrinking the SAM. This will result in a decline in revenue.In addition, LC takes a portion of the loan onto its balance sheet. Should the economy slow rapidly or go into a recession, LC may have to discount this asset in order to move it, resulting in loss on sales. If LC keeps this asset on the balance sheet for longer than planned, it will impact its ability to finance more loans. Either way, its revenue will be negatively impacted.LendingClub's business model is not robust through an economic cycle. Its revenue growth is decelerating because of intense competition for the business of the ""prime"" borrowers in its SAM. Its auto loan refinancing product is not expected to provide revenue growth in the foreseeable future. LendingClub's cost structure and expense growth is high compared to its revenue base and revenue growth. I have decided against investing in this company."

The online lending platform just completed another quarter full of records, making one struggle to comprehend the negativity surrounding the stock. New platform innovation might finally provide the catalyst towards consistent revenue growth that drives the stock to a higher price.LendingClub is in the midst of boosting margins by moving operational employees to the lower cost area of Salt Lake City or business process outsourcing centers. The end result is lower costs to originate and service loans.In the process, and in combination with higher loan originations, the online lending platform has improved the contribution margin as operating expenses were held in check while revenues grew by nearly $14 million YoY. The contribution margin jumped to 52.2% to a record high of $99.6 million, up $14.2 million from last Q2. In the process, the company cut the originating, sales and marketing costs to below 3% of originations.Source: LendingClub Q2'19 presentationWhile pure loan origination growth can drive the stock higher, any origination growth is huge when a company already generates strong EBITDA margins and is boosting the contribution margin. In the last quarter, LendingClub hit yet another record in this category with $3.1 billion in loan originations, up 11% YoY.Source: LendingClub Q2'19 presentationThese loan originations contributed to revenue reaching a record of $190.8 million. If investors like these records, one should like the Q3'19 guidance:The high end of guidance would beat record revenues by $19 million and record EBITDA by nearly $7 million. The new Select Plus Platform and the next generation certificate program are finally providing the catalysts for sustainable growth the market desperately wants from the fintech. Not to mention, LendingClub is finally on the path to sustainable profits.The Select Plus Platform is working with Theorem Partners LLC to provide affordable credit to borrowers that wouldn't normally meet existing loan criteria. Theorem Partners is run by a former Morgan Stanley banker and a former Google data scientist. The financial details and potential are unknown, but the promising part is that LendingClub is expanding on the marketplace model to offer more services with the existing infrastructure and access to applicants.The vision to finally turn LendingClub into a marketplace that delivers more products and services to the active members and large base of applicants is what will drive value for the stock. CEO Scott Sanborn had this to say on the Q2 earnings call:My previous research focused on the deep value with this fintech, and the Q2 numbers and guidance only reinforce this metric. LendingClub finally maintained full-year guidance while also launching a new platform with a new investor partner supporting bullish vibes on the beaten-down stock.With ~87 million shares outstanding, the stock has a market value in the $1.3 billion range. Not even factoring in cash, LendingClub trades at a P/S multiple not usually reserved for a stock with 10%+ revenue growth.The cash position is where the stock turns into deep value. LendingClub has a cash and marketable securities balance in the $555 million range. When including financial assets that account for loans held for sale by the company and deducting any related credit facilities, the company has a theoretical cash balance of $671 million. One would need to make a case for the loans to hold considerable risk in order to not include these financial assets in net value.Source: LendingClub Q2'19 press releaseIn such a case, LendingClub has an enterprise value that dips to only $650 million. The stock trades below a 1x EV/S multiple with 2018 revenues forecasted to reach at least. $765 million. The forward multiple is even more appealing with the company forecast to reach $880 million 2020 revenues for 12% growth.The key investor takeaway is that the stock value remains hard to comprehend. LendingClub continues hitting record financial metrics and will finally report a profit in Q3, thereby eliminating a lot of the negative reasons to avoid the stock. the stock simply needs to trade at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 15x to reach a target price of $30, or roughly a double."
4262456,105040,2019-05-10T08:32:06-04:00,LendingClub has a large TAM and offers a great value proposition.LendingClub has one of the best reputations in the industry.New management has executed well.Recession risks are overblown.,"If you look at a chart of LendingClub(LC) stock over the past few years, you may think that fundamentals have deteriorated or stagnated since 2016. However, LendingClub's fundamentals have actually improved substantially. With the price lower than it was a few years ago despite these improvements, we believe LendingClub may be undervalued, especially considering its great business model and strong reputation.Its no secret that the US has a debt problem. From student loans to credit card debt, US consumers frequently take on more debt than they can afford. With credit card companies and other lenders charging exorbitant rates, consumers are forced to pay massive amounts of interest.Meanwhile, there are massive pools of capital floating around looking for investments that can generate consistent returns. In the peak of this bull market though, solid high yield investments are hard to come by.Enter LendingClub, which takes advantage of these massive pools of capital to loan to borrowers for everything from home improvement to debt consolidation to large purchases at much lower interest rates, allowing them to pay off the debt much more easily and cheaply. Investors, meanwhile, get a decent yield for lending to borrowers. The value proposition couldn't be more clear to both parties.LendingClub's own research shows that the market for P2P lending available to them may be as much as $300-350bil.2017 investor presentationThese findings are supported by other sources. According to TMR, the peer-to-peer(P2P) industry is estimated to grow to 897bil by 2024 at a CAGR of over 48%. AlliedMarketResearch estimates the industry may grow to 460bil by 2022 at a CAGR of 51.5%. Although LC operates only in the US, the US is the 2nd largest economy in the world and will likely take a large share of the world P2P market.On the investor side, LendingClub's own research again shows an enormous market opportunity, with potentially $38T of capital available for P2P lending. LendingClub, being one of the largest operators in this space, will most likely be able to garner a significant chunk of this capital due to their proven status.2017 investor presentationLendingClub suffered from a devastating scandal in 2016. Turns out, Renaud Laplanche, its founder, had sold loans that did not meet the buyers criteria and had several conflicts of interest which he did not disclose. The scandal caused a sharp drop in LendingClub's price, causing it to plummet as LendingClub began to lose buyers and had to ramp up internal security. In the end, Laplanche and several other executives were ousted from the company.LendingClub has built up one of the best reputations in the P2P lending space after the scandal in 2016. On its own website, it boasts a 4.8 star average review score. In its Q4 2018 earnings call, management noted that they had hit an all time high NPS of 78, up from the 71 stated in their investor conference. This net promoter score is one of the highest among all companies and far exceeds the NPS of the average bank or credit card company (Major credit card companies have a NPS in the single digits while many banks have a negative NPS).-customer.guruMost independent reviews online have also been very positive, giving LendingClub a 4-5 star rating. On consumeraffairs, one of the only sites LendingClub didn't receive a 4-5 star review, LendingClub beat out competitors SoFi and Prosper by a wide margin. Most of the complaints on that site about LendingClub seemed to be from people who didn't even use the service.-consumeraffairsAfter suffering from the scandal in 2016, LendingClub's revenues and profits have dropped significantly. However, things have changed since then. New management and procedures have been installed and LendingClub is back to being a growth company. Revenues have increased back to 2016 levels and losses have been narrowed significantly.New management have executed well, managing to exceed their own investor day targets set in 2017. Over the past few years, they have implemented cost saving measures that have paid off handsomely, as shown by the strong adjusted EBITDA margin growth.Q4 2018 slidesManagement has also done extremely well settling the SEC and DOJ lawsuits. Although LendingClub Asset Management was charged, the fact that the SEC decided not to recommend charges against parent company LendingClub is another testament of the culture of transparency that LendingClub embodies.The only legal suit left to settle now are the FTC charges. We looked at evidence from both sides and we believe the FTC's allegations may be unfounded. Either way, on September 13, a judge told the FTC and LendingClub to try and settle the charges, so this problem will most likely soon be behind LendingClub.A frequently stated bear thesis around LendingClub is that a recession would cause P2P lending to die out as borrowers default. However, we disagree with this conclusion and would like to state the other side of the argument.The simple reason P2P lenders won't die is this: ""Credit card companies have made unsecured personal loans for decades and haven't gone bankrupt.""In the great financial crisis, the default rate momentarily peaked at 11 percent for a single quarter, but the credit card companies had 15 percent gross interest to cover those losses, leaving them with a 4 percent spread.This means that if a recession does happen, all P2P lenders need to do is raise prices. Of course, that would translate into lower volumes, which could cause losses due to the high fixed costs. However, LendingClub has addressed this as well by outsourcing some of their business processes, which translate fixed costs into variable costs and gives them further resiliency over the economic cycle. With its current cash position and strong balance sheet, LendingClub should be able to survive for several years without any originations.Furthermore, stress tests by LendingClub show that investors can achieve relatively high returns even in a downturn.2017 investor presentationUS consumers have also improved their FICO scores since the Financial Crisis, as one report shows:Most peer to peer lenders require high FICO scores, with LC coming in at a minimum 600. Many credit cards, meanwhile, have lower FICO score requirements. This is why I believe in a recession, P2P charge off rates will be lower than credit card charge offs, allowing P2P lenders to maintain a lower interest rate.Lastly, according to LendingWorks, the fractional reserve lending system was what caused the crisis in 2008. Since P2P lenders lend out $1 for every $1 they receive, they will not be leveraged, not to mention there can be no “run” on P2P lenders as lenders cannot withdraw their funds for loans. This is because all funds will go to the borrower and the lender cannot force the borrower to pay off the loan. Only at the end of the loan term agreement will a lender reclaim its funds.Competition has also been a major pillar of the bear thesis. With new fintech startups popping up, like Brex, this is definitely a valid concern. However, we have not seen any serious threats to LendingClub's dominance.One could argue that Marcus by Goldman Sachs is a serious threat, but with Goldman Sach's low NPS(4) and the fact the fact that LendingClub has a much more streamlined process and a better reputation, we believe Marcus isn't a major threat, though it may take a significant share of the market. Goldman Sach's itself says it aims to get $1bil of revenues per year, which may seem like a lot but is only a small portion of the market.Honestly, we don't see how Marcus can be a huge threat in the long term. Marcus may be backed by the capital reserves of Goldman Sachs, but its loan prices can be higher, according to anecdotal reviews, and LendingClub itself is back by large banks with huge pools of cheap capital, so we don't see how Marcus has a competitive advantage.Prosper is even less of a threat. It is much smaller than LendingClub and has a much poorer reputation, with its consumeraffairs score less than half of LendingClub's score.Overall, although competition is serious enough to prevent LendingClub from capturing most of the market, it isn't really a major threat to LendingClub's existence. There is more than enough pie to go around.Its quite hard to value LendingClub. Like most fintechs, it's losing money as it hasn't scaled enough to make a profit, yet high fixed costs means that operating leverage will likely help LendingClub increase profitability significantly as revenue increases. Therefore we'll use an adjusted EBITDA multiple to value LendingClub.Most major tech companies trade at around 20-25x EBITDA and grow at similar rates to LendingClub, therefore we believe using them as comparables is warranted. Using this valuation, LendingClub would be valued at around $2.8bil, or around $6.60 per share, twice its current price. We believe this is fair given LendingClub's competitive advantages and dominant status in its market. We use adjusted EBITDA as a metric as net income eventually trends towards adjusted EBITDA for most tech companies as they continue to scale and as variable costs start to dwarf fixed costs. We believe net income will trend towards adjusted EBITDA for the long run for LendingClub. In fact, adjusted losses in 2018 are far lower than adjusted losses in 2017.LendingClub has been beaten down too much. It trades at a lower price today than in 2016 despite the fact that its fundamentals have improved drastically. For a dominant company in this lucrative niche, we believe a market cap of $1.5bil is too little. LendingClub has significant upside from here, especially after it settles litigation from the FTC."
4248507,105102,2019-03-13T15:01:18-04:00,The company has been carrying the burden of previous scandals which has contributed to a depressed stock performance.Key indicators are improving and management is preparing the company to be successful in the long term.LendingClub has earned a niche for itself that is complementary to traditional financial institutions and stands to gain from further adoption of its technology.A black swan event remains possible in the form of an unexpectedly deep recession and a pullback in consumer borrowing.,"LendingClub (LC) was founded in 2006 but splashed onto the scene in the post-2008 fintech frenzy. In a way it is a typical Silicon Valley story with plenty of ambition, drama and excitement. It has been a long time since the company was in the news and that makes it a good time to look at its performance without all of the distracting noise.(Source: LendingClub)The business model of the company proposes that it is possible for a digital loan originator to perform all of the due diligence of issuing a loan more efficiently and with greater reach than a traditional financial institution. To achieve this goal, LendingClub had to solve both sides of the classic marketplace dilemma - it needed borrowers and lenders at the same time without having a long track record. We can now say that it was successful in doing this.When traditional banks were struggling to get their operations in order after the Great Recession, the new tech challengers initially positioned themselves as competitors. They had sparkling clean reputations and the support of the public. However, it became apparent that traditional banks had much stickier relationships with their customers and LendingClub had to pivot toward partnering with banks to find funding for its loans since relying on retail investors was not a sufficient or sustainable option.Fast forward to 2019 and LendingClub is sourcing the majority of its funding from banks and other institutional sources.(Source: LendingClub)Putting aside the humbling pivot, the change has served LendingClub well and positioned it on a sustainable trajectory.LendingClub has demonstrated that there is a demand for its loans as evidenced by its year-over-year origination growth. In 2018, the company originated $10,882 billion in loans, a 21% increase from 2017. It is also notable that applications rose 35% year over year.(Source: LendingClub)To put the numbers in perspective, LendingClub is able to originate more loans than most small-to-medium banks in the United States. This makes sense because most small banks in the US are regional, while LendingClub has national reach.Just to make sure LendingClub doesn't suffer from overly high marketing costs to get these borrowers, I've included below the marketing cost trend from their full-year 2018 results.(Source: LendingClub)The Sales and Marketing expenses increased by about 13.8%, which is lower than the 21% increase in revenues, suggesting a positive efficiency trend. In my opinion, these metrics are reassuring and the only major concern may be a macroeconomic black swan event which could impact the desire of consumers to seek loans from LendingClub (more on that later).Switching gears to review the supply side of funding sources, we see that LendingClub has done a good job of diversifying its suppliers. This strategic move will ultimately be key to the success of the company because as a machine for originating loans, LendingClub needs a constant source of funding. Earlier in its life LendingClub was overly reliant on retail investors for funding and it learned the hard way that being in such a position exposed its business model to critical risk.Accessing funding from banks and other financial institutions is also good because it means that LendingClub is becoming a part of those institutions' success. They will continue to become more comfortable with LendingClub as a partner and that places the company in a good position to capture the network effects of being in the middle of banks and borrowers. Borrowers in the US are also slowly (more slowly than some hoped) transitioning to self service digital banking solutions. LendingClub will benefit by this macro trend as business owners and individuals become more open to borrowing from a website rather than a banker.LendingClub's share performance since its IPO has been abysmal, as is widely known. However, it isn't the only lending fintech that has had its shares battered. Below we see a comparison with On Deck (ONDK) and we notice a divergence between the two in late 2017. On Deck has a somewhat different business model where they choose to keep more loans on their books, but I believe it can be considered a peer of LendingClub.Data by YChartsAt this point, much of the negative news that harmed LendingClub is likely in the rearview mirror. The management shakeup has helped ensure that an emphasis is placed on transparency and compliance. Barring any unexpected relapse in operating practices, the management is going to have more time to focus on growing the company rather than managing a crisis.It is worth noting that the company wrote off the goodwill asset from its financial statements, which certainly reflects all of the legacy legal and reputation issues it has suffered.(Source: LendingClub)Assuming LendingClub continues to perform within the trends it has established recently, I believe the market will begin to treat it more positively in the future. A slow retraction back into the $4-$5 per share range is within reasonable expectations.Every time I think about a fintech company, I am always reminded that almost none of them have been through a recession. Traditional banks know that when times are good, they should be preparing for the time when the cycle turns. We have yet to see how fintechs will do.LendingClub is exposed to a couple of potential risks in the event of a macroeconomic downturn in the US. Firstly, borrowers may stop borrowing, which will cause originations and revenues to decrease. Secondly, issued loans may perform worse than expected, causing funding sources to dry up. By all indications management is aware of these risks as they were mentioned in their Q4 presentation, but the risks exist nonetheless.One option the company has if funding sources disappear is to hold the loans on their own books. This would move it closer to being a traditional bank or more like On Deck; however, I believe changing the business model in the middle of a recession would incur more costs.Overall, the company has put a lot of work into recovering from previous problems and is now positioned well for growth. If management takes steps to prepare for the eventuality of an economic slowdown, the company should be able to weather a storm successfully."
4247771,105106,2019-03-11T11:48:11-04:00,"LendingClub evolved from P2P lending in 2009 to an institutional lender-driven platform in 2018.
        Revenue slowdown is not a concern as quality of loans continue to improve and institutional investors like it.
        LendingClub provides efficiency to the existing credit system through cost saving compared to traditional brick and mortar bank model by grabbing shares from traditional banks rather creating new credit.
        LendingClub enjoys a higher variable margin and thus employs a cost leadership moat to defend themselves from the competition from advertising-based credit product platforms and traditional bank models.
        LendingClub will leverage its fixed costs and improve profitability at scale. We believe that once LendingClub becomes profitable, the valuation multiple should expand.","LendingClub Corporation(LC) is the largest U.S. online marketplace platforms that connects borrowers and lenders, facilitating loan origination at a lower cost of debt for borrowers and superior risk-adjusted returns for investors than traditional banks. The marketplace facilitated approximately $40.0 billion in loans from 2007 to 2018. LendingClub charges issuing bank transaction and collecting investor fees as the loan servicer.EXECUTIVE SUMMARYWe summarized the risk factors of the company below and will discuss each factor in the following paragraph. On February 19, 2019, LendingClub released its fourth quarter 2018 report and FY2019 outlook. The stock was down 15% on that day and 24% since the earnings release. We believe the sell-off can be attributed to the company’s weak and decelerated 2019 revenue growth outlook, citing 7%-13% growth in first quarter of 2019 and 10%-14% in FY2019.We believe the panic is overdone and investors should understand where the company is heading long term, as it is shifting focus from P2P lending in 2009 to an institutional lender-driven platform. Lending Club has demonstrated improved operating metrics and is beginning to show the benefit of economic of scale. We believe the sell-off makes it a buying opportunity for investors.From chart below, we continued to see LendingClub demonstrate its benefits from economic of scale, as the company leveraged its fixed costs such as origination, research and general expense. Source: Company’s 10K, 10QFrom the revenue mix analysis, we clearly see that the revenue slowdown has been driven by its managed accounts and self-directed customers because of the wind-down actions of LendingClub’s investment advisor and its shift of focus to institutional investors.Per investors’ request, LendingClub decided to tighten its underwritten standard. We see the annualized loan charge-off rate has improved since it peaked in 2017. As the result, we see the investor demand rebounded nicely. Banks(41% of revenue) grew nicely at 34% accelerated from third quarter 2018. Overall, institutional investors as aggregate(78% of revenue) grew at 44% accelerated from third quarter 2018. LendingClub proved that it can effectively control the quality of loan. Source: Company’s 10K, 10QLendingClub has continuously evolved its investor base from 90%, comprised of the retail investor group in 2009 to financial institution driven in 2018.Source: Company’s presentationIt currently serves these two major types of institutions:Community banks:Community banks typically have a higher efficiency ratio and expense ratio compared to traditionally large banks because they provide fewer varieties of products and less convenience due to fewer branch/ATM locations. As a result, community banks are at a disadvantage in attracting retail customers compared to larger banks.Source: FDICFor community banks, the cost of building or buying their own online origination platform is prohibitive. In collaborating with LendingClub, banks can achieve more with less risk: they can get improved services for a significantly lower capital expenditure; a reduced cost of doing business; and, more importantly, access to market segments that would otherwise not meet their credit criteria.Asset managers:Assets managers look for assets with (i) return and quality, and (ii) diversification.(i) Return and Quality:Compared to bank partners, asset managers have a high-risk tolerance and return requirement. LendingClub structures Club Certificate program, typically 3-to-5 year tenure and customized for different asset managers. It uses transaction data, behavior data and other risk tools along with its 10-year credit database to evaluate loan risk to provide asset transparency for asset managers. LendingClub also provides post-lending loan servicing and takes over the loan application process for asset managers, which reduces their operating costs and improves return.(ii) Diversification:LendingClub provides assets manager with a new asset class which traditionally is profitable while being close to the bank industry. With an average short duration and higher yields, a Club Certificate program could be added to the portfolio as a balance for corporate and sovereign credit.Source: BloombergLendingClub has sold over $1 billion Club Certificates in less than one year since the program launch. As both banking and asset management markets are huge, and currently undeserved, We believe LendingClub’s business model is disruptive to the traditional banking model. Hence, the company could still grow through taking shares from the existing market regardless of the uncertainty of the macro environment. Source: Company’s presentationLendingClub has shown consistency in grabbing shares from traditional banks. It now accounts for 10% of total U.S. personal loan balances outstanding.Source: TransUnion Industry Insights Report 2017Another area of focus is auto loans, according to New York Fed consumer credit panel and Equifax(EFX). As of the fourth quarter of 2018, the U.S. auto loan outstanding balance is 1.2 trillion. In our recent article, we pointed out that the emergence of the online used car platform, Carvana(CVNA), can be attributed to its low variable cost lending model. LendingClub is currently quietly growing its refinance auto loan revenues. An excerpt from their earning transcript:Auto originations since launch are three times higher than personal loans at the same point in their life cycle. So, we remain encouraged about auto as a long-term driver of our growth. Having developed the user experience and credit model in 2018, we will be focusing on building out our investor base in auto in 2019.Carvana originated loans through its low-cost lending platform at the rate of 136% in 2017 and 138%, in the amount of $1.2 billion, in 2018. Clearly, there is strong demand in auto loans. We believe LendingClub should partner with other brick and mortar car dealers to bring down the consumer’s financing cost.LendingClub has currently incurred a GAAP loss compared to profitable advertising-based lending platforms such as Lending Tree(TREE), which attracts users by providing a variety of credit-related product information on its platform. LendingClub heavily invests in fixed costs such as acquiring talent and building its own proprietary algorithm system. However, LendingClub is continuously improving its borrower conversion rate by investing in its machine learning credit system. LendingClub’s high variable margin shows that it has better customer acquisition efficiency than Lending Tree. We believe LendingClub’s business model is more competitive long term.Source: Companies' earnings reportAs borrowers are shifting to digital channels, traditional large banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase are also building their own digital platforms, although traditional banks enjoy a lower cost of funding compared to community banks. However, due to higher brick and mortar fixed costs at J.P. Morgan Chase(JPM), LendingClub is more competitive than JP Morgan Chase in customer acquisition cost; hence, overall the company could offer lower interest rate loans along with its community banks partners.LendingClub has consistently shown an improving variable (contribution margin) and fixed cost structure (EBT margin) that strengthen its cost advantage against peers. Its contribution margin and EBT margin have improved over the past 3 years.Source: Companies' earnings reportCompared to lending platforms like OnDeck Capital(ONDK), which take most of the credit risk of the loans it originates and relies on its own credit solvency to access capital, LendingClub obtains capital from diverse sources. LendingClub provides products to banks, insurance companies, asset managers and other financial institution investors through a standard and customized program.Furthermore, Lending Club sources funding from banks, other institutional and lending club-funded inventory (mainly for the Club Certificate program and to keep a small piece of the loan in inventory to satisfy regulatory requirements). Banks typically target high credit profile customers while institutional investors look at yield and liquidity. The mix of the investor base provides diversification of access to capital for the lending club. Source: Company' earnings report Compared to its fintech peers: Source: Yahoo finance, BloombergLendingClub's current depressed multiple compared to other fintech peers because it is not profitable yet. However, with $645 million cash on hand, we are not worried about its liquidity. Also, we believe LendingClub will be profitable by leveraging its fixed costs. The valuation multiple should expand once the company becomes profitable."
4229576,85726,2018-12-21T02:42:38-05:00,"Lending Club has fallen this year along with the rest of the financial sector, despite strong U.S. economic growth.The market continues to value LC as a bank, rather than a two-sided internet platform.I concede the company is a mix of both, but I lean towards the latter.The company holds very few loans on its balance sheet, and its investor base is diversified.","At the beginning of the year, I pitched Lending Club (Nasdaq:LC) as a potential turnaround pick, given that its stock had been beaten down in the wake of its 2016 scandal that led to the resignation of its founder, Renaud Laplanche. The company has since promoted President Scott Sanborn to CEO, and then bolstered its ranks of executives with people from Blackrock iShares, JPMorgan, and other establishment financial institutions, along with tech talent from Netflix and Salesforce. The company tightened credit, and focused on bolstering its competitive advantage in using its scale and platform model to grow the business prudently without harming credit.So how did the company do? Well, looking at its results and core business – phenomenal. Last quarter the company achieved record originations, revenue and adjusted EBITDA even as it tightened credit (30% growth in applications, but only 18% in originations, along with 20% revenue growth). The company beat analyst expectations for both revenue and non-GAAP earnings (there are several expenses still cleaning up the 2016 scandal issues) and boosted guidance.What did the stock do? Since earnings, the stock is down about 25%. Go figure.In difficult times like these, balance sheets become important, and investors don’t seem to be appreciating what lies on Lending Club’s books. Lending Club’s financial statements can be a tad complex for the way loans are categorized on the company’s books, but the company simplifies things in the press release. It holds $348 million cash on its balance sheet, another $165 million of marketplace loans that it currently holds but can sell at its discretion, another $459.3 million that it holds and will be sold in a securitization or the newly-invented CLUB certificate, which trades on a public exchange. These are short-term holdings that will eventually be sold for cash, at a profit. The company has used its revolver, but only $185 million.The are other repurchase agreements that the company has entered into that can be thought of as a form of potential debt, but the company also has an additional restricted cash of $203 million and other collateral put up.If you add up the cash, loans held by the company at its discretion, and the loans that will eventually be sold via securitizations/certificates, and subtract out the revolver, the company’s cash and loans comes out to about $787 million. (Source: Lending Club Q3 2018 Earnings Release)Now, of course the company will need to retain this cash in order to execute securitizations in the future once it sells the current crop, but this isn’t a deposit liability that the company has to pay interest on or worry about refinancing if the depositor goes away, like a bank. It’s cash that actually pays Lending Club interest in the interim (so the company will benefit from higher rates, in this respect). This is very different from having to issue deposits, CDs, or high-yield savings accounts, like competitor Marcus by Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) has to do.So, at the current market cap of only $1.13 billion, investors are essentially valuing the company-ex cash at $330 million, less than half of this year's revenue and 3.5x this year’s EBITDA. The company continues to post GAAP losses but these should narrow or go positive in the next 1-2 years with operating leverage. As I'll discuss below, it should be cash flow positive right now, ex some one-time legal factors.For the year, the company now expects positive adjusted EBITDA of $89-94 million, which adds back $77 million in stock-based compensation and $54 million in depreciation and amortization. Year to date, however, the company has not been purchasing property and equipment at the pace it had last year, with year-to-date capex of $37.8 million versus D&A of $39.9 million. For the sake of conservatism, let’s say that the company spends $54 million on capex though.That would leave about $16 million of capex left this quarter vs. projected $20-25 million in projected EBITDA. So, while the company is unprofitable on a GAAP basis (like lots of tech startups), the company should be accumulating cash on the balance sheet going forward.Source: Lending Club Q3 2018 presentation.And by the way – the stock with which it has paid its executives through the transition now sits at a lower price, so it hasn’t diluted shareholders quite as much as the headline SBC costs would indicate (of course, we as shareholders would like that to change eventually).The current financial sector rout has taken Lending Club along with it since its last earnings release, but the company is somewhat insulated from the concerns of other small cap banks – namely, competing for deposits, along with credit risk. The company is of course not totally immune, as its fortunes are tied to those of its investors, but the company’s marketplace is diversified among a variety of banks, financial institutions, money managers, and self-directed investors. That’s the key advantage here – Lending Club can adjust and go where the money is according to the appetite for loans.Lending Club stock has come under pressure due to concerns about financials, but it is not 100% a financial stock. It’s partly an asset-light, two-sided platform with a scale advantage over competitors, it doesn’t have (that much) credit risk, and the company that should stand to benefit during any industry shakeout short of a depression due to its balance sheet."

My investment thesis remains solidly on track as the online lending platform with nearly $800 million of cash and loans held for sale is constantly ignored by the market. The perplexing value won't last as the fintech continues to survive and thrive in a rising interest rate environment.Image Source: LendingClub websiteThe last quarter included both records in loan originations and revenue. Loan originations reached $2.886 billion and grew about 2% above the previous record in Q2, while revenues were up 4% sequentially from the record $177 million.Source: LendingClub Q3'18 presentationThe story is even more perplexing when looking at the surging adjusted EBITDA margins. The company grew the quarterly margins to a very solid 15.2% and forecast a boost to the annual EBITDA target by ~$10 million to $91.5 million now. The annual run rate is over $100 million. Not bad for a stock with an enterprise value of around $665 million.Maybe the most important record number is the servicing portfolio. While record loan originations are great for ultimate growth, the business is more than just whether the fintech grows its quarterly origination metric.The loan servicing portfolio is now $13.2 billion, up from $11.5 billion last year. The investor fees from servicing the loan portfolio for clients smooths out revenues, as these fees are surging. LendingClub continues to get higher fees per loan, with investor fees reaching $38.2 million for 42% growth.Source: LendingClub Q3'18 presentationThe market is far too skeptical with the LendingClub story. The fintech saw loan application soar by 30% in the quarter to new records. The company could easily generate faster growth in the already record loan origination levels, but management has prudently refused to reach for low-quality loans.The amazing part is that the stock still trades around the levels seen after the scandal that forced the CEO out, when LendingClub hit a low of $3.44 in May 2016. Since mid-2017, the company has shown consistent revenue growth in the 20% range.LC data by YChartsAnother prime example of the market being far too skeptical here is the EV at a meager $665 million. The amount includes about $513.5 million in actual cash plus $459.3 million in loans held for sale to facilitate transactions for their investor programs. Naturally, these loans have higher risks than cash, but the company holds these loans for a relatively short period and wouldn't face any financial hardship if a large amount of the loans suddenly defaulted.Excluding $185.8 million in debt outstanding to fund these loans, LendingClub has a net cash and loan balance of $787.0 million. With a market cap of $1.45 billion, the fintech has an EV of ~$665 million.The incredible part is that a bullish analyst like Mike Palmer of BTIG has an FY20 EBITDA target of $201 million. The stock only trades at an FY20 EV/EBITDA multiple of 3.6x. Despite this low multiple, Mr. Palmer only has a $7 price target, though the amount is a 100% gain.The key investor takeaway is that the market remains perplexingly negative on LendingClub. The fintech continues to grow the business and improve key metrics like EBITDA margins. In fact, the rising rate environment only appears to be driving more loan demand for consumers to move away from higher credit card rates. The weakness remains an opportunity.Disclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

4199241,103480,2018-08-14T23:41:02-04:00,"LendingClub shares tanked after reporting Q2 earnings that included a net income guidance adjustment due to legacy one-time items.Net losses are now expected at -$124 to -$109 million, versus a prior view of -$70 to -$55 million.With losses at this company already steep, however, the ~$50 million adjustment isn't a top issue to focus on.Instead, look to LendingClub's revenue acceleration and originations growth, which looked much better in Q2 relative to Q1.LendingClub had a record quarter for originations, revenue, and contribution margin, leading to a huge boost in Adjusted EBITDA.","Over the past several quarters, online P2P lending marketplace LendingClub (LC) has vacillated wildly between gains and losses after reporting quarterly earnings. Most of the time, the stock movement is an overreaction - last time, LendingClub shares rocketed up 20% due to an EPS beat and a smaller loss than expected, despite misses to top-line expectations.This quarter, the story was the reverse. The company handily beat analysts' top-line expectations and showed a solid return to mid-20s growth in originations. Recall that because LendingClub derives the majority of its revenues from both origination fees and loan servicing fees, originations growth is one of the key drivers of its business. But this quarter, the company also took down its FY18 profit guidance due to an $18 million ""legacy issue"" and a $36 million goodwill impairment. The resulting new guidance range of -$124 to -$109 million, significantly below a prior guidance range of -$70 to -$55 million, caused shares to lose recent support above $4:LC data by YChartsLendingClub has had a troubled year, having never quite fully recovered from the exit of Renaud Laplanche and the fears of institutional investors pulling back their investments into LendingClub notes. Shares are down nearly 10% year-to-date, in spite of what I view to be material improvements to the company's pace of originations.For a company like LendingClub, which is still in growth mode and is revamping its business model, while still retaining sufficient balance sheet liquidity to fund losses for an ample amount of time, I'm much more focused on the top line than on the bottom line. My focus is particularly on originations, as it's the long-term lifeblood and source of the company's profit stream. Last quarter, LendingClub's originations growth slowed down dramatically relative to prior quarters, giving me pause. However, this quarter, originations rebounded.The cause of LendingClub's profit adjustment is largely non-operational. Here's some more context on the company's write-down from CEO Scott Sanborn's prepared remarks on the earnings call:The associated goodwill writedown, in my opinion, has no bearing on LendingClub's longer-term business health. As long as originations and funding supply from institutional investors keep a healthy pace, LendingClub's underlying operating profits will improve. Furthermore, LendingClub is trading at quite an attractive valuation for a company in recovery mode. With its current market cap at $1.67 billion and with $434 million of cash on its balance sheet, LendingClub has an enterprise value of $1.24 billion. This represents a 1.79x EV/FY18 revenue multiple, based on the company's updated revenue guidance of $680-705 million for the year - substantially below any peer technology company that is still growing its top line at a double-digit rate.While LendingClub certainly bears a considerable degree of risk - especially as it begins to load more of its Notes onto its own balance sheet - the fact that it's trading at a fraction of its peak valuation is enticing.The chart below, taken from LendingClub's Q2 earnings deck, shows the trend in the company's originations:Figure 1. LendingClub originations trendsSource: LendingClub investor relationsTotal originations grew 31% y/y to $2.812 billion, up from $2.15 billion in 2Q17. Note that this is a far cry from the disappointing 18% y/y originations growth that LendingClub endured in Q1, which slid five points sequentially from 23% y/y growth in 4Q17. Perhaps what really happened is that some volume of originations got pushed out from Q1 to Q2, but in any case, we can see now that LendingClub is back on track to hit originations growth in the mid-20%s this year. Scott Sanborn, LendingClub's CEO, also noted that this was a record quarter for both originations and originations growth.This is especially important as the company's FY18 revenue guidance range is targeting growth of 18-23% y/y. As long as LendingClub's originations growth can keep up with its revenue targets, it should be able to hit the latter with ease. Originations are the source of revenues - LendingClub's business model takes a percentage of originations as an upfront fee, and it also derives recurring ""service fees"" over time for outstanding Notes.One other important aspect to highlight is LendingClub's financing mix. It's clear that LendingClub has started to use its own balance sheet to fund originations, with LendingClub footing 18% of the originations mix this quarter (the highest ever mix). However, institutional investors are also starting to come back, supplying $465 million this quarter and up nearly 2x over the year-ago period. And even though banks, the largest funding source, fell as a proportion of total originations due to the increase of LendingClub's own principal contributions, bank funding also grew 18% y/y to $1.12 billion.The strength in originations, naturally, translated to strong quarterly results. Here's a look at the company's second-quarter post:Figure 2. LendingClub Q2 resultsSource: LendingClub 10-QTotal revenues grew 27% y/y to $177.0 million, a record quarter for revenue as well as for originations. Wall Street had only expected $166.8 million in revenues, or +20% y/y. Revenue growth also accelerated five points relative to 22% y/y growth in Q1.Alongside strong revenues, LendingClub also achieved a record quarter for contribution margin - which it defines as net revenues, less expenses for sales and marketing as well as originations. Here's a look at the company's contribution margin trends:Figure 3. LendingClub contribution margin improvementsSource: LendingClub investor relationsExpenses as a percentage of originations fell, leading to a 100bps increase in contribution margin to $85.4 million (48.3%). LendingClub's CFO notes that the company has been able to capitalize on increased marketing efficiency to improve operational leverage:In spite of a more disciplined approach to marketing, the company also notes that its applications for new loans jumped 49% y/y, helping to boost the company's originations growth. The company also re-iterated its commitment to achieve cost-down efforts in both the engineering and loan servicing departments, with tailwinds to EBITDA to kick in this year.As a result of these cost efficiencies, LendingClub enjoyed a massive boost in adjusted EBITDA:Figure 4. LendingClub adjusted EBITDA trendsSource: LendingClub investor relationsAdjusted EBITDA grew more than 5x to $25.7 million, representing a 14.5% EBITDA margin and an over-11 point improvement relative to just 3.2% margin in 2Q17.In my view, LendingClub's second-quarter results were a success, not a disappointment. We've seen that the company's acceleration in originations growth and continued efficiency increases on the cost structure have led to a massive boost in adjusted EBITDA.Investors shouldn't be too worried about a one-time goodwill/legacy impairment charge that takes ~$50 million off this year's net income. The business impact is minimal and has no bearing on LendingClub's long-term potential as the largest P2P lending marketplace. After this quarter's misguided selloff, I'm keen on this stock again."
4221476,102837,2018-11-12T17:44:46-05:00,"The irrational bounce after the company reported its ninth straight quarter of losses provides investors another chance to sell the stock.
        LendingClub is being valued like a technology company although it should really be valued like a credit services company with a much lower forward multiple.
        Bringing the availability of high interest loans to the web is not a business model to get excited about; especially given the ample competition.","LendingClub (LC) announced yet another unprofitable quarter on November 7th. This might surprise some readers who have only read at statements which highlighted adjusted earnings. Adjusted earnings exclude what are supposed to be one-time items or items that do not reflect the ongoing performance of a company’s underlying operations. In the case of LC, it would behoove investors to give much greater weighting to the GAAP earnings. This is even more important than usual in this case since actual results always show a loss in LendingClub’s recent history.When considering a company’s valuation or prospects, investors should carefully consider what the company in question really does. Does the company provide value to its customers or society? In the case of LendingClub, the answer is a resounding no. In some cases, they are providing a service that is only slightly better than that provided by the payday loan industry. Most short or medium term personal loan companies trade at paltry valuations. Consider one such company, World Acceptance Corporation (WRLD), with its PE ratio of 13.06 and average analyst long term growth estimate of 1.50%. This is actually a profitable company but not one that we would recommend investing in by any means. Its 2018 revenue of $549 million is lower than its 2014 revenue of $599 million. This is not an industry with years of high growth ahead of it and if it was that would be a bad sign for the economy. LendingClub’s 2017 annual sales came in at $605 million so it’s not as if we should anticipate much higher growth than World due to starting from a lower base.Someone seeking a loan from LendingClub is not in a good financial state. It is often used by people wanting to consolidate their high interest credit card debt, at possibly a lower rate. Consider the example below from LendingClub’s website. It shows a $6,000 loan with an APR of 11.51%. The 60 month term loan, not pictured, is for a $20,000 loan for a 10.19% APR. This $20,000 loan would end up costing you $24,325.80 or 21.6% more than the loan amount. Of course, the situation could get a lot worse if there are any late payments in which case a late payment fee of 5% will be charged each time.Source: LendingClubAmerica is a nation of debt and LendingClub has found an ample supply of customers. Suffice it to say that if LendingClub is seeing a great deal of new customers, it’s probably not a good sign for the economy. Actually, it’s not even clear if it would be a good sign for LendingClub given that as sales have increased from the low base in 2013 so have the losses.LendingClub has a diverse group of competitors. Individuals desiring to get a personal loan can check with traditional sources like banks or credit unions or the worst option payday loan companies. There are also a host of online lenders like Discover (DFS), Earnest, LightStream, Prosper, or Marcus which is part of Goldman Sachs (GS). The long list of companies that provide personal loans highlights the competitiveness of the industry. This makes increasing margins without losing customers all but impossible. Consumers will shop around to find the lowest possible rates and competition will remain fierce. Obviously, there are many companies with much stronger balance sheets that can compete against LendingClub in addition to a swath of upstarts with similar business models.That said consumer debt is growing at a rapid pace. According to credit reporter Experian, personal loan debt increased by 11.4% from Q2 2017 to the same quarter in 2018.Source: ExperianThe type of environment that would increase business even more for LendingClub would be one in which the economy is headed towards or already is in difficult times. For example, during the financial crisis many people turned to online lenders when banks cut down on risky lending. Of course, this was around the same time default rates were making investments in these loans much more risky. Additionally, the last few years that have provided revenue growth for LendingClub came at a time of historically low interest rates. Once rates normalize, LendingClub’s customers may be less inclined to take out loans or will at least incur significantly greater costs to do so. In fact, in its most recent Q3 call, LendingClub noted that they had tightened credit on their standard program by 17% to reduce portfolio charge-off rates and raised interest rates by between 49 and 114 basis points. In our opinion, it seems likely that LendingClub performed this credit tightening because the company started to notice problems with some of its loans.The company highlights the ability to leverage its scale and data. On this end, it mentions a recently announced partnership with Intuit (INTU) to integrate Turbo Tax to possibly add to its credit model to make the loan application process “easier”. An obvious concern here seems privacy. Do borrowers really want LendingClub to have their tax data? Spreading all of this data around even more to LendingClub or other various online lenders means borrowers have to also pay the price of privacy by giving up more data. It is almost comical how LendingClub highlights the ability for customers to upload their Turbo Tax files as a benefit to customers so they can get approved faster.LendingClub also continues to deal with the fallout from a host of litigation issues including class action lawsuits and Department of Justice investigations. Rosen Law Firm’s recent class action alleges that LendingClub falsely promised consumers they would receive loans with no hidden fees. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of purchasers of securities from February 2015 to April 2018. In April the Federal Trade Commission also charged LendingClub with misleading customers who were told that loans came with no hidden fees.LendingClub has already settled with the SEC and together with former CEO and CFO agreed to pay a combined $4.2 million. This was related to allegations that former CEO Laplanche and the company directed a private fund LendingClub worked with to purchase interests in loans that would otherwise remain unfunded. The company also recently agreed to pay $2million to resolve a Department of Justice civil case into its lending practices. In this case, dating back to 2010, LendingClub allegedly made misrepresentations to WesBank which originated over 200 loans that did not meet WesBank’s credit requirements.In its recent third quarter call, the company provided guidance stating that it expects a full year GAAP net loss between $129 million to $124 million. Too much focus from analysts and various investing news sources is on the company’s adjusted earnings figures which show positive earnings. The problem with this is that the company has been unable to contain expenses while increasing revenue and the legal issues are not going away. The balance sheet is in real trouble. Consider the accumulated deficit which now stands at $504 million compared to $389 million in December 2017.Focusing on loan originations which increased and are often celebrated in company statements is also a mistake. Consider the relationship pictured below between quarterly change in revenue and quarterly change in net income. The two measures are definitely not moving in tandem and there are little signs that this will change in the near future.Another way to consider the graph above is by looking at the numerical percentage change in various expenses compared to revenue. From the table below, notice that Sales have increased by a surprising 20% quarter over quarter. The obvious problem from the table is that costs have increase by 29%. Even if we remove the litigation expense, costs still increased by 23% and it would be overly optimistic to assume that litigation expense will be zero going forward.Source: 2018 Third Quarter 10QWe think the focus on adjusted earnings that bear little resemblance to actual results provides current shareholders an opportunity to sell before things get worse. The analyst estimates for dramatic upside in the shares are not aligned with the realities of the industry and prospects for real earnings growth at LendingClub. The disclosure from the bullish analyst report is also interesting: ""BTIG LLC expects to receive or intends to seek compensation for investment banking services in the next 3 months from: LendingClub Corporation (LC)."" For investors that take on short positions, we think there is a nice risk-reward relationship on the short side. The shares are easy to borrow and any bounce from the current level just provides a better entry point. LendingClub also has long dated put option available for purchase for investors that are not comfortable shorting. The in the money put options expiring in 2020 or even 2021 are not expensive given what we see as a high probability that it is only a matter of time before they would become profitable investments. We rate LendingClub a strong sell."
4198506,101584,2018-08-13T09:49:19-04:00,"I believe the market drop after soft guidance is going to be the first of a few as the market realizes the future is dim and investor expectations are overblown.The personal loan industry has been booming and LendingClub has been the beneficiary the past few years.The company has moved towards a healthier balance sheet and loan offerings with less risky loans for sale are being offered to borrowers. This will have mixed results.With a possible economic downturn coming, the banks such as Goldman Sachs have better resources to weather the storm as they don't have to rely on investors' capital.The company has an incredibly high valuation considering its short-term earnings expectations, and with possible upcoming headwinds, the company will need a miracle to post earnings that justify its valuation.","LendingClub (LC) came out with earnings yesterday and got absolutely hammered. Dropping over 10% of its market value over the course of the past few days, investors are worried. The company is the premier peer-to peer-lending platform that services personal loans and investors in those loans who can range from individuals to small banks. Despite exceeding expectations, the company issued soft guidance and investors sold off pretty intensely. Many who were invested at its higher valuation were probably looking too much at growth trends without looking at the larger picture. I believe this correction is legitimate and we might see the stock drop more.The company has performed incredibly well so far. As the industry of personal loan growth is coming in at an increasingly accelerated pace as can be seen below, the company has seen large demand growth from the borrower side, as well as growth in demand from the lender side. As the company makes a profit as a percentage of the loans originated and sold, higher volume means higher revenue and profits.(QZ-U.S. Total Outstanding Personal Loans)In addition to the increase in loans, as the graph on the entire industry shows, we have seen a sharp increase in the amount of subprime loans being originated. This could prove stressful to the personal loans industry.(QZ)Despite what the chart above would suggest, LendingClub investors have increased their appetite for high grade loans much more than the lower grade loans. As can be seen from the chart below, as compared to last year, the proportion of loans in the top tiers have gotten higher and the lower tiers have dropped to almost nothing. This is due to a large wave of defaults that caused fear for investors and has forced lending restrictions to get tighter.(LendingClub 10-Q)(LendingClub Website)A large reason why investors may be losing interest in these low quality loans may be that they aren’t proving to be more profitable. As the charts let us see, the increased risk isn’t necessarily driving higher returns. As one of the first rules of finance is that risk must be compensated, this model doesn’t drive investors towards the lowest tier loans.(LendingClub Website)This increase in the desire for the upper tier loans has both positives and negatives for the company. The positive is that investors are less likely to lose money and shouldn’t be as affected by a potential economic downturn. The negative is that borrowers in the upper tiers tend to have more options and are more likely to seek competitive pricing. With multiple other options, especially Marcus by Goldman Sachs (GS) which doesn’t charge fees, we may see the company start to shrink fees to retain customers.As talk of the credit cycle turning comes into play, we may start to see credit defaults rise. (Atlas)Along with the increased indebtedness of Americans and rising auto loan delinquencies that I discuss much more in depth in my Goldman Sachs article, we may see these trends start to move into the consumer loan industry as well.(QZ)As Societe Generale's Albert Edwards claimed there is a recession coming, we must look at the risks of what that would do to the company. With a possible economic downturn, default rates tend to soar and the amount of delinquencies rise. This starts with the least creditworthy and then gradually moves uphill. The fact that less investors are invested in the classes of debt that are first to go in a recession can protect them a little bit from the potential downfall. This also means that the loans the company takes on for the purpose of selling will tend to be higher tier and allows the company to maintain a healthy balance sheet.However, during that same economic downturn, if investors start seeing defaults, they could be scared to invest in loans which could hurt the business. This is also due to the fact that investors will have less capital to spare as the market starts to fall. The only saving grace is that as higher loan grades become more popular, this could be seen as a haven for investors. However, we are already seeing consumer credit starting to decrease.(Trading Economics)As I discuss in an article I wrote on the FinTech industry and how Marcus by Goldman Sachs will likely be the beneficiary of a recession, these higher grade borrowers can go to Marcus which charges lower rates and lower fees. This is possible because Marcus uses their own capital and gives it directly to consumers without the P2P lending aspect. For these investors, it is likely we see the big banks find themselves in a better position to service these loans.Given its high trading multiples, with no earnings, at a market cap of just over $1.55B, the company shows classic signs of a speculative investment. The company has revenues that reached $574.5M last year and are expected to hit $694.5M this year, according to Bloomberg. This would give the company a forward P/S ratio of 2.23x. I think this is a metric that the market is using as it helps get a gauge of the growth of the business and the future potential if earnings turn positive. After a quick look at their GAAP earnings, we see that the company hasn’t reached profitability. As can be seen from what I believe to be positive expectations, in two years the company is still only earning $16.45M on the year. This would give the company a forward P/E of 94.22.(Bloomberg Terminal)(Bloomberg Terminal)However, due to the reasons I mentioned above, the amount of pressure the company will face from not only competitors, but from the demand curves of both borrowers and investors if the market turns will be immense. In addition, as the company maintains a large exposure to their actual loans, the souring of loans would put a damper on their earnings.The main reason for this valuation is because investors are putting too much weight on what the company refers to as “contribution” in their non-GAAP reporting. This is a term the company uses to basically write off expenses that aren’t directly driving revenue. They consider all costs not within marketing and sales and loan origination to be “contribution” and use the “contribution margin” of 48.3% to try to shade a rosy picture of the potential the company has for future earnings.(LendingClub 10-Q)How they get to contribution is shown below. I think that while this information may be useful for management decisions, putting to much weight on it may mislead investors.(LendingClub 10-Q)Even if we take this into account, however, as if the costs didn't exist, the company is still trading at nearly 16x Adjusted EBITDA with the highest margin percentage they have ever recorded. More-so, the company has not proven that they will be able to reduce their non-direct costs in any measurable way. While I do think this is relevant and does prove the theoretical potential, with all the negative trends that could be headwinds for the business in coming years, I feel the stock has too much risk to earn this high of a valuation. Despite the theoretical possibility for large long-term growth, trading at 16x a highly favorably adjusted EBITDA seems out of touch with reality. Even if hard times weren't such a risk, I would struggle to argue that this isn't an overly optimistic valuation.I suggest that people stay away from the stock. I believe the company can't justify its valuation even in the best of times and it will only get worse as the credit cycle shifts. I believe that the company has huge downside risks from the economic landscape and the competitive landscape and investment should be avoided."

The news that LendingClub (LC) is pursuing a 1-for-5 reverse split followed a 10% gain during the trading day. Investors shouldn't necessarily stray away from the fintech on this news due to the perplexing value in the stock. Image Source: LendingClub website The history of reverse splits is very negative, though actual research reports are very lacking. In general, stocks usually don't trade at such low prices warranting a reverse split without the related company having a problematic past and a questionable future.For investors that don't understand a reverse stock split, Investopedia provides this general definition. In addition, the website provides a lot of additional explanations and examples for investors wishing to dig into the subject in further detail.Source: InvestopediaThe key takeaway from Investopedia is that a reverse stock split often signals a company in distress and a company looking to avoid being delisted from a major stock exchange. In a few cases, the stock is just stuck below $5 and a split helps improve the relevance of the stock and attractiveness of the price.Several general studies found searching the Internet appear to confirm the theory that reverse stock splits are negative. One firm completed a study on microcaps from 2008 through 2016 that concluded the general reverse split lost money while a few saw big rallies. The data concluded that the average reverse split was down over 5% after just 50 trading days.Source: JBMarwoodAlso, Cabot Wealth references several studies where stocks involved in reverse stock splits underperformed the market by a large margin. The main business school study showed that after three years, the stocks averaged underperforming the benchmark S&P 500 index by a whopping 54%.Just as importantly, Cabot Wealth referenced some reverse splits that worked such as E*Trade Financial (ETFC). According to the stock split database, E*Trade had a reverse split back on June 2, 2010 in the amount of 1-for-10 shares.Data by YChartsThe picture is rather mixed, but over time, the stock has outperformed the S&P 500 since the reverse split. At the peak in 2018, E*Trade had provided a substantial gain that topped 350% since the reverse split.The key here is that several random studies seem to confirm that the general reverse split is bad, but a few stocks do turn out to provide solid returns for shareholders.The market has seen several prominent reverse splits this year. Ensco (ESV), Blue Apron (APRN) and Rite Aid (RAD) have all completed reverse splits this year to no success. All three stocks are down substantially in the last three years with only Ensco approaching any semblance of a flat price over the last few years.Data by YChartsThe key here is that LendingClub is in a far different position. The stock appears to fall into the category of a company looking to regain relevance rather than one trying to meet listing requirements.The fintech plans to complete the 1-for-5 reverse split on July 5 with the stock trading split adjusted on July 8. The stock has been stuck below $5 going on a couple of years. In addition, LendingClub has struggled to regain footing ever since the founding CEO scandal back in May 2016 undercut the stock.Ensco and Rite Aid are highly indebted companies competing in difficult sectors with questionable paths to profits. Blue Apron has no logical path to profits.LendingClub is a very different breed in this equation. Outside of the blip from the founding CEO scandal, the fintech has generated substantial revenue growth. The company is on a path for revenues approaching $800 million this year.Data by YChartsLendingClub even sets itself apart with net cash in the $664 million range. Basically, the company with solid growth and a strong balance sheet doesn't belong in the reverse split bargain bin.The company even generates solid EBITDA margins having topped 13% in the last four quarters.Source: LendingClub Q1'19 presentation The bigger issue appears to be the inability of the current management team to sell the market on the attractive stock price. LendingClub only trades at an EV/S multiple of 1x. Rarely does a company with revenue growing in the double-digit range trade at such a low multiple.The key investor takeaway is that LendingClub shouldn't be a reverse stock split candidate based on their financials. Any stock weakness from this move should actually provide an additional buying opportunity. The stock is likely to follow the path of E*Trade over any of the other reverse split examples."
4198275,22148,2018-08-12T13:34:30-04:00,"LendingClub reports record quarterly numbers highlighting a successful turnaround from the corporate scandal over two years ago.
        Record originations will boost revenues over the next year.
        The EV/S multiple of 1x won't last much longer on a 20% grower.","By all measures, LendingClub (LC) reported an impressive quarter. The stock again tanked as the market got lost in one-time expenses and charges in a similar manner to my previous research from a couple of months ago. The online lending platform remains one of the best values in the market after this dip back below $4. Image Source: LendingTree website In past quarters, the market didn't like that LendingClub wasn't generating loan origination growth. Most of the reasons were due to prudent risk management as the company had the applications to boost originations. Even in Q2, the fintech boosted loan originations by 31% over last year to $2.8 billion though the actual applications surged 50% over last year levels. The company was still constraining growth by restricting loan approvals. Source: LendingClub Q2'18 presentation A big part of the origination boost went to LendingClub's inventory for future structured transactions. After several recent successful deals, the market shouldn't find any concerns in this number rising from $214 million in Q1 to $506 million in the last quarter. LendingClub ended the quarter with a cash balance of $584 million that includes $92 million held for regulatory risk requirements. Either way, the company isn't stepping into a risky financial position by taking on these loans for a short period. Their net cash and loan position less the $249 million in debt financing still amounts to a cash and investment position of roughly $850 million. So without any meaningful risks here, the market should be celebrating the record revenues of $177.0 million and the EPS beat. Not to mention, the EBITDA margin surged to 14.5%, up from only 10.1% in the prior quarter. Another big benefit of the resurgence in loan originations is that the servicing portfolio got a big boost. The outstanding loan balance grew to a record $12.6 billion. This 13% increase from last Q2 levels provides a revenue boost over the next year as LendingClub collects fees for servicing the loans on higher balances compared to last year levels. Source: LendingClub Q2'18 presentation One of my favorite charts to highlight a market disconnect with the valuation of a stock is to look at trailing revenues versus the stock price. Despite LendingClub surviving the corporate scandal in 2016 and returning to revenue growth last year, the stock is back at the lows. The revenue impact from the scandal is only blip on the five-year picture now. The original stock dip after the IPO in 2015 was logical because the valuation was rather expensive. Now though, the fintech is valued at the opposite spectrum suggesting the company doesn't have a future despite the recent trend of 20% growth for over a year now. Once one balances the $700 million revenue runrate with the $850 million in cash and net loan balances, the market cap of $1.56 billion is highly misplaced. The fintech is now running at a $100 million EBITDA rate with an EV of only $800 million while growing at over 20%. Very few larger disconnects exist in the market. The key investor takeaway is that the market typically doesn't overlook record numbers and a cheap valuation forever. Some of the short-term charges and impairments reported in the quarter are causing the market to lose focus on the growth in the core business."
4223264,103480,2018-11-19T12:19:55-05:00,"LendingClub posted yet another solid quarter in Q3, with both top and bottom line results exceeding Wall Street's estimates.The quarter was highlighted by record-setting originations growth, plus a boost in fee margins charged on loans.Interestingly, the gradual upward creep of interest rates has only strengthened LendingClub's pool of loan applicants, not weakened it.The company also boosted its EBITDA guidance for the current year.","Investors are barely noticing it, but LendingClub (LC) continues to pump through another record-setting quarter as the P2P lending platform shores up its core business and boosts its profit targets for the year. Volatility has largely left LendingClub stock; the company has traded in the $3-4 range for the better part of this year as investors have moved on to more exciting names, but in my view, LendingClub is well-positioned for a near-term rebound.Last year contained lots of noise that distracted Wall Street from LendingClub's core business. Now, with the Renaud Laplanche ousting firmly in the rearview mirror, we can focus on the fundamentals and primarily on LendingClub's soaring originations growth. Shares are down since last week's earnings release, but the combination of better-than-expected Q3 performance, a raised guidance outlook, and a pullback in stock price makes for a great entry point in LendingClub.LC data by YChartsOn the back of LendingClub's strong Q3 report, the company also inched up its guidance for FY18. The forecast now calls for $693 million in revenue and $91.5 million in EBITDA at the midpoint of management's ranges:Figure 1. LendingClub revised guidanceSource: LendingClub investor relationsThis new guidance range represents a tighter spread on revenues (previous guidance called for $680-$705 million in revenues, with the midpoint essentially the same; but previous EBITDA guidance called for only $75-$90 million).LendingClub's market cap now sits at just $1.51 billion. If we net off the $551 million of cash and restricted cash on its balance sheet, the company has an enterprise value of just $960 million. That represents a bargain-basement valuation multiple of just 10.5x EV/FY18 EBITDA. Against next year's consensus revenue of $797 million (per Yahoo Finance), LendingClub also trades at a forward revenue multiple of just 1.22x EV/FY19 revenues. Either way you slice it, LendingClub trades at a bare-bones valuation for a company that is boosting profitability amid climbing loan originations.While it's understandable that investors have lost confidence in LendingClub after originations turned negative in FY17 and it was revealed that LendingClub was quietly buying up its own loans to absorb excess originations, the company's fundamental picture has greatly improved under new CEO Scott Sanborn, as has the willingness of institutional investors to buy up its loans.In my view, LendingClub stock is low enough to take a chance on. It's easy to forget that LendingClub is the original P2P lending platform, and many consider it to be one of the first fintech companies overall. Paying a ~10x EBITDA multiple for such a category-defining business that is still expected to grow its top line in the mid-teens next year isn't a daunting proposition at all.Apart from strength in originations, LendingClub has also put a spotlight on profit growth under Sanborn. In its investor day earlier this year, LendingClub gave Wall Street internal targets on cost control and EBITDA margins, all of which it has surpassed in the year-to-date:Figure 2. LendingClub margin hurdlesSource: LendingClub investor relationsPartially driving this margin improvement is a boost in LendingClub's loan servicing fees. A good chunk of LendingClub's revenues comes from its loan servicing portfolio, which as of the end of Q3 hit over $13.1 billion, or +15% y/y. At the same time, LendingClub was able to push through a fee hike, which brought its fee percentage to 29bps, up 6bps from 23bps in 3Q17:Figure 3. LendingClub servicing fee increasesSource: LendingClub investor relationsTom Casey, LendingClub's CFO, also made some useful quantitative commentary on the Q3 earnings call on the topic of expense control:This focus on cost drivers has led to tremendous 34% y/y growth in adjusted EBITDA to $28.1 million in the quarter, representing a 160bps improvement in EBITDA margins to 15.2%, up from 13.6% in the year-ago quarter:Figure 4. LendingClub Adjusted EBITDA walkdownSource: LendingClub investor relationsWith an improved EBITDA guidance range for this year and all signs pointing to double-digit EBITDA growth in FY19 as well, it's unclear why LendingClub trades at such a low multiple of EBITDA. It's worth noting as well that LendingClub's pro forma EPS of $0.03 this quarter edged out over Wall Street's expectations of $0.02.Of course, the major highlight coming out of Q3 was yet another record-breaking quarter for loan originations. There are a couple of interesting trends to highlight here, but let's look first at the total originations volume in the quarter, which rose 18% y/y to $2.9 billion:Figure 5. LendingClub originations growth and funding mixSource: LendingClub investor relationsNotice here that institutional investors pumped in 19% of this quarter's funding mix, rising 33% y/y to $564 million. A little more than a year ago, LendingClub was having so much trouble lining up investors for its notes that it had to quietly absorb them through third-party vehicles. Now, amid flattening equity markets, it seems institutional investors are raring to take on LendingClub's high-yielding notes.Perhaps the increased appeal of LendingClub notes had something to do with the company's pledge to improve credit quality, after the vintages of 2015-2016 produced sour returns (as an investor in Notes of those vintages, I've experienced those charge-offs firsthand). Per CEO Scott Sanborn's comments on the earnings call:It's also encouraging that despite a rising rate environment - in which LendingClub followed suit and raised its own rates - the company is still growing its loan applications and originations.Record originations this quarter also led to record revenues of $184.6 million, up 20% y/y and beating Wall Street's expectations of $182.0 million (+18% y/y) by a two-point margin. Combined with the expense reduction efforts outlined in the prior section, LendingClub's top-line originations growth makes for a compelling fundamental story.In my view, LendingClub is looking a lot healthier than ever before. Investors should make a clean break from the past and focus on LendingClub's future - which, with the promise of strong double-digit originations growth and EBITDA margin optimization, looks extremely bright. A hike in servicing and origination fees is being supported by higher interest rates and is also enormously accretive to LendingClub's revenue growth. LendingClub's severe valuation discount might have been warranted in the thick of 2016, when the company's business model and ethics were in question - but now, there's little doubt that institutional investors are on board and supplying financing for its Notes.Stay long on this stock as it attempts to claw back lost ground."
4189485,82056,2018-07-24T12:00:59-04:00,Lending Club has been going down in price since 2015.Lending Club has serious government compliance issues.At 1/5th its 2015 price is Lending Club a good turnaround candidate?,"Lending Club (LC) is what's called a ""Financial Tech"" stock which basically means a company that uses the internet to conduct financial business. They are mostly companies that have gone public over the last 5 to 10 years and typically use a lot of software development to give them advantages over competitors. Much of the software is used for data analytics theoretically giving them an advantage in choosing which customers to pursue, which products to offer and how to make the resulting transactions profitable.What LC does is loan money to individuals and small companies to use for bill consolidation (mostly credit cards) or perhaps to fund a business expansion. Loans are typically in the $5,000 to $40,000 range. In LC's case they provide a front-end marketing service for investors (banks provide 48% of funding) that fund the loans. LC makes money on interest and transaction fees.The way it works is you apply online. For example, if you have $30,000 CC debt and good credit you can get a 3-year payoff at about 6% and a 5 year at about 7%. That is a big improvement over a typical rate of 17.5% on purchases and an amazing 23.5% on cash advances. So you take out the $30,000 loan, pay off your credit cards and save thousands in interest while you are at it. In addition, your CC is now zero and you can start using it again.That is a compelling argument.They came to market via an IPO late in 2014 and were an immediate hit rising over 50% their first day. They were immediately valued at over $9 billion. Today they are at less than $2 billion, a drop of almost 80%.If we look at my favorite ""Jaws"" charts we see they are indeed far behind in the price column. That, of course, does not mean they are undervalued. The low value could be correct or even high.Here is my ""jaws"" chart 1 comparing LC to an ETF called ""Global -x Fin Tech ETF"" (FINX). In fact, FINX owns 126,000 shares of LC.Yep, LC looks bad when compared to peers.Then for ""Jaws"" chart 2 we compare LC to the S&P 500 Index we get this:No surprise there either. LC has not participated in the market's move up.And finally here is LC's chart since the IPO. Talk about ugly.So here is the good news and the bad news.1. They had a good Q1 with most metrics beating Q1 2017 by a large margin including Earnings, Contributions Margin and EBITA margin. See slides here.2. The creditworthiness of their borrowers, as planned, is improving. For 2018 Q1 credit classes A and B (the two highest rated) are up to 54% of loans form 41% a year ago. This may explain why banks are increasingly providing funds, usually at lower rates than other sources. Banks now represent 48% of their borrowings.3. Rising interest rates should be a plus for the business. Not only will margins go up (hopefully) but from a marketing standpoint they can argue that consolidating your CC debt now will keep you from paying higher rates next year and the year after.4. Insider buying over the last year was 11 times insider selling.1. They have never made a profit. Does this mean their model is suspect?2. They settled a class action lawsuit late last year for $125 million. There is at least one more class action to deal with.3. They are under investigation by three federal agencies: the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), the DOJ (Dept. of Justice) and the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) for various claims of misleading both investors and customers.From the 2017 10K:These kinds of government actions can last for years as shown by this chart of Bank America when it was being fined more than $50 billion between 2004 and 2017. BAC's price struggled for more than 8 very long years before it consistently exceeded $15. That gives me great pause.For more details on these problems see the 10K pages 141-144 here.Note from the previous chart that LC has been between $4 and $6 for about 2 years. That is a long way from 8 years.Well, for my personal taste, the bad news overwhelms the good news. However, it is an intriguing stock and if it falls under $4 I would look at it again. And if it falls under $3 again like it did for 10 straight days in April I would be very interested. Another way to invest would be to buy the 2020 LEAP $4.50 options at about $1. If they turn it around over the next 18 months you could make a lot of money.Interestingly Morgan Stanley just upgraded Fintech to ""Attractive"" (see here) but put LC at ""Equal Weight.""If you found this article to be of value, please scroll up and click the ""Follow"" button next to my name.

4177952,22148,2018-05-29T20:14:12-04:00,LendingClub continues to fail to match up record revenues with analyst estimates.The fintech is controlling origination growth to improve investor yields to the detriment of the stock.The stock is a no brainer trading at an EV/S multiple of 1x.,"Anybody looking at the relative results of LendingClub (LC) would pay substantially more for the fintech trading at only $3. The market, though, is highly focused on momentum metrics providing the opportunity for a major catalyst for the stock once the company gets the guidance accurate.Source: LendingClub Q1'18 presentationMy recommendation to all investors is to pay attention to the actual results and compare that to the value of the stock. How the stock trades based on whether the company meets expectations is something to consider, but the scenario typically provides more opportunity than actual risk.The following table highlights the prime issue with why LendingClub trades at an all-time low and why investors should absolutely snap up shares. The online lending marketplace has now generated consistent quarterly growth around 20%, yet the constant misses keep the stock depressed.Source: SeekingAlpha earnings tabThe market in essence sees the stock as having limited value because this management team can't hit analyst targets based on internal forecasts, despite surpassing the midpoint of guidance set at $145-155 million. The Q1 revenue surged 22% over last year, but the market doesn't like that loan originations dipped sequentially.It even doesn't apparently matter that the Q2 revenue guidance of $167.0 million at the midpoint amounts to record revenue of around $10.5 million above the Q4 record of $156.5 million. A similar beat of the midpoint guidance places the actual revenue closer to $169.0 million.The market is rightfully concerned that LendingClub might again miss analyst target, down to only $168 million now. The logical market would shift forward to Q3 revenue target at $184 million that provides a substantial boost to the previous record.LC Revenue Estimates for Current Quarter data by YChartsLendingClub missing estimates should cause the stock to not trade at massive premiums, but the stock now trades at an EV/S multiple of about 1x. An incredibly low valuation multiple for a new generation company producing 20% growth.The biggest hangup are the origination numbers where LendingClub hit record levels at $2.44 billion back in Q3. The company can generate more revenue from servicing fees and such, but the platform ultimately needs more loans to build the size and scope of the fintech.The quarterly materials including analyst questions on the earnings conference call oddly failed to mention expectations surrounding loan originations in Q2 and the full year. Some guidance around record levels here would've probably boosted the stock far above the levels before the FTC complaint.LendingClub saw applications in the quarter surge 36% YoY to 2.8 million. The number was similar to the growth last quarter. Whether good or bad, LendingClub only approved an 18% YoY growth in loan origination volumes to $2.31 billion.A big key is that with rising rates and credit quality concerns, the online lending platform has moved up the loan grades with a substantial increase in the higher grades of A and B to 51% of loans. The declines in the lower grade levels have held back origination volumes that might actually boost the stock due to higher growth rates.Source: LendingClub loan statisticsLendingClub naturally argues that this improves the yields for loan investors, but the move disappoints shareholders wanting a more open platform that doesn't control originations where investors exist with the ability to choose whether to take the risk.The key investor takeaway is that LendingClub remains a fintech with 20% revenue growth, improving margins and a market cap of only $1.4 billion. Based on about $750 million of cash and loans held for sale, the stock has a meager enterprise value of $650 million. The stock remains an incredible bargain around $3.35."
4172158,103480,2018-05-10T09:00:01-04:00,"LendingClub's stock soared more than 20% after reporting Q1 earnings, despite a slight miss to analysts' top-line estimates.Originations growth slowed down in the quarter to 18% y/y, sequentially down from 23% y/y growth in Q4.As originations is the primary driver for the business, the slowdown is concerning, especially in a rising rate environment.LendingClub's rally is more likely due to short covering than the beginnings of a sustained recovery.","After being tossed into the dumpster quarter after quarter, LendingClub (LC), the Internet's largest online lending marketplace, finally has a positive earnings quarter to show to investors. Cheered primarily by the company's cost-down efforts and a bottom line that beat analysts' expectations, investors bid up LendingClub shares by about 20% after its earnings release:LC data by YChartsSuch a strong reaction to LendingClub hasn't happened in years. The company is still down 20% year to date, and more than 40% in the last twelve months. LendingClub has struggled to find its footing ever since the ouster of its CEO, Renaud Laplanche, after controversy over the parking of LendingClub notes in a related third-party firm. More recently, in the wake of Wells Fargo's (WFC) fake-account scandal, the FTC has also charged LendingClub with charging improper fees to borrowers, sending the stock to new all-time lows of $2.57.But with this earnings quarter - the first time in a long time that LendingClub has rallied to earnings news (in Q4, LendingClub dropped 9% after missing revenue estimates; the quarter before that, it tanked 17% for doing the same). What's interesting is that even in this quarter, LendingClub continued a three-quarter streak of missing analysts' revenue expectations. Originations, the primary fuel for revenue growth, also saw weakness in the quarter. Especially in a quarter where investors are being extremely picky on earnings and sending even earnings winners down, LendingClub's post-earnings rally looks a bit suspect. Is it the true beginnings of a recovery, or is it short covering?Last quarter, I had believed the company was close to finding a bottom. It seems the bottom was found in April after the FTC news, and with this quarter, LendingClub has dug itself out of its hole extremely quickly. With this quarter more of a mixed quarter than a beat, I don't think there's much opportunity left in LendingClub shares - even if the stock is still cheap at about 2x forward revenues.The instability of the debt markets continues to be a big question mark for LendingClub. 10-year U.S. Treasury yields keep hovering closely to the psychologically significant 3% mark, and the influx of interest rate-related headline news has drummed into the heads of most Americans that now is not a great time to take on more debt. The soft originations growth seen in this quarter may not be just a fluke, but the beginnings of a weakening trend.All in all, LendingClub looks particularly risky after a 20% rally. Many investors will leap at the opportunity to exit a losing position. A slight improvement in profit margins and better-than-expected losses are far from what's necessary to save this company, and until we get more robust data on originations and revenue growth, LendingClub is a clear stock to avoid.Here's a look at LendingClub's summary results for the quarter:Source: LendingClub investor relationsTotal revenues grew just 22% y/y to $151.7 million. This is better than the 20% growth that LendingClub saw in Q4, but still the company was unable to meet investors' expectations of $152.8 million (+23% y/y) in the quarter.If you note LendingClub's revenue breakdown, you'll notice that the company's growth was primarily driven by a completely new source of revenues - gains on sale of loans. LendingClub made the decision last year to invest a small amount of its capital in its own loans, and the benefits of buying and selling notes are evident in this quarter's results. Note, however, that these gains could easily swing to losses, as principal trading is an inherently volatile business even for the largest of banks.Source: LendingClub investor relationsThe worse news, however, was clearly originations growth. At least revenue growth saw a slight acceleration over Q4's results. Originations, on the other hand, saw a sharp deceleration. Given that originations this quarter have spillover effects into the future - after all, LendingClub derives a lot of revenues from servicing fees on its loan portfolio - the softness in originations is an even more important metric to watch than revenues.The company originated $2.31 billion in loans this quarter, up 18% y/y. That's not bad, but it's a steep deceleration from the 23% y/y originations growth LendingClub saw in Q4. The quarter before that, originations growth was 24% y/y. This is the first time since 2Q17 that LendingClub's originations growth has dipped below 20% - yet this is also the only quarter that LendingClub rallied on earnings news.Part of the reason why LendingClub's originations are down is strategic. The company, responding to criticism that notes are highly risky instruments that have sank in performance over recent years (as an investor in LendingClub notes, I can personally attest to the degradation of my own portfolio), has decided to cut back on the lower-rated F and G notes and originate more high-quality A and B notes. Observers have noted that this will become a limiting factor on originations growth. This quarter, originations of A and B grade notes rose 97% y/y and 38% y/y, respectively (combined making up about half of the quarter's originations), while F and G notes fell 57% and 75% y/y, respectively.Should this trend in originations mix continue to put up headwinds, LendingClub's financials are at risk. I can't stand by the belief that originations growth is not important to the long-term health of this company; thus I believe this quarter's earnings reaction is highly questionable.Of course, what investors were primarily cheering was the bottom line. Pro forma EPS of $0.01 beat analyst consensus of -$0.01, but really, it's the adjusted EBITDA that has investors talking. That metric is up to $15.3 million, up from a near-zero $0.2 million in the prior year.I'll admit that this is an impressive feat. Analysts are cheering LendingClub's more controlled marketing expenses, and its product development/technology costs have also shrunk as a percentage of revenues. On the operations side, LendingClub also announced alongside last quarter's earnings that it would bring a third-party servicing firm to help service LendingClub's Notes. Though this is dilutive to revenues, the company has stated that the outsourcing of some of the servicing work will be accretive to EBITDA margins, an assertion that shows clearly in this quarter's EBITDA upside.Despite what the company believed to be a strong quarter, however, LendingClub's management has held its guidance to $680-705 million in net revenues and $75-90 million in adjusted EBITDA.There's no doubt that after LendingClub's spectacular fall since 2016, the stock is one of the cheapest plays in fintech. Its current market cap of $1.38 billion is much lower than the private valuations of many private fintech unicorns. If we net off the $405 million of cash LendingClub has on its balance sheet, its enterprise value is just $975 million.Against LendingClub's midpoint guidance ranges, the company trades at 1.41x EV/FY18 revenue multiple and an 11.8x EV/FY18 EBITDA multiple. Cheaper valuations in the technology sector can't be found elsewhere. Yet I do think there's a substantial amount of risk underlying this apparent value stock. With credit markets tightening (as shown in LendingClub's deceleration in originations growth) and an unclear outcome from the FTC action pending, LendingClub has a lot more hurdles to cross before it can find itself in a true recovery. Be on the lookout for huge selloffs to enter a small position in this stock, but remain extremely cautious on this name."
4151649,22148,2018-02-28T09:34:25-05:00,LendingClub reported record revenues for Q4.The fintech is generating solid EBITDA margins while maintaining a strong balance sheet.The stock trades at depressed multiples that completely ignore the generally accepted growth path.,"After the close on Tuesday, LendingClub (LC) made the typical move following earnings. The fintech reported some impressive numbers on face value, but the company underperformed lofty expectations, leaving the stock trading at all-time lows and offering another opportunity to make an investment. The good news is that LendingClub generated record revenues. The bad news is that the fintech missed revenue targets by $1.5 million after missing Q3 estimates by $3.5 million. Source: LendingClub Q4'17 presentation After ramping up loan originations in Q3, the online lending marketplace disappointed with flat sequential numbers. The shift to again improve credit quality continues to limit origination growth. LendingClub completed a third consecutive quarter of 20% YoY revenue growth. And despite the misses, the company improved the bottom line with quarterly adjusted EBITDA numbers around $20 million. The guidance was even decent and inline with recent results. The fintech basically expects 2018 revenues growing 20% to the range of $680 million to $705 million. Adjusted EBITDA of up to $90 million again suggests the company has financials under control whether or not revenue targets are hit. Despite all these positives, the stock trades at all-time lows that even eclipsed the lows following the resignation of the founding CEO back in May 2016. The stock hit a low of $3.44 about two years ago and recently hit a similar level at the end of 2017. Since stock price doesn't really tell the story on value, investors need to take a different view. The question is how much would one pay for a 20% grower. A EV/S multiple of 3 to 4 or maybe 15x forward EV/EBITDA estimates is possible. The reality is that the stock trades at a forward EV/S multiple of somewhere around 1x the analyst revenue target of $684 million for 2018. The following chart shows the P/S ratio down below 2. This calculation doesn't factor in the roughly $700 million in cash and loans held for sale on the balance sheet. As far as EBITDA, BTIG places a $144 million target for 2019. The stock trades at a '19 EV/EBITDA multiple of 4.6x. The main point is that LendingClub trades at levels suggesting the company might go out of business similar to the fears back in May 2016, yet the company is generating solid revenue growth and strong EBITDA margins.Meeting the goals would easily allow the stock to reach the $7 price target. Very noteworthy is that BTIG only forecasts 2018 revenues of $676 million. The weak Q1 guide has Mark Palmer expecting disappointing top line results for the year, yet the analyst still sees the stock exceptionally cheap. His 2019 revenue estimate of $815 million offers nearly 21% growth. Again all of the expectations are for continued record numbers. The key investor takeaway is that the market remains in an all or nothing phase with this stock. Despite consistent growth outside of the death spiral caused by the ex-CEO scandal, the stock now trades as if the fintech is on the verge of going out of business. The reality is that LendingClub has a strong balance sheet and the competitive threats are overblown in the massive personal loans marketplace. The stock is too cheap to pass up at all-time lows."
4163073,103480,2018-04-15T10:46:33-04:00,"LendingClub has continued a downward slide in recent months and hasn't been able to stage a meaningful rally above the low $3s.S&P Global's warnings that the leveraged loan markets have reached a mature stage may also reduce investor demand for risky consumer credit.Big banks, which were the first to report Q1 earnings, also showed an uptick in credit card charge-offs, further heightening the consumer credit risk profile.Competition in consumer lending has also intensified, with even Goldman Sachs' Marcus brand going live.","LendingClub (LC) has continued to have a hard time in regaining favor in investors' eyes. After a huge decline post-Q4 earnings, in which LendingClub broadly missed analysts' estimates, the March and April selloffs of tech stocks have hit LendingClub especially hard. Shares have moved up from the all-time lows they hit in late February, but trading hasn't been too enthusiastic either, with LendingClub down 20% year-to-date and 40% over the last 12 months.LC data by YChartsI had initially thought post-Q4 that it couldn't get much worse for LendingClub. Expectations were then (and remain) so muted that the company couldn't possibly disappoint investors any more than it had already been doing - the stock was so heavily pummeled that it seemed due for recovery.The recent data and market commentary concerning the health of the credit markets and high-yield debt in general, however, give that thesis pause. Can LendingClub continue to achieve growth in originations amid such shaky market conditions? Recall that LendingClub's originations growth and revenue growth (and thus, its bottom line) are very closely linked. When originations fall, as they did in 4Q16 and 1Q17 (as shown in the chart below), so too does revenue and net income. Conversely, revenue spikes when originations grow.Figure 1. LendingClub Q4 originations dataSource: LendingClub investor relationsThere's a minefield of potential risks to originations growth as LendingClub approaches its Q1 reporting data in mid-May. In the face of such bearish data, investors are cautioned to trim their holdings now before the stock takes another post-earnings dive.S&P Global Ratings, the credit ratings agency that's also widely known for its ownership of the S&P 500 index, recently warned investors that the years-long bullish trend in the credit markets is getting long in the tooth. According to S&P, conditions in the leveraged loan markets can ""turn sharply, particularly given global trade tensions and rising interest rates."" In short, any number of factors this year could upend high-yield debt. Interest rates rising, while a positive for floating-rate loans (which make up the majority of leveraged lending), has the potential to cause a spike in defaults.What does this have to do with LendingClub, which makes personal loans and not leveraged loans to enterprises?I've previously argued that LendingClub's growth is a function of the available supply of capital that it attracts. For the past several years, LendingClub's loan growth has essentially been constrained by the willingness of investors to fund its loans, especially in the wake of the 2016 scandal that caused investors to lose trust in LendingClub's credit quality and resulted in the ouster of founder and CEO Renaud Laplanche.To mitigate this, LendingClub has begun investing some of its own balance sheet into its loan originations. These are minor capital commitments, but they serve to restore investor confidence that LendingClub isn't simply originating as many loans as possible to bump up origination fees, without regard to credit quality. With banks and institutional investors making up more than 50% of LendingClub's funding mix, as per its most recent earnings deck, it's highly critical for the company to continue attracting their capital.If leveraged loan markets turn south, investors are likely to back off the high-yield asset class as a whole. Unsecured consumer credit, which is LendingClub's domain, is essentially an extension of high-yield debt, no matter how much LendingClub stresses its diversified nature, and arguably, unsecured loans to indebted consumers for credit card consolidation or home improvements are far more risky than leveraged loans to companies.Adding fuel to the notion that credit markets might be turning south, last week, three of Big Four banks reported earnings. While all three of them beat earnings, the financial sector was the worse-performing sector on their report date (April 13), with Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) dropping 1.5%, 2.5%, and 3%, respectively. While these are large and diversified institutions with dozens of lines of business, there was one startling metric that is particularly relevant to LendingClub: a worsening of net charge-offs (NCOs) in each of these banks' credit card departments.Wells Fargo posted the strongest performance of the three. Net charge-offs were essentially flat, with the losses rising only 3bps to 3.69%:Figure 2. Wells Fargo card net charge-offsSource: Wells Fargo investor relationsCitigroup, on the other hand, saw its charge-off rates rise 15bps to 3.83%, up from 3.68% in 1Q17 and up 33bps from 4Q17. Though 15bps might seem like a small number, this is a 4.1% y/y rise and in an average card loan portfolio of $159.2 billion is actually a fairly large number:Figure 3. Citigroup card net charge-offsSource: Citigroup investor relationsDitto for JPMorgan Chase, where card NCOs rose 38bps (13% y/y) to 3.32%.Figure 4. JPMorgan Chase card net charge-offsSource: JPMorgan Chase investor relationsYou might again be thinking: what do bank earnings have to do with LendingClub? LendingClub obviously doesn't offer any credit cards or hold card receivables on its balance sheet.LendingClub's loans, however, are very similar to credit cards in that they are unsecured consumer debts. As card charge-offs rise for banks, it's expected that LendingClub defaults will as well. Growing risks in consumer credit will not only scare away LendingClub's institutional funders, but may also impact the company's balance sheet, which as previously mentioned has begun holding a nominal portion of its Notes.Then there's the demand side as well, or LendingClub's potential borrower base. With the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rising all year and currently at 2.825%, at new highs since 2014, borrowers' loan appetite is almost guaranteed to dwindle:Figure 2. 10-year UST yieldsSource: CNBCAdd this to the fact that there's never been more competition in the personal lending space. Prosper, LendingClub's primary online competitor, is still private but reports its results to the SEC as it's a regulated company.Prosper achieved $2.88 billion in originations in FY17, up 32% y/y. This is still a fraction of the $8.99 billion that LendingClub originated in FY17, but Prosper is catching up at a much faster growth rate - and its reputation, unblemished by the 2016 fallout, is arguably much better than LendingClub's.Then there's Marcus by Goldman Sachs (GS), which rapidly rolled out a fully functional online banking and loans platform and has earned a 5/5 rating from popular consumer credit site NerdWallet. We don't know how much share Goldman Sachs has taken to date in originations (we might get some clues this week when Goldman reports earnings), but there's no doubt that Marcus puts additional competitive pressure on LendingClub.Right now, there's no shortage of issues plaguing LendingClub, and the recent selloffs are fully justified. On top of missing earnings in its most recent quarter and delivering disappointing guidance, tightening conditions in the credit markets and the rapid rise of new online lending players are highly likely to cause negative impact to LendingClub's originations, its largest driver of growth.Despite the recent correction in LendingClub shares, the company remains appropriately valued against its elevated risk profile. I'd stay on the sidelines for this one."
4149335,103480,2018-02-22T08:37:37-05:00,"LendingClub stock tanked sharply after missing Q4 earnings, interrupting the stock's recovery since early February.Both revenues and earnings missed analyst expectations, but only by a hair.Originations grew 23% y/y in the quarter, after being roughly flat for the full year.The company guided below Wall Street's expectations for Q1, but maintained its full-year outlook in-line with consensus. The latter is probably the more important guide to watch.With the recent buying activity after a pummeling, LendingClub looks like it's finding a bottom and is trading cheaply under 2x forward revenues.","I've had my frustrations with LendingClub (NASDAQ: LC) for a long time - as I noted in a prior article, I had a portion of my portfolio in LendingClub Notes that have returned 9-% this year due to excessive charge-offs - but after catching up on the company's Q4 earnings, I continue to believe that equity investors will have better luck than Note investors in the coming year. Put another way, I still believe LendingClub is finding a bottom in the high $3s and is well positioned to snap back strong. Bulls have been punished severely on this name with little respite (hence the title of this article), with shares falling -10% YTD (and -34% in the past twelve months), but given how amplified LendingClub's pummeling has been, investors buying at this bottom could be in for a nice rebound.LC data by YChartsThere are a couple of business narratives to support a more bullish outlook for LendingClub, putting aside the raw numbers and guidance for a moment. The company has committed to investing its own principal into its loans, putting its interests in-line with Note investors (whereas before, many including myself griped that LendingClub was issuing as many loans as possible to pick up fees without any regard to the underlying credit quality). This has potentially driven the resurgence in LendingClub's originations, which are the underlying driver behind its revenue growth and profits. LendingClub has always been more dependent on the supply side of the loan market (aka, investors, especially large institutional ones) rather than demand (borrowers), so the more LendingClub can do to convince big investors back onto its platform, the more it can continue to revive originations. It certainly helps that the company's newer loan vintages are performing much better than the 2014/2015 class which investors got stung on, though we'll see if the credit quality can hold as time goes by.The company's recent push into innovative securitization for its loans also expands the addressable market for investors. And let's not forget that interest rates are going up, with 10-year U.S. Treasury rates hitting levels not seen in years, as reported by the WSJ. If LendingClub's rates follow suit in rising higher, it can attract even more investors to spur originations growth. The demand side (borrowers) doesn't seem to be fazed by higher rates, as consumer debt continues to notch new highs.All these are factors that, I suspect, were left out of the story when investors sold off LendingClub shares after Q4. It's pretty shortsighted to zero in on LendingClub's Q1 guidance being below estimates when the entire year's guidance was maintained and still holds up against Wall Street's expectations. The way I see it, LendingClub is just giving itself breathing room in Q1 to outperform, rather than pointing to a drop-off in the business. All things said, LendingClub is still one of the largest online lenders there is, and it has garnered quite a decent reputation for quality, with the exit of former CEO Rene Laplanche now well into the rearview mirror.Before diving into LendingClub's results, let's take a peek at its valuation post-selloff to establish that the company is, in fact, cheap.LendingClub has 415 million shares outstanding at a post-selloff price of $3.74 per share - that indicates a market cap of $1.55 billion. Netting out $402 million of balance sheet cash, LendingClub's enterprise value is actually just $1.15 billion.Relative to the company's full-year guidance of $680-$705 million in revenues and $75-$90 million in Adj. EBITDA (both roughly in-line with consensus at the midpoints), LendingClub currently trades at a valuation of:These aren't just reasonable multiples, they're bargain multiples - and cheaper than where the stock was at last quarter.No doubt, there is certainly risk involved here. LendingClub's history of stumbles doesn't exactly make it a candidate for Company of the Year, and there are plenty of investors (both in the stock and in Notes) who are frustrated with the company. But at this price, LendingClub has a lot more wiggle room on the way up than on the way down. Put another way, at less than $4 a share, the risk-reward spectrum tilts heavily in favor of the bull.Here's a look at LendingClub's key results for the fourth quarter:Figure 1. LendingClub Q4 resultsSource: LendingClub investor relationsThe first and most important point to pick up on, of course, is the 23% y/y growth in originations to $2.43 billion. This is roughly on track with the 24% y/y growth in originations that the company saw in Q3, reinforcing the narrative that originations are once again on the rise after a rocky start to the year. For the full FY17, LendingClub's $8.98 billion in originations is still up only 4% y/y.Even though LendingClub has a portion of its capital invested in Notes now (and thus, generates interest revenues), the lion's share of LendingClub's business still derives from origination and servicing fees. With the company exiting Q4 at a strong run rate for originations growth, the outlook for FY18 looks bright. If LendingClub was able to drive 14% y/y revenue growth in FY17 on the back of just 4% y/y originations growth, it should in theory be able to drive more than the 20% y/y revenue growth it has guided to (based on its $680-$705 million rage) if its originations rate holds above 20% for FY18. Revenue has historically seen a magnified correlation to originations growth in previous quarters.And another note on originations growth - LendingClub has seen success in using its structured securitizations to drive originations, making it less dependent on banks as a funding source. See the company's originations growth and funding mix below, noting that the recent growth in originations is highly correlated to LendingClub-driven securitization which will continue into FY18:Figure 2. LendingClub originations mixSource: LendingClub earnings materialsOne note on fee-based incomes: LendingClub also announced along with its earnings release that it would be taking on a new third-party loan servicing platform. This means it will be sharing its servicing fees with these new partners, but management believes the move to be accretive to cost efficiencies and will drive higher EBITDA margins.Revenue was a disappointment in the quarter - LendingClub grew its top line only 20% y/y to $156.5 million, missing analyst expectations for $258.0 million - but again, the continued strong pace of originations growth is probably the better metric to focus on given it has more long-term impacts for servicing fees and interest than a single quarter's revenue.Note also the improvement in Adjusted EBITDA to $19.0 million in the quarter (a 12% EBITDA margin), up from a small loss last year. Ditto for the full year FY17. And lest you think Adjusted EBITDA is not a ""real"" earnings measure, LendingClub's calculation is fairly standard - using the bread-and-butter definition of EBITDA and adding back stock comp.There's plenty of fear surrounding LendingClub right now, and a lot of it is for good reason. But for the reasons outlined above - primarily originations growth - I don't believe LendingClub to be a falling knife; rather, I think the stock is setting itself up for a recovery as it uses this quarter to reset expectations with investors and outperform in 2018. This is a somewhat uncorrelated data point, but I've also noted that the losses in my portfolio of Notes have begun to taper off and stabilize - whereas a few quarters ago, I'd see huge swaths of notes getting charged off at once. As the loan portfolio stabilizes, I believe the business and the stock will too.The other key thing to remember is that there is a bottom floor to LendingClub's valuation as one of the only platforms of its kind to operate at scale. Though it has seen its share of controversies, the space is it's in - online, customer-drive, nonbank lending - is a hot one to be in. Even Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS), which once turned its nose down on commercial banking activity, set up its Marcus arm in part to compete against LendingClub and take home its share of the profits in the space. There's a long-held adage that Goldman can smell where the money is from miles away - and if Goldman believes as much in the space to water down its brand with a personal-lending arm, then LendingClub must at least have something right.Once the dust settles from the Q4 fallout, it will be a good time to pick up LendingClub shares."

        Many are doing so using their credit cards.
        LendingClub, which makes unsecured consumer loans, will likely see similar usage trends.
        LendingClub's already declining credit performance could see another big drop.
        The bigger the Bitcoin boom goes, the more collateral damage there will be when it turns into a bust.","LendingClub (LC) has had plenty of troubles over the years. Back in 2015, you could throw a dart at a list of financial stocks and hit a double if you held it through today. LC stock, by contrast, has destroyed shareholder value since its IPO. Even the recent Trump financials rally did next to nothing for LC stock, and now shares are back to near new all-time lows after a downbeat earnings report:What's gone wrong for the company? There are several factors at play. A management scandal, which in turn caused the CEO to be booted, no doubt badly tarnished the company and reduced its access to institutional capital. But arguably more importantly, the company's product simply isn't performing as well as expected.During a time when consumers are seeing strong job growth, you'd think consumer loans would be performing excellently. Instead, LendingClub's loans see diminishing returns, especially for riskier borrowers.About a year ago, the company already admitted that its lowest-rated loans were coming in way under expectations. At the time, the Financial Times wrote that:This is pretty incredible. In a booming economy, the G-rated loans did so badly that they jacked up interest rates almost 3% on consumers while also reducing expected returns by more than 3%. This suggests that the G-rated loans were fully 6% short of expectations. This speaks to massive problems with the company's underwriting, and leaves you to wonder just how badly internet-originated subprime loans will fare when a recession hits and the unemployment rate goes up again.Even 2016's tightened lending standards weren't enough. Investors using the LendingClub platform have continued complaining about increasing defaults and plunging returns this year. See the epic 35 page thread over at a LendingClub forum for details - here's one prolific lender's portfolio delinquency rate evolution over time: (source of graphics)Charge offs:and net returns over time:There are numerous such reports - I encourage you to read around that forum if you are long LC stock. Or consider Seeking Alpha contributor Gary Alexander's experience (as of October 2017):One commenter on that article raised serious questions about the veracity of LendingClub's loan origination standards:Given all this backdrop, perhaps it's not surprising that LendingClub has further cut back further on their subprime loan offerings as of the latest earnings call.Given the problems LendingClub has had with loan underwriting in the past, they are now retaining a portion of the loans they originate on their own balance sheet:This is in theory a positive, since it aligns the interests of shareholders with management. Without such a policy, management could focus solely on originating more loans with little regard to quality.However, this comes with a significant risk. Just as some mortgage lenders in 2006 retained some of their own loans and subsequently went bust as a result, LendingClub faces material risk to their own balance sheet if their loan performance continues to degrade further. This would potentially be problematic during any event - such as a recession. (And, of course, LendingClub's loan origination volumes would decline if a lot of their investors lose money on bad loans and take capital out of the system)In particular, however, Bitcoin lending should terrify creditors.Think about it for a second. If you are someone with a low income and a challenging financial position, you have an almost no-lose proposition (if ethics don't get in the way). You borrow money on a credit card or from LendingClub, ""invest"" it in Bitcoin or Ethereum, and then hope it keeps going to the moon. If it does, you make many multiples of your interest expense, and have hit the lottery.Now if the trade goes bad, and Bitcoin plummets, what is your debtor going to do? Since there is little consequence to defaulting on unsecured debt (and LendingClub has a reputation for being a lax debt collector), you simply stop paying on the note. The borrower has a win/win situation - essentially the lender is financing purchase of lottery tickets. I don't know about you, but I'd need a much higher interest rate than even the 15 or 20% you might get off a low-end LendingClub note to justify that risk.You may say this is hypothetical and far-fetched concern. But look at this chart:SourceWhile only a small portion of LendingClub loans are probably used for speculative gambling at this point, this can and will change in a hurry if coin prices keep rising for at least a few more weeks. Specifically to LendingClub, it's hard to see the value proposition here. Management has little credibility at this point - the company's performance has gone from bad to worse since the scandal started last year. And that's during good economic times. If you're long LC stock, you should think long and hard about what happens once consumers start losing their jobs, and, potentially, a whole wave of speculative gambling notes start going bad.More generally, technological disruption causes widespread effects on the economy. For example, think about how Uber decimated the equity value of bank lenders who extended loans against taxi medallions. When cryptocurrencies crash, you're going to see a lot of losses distributed throughout the economy. It isn't all fun and games - the people cashing out big gains now did so at someone's expense. The losers aren't apparent yet, but we'll find out soon enough who they are once crypto prices experience a big break.LendingClub, in any case, looks like one of the more exposed parties from a financial perspective. I (like others mentioned above) have a LendingClub account and have outright lost money. I stopped buying notes earlier this year - and I certainly wouldn't resume doing so now. It's hard to see a case for either lending on their platform or owning their equity at this point."

The bulls have had little to celebrate since then.At its Q3 earnings announcement after the close on Nov. 7, LC announced a revenue miss ($154M, a miss of $3.5M), and the stock fell as much as 20% intra-day from the previous close to a low of $4.35. The company lowered its guidance for Q4, offering up a range of $158M-163M in revenue vs. analyst consensus expectations of $174M.Let’s take a look at the psychology of lowering guidance from the perspective of Scott Sanborn (CEO) and Tom Casey (CFO). They would be sure to know that missing Q3 would result in the stock being hit hard, especially in conjunction with lower Q4 guidance. When faced with the decision of what to say about Q4, they had three options.1) They could choose not to adjust guidance for Q4. This would have resulted in less of a hit to the stock now, so they must have taken down guidance because their internal forecasts are now predicting what would have been a miss in Q4.2) They could take down Q4 to the level they are forecasting internally or above. Doing this is the worst of both worlds - take the hit now to the stock price and take on some risk of missing again in Q4 and taking another hit.3) They could take down Q4 to below the level of their internal forecasts. Doing this, they still take the hit now, but they set themselves up for a beat in Q4. 2017 was another tough year for the company, and February would be a great time to announce a beat to try to generate some momentum for the stock into 2018.We know they didn’t choose option 1, so internal forecasts must have been taken down relative to when guidance was first issued. Between options 2 and 3, it seems clear that 3 is the option they would have plumped for, which implies a high likelihood that they are setting themselves up for a positive surprise in Q4.It is worth noting that LendingClub’s Q3 EPS of $0.03 was in line with expectations. It has ~50% contribution margins, meaning that had it been in line on revenue, the company likely would have been able to beat on EPS. Bad weather in Q3 contributed, according to CFO Tom Casey’s comments on the earnings call, to roughly 30% of the miss. This is obviously a short-term effect. And the new credit model also hurt volume, which is potentially addressable through aligning targeting with the new model - and is also a good indicator that the company is handling credit risk prudently.Revenues grew 34% on a year-over-year basis, even with the miss. And EBITDA margins expanded significantly, by 10 points. This kind of growth trajectory and continued margin expansion do not appear to be baked into the valuation. The chart below, from the company, shows originations finally taking off. With 4Q16 and 1Q17 originations below $2B, the stage is set for significant y-o-y growth to continue.The company has a shareholder lawsuit outstanding, which it has said it is likely to settle during Q4. It is unlikely that this could be expensive enough to harm the company’s long-term valuation, but the uncertainty may be causing some overhang today. Along with the lawsuit potentially settling, a second short-term catalyst is LendingClub's Investor Day on Dec. 7, at which the company is expected to discuss initiatives to drive future growth.Before the 2016 scandal, LendingClub traded in the $8 range, almost double its current price. It is currently trading at a similar level to the two months immediately following the crisis, when there was a genuine existential threat facing the company. With that threat firmly in the rear-view mirror, and with loan originations taking off again after four quarters essentially flat, the company has the opportunity to continue its prior growth path and keep expanding margins.We believe that with the stock trading in the mid-$4 range, it is now oversold. With the presence of near-term catalysts, it represents a value opportunity in the 1-3 month time frame, potentially hitting $5 before the end of the year and $6.50-7.00 after Q4 earnings."
4132285,103480,2017-12-16T08:26:56-05:00,"LendingClub hosted its first-ever Investor Day in December in response to its flagging stock price and uproarious investor concerns.The company plunged after missing estimates and issuing weak guidance for Q4. In its investor day, LendingClub cut Q4 guidance even further, causing the stock to drop to fresh lows.LC recently tightened its credit underwriting standards to disqualify the most subprime of borrowers.While this is a positive concession to Note investors who've seen growing charge-offs, LendingClub's originations (its main source of fee income) will suffer as a result.The company still has a rocky road ahead, but the stock may soon find a bottom in the mid-$3s. Look for an entry point there.","With its brand-new lows, I'm developing mixed feelings for LendingClub (NYSE:LC). As a multi-year investor in LendingClub Notes who has seen negative returns in my LendingClub investment (-2% over a 2.5-year span), I've been consistently burned by the company's loose credit model and believe that lack of funding enthusiasm for its loans will limit its growth.Equity investors, however, seem to have it worse - now in part due to the fact that LendingClub is taking steps to address the credit weakness that Note investors suffer from. LendingClub's stock has dived 23% this year, as shown in the chart below, missing out on 20% gains in the broader market and underperforming by a massive 40-plus percentage points.LC data by YChartsThough losses in Notes still leave a bitter taste in my mouth, and even though LendingClub's weak guidance is a major concern that's had me bearish on the stock for a while, I do believe the company may be forming a bottom in the near term. The stock seems to find resistance in the upper $3s.It's important to remember that LendingClub is one of the first movers in the P2P lending space and a major thought leader in fintech as a whole. LendingClub was one of the first companies to shake up the traditional banking model, and it has since spawned an entire cadre of startups such as Beam and Prosper that are focused on modernizing the banking and lending experience for millennials. With a market cap of just ~$1.6 billion, LendingClub's value might underestimate its potential and brand power. I'm not a bull yet - the road is still going to be rocky through at least the next quarter, but I am interested in giving the stock a fresh look.My take on LendingClub: Watch it closely over the next few weeks and look for a well-timed entry point. Red-hot markets will leave investors searching for stocks that have recently underperformed and are showing decent value, and once the current chaos on LendingClub's guidance has settled, the tide may just turn.LendingClub was $3 million short of analyst revenue consensus in Q3, growing revenues 34% y/y to $154 million instead of the $157 million Wall Street wanted to see. Still though, growth has picked up in the back half of the year along with originations - growth in the nine months year-to-date was only 13% y/y.Where investors are currently getting caught up is in LendingClub's new guidance. In Q3, LendingClub guided to Q4 revenues of $158-163 million, badly missing analyst expectations for $173.6 million. That miss alone caused the stock to drop ~15%. Making matters worse, LendingClub cut guidance even further to $155-160 million, implying 21% y/y growth over the $130.5 million it generated in 4Q16 - this second cut provoked a second ~15% tumble in the stock. The slide below, taken from LendingClub's analyst day deck, summarizes the guidance cut:Figure 1. LendingClub guidance cutSource: LendingClub investor relationsStill, however, LendingClub is still tracking toward growth in the low 20s, which is respectable for a technology company approaching $1 billion in annual revenues. The company is also making good progress in margin improvements, dropping overhead costs by 6 points in Q3 as shown in the chart below:Figure 2. LendingClub margin improvementIf you're willing to take a step back, tune out the negative media over two successive guidance cuts, and look at LendingClub from a fresh perspective: as a tech stock with growth in the 20s and high-single-digit margin expansion, it's not a half bad story.LendingClub's 2018 guidance, like its Q4 guidance, missed analyst expectations. The company's view of $680-705 million (+20.3% y/y at the midpoint of $692.5 million) was short of analyst expectations calling for $699 million. The company is also calling for a ~12% adj. EBITDA margin, with a long-term target of 20% margin.Figure 3. LendingClub FY18 guidanceTaken as a whole, though, LendingClub's FY18 guidance doesn't look that bad either. 20% growth, profitable (at least on an adjusted basis), and with further improvement for margin expansion - at the very least, there are other technology companies that are growing much slower (or are in decline) and haven't hit pro forma profitability yet.Take HR software company Cornerstone OnDemand (NASDAQ:CSOD) or Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) for example: these are both companies with worse growth and margin profiles than LendingClub that trade at higher valuations.Trading at $4/share and with 414.9 million shares outstanding, LendingClub currently has a market cap of $1.659 billion. Netting out the company's $384.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, LendingClub currently has an enterprise value of $1.275 billion.As previously mentioned, LendingClub has offered guidance of $680-705 million in revenue and $75-90 million in adjusted EBITDA for FY18. Taking the midpoints of both of these ranges, this implies that LendingClub currently trades at:The company's low revenue multiple is a telling signal of its undervaluation in the markets. Constructing a peer set for LendingClub is exceedingly difficult because many of its direct competitors are still private, but when comparing LendingClub against other technology companies whose growth has fizzled and is disappointing investors, LendingClub trades at a discount even to these.TWTR EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsWhile I always thought I would be a perma-bear on LendingClub stock, after taking a fresh look at the company's rock-bottom valuation, even the hardiest of bears have to ask whether at such a low price, the risk-reward profile becomes somewhat appealing.Much like General Electric (NYSE:GE), I believe LendingClub is using this window of time when sentiment is already bleak to do a ""kitchen-sink reset"" and start fresh with new guidance. Though the tide will still be rocky for a few months, LendingClub will soon find a bottom to recover from.Valuation and growth metrics that were discussed in this article aside, there's a lot about the new business model that I'm liking as well. Funding sources have greatly diversified, reducing LendingClub's reliance on single large institutional accounts. Perhaps most importantly, LendingClub has committed to putting ""skin in the game"" - requiring itself to hold at least a 5% principal stake in its loans. For years, LendingClub has been criticized for prioritizing origination volumes over investor interests - with its self-imposed requirement to hold principal risk on its billion-dollar portfolio, investors might get more comfortable with trusting in LendingClub's new credit model, which is also stripping away the riskiest of borrowers.Figure 4. LendingClub loan holding policySource: LendingClub investor relationsLendingClub isn't the darling of Wall Street anymore and likely never will be again, but there's salvage value here. I'm not jumping in just yet, but I'll be testing the waters over the next few weeks for a plausible entry point."
4123650,103480,2017-11-11T06:28:09-05:00,"LendingClub tanked more than 15% after posting an extremely disappointing Q3, missing analyst revenue estimates, as origination volumes continue to track behind last year.The company also announced tighter underwriting standards that will hurt originations in the near term.Notes graded F and G, the most sub-prime of LendingClub's borrowers, will no longer be originated.These are often the most highly demanded of LendingClub notes among investors and the most actively traded on third-party exchanges.","Mixed feelings abound for the latest slew of news coming out of LendingClub (NYSE:LC). The company has, probably for the first time since launching, implemented a major review of its credit underwriting standards and tightened its borrower criteria. As I wrote in a prior article, I'm an investor in LendingClub notes and have suffered losses as a major chunk of my portfolio sits in charge-off status and my yearly return is negative. For loss-bearing investors, tighter underwriting standards are a step in the right direction (though we would also like LendingClub to step up its delinquency collection efforts), but equity investors clearly don't believe it's fundamentally good for LendingClub's business, as it's a tacit implication that its credit model isn't as revolutionary as it originally intended.In a sign of confidence in its own platform, however, LendingClub directly contributed to its own notes for the first time in 3Q17 - probably generating some goodwill among platform investors who believe credit quality is a low priority for the company (it generates the majority of its revenues, after all, from origination and servicing fees, not interest, which is unlike other fintech platforms like OnDeck (NYSE:ONDK) which like a bank actually generates the majority of its revenues from lending). Of the $2.4 billion in originations in Q3, LendingClub directly financed $217 million from its own balance sheet. However, the company's own note holdings are intended for sale in its securitization program, not for long-term holding. Note investors would probably like to see LendingClub hold at least some portion of its notes for the full 3-5 year tenor - see the company ""eat its own cooking"" as the saying goes.LendingClub's quarterly earnings were a disaster. Revenue of $154 million underperformed versus analyst expectations for $157 million, and while loan originations grew y/y in the quarter, they are still down year-to-date. Post-earnings, investors sold off LendingClub's stock to its lowest level in years. Year to date, the stock is down 16%, drastically underperforming a 16% gain in the S&P 500 and a 26% gain in the NASDAQ.LC data by YChartsGiven poor performance, Wall Street's jitters, and a revamped credit model that has an unknown long-term impact on the business, LendingClub has a poor risk-reward profile. As I previously wrote, LendingClub's history of poor loan performance has scared off the large institutional investors that fund the majority of its subprime loans - and while it has enticed some of them back to the table, their cooperation is vital in ensuring LendingClub can still grow its platform. Until we see proof - in either raw quarterly results or a confirmation of large institutional investors buying a new chunk of loans - LendingClub remains a stock to avoid.LendingClub grew revenues +34% y/y to $154 million, driven by an increase in originations. Still, however, revenues tracked below analyst consensus of $157 million, or +37% y/y.Figure 1. LendingClub Q3 resultsSource: Earnings press releaseOriginations also saw 24% y/y growth to $2.4 billion, as shown in the chart below (taken from LendingClub's Q3 earnings presentation). Originations saw a return to growth after a challenging 2016, when some of the company's biggest investors (banks and institutional investors) were pulling back their funding.Figure 2. Q3 originationsQuarter over quarter, LendingClub's sequential origination growth of 14% in Q3 represented a massive acceleration over the prior few quarters.Growth translated as well into earnings. LendingClub's adjusted EBITDA - which adjusts for stock-based comp - saw an expansion to $20.9 million, representing a 13.6% margin, versus a loss of -$9.2 million in 3Q16.Earnings were in line with expectations, as margin expansion above expectations offset the shortfall in revenues. Pro forma EPS of $0.03 matched Wall Street consensus to the penny.So what went so sour with earnings if the company was growing (even if slightly short of expectations) with profit expansion? The answer lies entirely in weakened guidance.Back in Q2, LendingClub released full-year guidance of $585-600 million in revenues. Through Q3, it has achieved $418.1 million, indicating $167 million left to go to meet the low end of its guidance, and $182 million to hit the high end.LendingClub's updated Q4 guidance, however, calls for only $158-163 million in revenues, indicating that, at the midpoint, the company would only achieve $579 million in revenues for the year. And that's if it meets its updated guidance midpoint - Q3 actuals fell to the low end of guidance.Analyst consensus had called for Q4 guidance of $173.6 million, vastly above the view that LendingClub offered. LendingClub cited its intended tightening credit policy as the driver of lower revenues, saying it will cause a ""slight headwind"" in Q4. Scott Sanborn, the company's CEO, said the following in the earnings call - as taken from the Seeking Alpha transcript:Sanborn goes on to say that he still feels confident in the 2018 outlook, but investors aren't buying it. There's a big question mark about how this new underwriting model - which ditches FICO scores and relies more on LendingClub's proprietary data - will affect the business in the long term. Is it enough to convince institutional investors to come back to the table, many of them stung by the high charge-off rates seen in the loan performance of the ill-fated 2013 and 2014 vintage?LendingClub's business has long been driven by the supply side of the equation - that is, it's always had trouble lining up enough investors to fund its loans - and indeed, in Q3, it began funding a portion of its own loans as well, as shown below (LendingClub's portion shown in green):Figure 3. LendingClub funding mixHow will this credit-tightening change affect the supply side? Though investors will be pleased at LendingClub's efforts to improve loan performance, will the disappearance of high-yielding F and G notes (probably the most popular class of notes on the platform, and the easiest to sell on the Openfolio trading market) stem investors' appetite for notes?Further, how will the credit tightening affect the demand side of the picture - will borrowers shy away from applying for loans due to stricter standards?There are just too many variables in play and uncertainty surrounds LendingClub's direction. The credit change is a major reversal to ""business as usual"" for the company, and the end result might not be a positive one. Wall Street, as everyone knows, has a penchant for this level of uncertainty.With a miss in Q3 revenues and a cut to guidance, LendingClub already looks like a losing bet. Add in the fact that a credit overhaul will have an unknown impact on FY18 and you can see why investors sold LendingClub off sharply.LendingClub has been a massive underperformer on the public markets since its 2014 IPO at $15. The company had once traded as high as $25, but the ensuing turbulence as big-time institutional investors left the platform and a temporary drop in originations have disrupted the smooth growth path that tech investors have come to expect.Recovery doesn't look likely, at least in the near term. The risk-reward profile is too heavily tilted out of favor - continue to avoid this name."
4123285,22148,2017-11-10T10:19:52-05:00,LendingClub plunged following disappointing Q4 guidance.Most of the impacts are short-term adjustments to the credit model or temporary market conditions.The fintech guided to record revenues for Q4 and expects further growth in 2018.,"LendingClub (LC) plunged 16% in the first day of trading following Q3 results after taking a hit leading into earnings. Despite record revenues, the market was highly displeased with projections even considering a highly attractive valuation.The stock now amazingly trades towards the levels seen back in 2016 right after the CEO fraud issues that questioned the very future of LendingClub. Is now the ultimate time to buy the stock?Investors need to take a high view of the company and not get so focused on guidance versus estimates. The company reported net revenues of $154 million in Q3 and guided towards Q4 revenues of over $160 million. The previous record was $151 million.Source: LendingClub Q3'17 presentation Sure, revenue estimates were a lot higher, but LendingClub only has an enterprise value now around $1 billion with roughly $800 million cash and loan investments on the balance sheet. Maybe investors don't actually dig into the details that the fintech implemented a new credit model at the end of September that impacted short-term results.Ultimately, LendingClub gave numerous excuses for a revenue snag from the Q3 hurricanes to the Equifax (EFX) issue freezing certain consumer credit scores to the 5th-generation credit model. All of these issues are either minor hits to long-term growth or short-term impacts that will resolve themselves over time. In fact, the new credit model will eventually help the fintech target marketing to better borrower candidates rather than existing ones that turn problematic by either prepaying loans or defaulting on the loan.Investors need to consider that LendingClub survived the near death experience of investor classes like banks exiting from the platform, yet finds itself at record revenues now. These adjustments to the online lending platform will take place from time to time, but growth in the online lending marketplace is all but certain when loan applications are up 58% over last year.The company will hit road bumps when embarking on a new frontier like online lending. The key is to taking advantage of the dips when the market loses faith in the business model.The below chart highlights how revenues are headed back up while the stock price is disconnected and trading at lows. Once updated, the revenue totals hit $547 million and around $578 million for the full year once incorporating the Q4 target.LC data by YChartsThe key investor takeaway is that investors need to take a step back and see the big picture highlighted in my previous research. Most of the hiccups with Q4 guidance are related to short-term impacts that don't alter the long-term strategy. LendingClub is an exceptional bargain trading with an EV closing in on $1 billion while rapidly growing."
4113649,103480,2017-10-16T08:08:18-04:00,"LendingClub relies on fresh capital to originate loans and generate revenue growth, which is increasingly being provided by a small amount of institutional investors.LendingClub's loan performance has been beset by high charge-off rates, and newer vintages have markedly lower performance than in the past.Investors have surely taken notice and will be more wary to invest large sums in LendingClub's new vintages, hampering loan growth.While borrower demand for LendingClub's loans remains high, its supply of capital will be the major impediment to its growth.","LendingClub (NYSE: LC) is reaching for 52-week highs again, as equity investors seem to think that LendingClub's days of scandal are behind it.For a quick refresher: in mid-2016, news broke that an affiliate of LendingClub had been quietly buying up its hundreds of millions of LendingClub's ""Notes"" (the slices of consumer debt that are securitized and sold to both institutional and retail investors). This called into question LendingClub's claim that it takes no credit risk, as it was arranging for an affiliated entity to buy up its loans. The event brought down LendingClub's founder and then-CEO, Renaud Laplanche.Aside from being a major embarrassment to the company, the LendingClub debacle served to illustrate one key point: the most important driver of its business is the fresh supply of funds to continue originating loans. The only reason LendingClub had an affiliate buy up its debt was to absorb the lack of institutional buying. LendingClub generates its revenue from origination and service fees, not from holding the debt it sells - to keep originating loans, it has to convince the suppliers of capital (aka, investors) to keep playing ball.This risk is just as apparent today as it was a year ago, and the company has seemingly made few improvements in bolstering its capital supply. Equity investors are cautioned not to toss false hopes into LendingClub re-reaching its former glory - unless its loan performance can improve, its access to capital will be severely restricted. Beware of this fintech company as it stretches for new highs - once the capital stops flowing, its business will grind to a halt.LC data by YChartsFull disclosure: I'm an investor in LendingClub Notes, not in the stock. In the past few months, I've seen the value of my consumer debt portfolio dwindle as more than a tenth of my Notes go sour, with little results in the way of recoveries (though supposedly, the fees I pay to LendingClub should in part be used for the company to make every effort to make delinquent borrowers pay).Unsecured consumer debt is risky. Everybody knows that. LendingClub regularly communicates this to investors, so the company itself can't be faulted for lack of disclosure. Caveat emptor - let the buyer beware. But despite doing everything LendingClub recommends - limiting single-Note exposure to $25, maintaining a portfolio of 100+ notes, and spreading that portfolio across risk grades (LendingClub rates its borrowers from A (best) through G (worst)), the monthly statements I receive from the company show consistent underperformance and value deterioration.The company provides the following historical performance charts for the two types of loans they offer: 36-month loans and 60-month loans.Figure 1. LendingClub 36-month loan performanceFigure 2. LendingClub 60-month loan performanceSource: LendingClub websiteThe charts above carry two key takeaways. First, loan performance degrades over time. This is natural and nothing unexpected: borrowers tend not to default in the beginning, inflating the initial rates of return. Bad eggs only reveal themselves years later as problems surface.But something else that is of note in these charts: LendingClub's newer vintages aren't performing as well as that of 2012, 2013, and 2014 - the dark green, light green, and red lines, respectively, and its best years.Take a look at the pink and purple lines - representing loans originated in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Their performance significantly trails that of 2013-2014. Furthermore, the drop in performance (the ""cliff"" you see at the beginning of the life of the loan) is happening sooner and swifter than in the prior years. Take a look specifically at the vintage of 2015 (pink), where performance has nosedived below any year except 2008's 36-month loans.With the 2015 vintage declining from a 16% annualized return to merely 8% annualized return only 20 months into its lifespan (1/3 of its lifespan), it's well on its way to generating a low single-digit or even subzero return by the time it hits its last year. Why would a rational investor choose to invest in highly risky, unsecured consumer debt for a reward of 1-3% if that same investor can simply invest in an S&P 500 ETF that can generate ~8-10% annualized returns over the same 5-year period?Investors look at LendingClub the same way they would look at mutual and hedge funds: where recent performance is weak, they'll invest less money or pull out entirely. And while everybody knows that past performance is not an indicator of future returns, nobody is going to want to invest in an asset class that shows deteriorating performance from year to year.Certainly LendingClub doesn't wish for bad performance. But loan performance isn't exactly that high on the company's priority list, either, seeing as it doesn't hold its Notes beyond the short term.LendingClub is a prime example of incentive misalignment. Its goal is simply to originate as many loans as possible, because:Source: LendingClub 10-KUnlike a bank, it doesn't seek to generate interest revenue from its balance sheet. Once it originates a loan and receives its fees, it wants to move its Notes out the door as quickly as possible via securitization and mass sales of its loans. It doesn't want to take on the risk of its own product.Sound familiar? This isn't too unlike what happened with securitized mortgages in the financial crisis of 2008. Without any vested interest in the quality of loans (only in origination volumes), mortgage lenders sought to originate as much as possible, lowering underwriting standards in the efforts to originate as many loans as possible.LendingClub is not a crooked lender, by any sense. All the evidence suggests it genuinely does its best to make sound loans and offer its investors a good return. But after facing several sequential quarters of revenue decline (only returning to growth in its most recent quarter), the company is certainly under pressure to keep loan originations high.LendingClub is a marketplace service, after all, and like in any marketplace, outcomes are determined by the balance between supply and demand. In LendingClub's case, the suppliers of capital (that is, investors) hold nearly all the cards.Let's review several important facts about LendingClub's dependency on its investors. First, as shown in the chart below from LendingClub's most recent earnings presentation, its revenue growth is highly dependent on the growth in its origination volumes:Figure 3. LendingClub originations vs. revenue growthRevenue grew 35% y/y - impressive, surely, but driven entirely by its 10% growth in originations. When originations are weak (like in the previous quarter, where originations fell 29%), revenue takes a nosedive as well.Secondly - without outside capital, LendingClub cannot afford to continue supporting loan growth. In 2Q17, LendingClub originated $2.15 billion in loans. The company has only $573 million of cash on its balance sheet. By its own merit, it can only afford to fund about one month of its own loans.LendingClub's biggest strength is also its biggest weakness: it's not a bank. Because it's not a bank, its origination speed and tech-forward approach is immensely appealing to borrowers, driving demand for its loans (it has seemingly no problems attracting new borrowers). But because it's not a bank, it doesn't have easy access to capital in the form of deposits to fund loans.In fact, traditional banks are LendingClub's largest sources of capital, providing 44% of its originations in Q2, for an aggregate total of $955 million:Figure 4. LendingClub capital supply mixFurther, the bank mix of LendingClub's capital supply has grown from par with retail investors (in gray) to nearly half its capital supply. Institutional investors, shown in yellow (think mutual funds and hedge funds) are retreating from supplying funds to LendingClub, possibly scared off by the deterioration in the performance of LendingClub Notes.LendingClub had better keep the banks happy. In a moment's notice, if the banks pull their funding, LendingClub's originations machine could suddenly stop.This risk factor, taken from LendingClub's 10-K, sums up its precarious situation quite nicely:The section goes on to say that following the fall of LendingClub's former CEO, many large investors have pulled funding from the platform. And because it has a ""relatively small number"" of heavy hitters funding its loan book, it really can't afford to lose a single one.For now, investors think the world is merry - after all, revenue is up 35% y/y. The company is projecting a positive adjusted EBITDA for the full year. Originations are up, and GAAP net income is closing in on breakeven. See below LendingClub's most recent quarterly results, which has sent the stock rallying since the beginning of August:Figure 5. LendingClub Q2 resultsWith its stock pushing toward the mid-$6s (up from lows in the $4s in 2016 post-scandal), LendingClub now touts a $2.7 billion market cap.This represents a Price/FY17 Revenue multiple of 4.5x (based on the midpoint of management's increased FY17 guidance range of $585-$600 million) and an Adjusted EBITDA multiple of 50x (based on guidance of $50-$58 million in Adjusted EBITDA).These multiples are hardly cheap, especially for a company whose revenue and profits swing from growth in one quarter to deterioration in the next (we could say the same for its loan performance, though lately it seems loan performance has shown pure deterioration).This is not a company worth betting on - either in its stock or in its Notes.LendingClub operates a truly marvelous platform, even I have to admit. Using technology and software, it connects borrowers and savers together in a seamless, web-enabled interface that puts traditional banks to shame.Unfortunately, the way the situation looks right now, savers (the suppliers of capital) hold all the power in this marketplace. LendingClub, with a thin balance sheet of its own, relies entirely on these institutional investors and banks to provide capital to fund loan growth. These investors care about only one thing: performance. Unsecured consumer debt is a good asset class to diversify into, but only if LendingClub can generate good returns on its Notes. In this regard, its own statistics show it has failed.One quarter of good results should not erase from investors' minds the very real possibility that Q2 revenue growth was a one-time fluke. LendingClub has been congratulating itself on two high-profile ""self-sponsored securitization,"" loosely translated as a big sales push to market and securitize more Notes in an effort to bolster demand for LendingClub product. These big sales pushes may temporarily increase its access to fresh capital, but it's costly for margins (the company engaged JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) and Citigroup (NYSE: C) to underwrite its most recent $323 million offering in September, and investment bankers don't do anything cheaply) and also more ephemeral. In fact, it's these very securitization deals that may have boosted the optics around originations growth - once the novelty wears off, LendingClub may find itself strapped for capital again.Until LendingClub can show meaningful improvements in the performance of its Notes and win back institutional investors' trust, its short-lived period of growth will tumble back into decline. It needs a consistent supply of capital to power its growth, and for that it also needs to show consistent returns for its investors. Stay away from this stock until its fundamental picture becomes more sunny."
4150706,102796,2018-02-26T12:48:30-05:00,"I have had a very poor experience investing in LendingClub notes, and I am not the only one.If you want to get into peer to peer lending, there is another company you can use whose underwriting is better.Diversification is only good if it works.","For those unfamiliar, LendingClub (LC) is a peer-to-peer lending platform that essentially takes out the institutional middleman and allows the average Joe or Jane to lend money on interest to some other average Joe or Jane. LendingClub facilitates those transactions by reviewing and approving qualified loan applications from the borrower, underwriting the loan, and assigning a rank (and corresponding interest rate) that describes their creditworthiness, and then puts those loans on its website to be crowd-funded in $25 increments by potentially hundreds of different investors. LendingClub makes money by charging a fee to the borrower for the job of underwriting, while also taking a portion of each monthly payment.I bought my first batch of $25 notes on April 22, 2016. I made several purchases then-after through December of the same year, only committing a few hundred dollars in capital so as to test this new platform. The peer-to-peer lending industry was then and certainly still is in its infancy, and I wasn't comfortable risking more than that. Now, it is important to note that LendingClub is very clear in its advertising that ""99% of portfolios with 100+ Notes have seen positive returns."" So I suppose I added a level of risk by not having a portfolio worth at least $2500. But even still, returns can be .1% annualized and count as 'positive', but that is not an acceptable return by anyone's standards given the risks involved in lending to strangers. My intent today is to illustrate my experience and use it to explain why LendingClub is not worthy of investment, certainly not its notes and consequently, not its stock. I will also provide an alternative for those still interested in peer-to-peer lending and conclude with a brief discussion of this asset class' overall returns.To date, I have received $436 in payments, $96 of which is interest. I have lost $100 on notes that have charged-off, meaning that there is zero expectation of future payment and LendingClub collectors have stopped attempting to reach the borrower. I also have a note that is late, and based on how things have gone so far, I fully expect that to charge-off too and will lose the $11.50 still owed. In short, I have already lost almost 20% of my initial investment, crossing my fingers that none of the 14 notes I still have that are current don't enter a late status with more than a year to go before the oldest reaches full term. My results have been dismal.Even with my small portfolio, how could my returns be THAT BAD, especially in light of the fact that I handpicked my notes based on back-tested data that shows which criteria leads to outperformance? When browsing the LendingClub marketplace for potential investments, there is an information page that shows the creditworthiness (or lack thereof) of the borrower indicated by several categories.This is a snapshot of an ""A"" rated loan. The back-tested data I mentioned earlier showed that several categories flagged likelihood for outperformance. They are:1) No inquiries in the last 6 months: they haven't had a hard pull on their credit report2) Loan purpose is for credit card debt or debt consolidation (as opposed to medical needs or home improvement)3) The borrower owns their home or has a mortgage4) Annual income over $45,000I deliberately handpicked those notes that met the above qualifications (for the most part), along with a few other categories that made logical sense to me:- No delinquencies: current accounts that are late.- No public records: Bankruptcy, tax lien (failure to pay Uncle Sam), civil judgements (a debt one owes as a result of a lawsuit).- No Major Derogatory: accounts that are 60-90 days or more past due, and includes repossessions and foreclosures.- Employed for at least 2 years.Now, I did bend a little bit on a few criteria here and there. It turns out if you filter according to all these criteria, you will have eliminated all notes from eligibility. So I have notes where the borrower does not own their home, one note where I chose to invest in spite of their have a delinquency from 6 years prior because they were a teacher and I have a soft spot for educators, and one where I ignored an 'n/a' underemployment length and an inquiry in the last 6 months because I figured their verified annual income of $120,000 should have made up for that. But the point still stands, why have my results been so dismal when I filtered for quality? Even by LendingClub's standards, where they assign its own rating to each note based on all the criteria, I invested relatively conservative:LendingClub's ratings are A-G, with A being the safest. As you can see, the vast majority of my portfolio sits in A-C, with one E and one G note (LendingClub did away with F and G notes last year).To determine underwriting quality, I put together a graph of my charged-off notes to see if I can see any trends. My E and G notes should, in theory, and if LendingClub has wise underwriting, be among the charged-off, right?Turns out, my E and G notes are doing great. They have almost already paid for themselves ($20.46 and $22.55 received from each so far, combining principle and interest, respectively) and they still have more than a year to go before their final payment falls due. They are on track to deliver my full interest rate of 23.32% and 27.34%. Clearly, something is up with LendingClub's underwriting if the majority of my charged off notes are grade B and my two 'worst' graded notes are performing perfectly. The back-tested data about home ownership was born out under my results: renters are riskier.One could easily argue that my sample size of 26 notes ($650) is not large enough to draw any conclusions from. Well, I would concede that point were it not for other investors whose experience with LendingClub has soured. One example is Peter Renton, who runs the Lend Academy website, a forum for all things peer-to-peer lending. If you are interested in the p2p industry, you will find no finer resource. Mr. Renton publishes his p2p lending results every quarter and his results with LendingClub are telling:Lest anyone think that the recent slide in results is a result of larger forces within the market like a general slide in borrower creditworthiness (which may, in fact, have something to do with it), let's turn to Prosper, a competitor of LendingClub who does the exact same thing of peer-to-peer lending. Here is the same data from Mr. Renton's Prosper account:While results have similarly slid over the period observed, they have held up MUCH BETTER than LendingClub, even with the assumption of greater risk (notice the higher interest rates at Prosper). This suggests a weakening borrower pool in the peer-to-peer lending landscape in general since returns at both companies have worsened, but Prosper's underwriting was stronger, to begin with, and thus was not as affected. To bring things full circle, let's take a look at my own Prosper account which I opened shortly after note was popping up late at LendingClub. I chose to take the payments I was getting on my LendingClub notes and transfer them over to Prosper, thus not committing any more capital to this experiment:As you can see, as a result of my LendingClub jitters, I had my own proverbial 'flight to safety':But the point remains, I haven't had a single missed payment in my Prosper account. I have five notes that are over 9 months old in Prosper. By this time in my LendingClub account, I had four notes that had fallen late and were on their way to ultimately charging off.It is my opinion that LendingClub fell prey to what many underwriting institutions (insurance, lenders, and the like) have bowed to since they came into existence: quantity over quality, loan origination volume over borrower creditworthiness. This can happen with loose underwriting standards, but it can also be more overt, like when the CEO talks his family into taking out loans on the LendingClub platform just to boost reported volumes. Yep, that's a true story that you are familiar with if you follow p2p lending and LendingClub in particular. I won't rehash that here, but my experience and the experience of others has shown that LendingClub underwriting is simply bad. Now, the company is in a bit of a transformation stage as it overcomes the scandal difficulties. It has even tried to tighten up its underwriting standards to decrease instances of charge-off with its 'Next Generation Credit Model'. However noble these attempts are, I am not interested in gambling on some turnaround situation. There are analysts and investors who do that, but it's not for me. I have no reason to believe that what LendingClub is trying to do will work. I have no reason to put forth the work to determine whether or not its efforts will work, not when I have an identical platform whose results are better. That brings up a more important question: should I be using p2p lending as an asset class at all? Is this an area I should diversify into?If you have read any of my other articles, I have explained my thoughts on diversification a couple times. Ultimately, diversification for the sake of diversification is a money losing proposition. Only diversify to the extent that it works. So if diversifying into peer-to-peer lending doesn't result in returns that are competitive with the best performing asset classes, why bother?LendingClub claims historical returns in the range of 4-6% (a graph elsewhere on the site shows a median return of 3.6%). Prosper claims you can get 6.7%. Personally, I have negative returns at LendingClub and an 8% return at Prosper. A user who commented on Mr. Renton's forum has invested in LendingClub and Prosper since 2013 and his returns are sitting at about 5% between the two. How does that all stack up against older, more traditional asset classes? Well, according to MFS investment management, the best asset classes over the past 20 years have been small/mid cap stocks returning 9.12%, real estate investment trusts returning 8.67%, and large cap value strategies returning 7.39%. From what I have seen and experienced as mentioned above, p2p lending isn't competitive with these. For me, diversifying here isn't going to bring outsized returns and won't be advantageous. Now there are a lot of variables at play that could bring others to a different conclusion and may, in fact, make me change my mind in the future. For example, you might like the philanthropic appeal of helping someone get out of debt. Or perhaps you believe that p2p lending will reduce the overall volatility of your portfolio as it has a low correlation to fluctuations in the stock market. And there are many other reasons why one might take the p2p plunge. But be warned, this asset class is very young, you are literally lending to strangers and you are at the mercy of the underwriters. Will I keep my money in Prosper? Yes. I want to keep seeing how this experiment plays out. Will I commit more money in the near future? Probably not. I trust other asset classes more, and there is a level transparency to investing in publicly traded companies that you just don't get by lending to folks you don't know.In conclusion, I would advise against investing in LendingClub stock on the grounds that its notes perform poorly and those notes are its business. If charge-offs happen, LendingClub does not receive its cut of each monthly payment, which is what its business lives on. Don't invest in the notes, don't invest in the stock.Please comment with your insights and have a great week!"

Despite a return to growth following the scandal with the founding CEO, the fintech has not gotten much of a bump of bullish calls.The stock ended the week at only $6.39 after once approaching $30. Though the market mostly ignored a bullish call last week, LendingClub still appears poised for a breakout to multi-year highs based on the below chart and a compelling valuation.At the Sohn investment conference in San Francisco, a rising star investment manager made a bullish case for LendingClub. A prime example of the bearish view in that the market mostly yawned at the prediction with a meager $0.01 gain on the day.The ""next generation of talent"" in the form of Seth Wunder from Black-and-White Capital placed a $17 target on LendingClub. The portfolio manager picked the fintech for the very reason that the stock originally traded above the target as recently as 2015: no credit risk.LendingClub created an online lending platform for investors and borrowers to obtain better rates than available through the traditional banking system. The ability to lower the borrowing costs for consumers with high-interest debt and provide an alternative investment for investors looking for better returns than those offered by the banking system makes the platform appealing.The company has roughly 407 million shares outstanding at the end of Q2. To reach $17, LendingClub would obtain a market valuation of $6.9 billion. With a cash balance of $750 million, the stock would have an enterprise value of only $6.15 billion.LendingClub now has a current market cap of $2.6 billion so most investors probably scoff at the concept of the stock hitting a valuation of $6.9 billion. My previous research highlighted why the online lending platform might surprise investors in the next couple of quarters.Most people probably don't realize that the fintech is on the verge of reporting record revenues. The scandal involving the departure of the founding CEO in May 2016 set the lending platform back nearly a year, but the company is on the verge of breaking to new record levels.The original record revenues of $151.3 million from Q1'16 prior to the executive scandal is expected to be topped in Q3. Wall Street forecast revenues of $154.4 million and a huge leap to $174.0 million in Q4. The Estimate consensus expects an easy revenue beat while the chart shows the substantial rebound in revenues following the scandal low last Q3.Revenues have already jumped dramatically off the lows around $100 million. Most importantly, the fintech has already entered a quarter where analysts view the revenue run rate reaching $700 million. A valuation of nearly $7 billion isn't a complete stretch. Regardless though, the current valuation is absurdly low.The EV/S multiple sits at only 2.5. Ycharts doesn't show this multiple correctly, but the P/S multiple shows how the rebounding revenue expectations haven't transformed to a higher multiple.LC PS Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsMajor platforms in growth mode can reach EV/S multiples in excess of 10. With revenues approaching $800 million in 2018, LendingClub could easily see the $17 target based on the current revenue run rate once the market obtains confidence in the platform.According to BTIG analyst Mark Palmer, CFO Tom Casey told the analyst that the fintech wouldn't hold an Investor Day in December if the platform wasn't in growth mode. The market wouldn't want to hear about the growth prospects otherwise. LendingClub announced the intent to hold the Investor Day on August 28 suggesting the company was highly confident that Q3 results were going to exceed analyst estimates that already forecast revenue growth returning to the 35% range.The key investor takeaway is that LendingClub is clearly on the path to record numbers though the stock still trades below pre-scandal levels. The $17 target from Black-and-White Capital is a lot more realistic than most investors think considering the stock didn't even budge on the news."

        In 2017, though, the product has been commoditized and Lending Club has no edge.
        Marcus by Goldman Sachs, a new competitor, is especially formidable.
        Not much reason to expect Lending Club to flourish in the new, highly competitive environment.","When it started in 2007, Lending Club (NYSE:LC) offered an innovative product: unsecured personal loans, applied for and disbursed over the internet. Although Prosper was an also-ran in the same space, the real implicit competition was credit cards. Millions of Americans carried thousands of dollars of credit balances at high interest rates, and Lending Club's selling point to consumers was that a loan from them was way cheaper than paying the bank 20% or so indefinitely.Fast forward ten years. Lending Club's business model has been commoditized and they no longer offer the consumer an innovative product. The long-term viability of their business depends on how well they match their competitors. This article will take a look at Lending Club's competitive environment. I will pay special attention to the newest and, in my opinion, most formidable entrant, Marcus by Goldman Sachs.The competitive environment for online lendingCreditKarma is a personal finance website. They provide a list of online personal loan options, given some basic information. I put in $10,000 as my desired loan amount and selected a credit score of 700-749. I got the following list of offers:That's eleven online, unsecured personal loan providers. The list does not include some others, like SoFi and Lightstream. Try it yourself here.The bottom line here is that, as far as the consumer is concerned, Lending Club does not do anything that, literally, a dozen other websites do. This is not a good situation to be in, for a business: as a rule, commodity businesses have their profits competed down to subsistence level.Lending Club is not winning this competition on price. Their APR is smack in the middle of the list. I varied the inputs but this list is representative: Lending Club has no special pricing edge.Lending Club is not going to win this competition on service, either. To see why, let me introduce the newest and fiercest competitor on this particular block: Marcus by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).Marcus by Goldman SachsMarcus by Goldman Sachs is the name of the online lending platform unveiled by Goldman Sachs last October. It competes directly with Lending Club. I covered its genesis here.The team that created Marcus made a special effort to be customer-oriented and rethink the loan process from the ground up. They did extensive research to see what consumers did and didn't like about the lending process. This effort shows up numerous ways on the Marcus platform:Lending Club vs. MarcusThe two companies have very different funding models and risk profiles. Lending Club is an originate-to-distribute lender, while Marcus is a balance-sheet lender. Lending Club gives much of the profit of a loan to its investors, along with default risk and prepayment risk. Marcus keeps the risks and the profit. If we assume that Marcus's loans look like Lending Club's, with interest rates averaging 14% and defaults averaging 6%, then the income from each loan looks approximately like this:LC: 5% origination fee + 1% servicing fee = 6% of loan principalGS: 14% interest - 6% default - 1% cost of funds = 7% of loan principalLC's income is heavily front-loaded while Goldman has to wait, so given the time value of money, the economics come out roughly the same. Goldman is in a position to improve their margins and/or lower rates by limiting defaults, and Marcus is indeed marketed to higher-credit borrowers.The real difference, though, is in the flexibility of the business models. For one thing, Lending Club needs to grow (they aren't anywhere near profitability yet) and their growth is constrained by the amount of investment capital they can attract. As competition in their space heats up, investment capital gets harder to come by: maybe it is significant that Lending Club originations haven't moved much in a year. Nobody knows what the P/L on Marcus looks like. But Marcus' growth has no similar constraint: it will be a lot easier for Goldman to raise, or redirect, cheap capital as needed.Second, Lending Club is only superficially immune to default risk. Investors bear this risk, and they respond to the characteristics of the loan portfolio. Elevated defaults mean investors withdraw money, which Lending Club cannot afford. So Lending Club must manage defaults at least as vigorously as Goldman does.More importantly, it is a lot more painful for Lending Club to cut back on loan originations, for example in a downturn, and it doesn't necessarily control the pace of lending. If Lending Club stops originating loans, the lion's share of its income dries up immediately. A relatively minor pullback in lending capital in 1Q16 led the founder and then-CEO of Lending Club, Reynaud Laplanche, to cut a few corners in order to maintain Lending Club's profitability and growth profile. (For a few details, see an earlier article of mine.) That caused a scandal, a DoJ investigation, and a change of CEO.If Marcus stops originating loans, in contrast, it still has a steady stream of loan payments coming in. Defaults would hurt, but Marcus can start lending again when it believes the coast is clear. When defaults rise on Lending Club's platform, investors rather than the company control when the lending starts up again. In other words, Goldman retains the flexibility to say, ""this is not a good time to lend,"" while Lending Club never has that luxury, and they can step back in when they, not outside investors, judge it prudent.SummaryLending Club was an innovative product when it started a decade ago. Success breeds imitation, however, and now any number of companies are helping consumers cut their credit card payments. The addressable market is truly gargantuan-consumer debt in the US stands at $3.4T and almost $1T of that is revolving debt (source)-but still, the competition has begun to intensify and over time it will get fierce. The real winners will be borrowers. The companies that come out on top will be those with cheap funding and excellent customer service. Balance-sheet flexibility will be an asset.Goldman has all of these bases covered, and they are a tech-savvy, highly experienced, deeply connected competitor. Lending Club has no special advantages at this point. The easy growth, when competition was thinner, is behind them. I have no predictions to make about the short term fate of the company, but the long term future looks dim."
4094907,21434,2017-08-04T10:56:06-04:00,"LC shares are testing a key technical support level.The first quarter's sequential revenue trend was modestly negative.Income is improving, though rising expenses could become a key headwind.Monday's second quarter report is something of a do-or-die event.","A few days earlier and a few days later, I might be more willing to make a firm bearish call on online lending venue Lending Club (LC). With its second quarter earnings report slated for Monday, August 7th though -- after the close -- there's just a little too much risk in making such a call despite the potential reward.There's no risk in showing why I came awfully close to calling LC a short-trade candidate though, and simultaneously previewing how its Q2 earnings outlook fits into its bigger earnings trend.Several year ago when Lending Club was the bulk of the online-lending market, it had little problem attracting capital, attracting borrowers, and serving as the middleman between the two.As is generally the case though, nothing breeds competition like success. Heath White pointed that out quite plainly in June, citing eleven other online lenders, roughly half of which were more competitive (in terms of interest rates) than Lending Club was itself.It wasn't exactly news to... well, anyone. All that competition started to take shape in 2015, and by 2016 Lending Club's revenue was falling and losses became the norm. Questionable loan-risk policies and the related exit of then-CEO Renaud Laplanche took a fiscal as well as a reputational toll on the company, and though things are on the mend, the organization hasn't even come close to fully recovering. The graphic of Lending Club's past and projected revenue and earnings below tells the tale.Source: Thomson Reuters Eikon, image made by authorFast forward to Monday. That's when Lending Club is expected to log another progressive quarter, cranking revenue up to $136.2 million, and whittle the per-share loss back to only one cent; the company lost nine cents per share on $103.4 million in sales for the same quarter a year earlier. Not only is revenue expected to keep growing beyond that, Lending Club is expected to swing back to a profit in Q3, of two cents per share.If history repeats itself, we can broadly expect an earnings beat, though analysts aren't overwhelmingly convinced. As of the latest tally, nine of the sixteen pros following it are calling it a hold, though it recently ramped up its ""Strong buy"" ratings from only two to three (Oppenheimer).What most of those analysts, and most investors for that matter, haven't adequately addressed in the fact that for the first quarter of this year, revenue fell sequentially, as did income. In fact, as Orange Peel Investments also illustrated in May, the quality of Lending Club's loan portfolio is deteriorating. And, as Stephen Zentner pointed out following the company's first quarter report, its expenses are on the rise... something to watch for in the Q2 numbers.Something significant would have had to have changed over the course of the past three months to expect the revenue and income growth trend to be rekindled. I didn't see any such changes.To that end, it simply looks and feels like the second quarter could be the one that makes or breaks the company, and the stock... at least for a while.While the future is only cloudy rather than convincingly bearish, it's worth noting how investors as a group are increasingly showing doubt in the company's future by virtue of selling their shares shortly after April's modest rebound effort. In fact, for the first time in over a year LC shares have logged lower lows and lower highs. The lower low was hit this week with a trade under the prior low of $5.03. The stock didn't remain under that floor, but rather, fought its way back above it. The matter is far from settled though.Source: Schwab's StreetSmart EdgeIt's the descending wedge pattern (framed in orange), by the way, that got me mulling a short position on LC. Although short-selling super cheap and small-float names like Lending Club isn't for the faint of heart, to those who can stomach the risk and are able to watch their positions like a hawk. It isn't the right choice for everyone.For those who are experienced in the art (and risk) of short-selling though, this chart and the impending earnings report establishes a potential opportunity. If the horizontal support level at $5.03 is broken again, it's unlikely the bulls would be willing to prop it up yet again and give it another chance at a recovery. Once those floodgates open again, they'll apt to remain open for a while.Realistically speaking, there's not another technical floor until last July's low of around $4.02, and then there's not another one until last May's low of $3.50.The catch -- should the floor break in response to a poor Q2 or a grim outlook -- is not piling on in the event of a sudden and sharp selloff. A steep intraday loss may simply be interpreted as a bargain-buying opportunity. For LC to fully capitalize on its downside potential, it needs to break under that floor and gradually pick up bearish steam.Of course, that point of view may all be for naught, if Lending Club somehow has managed to get its ship back on course and prods the stock upward. In that case a break above the upper edge of the converging wedge shape, currently at $5.60, could trigger a trade-worthy meltup.The same idea applies though... don't go chasing a massive, instantaneous boost. Those moves rarely muster any immediate follow-though.It's difficult to just sit on an idea and wait for it to be triggered. It's even more difficult when there are two potential triggers that could push the stock in question in diametrically opposite directions (and that assumes we'll get decent movement in either direction after earnings -- we may not).Whatever the case, the Lending Club story is one that's coming to a head, for better or worse. The pivotal chapter may well begin on Monday. Be ready."
4070470,70965,2017-05-08T02:32:51-04:00,The case for avoiding Lending Club as an investment is pretty simple.We're at the end of an 8-year short term credit cycle that is going to put pressure on peer to peer lenders.They will be first to feel the pain as delinquencies and defaults tick up.,"By Parke ShallWe believe the most commonsense case for avoiding Lending Club (NYSE:LC) as an investment is pretty simple and doesn't involve a deep dive into the numbers. We think the reasons for avoiding peer to peer lenders can be explained simply and are relatively easy to understand. Lending Club, along with other peer to peer lenders and smaller aggressive regional banks, will likely be a poor investments in coming quarters as a shorter-term debt cycle turns over and the lowest creditworthy types of loans begin to see a spike in delinquencies and faults.LC data by YChartsFirst, a simple question: What type of lender is Lending Club, and where did it come from? The company calls itself a peer to peer lender, but basically all it is doing is lining up people that want to invest cash for a higher yield with people who want to borrow but may not have sufficient access to credit through a banking facility or other means. The whole company is essentially a byproduct of the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates at 0%. People are then forced to go looking for yield in aggressive spots, and the next thing you know we have individual lenders lending money to noncreditworthy individuals.For instance, those that would fit on the ""Grade G"" portion of this chart provided to lenders by Lending Club:Like any lender, Lending Club has a place somewhere on the totem pole of lender quality. At the top of this list would be institutional lenders like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), which lend money to extremely creditworthy individuals, wealthy people, politicians, corporations and the like. Those are top-quality loans with the least amount of worry. At the bottom of the totem pole are people who can't get credit at all. This is a group of individuals who don't have access to credit cards and can't take out any type of loan other than probably a payday loan. Where does Lending Club sit? It is right below the lowest bank on the totem pole and right above people who simply can't get credit at all. That is the niche that peer to peer lending has carved out for itself.While Lending Club loves to point out to its investors and those who participate in its online marketplace that a lot of its borrowers have great credit scores, the reality of the situation is that the lowest creditworthy people who are denied loans elsewhere will drift to platforms like Lending Club in order to secure a loan they otherwise would not be able to obtain. This is just simply a function of lending markets: the least creditworthy people will find the lowest spot on the totem pole to borrow money. As you can see from this chart sourced from the company's website, the combined number of ""A"" and ""B"" quality loans have drifted lower, while ""C"" quality loans now make up a majority of Lending Club's loans.Then we take a look at the macro economy. Coming out of 2008, the Federal Reserve moved interest rates as low as they could possibly go, because for some reason it is under the impression that more spending equals a healthier economy. This type of ridiculous thinking has led to the ""recovery"" that we have had over the last eight years, which has basically been institutions issuing more credit for cheaper cost of capital. Banking institutions, universities and automobile dealers have all been issuing credit in record amounts and have all once again perpetuated bubbles in their respective sectors. Lending Club is one of the companies that was born out of the 2008 recovery, and we believe its risky nature has slipped under the radar during this ""recovery.""We know that massive bubbles come around every 20-30 years. This is similar to the bubble that we saw in 2008. In the meantime, however, smaller credit cycles of about seven or eight years also turn over regularly.This is the point that we believe we are at coming out of the 2008 crisis. We could bore you with our exhausting and overreaching argument that the last eight years weren't even actually a real recovery, but instead we will just say that once somebody starts to prick the credit bubble, it is going to be the institutions at the lowest part of the totem pole that start to feel the pain first. As interest rates continue to rise, even nominally, and institutions slow on the amount of lending that they offer, defaults and delinquencies will continue to tick upward. Obviously, delinquencies and defaults will be the most pronounced on the part of people who should have never have had credit to begin with.Enter Lending Club, a pool of investors chasing high yield and borrowers who were likely unable to obtain credit elsewhere. We think the obvious outcome for the broader economy will be significant and continued pressure on all peer to peer lenders, not just Lending Club, going forward over the next couple of years. We think the next few years will be a true test of whether or not the model can even hold up, and we don't want to be invested in a name when it undergoes that type of volatility and that type of pressure from the broader markets. We would avoid Lending Club and all other peer to peer lenders here."
4096279,22148,2017-08-08T11:15:39-04:00,LendingClub confirmed the ability to return to growth.Guidance supports a continuation of the 35% revenue growth reported in Q2.The enterprise value remains too cheap for the lending lending marketplace.,"After the close, LendingClub (LC) reported earnings that generally met analyst estimates. The stock soared as the key to the Q2 report was the return to fast revenue growth as promised by the fintech. At below $6, LendingClub only trades for roughly $2.4 billion. The big question now is whether the return to growth signals much higher stock prices ahead. For Q2, the fintech reported revenues grew 35% over last year to reach $139.6 million. The important part of the story is that revenues climbed to the highest levels since the founding CEO resigned last year. Back in Q1'16, LendingClub reached revenues of $151.3 million. The company grew revenues at an 87% clip at the time, but the fintech is now positioned to top those revenues with Q3 guidance of at least $154 million in projected revenues. Source: LendingClub Q2'17 presentation The key story is that originations returned to growth as revenues were trending upwards due to the larger servicing portfolio. The long-term investment thesis needed more people investing on the platform in order to see a real return to growth. For Q3, loan originations grew to $2.15 billion, up 10% sequentially from $1.96 billion in the prior quarter. The one reason the stock failed to rally after the Q1 results despite the strong guidance was the fact that originations trended down from the prior quarters. The market wasn't convinced that LendingClub could return to growth. With the return to fast growth, LendingClub turns increasing cheap. One needs to consider that the stock originally traded above $25 on the promise in the online lending marketplace.With $764 million in cash, the stock only has an enterprise value of roughly $1.6 billion. Based on the guidance, revenue estimates of about $740 million for 2018 appear too low. Even so, the stock trades at an EV of roughly 2.2x '18 revenue estimates. The key investor takeaway is that LendingClub is no longer beleaguered. The stock should trade at higher multiples with a return to 30% plus growth. Buy the stock below $6."

The online marketplace is now ready to unleash the platform back into growth mode.Despite this plan for returning to growth, the stock is trading down over 7% at around $5.65. The price is actually lower than prior to the pivotal Q4 results back in February. The real question is whether anyone should avoid the stock at this attractive price?LendingClub slightly beat estimates as revenues of $124.5 million topped guidance and analyst estimates. The company reported a small loss that isn't meaningful at this point as the online lending marketplace focuses on returning to growth.The real key is that the company guided to Q2 revenues of up to $137 million. The high-end estimate is more meaningful considering the Q1 revenues flew past the original guidance of a range of $117 to $122 million. A similar beat in Q2 would result in revenues reaching $140 million as easily surpassing analyst estimates.Due to the financial issues last Q2, LendingClub only generated revenues of $102.4 million. The new guidance assumes revenue growth in excess of 30% and reaching the second highest quarterly revenue in company history only topped by the $152 million last Q1.The story is incredible considering an analyst like Mark Palmer of BTIG is forecasting revenues in Q3 of $152 million and a Q4 that reaches $171 million. Basically, LendingClub is forecast to blow past record revenues, yet the market is generally looking backwards at the lack of loan origination growth so far since the scandal.Source: LendingClub Q117 presentationThe valuation proposition remains very appealing on historical basis despite returning to solid growth. At a market cap of roughly $2.3 billion now, investors will start focusing on the 2018 revenue estimates of over $725 million (BTIG is up at $785 million) that makes the stock very appealing at these levels.LC PS Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsWhen factoring in the $781 million cash balance, the enterprise value dips to only $1.5 billion. The EV/Sales multiple dips to a meager 2.1x '18 estimates. Most platforms growing in excess of 20% trade at much higher multiples.The stock traded is trading down as investors probably fret over flat loan originations. LendingClub didn't provide a ton of details surrounding the initiatives to return to origination growth outside of auto loans, but investors need to keep in mind that the company reached $2.75 billion in quarterly originations prior to the CEO scandal or nearly 35% higher.The key investor takeaway is that LendingClub remains a cheap stock. Investors should use this dip to own the premium fintech still trading near the lows despite returning to fast growth during this quarter."

The company posted record high originations, healthy operating revenue, and a second straight quarter of GAAP profits.But the market did not have time to absorb any of the good news, because on the same day that earnings were released (May 9th, 2016), it was announced that the CEO had resigned. It was also revealed that some loans had their details altered. As a result of these two revelations, Lending Club lost $1B in market capitalization over night.The following months were painful for the company. Lending Club's underwriting was questioned by institutional investors. The Department of Justice and the SEC investigated the company. As platform investors halted reinvestment or withdrew, originations dropped and revenue shrank.The remainder of 2016 was dedicated to shoring up its compliance and recruiting top management. Only released one new product during 2016: auto loan refinancing, which had been on Lending Club's road map since at least Lendit 2013.One year later, the question hangs in the air: Has Lending Club recovered?A look at Revenue and ExpensesSource: Compiled Lending Club 10-QsLooking at the company's expenses against its revenue, adjusted expenses are once again positive after three quarters of being in the red. GAAP expenses have continued to climb, as the company has spent a considerable amount on ""one-time expenses"" and has issued tens of millions of dollars in stock compensation to its employees.Delving into Lending Club's expenses, we can see that while sales and marketing expenses have stabilized, origination and servicing have gotten relatively much more expensive year over year. This is a reversal of the Origination and Servicing from third quarter 2014 through first quarter 2016, when the company was consistently more efficient at servicing loans. More about these Origination and Servicing expenses are considered further on.Source: Compiled Lending Club 10-QsMeanwhile, G&A expenses ballooned as the company increased spending in compliance, retention, and recruiting. Despite only releasing one product, relative engineering costs also increased significantly during the same period. The company spent $35M in non-adjusted engineering costs, an increase of $11.5M from a year prior. Why have costs expanded, even though the company hasn't grown?In the first-quarter earnings call, Lending Club CEO Scott Sanborn noted that the company was migrating company services to the cloud, and further explained the increase in engineering costs:Source: Compiled Lending Club 10-QsKeeping tally, revenue has not yet recovered, while expenses for three of the four main categories are up. Next, we take a look at Lending Club's underwriting. Were investors right to be worried?Lending Club's UnderwritingCapital invested on the platform is supposed to be sticky, as investors can easily reinvest any borrower payments into funding new loans. If investors are not achieving the return they expect, they will not reinvest the principal, and the company will need to find new investors to replace the lost capital.Following the Jefferies incident (and even in the months leading up to it), one of the concerns that was brought up in 2016 was regarding Lending Club's underwriting, both in its efficacy and in its efficiency. Many institutions temporarily halted their investments on the platform during the second quarter to do more due diligence, specifically on the concern that additional loans may have had their details changed.While the specific incidences surrounding Jefferies proved to be isolated (and several large institutions have since committed capital to the platform), cumulative dollar charge-offs have progressively increased year over year starting in 3Q 2014.Source: Lending ClubThis issue was recognized in the first quarter of 2016, when Lending Club stated that it had begun eliminating high-risk populations from its credit policy. The company announced several more cuts to its underwriting throughout 2016, most recently eliminating another 6% of borrowers from its credit policy. Cumulatively, approximately 17% of borrowers who formerly qualified for loans were cut from the credit policy.While the company stated that the deteriorating credit policy was centered around high-risk borrowers, interestingly (and somewhat worryingly), we also saw an increase in charge offs for grades A-C during the same period. Lending Club stated that it had tightened its policy for lower-quality borrowers throughout 2016. There is evidence that this policy is working, from the slight shift in the curve for the charge offs for the 2016 Q3 vintage compared to the 2016 Q2 vintage. This rightward shift is not evident for better quality borrowers.Source: Lending ClubWhy is credit deteriorating? Lending Club noted these deteriorating credit trends early in 2017:But, in the first-quarter conference call, Mr. Sanborn commented that: ""The data is still early, but we now have a couple of quarters under our belt where we're seeing that early delinquency rates are coming in line with our expectations. They are stabilizing.""The delinquency rates for grades D-G do seem to be flat/trending down over the course of 2016, but delinquency rates for 36-month loans grades A-C are flat/trending up over the same period.While not a perfect corollary, S&P/Experian consumer credit default indices also show an increase in bank card defaults over the past six months, which suggests that the increasing level of charge-offs is not limited to Lending Club. The same report states that consumer default levels are expected to increase throughout the next two years:The effect of charge-offs on note investor returnsIt is important to point out that charge-off rates are an important indicator to platform returns but are not the only factor. From November 2015 to October 2016, Lending Club raised interest rates by ""a weighted average ... of approximately 118 basis points.""This is evidenced by the current stated minimum credit policy, which reset DTI to < 35%, the same as the platform's pre-IPO credit policy. The median return for portfolios with an average age of 13 months is still 4.6%, or 0.9% below portfolios with an average age of 28 months.Source: Lending ClubLending Club also noted that it is spending a significant amount more on in-house collection efforts. Servicing and Origination expenses increased $2M from 4Q 2016 to 1Q 2017. If Lending Club is successful, the efforts should be able to be seen in the loss curves.In regards to company revenue, it does look like the increase spend in origination and servicing is cost effective. Lending Club noted that, although its servicing portfolio balance only increased 8% year over year, the revenue collected on its servicing portfolio has increased 34%. While it is clear that investors are spending an average of 4 bps more than last year to have Lending Club service their portfolio, it is hard to tell what the effect on platform investor return has been.Source: Lending ClubSticky Capital?In its first-quarter report, Lending noted that it had ""... delivered $2.0 billion of principal and interest payments to investors throughout the quarter."" Since the company originated slightly less than $2B in new loans during the same quarter, this effectively means that the company is treading water in attracting new capital as investor capital outflows are matching new investor capital inflows.If we tally up our score card, we have:Final ThoughtsLending Club was set back by more than a year by the Jefferies incident. I'm still generally optimistic about the future of the company, but not in the near term.This may be semantic, but one thing I noticed is that for the first time since Lending Club has done its quarterly presentations, it has eliminated some long-standing slides from its quarterly report deck. In the fourth quarter report, the ""providing value to both borrowers and investors"" slide was eliminated. In this last report, gone were the ""Business model driving lower costs"" and the ""Efficient Regulatory Framework"" slides. These small changes reflect a culture change in the company, and part of me misses the company that Lending Club used to be. It felt exciting being part of an industry that proclaimed it was going to change the world of credit.It's hard to say where the company would be today if last year's events never happened. But it looks like we'll have to wait a bit longer, as the one thing we can say for sure is that the recovery is not yet complete."
4027559,102505,2016-12-01T10:24:23-05:00,"The fragility of ""true"" marketplace lenders like LendingClub was displayed for all to see earlier this year.Loan Investors, Not Shareholders, Get All the Value Created by LendingClub.LendingClub Would be Worth Far More as a Bank and Should Start the Process as Soon as it Can.There are Plenty of Things LendingClub Can Do in the Meantime to Boost Performance.","A slightly different version of this Post was originally published in FT Alphaville on November 25, 2016 Lending Club's (NYSE: LC) Q3 2016 earnings call was a strange affair. Despite a second consecutive quarter of losses and a year-on-year loan volume decline, the stock actually rose 15 per cent after the call before eventually returning to its pre-announcement level in the weeks that followed. Today it's still worth around $2.3bn, which has led many investors to scratch their heads and wonder how this company can sustain a valuation that seems so at odds with its fundamentals.The fragility of ""true"" marketplace lenders like Lending Club was displayed for all to see earlier this year when market conditions suddenly shifted, originations plummeted and a scandal involving Lending Club's CEO hit the papers. Marketplace lenders (sometimes referred to as P2P or online lenders) transfer loan revenue and credit risk to loan investors at origination, so they earn nothing from loans held on balance sheet. Almost all their revenue is generated from ""gain on sale"" fees earned from new loan sales, putting them on a perpetual origination/volume hamster wheel. Their business model is completely dependent on loan investor demand and risk appetite, which makes them exquisitely sensitive to small market disruptions and credit performance changes that can turn gains into losses and threaten their ability to generate any revenue at all.What, then, could possibly lead investors to continue to value Lending Club so highly?I for one was flummoxed, so I decided to conduct a simple experiment. I would work backwards to determine how much Lending Club would need to earn to justify today's valuation using a traditional price-to-earnings based approach. Then I would look at what Lending Club's financial performance and market value would likely be if it were to become a bank.The takeaway? Lending Club should become a bank as fast as it can in order to reap the economic benefits of its loans and secure a more stable funding base. And, in the meantime, there are changes it can and should be making to increase resiliency and create the foundation for a sustainable and profitable business.Does Lending Club's valuation make sense?The first order of business was to determine if Lending Club's business could support its current valuation. I ran the valuation based on the annualized quarterly earnings run rate for Lending Club in Q3 2018 (2 years from now) so as to allow ample time for the company to turn things around after the recent management turmoil. I assumed a P/E for Lending Club of between 6-8x, which is a generous range for a gain on sale-dependent, liquidity-constrained lender without a balance sheet. For simplicity's sake, I focused the analysis on the 7x middle of the range. (The best comparable for a marketplace lender like Lending Club is probably a mortgage banker like PennyMac Financial (NYSE:PFSI), which currently has a forward P/E of around 7x.)According to my simplified view, Lending Club would need an annualized net income run rate of $329m (at a 7x P/E) by Q3 2018 to justify a $2.3bn valuation.Lending Club's sales & marketing and origination & servicing expenses have oscillated around 50 percent of its operating revenue for the last two years, so I made a management-friendly assumption that those two items would continue at that level for the next two years. I also assumed that loan gain on sale margins (reported in the transaction fees revenue line) and servicing revenue margins would stay at their current levels due to competition, the credit cycle and loan investor conservatism. The composition of Lending Club's loan servicing portfolio was assumed not to change, with servicing revenues moving in step with loan originations.I then did some simple calculations with these assumptions. I assumed that Lending Club doubled its loan originations to $4 billion a quarter by Q3 2018. Instead of the $112 million in operating revenue it reported in Q3 2016, Lending Club would have $224 million in operating revenue in Q3 2018 based on the assumption that transaction gains and servicing margins are unchanged. With sales & marketing and origination & servicing expense taking up 50 per cent of operating revenues, that would leave $112m in operating revenue to cover all other expenses and generate any profit.During Q3 2016, Lending Club's other expenses - which include engineering, product development and general and administrative costs - totaled $88million. I made a really aggressive assumption that, despite doubling its quarterly origination rate, it could hold all other expenses flat at Q3 2016 levels ($88 million) an absolute basis.Lending Club would then show pre-tax quarterly income of $24m ($112 million minus $88 million), or $16m in net income at an assumed 33 per cent tax rate. Multiply that by four and you get $64m in annualized net income, which translates into an expected market cap of $448m at a 7x P/E. That's a far cry from today's $2.3bn market cap.I then looked at what would happen if Lending Club were able to quadruple originations over the next two years, to $8 billion a quarter by Q3 2016, with revenue margins unchanged, sales & marketing and origination and servicing expense at 50% of operating revenue and other expenses flat. Quarterly pretax earnings would be $136 million and quarterly after tax earnings would be $93 million, leading to annualized net income of $372 million. That would translate into a market cap of $2.6bn at a 7x P/E, which is around 13 per cent above the company's current market cap, although the difference amounts to nothing for shareholders absent dividends in the interim.Toggling the combined sales & marketing and origination & servicing expenses below 50% of operating revenue (while maintaining revenue margins and holding other expenses flat) would reduce the origination growth necessary to reach current market cap, but not by much. If LendingClub tripled quarterly originations by Q3 2018 to $6 billion, but only spent 45% of operating revenue on sales & marketing and origination & servicing, it would have annualized net income of $168 million and a market cap of $1.18 billion at a 7x P/E. That's still far short of today's value. Changes in origination margins would have a similar impactThe message seems pretty clear. Lending Club would need to aggressively grow originations over the next 24 months, while margins and other expenses stay flat, to justify the current price for the stock. Lending Club is having a hard time finding buyers to fund $8bn in annual originations today - it's wishful thinking to think management can increase that to $32bn in two years at high enough margins to make it all work, especially when total unsecured consumer online lending in the US is likely to be around $12bn in total for 2016.There's an old adage that value in a lender is found in its liabilities, not its assets. Cheap and stable funding creates economic value in financial services, while good or bad lending can only improve or detract from that value. That's why banks, with their deposits, will be around for the foreseeable future. So shouldn't Lending Club be a bank?Lending Club's basic economics look like this today: it originates and sells loans for around a 5 per cent effective net premium ($100m in transaction fees on $2bn in loans originated in 3Q 16.). If you amortize those fees over the approximately 4-year average estimated loan term for LendingClub loans you get 1.25 per cent per annum in transaction fees on loans, plus 75-80 bps in annual servicing fees, or a little more than 2 per cent in annual revenue on managed loan balances.Unsurprisingly, a bank would make a lot more money if it originated and held Lending Club-type loans on its balance sheet. It's pretty basic math - a 14 per cent loan (the Lending Club approximate average) held at a 1 per cent bank cost of funds (the actual average bank cost of funding earning assets in Q2 2016 was only 0.36%) leaves would generate a 13 per cent interest margin before credit losses every year over the time it holds the loan. If we factor in 6 per cent annual credit losses (Lending Club's current approximate portfolio loss rate) a bank would get 7 per cent in annual net interest margin from holding those loans. By contrast, Lending Club earns a 2 per cent ""margin"" from its fees. The company's loan investors take almost all the value of the economic value for themselves.*Marketplace lenders have to hold capital tooYes, a bank is legally required to hold capital against loans, but it's still a lot of spread income. And let's not kid ourselves - Lending Club has to hold plenty of capital to satisfy investors today (around 9% of its $10.9 billion in managed assets). When you compare Lending Club's 2 per cent annual revenue on loans to a bank's 7 per cent credit-adjusted annual revenue the point is blindingly clear - Lending Club's business would be better off in a bankWhat would ""Lending Club Bank"" be worth? If Lending Club were to increase originations modestly over time and build a $10bn balance sheet (a little less than its current managed assets) funded by core deposits, it should be able to generate at least a 2 per cent return on average assets or at least $200m in annual run rate earnings. Multiply that by a 15x typical regional bank P/E ratio and you come up with a valuation of $3bn. That's more than 30 per cent above what the company is worth today. Additional balance sheet growth over time would only add to value.Despite what many think, Lending Club operates much like a bank today. Lending Club is subject to, and complying fully with, the full panoply of federal and state consumer lending laws such as TILA, ECOA etc. Its loans are currently originated by a regulated bank (WebBank) which makes LendingClub adhere to ""bank-like"" levels of risk management and compliance. Lending Club has plenty of capital (20 per cent of managed assets) to support a banking operation and balance sheet growth. And Lending Club would have easy access to its loan customers for deposit marketing.Of course there are some real issues. Lending Club's business is highly concentrated in one product - consumer installment lending - and some of its higher-risk loans could be problematic for regulators. Asset growth above a certain annual level in any bank can also be problematic. But Lending Club could continue to sell or securitize some loans to control these risks, albeit at a higher cost than holding them on balance sheet. And bank regulators today seem quite interested in bringing online lenders into the fold.When you can't beat them, join themDespite these concerns, industry observers think that Lending Club could become a bank if it really wanted to. But there would be costs to this path. Lending Club would probably have to restrain balance sheet growth for the next several years, particularly in higher-risk loans. It might also have to agree to broaden its product offerings, while bearing the miscellaneous burdens and costs that go along with being a bank. That would delay for some time realization of the full financial benefit of bank deposit funding, but not necessarily restrict volume growth, as Lending Club could continue to sell loans to its existing investor community as its balance sheet grew to accommodate more originations over time. The transition would be messy and protracted, as it often is when a non-bank moves into regulated banking. Clear communications with equity investors would be critical to keeping the focus on the future configuration of the business as a bank.For Lending Club's management, job number one should be converting into a bank as soon as possible. That means submitting a credible business plan that shows the regulators that management understands that growth and yield goals need to be balanced against an appropriate risk appetite. A strong marketing plan will also be needed to gather necessary deposits and support customer growth. And Lending Club should pursue a bank acquisition to speed up the process and lessen concentration issues if the right partner can be found.Time to admit the current model doesn't workBut there are plenty of changes that can and should happen immediately. The first step should be abandoning the cherished idea that true marketplace lending is a viable model. That should be easier to do now that Lending Club's ousted founder, Renaud Laplanche, is reportedly setting up a competitor with a ""hybrid"" balance sheet model where some loans are held on balance sheet while others are securitized or sold. Next, Lending Club should use some of its $800m cash hoard to hold loans and start earning spread income. Most other online lenders are already doing this. By building its balance sheet, Lending Club will be in a better position to weather temporary market disruptions and take advantage of less expensive securitization funding. Securitization will also broaden the base of institutional investors that can invest in Lending Club's loan products - many today can only invest in rated securities.Lastly, Lending Club should try to pick up the pieces of any faltering competitors - Prosper comes to mind - to build volume inorganically.If Lending Club does all these things with determination and speed, it may emerge from the other end of the process as a lean, tech-driven consumer bank with a healthy stock price, strong funding, solid growth and a profitable business model. If it doesn't, equity markets and loan investors will eventually figure out that the marketplace lending Emperor has no clothes and take their money elsewhere.*Another way to look at this question is to compare LendingClub's effective cost of funds to a bank's. LendingClub gives up to its investor/funders the entire yield on loans minus 2% in annual fees. That makes LendingClub's credit-adjusted cost of funds 12% (14% minus 2%). This compares to a 7% credit-adjusted cost of funds (1% bank cost of funds plus 6% annual losses absorbed) for a bank."
4020671,22148,2016-11-07T15:29:27-05:00,LendingClub produced Q3 results showing that the platform is ready to return to growth as incentives were dropped.A large deal with a bank grows the funding sources for the next year.The stock remains cheap under $6 as the online lending platform reignites growth.,"By all accounts the announcements around the Q3 results for LendingClub (NYSE:LC) were amazingly bullish. Only a few weeks back, analysts were still questioning a turnaround of the business and slapped a meager $3.75 target on a $6 stock. The dip in the stock only enhanced my investment thesis at the time.The good news had the online lending platform up over 15% to a high above $6. The question for most investors is whether the quarter was such a game changer that the stock not only holds these gains, but also surges even higher.Banks Are BackThe fact that LendingClub beat analyst estimates for Q3 was good, but the real news is that the online lending platform saw an improvement in the business environment. Key investor groups that left the platform after the ouster of the CEO are now coming back.The most important news of the day was the announced deal with the National Bank of Canada (OTCPK:NTIOF). The bank plans to fund an incredible $1.3 billion on the platform over the next 12 months. In essence, the bank plans to fund an average of $325 million per quarter or some 16% above the Q3 originations of nearly $2 billion.As well, the monthly funding improved to the level that LendingClub didn't need to offer cash incentives to investors in September. The company spent $11 million over July and August to attract funding sources.Source: LendingClub Q316 presentationPlatform originations reached $2.75 billion during Q1 so plenty of upside exists from the Q3 levels. The prime growth area are these banks such as National Bank of Canada where funding is down nearly $700 million since the Q1 peak. Sources such as managed accounts and self-managed individuals are actually providing more funding today than back in Q1 partially due to the incentives.Growing OpportunityThe business even has more opportunities now with the adoption of the auto refinance market. LendingClub estimates that the market includes over $525 billion in annual originations with at least $40 billion targeted in the addressable market.Another opportunity is the growing servicing portfolio that helped stabilize revenue and sets up LendingClub for future growth. Q3 servicing and management fees nearly doubled from last year as the loan portfolio continues to expand despite the slower originations.Source: LendingClub Q316 presentationTakeawayThe end result is that LendingClub ends 2016 with a larger addressable market and recurring revenue stream than starting the year. The stock though trades far below the levels from 2015 when it traded above $20 at times.The key investor takeaway is that LendingClub has turned the corner. The gains today are only the start for a stock with an enterprise value of $1.6 billion. Revenues could easily surpass $600 million next year placing the stock at a bargain at around 2.5x forward sales estimates.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4046239,22148,2017-02-15T11:02:38-05:00,LendingClub beat Q4 estimates signaling a turnaround is on track.The market is misinterpreting Q1 guidance as negative.The online lending marketplace is on pace to return the focus back to borrower growth.,"After the close on Feb. 14, LendingClub (NYSE:LC) reported further progress on the turnaround from the issues related to the founding CEO. The online lending marketplace has made significant strides since the May collapse that left some fearing the company wouldn't survive.The stock rebounded to $6.70 and highs not seen since the resignation of Renaud Laplanche prior to the release of the Q4 results. Is LendingClub a buy on the after-hours dip following some disappointment surrounding guidance?LendingClub reported the second quarter of sequential revenue gains and reduced losses. The ability to stabilize and slightly grow the loan originations since the May issue was a paramount requirement for the marketplace.The company boosted revenues by stabilizing originations throughout the period by reducing incentives. All the while, LendingClub doubled fees from servicing loans though still a relatively small $23 million in revenues.The market possibly doesn't like that originations only grew from $1,955 million in Q2 to just $1,987 million in Q4. As well, guidance for a sequential decline in revenues to around $120 million in Q1 possibly disappoints investors. The market though probably didn't understand that LendingClub cut about 6% of loan volumes in early January due to a reduction in low quality borrowers.The key is that the new management team has remained conservative during this turnaround period. The Q4 revenue guidance at the time of the Q3 earnings release was only $116 to $123 million. LendingClub ended up generating $129 million so investors should take the Q1 guidance of $117 to $122 million with a grain of sand.Conversely, even the recent history of conservative guidance didn't stop the company from projecting full-year 2017 revenues of $565 to $595 million. This guidance assumes revenue of $448 to 473 million in last three quarters of the year in comparison to the reported revenues of $344 million for that period last year. LendingClub is forecasting 25% growth at the mid point. The end result is that annual revenues are still growing.Source: LendingClub Q416 presentationThe real important news is that banks returned to the platform without incentives this quarter. Banks funded 31% of loans during the quarter and a new hedge fund like LendingRobot is prominently raising funds to invest in loans on platforms like LendingClub or other fintechs.So while all the top line numbers are good, the company as well made the wise decision to continue funding engineering and product development. Those expenses jumped 36% over last Q4 to $32.5 million. LendingClub now spends over $125 million at an annual rate on R&D helping squash competitive threats.The key investor takeaway is that LendingClub remains on pace to bring the sizzle back in 2017. Based on the after hours dip, the stock has an enterprise value of only $1.7 billion with $800 million of cash on the balance sheet. The stock is exceptionally cheap trading at 3x revenue and returning to solid growth rates."
4032268,102603,2016-12-22T14:36:10-05:00,"LC is a great underperformer after a year of turmoil.However, a short squeeze could be on the horizon.But what does an economic downturn mean for the P2P lending business?","Shares of Lending Club (NYSE:LC) have gone from $25 a share to roughly $5 a share in just a few years. The peer-to-peer lending company might look to be a 'great' buying opportunity, trading more cheaply than many lending peers, but it could just as easily be a value trap. At the end of the day, Lending Club has transformed the lending business and is disrupting the banking industry. Granted, it's hit some roadblocks, it could be cheap enough now (with a $2 billion market cap) for a traditional lending to come in and buy it up. At its core, it takes on no credit risk and levers its technology to connect lenders and borrowers.Third quarter numbers were solid, with the top line up nearly 11% quarter-over-quarter. Loan originations were up as well. The company is planning to continue investing in its compliance to strengthen controls, which has been a 'weak' spot for the company..Lending Club could also be set up for a short squeeze. Short interest is still close to 17% Meanwhile, top competitor, On Deck Capital (NYSE:ONDK), has a short interest of 8%. As well. Lending Club is trading at an enterprise value-to-sales multiple of 3x, while On Deck is at 5.4x and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) at 4x. Granted, investing in a company because there might be a short squeeze is ill advised. Nor is investing in a company because it looks somewhat cheap. But the good could well outweigh the bad here, and rather quickly.But first, the bad.Lending Club is the pioneer of the financial technology and peer-to-peer lending industry. However, it's hit a number of roadblocks. This includes having to oust its founder and CEO Renaud Laplanche. Lending Club got hit with issues earlier this year, when the fact that peer-to-peer lending goes unregulated led to issues, as Lending Club was said to have sold loans to an institutional investor that did not comply the investor's requirements. Founder/former CEO Laplanche also failed to disclose a personal conflict of interest. Since then, investors (large investors) have been been pulling money from the platform. But this appears to be just a near-term headwind and overreaction, as new investors are showing confidence in the platform.Getting better.That's right, banks and institutional investors (which are funding more and more of Lending Club loans) are already showing confidence in the platform again. The firing of Laplanche, and the fact that banks will have a hard time finding the kind of low-volatility returns that Lending Club loans offer, has helped tremendously. The lending business is one of trust, and Lending Club must work on rebuilding its reputation - hence the investments in compliance and controls the company is making (mentioned earlier).Lending Club CEO, Scott Sanborn, mentioned in late November that banks are already coming back to the platform. National Bank of Canada just put $1.3 billion to work to finance Lending Club loans. Lending Club is also looking to new growth markets, notably refinancing auto loans. But the opportunity lies in focusing on prime borrowers, right now just those with a credit score of 640 or above and history of paying on time. There's a big growth opportunity here as Lending Club navigates the overextended subprime lending market. The auto market is hitting peak organisations, where subprime auto-loan defaults are rising rapidly - to the point that it's akin to what we saw before the financial crisis. Assuming Lending Club can navigate this market as it did peer-to-peer lending, it'll be poised to capitalize on the fallout in auto lending just like it was able to with consumer lending in the financial crisis.More good.The SEC may start regulating the likes of Lending Club, which has been a slight overhang for shares as well. That would mean hindered growth prospects and increased costs to manage regulation. The SEC has asked Lending Club to reveal more about its lending operations and shed more light on non-GAAP measures. In particular, its non-GAAP numbers could be misleading, where it strips out one-time or non-cash items.But at the same time, many companies have faced similar criticism from the SEC over non-GAAP numbers and have simply revised their disclosures to conform. In particular, Lending Club get a letter from the SEC in November saying it had finished its review. Lending Club has started putting together data on its loan portfolio and delinquency rates to comply, and the overhang should clear up in 2017.Plus, not all regulation is bad. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, regulator of the banks, is going to allow financial technology companies the ability to apply for a charter to be subjected to federal banking rules. The good here is that it would give these fintech companies a framework for managing capital and also instill some confidence among potential investors, now that they'd be 'regulated.'The GoodAnother financial crisis, or at least a pullback in the economy could be just what Lending Club needs. The company, and peer-to-peer lending, was born out of the financial crisis, as the banks tightened lending standards, a new form of lending was born.However, since the financial crisis, it's not just individual investors, but larger investors and institutional investors are offering up money on the platform, hoping to generate higher returns than they're seeing in the markets.Investing on the platform offers higher yields and no correlation to the stock market. Meanwhile, the Lending Club stock also hasn't correlated with the stock market, but returns have been abysmal. Per Lending Club, the long-term returns have been between 5%-7% with virtually no volatility.Source: Lending ClubAnd yet, investing in the platform means you own an unsecured consumer loan. Whereas, investing in Lending Club's stock gives you a stake in the company assets. As well, it's not entirely 'sure' how well Lending Club loans and borrowers will perform in an economic downturn. Granted, Lending Club succeeded in the last economic downturn and will likely see demand growth in the next downturn, the big unknown is how current loans will do. That risk; however, looks more than baked into the stock price. In fact, we could see margins rise going forward for Lending Club as repeat customers help push down the customer acquisition fees.In the end, Lending Club could be a value trap, as it's grossly underperformed for investors over the last couple years. However, it appears the 'worries' of investors pulling money from the platform are overblown. It appears that banks are giving Lending Club another chance, now coming back to the platform and and boosting their purchases of loans. By all accounts, Lending Club is looking at a return to organization growth for 2017. On a risk-adjusted basis. Lending Club's stock could be interesting for investors looking to add a somewhat speculative stock to their portfolio.Bottom line - what the market doesn't expectLending Club could impress investors as early as when it releases fourth quarter results. This comes as many major investors are coming back to the platform and we're seeing a strong than expected growth in its contribution margin as repeat borrowers drive acquisition costs down. The company guided on the low-end for the fourth quarter and the numbers should be relatively easy to hit.There's still plenty of growth as well, with the large auto refinance market, which is a large and overlooked market in lending. Lending Club can do for auto lending what it's done for consumer lending, and we may be on the cusp of a catalyst, as the subprime auto industry looks 'overextended.' Lest we forget the small-medium business market that Lending Club could tackle with incremental product roll outs - a market said to be upwards of $200 billion.What happened with firing the CEO could be a black swan like event that has created a very enticing buying opportunity for some investors. Recall that Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), which is trying to crack into the consumer lending business with its Marcus platform, has said to be shopping around for an 'established' company in the industry to jump start its plans. Lending Club would be a natural fit."

To recap, LendingClub is a marketplace business that matches consumer borrowers with investors with differing risk parameters. The May 2016 episode concerned LendingClug selling loans to an investor that did not match specification, and revealed serious inadequacy in the platform, which is largely automated.As we can see in the left hand slide in the chart below, bank funding contracted sharply in 3Q 2016 from 28% to 13% of funding, reflecting the impact of the mis-selling episode. This has now been restored after an incentive program and much work reassuring the bank funding clients that the problem has been remedied.Company dataLC has added a warehousing function whereby it will hold around $100 million of originated loans on its own balance sheet prior to securitizing them, with guidance being for the origination and securitization process to roll over once per quarter. This will allow the company quickly to take loans off the balance sheet of an investor should future mismatches occur. It also expands the company's range by allowing post-origination placement of loans without the requirement that they match particular investor parameters.So the stock was working its way back from the May episode and the results call confirmed remedial actions have been effective so far. Why then the weakness in the shares?This relates to company guidance for 2017. The market was disappointed with 1Q revenue guidance at $117-$122m, EBITDA loss guidance of $-5 to -$10m and net loss guidance (GAAP) at $-38 to $-43m. Full year guidance does embrace an acceleration of revenue growth potentially up to $595m with commensurately greater net loss of up to $84m. 2H losses should be lower than 1H however and the key moment will come when LC re-emerges into a platform building mode.It's valid to ask if the introduction of a balance sheet function dilutes the marketplace business model. Management commented on the call that the move did not sit well with some of them at a deep philosophical level. To my own mind it is fine. LC needs the ability both to remedy mistakes quickly and if it runs its origination function within sensible limits it should be able to place loan bundles efficiently after they are constructed. The question is size and the extent to which the company will subject itself to greater regulatory burdens over time or be exposed to a downshift in risk appetites in securitization markets. In principle the development is nothing to worry about - in the end it is about what works.ConclusionTrading at only ~3.7x prospective 2017 revenue, the current level is a reasonable entry point for investors with patience and a stomach for the turbulence that can come from a young business building scale and complexity of an offering. The gear change from retrenchment to growth should happen around mid-year and slowly building a position into that point in time makes sense."
4023514,80836,2016-11-15T09:34:06-05:00,"For over a year I invested a portion of my portfolio in Lending Club. However, in Q3 I decided to liquidate my position.In this article I will share the reasons for my disappointment, and why I believe investors should avoid the stock.If you want to lend money to many different organizations, just buy a bonds ETF. The yield will probably be lower, but there is no free lunch.","IntroductionI have been investing in Lending Club (NYSE:LC) since 2015. I had a very clear investment plan. As with my stocks portfolio, I find plans to been essential for investors who look for consistent returns. I invested 60% in notes graded B, and 40% in notes graded A. I only lent money to people who looked for credit card refinancing, and debt consolidation as I believe these people are trying to get the financial situation right, and I want to help them. I also only lent to people who were looking for $10,000 or less.The results of my investment after more than a year were pretty satisfying. I managed to achieve high annual return of 8.5%, with only one loan (less than 1%) charged off. I believe that participating in loans of less than $10,000 is a major key, as most people consolidating debt wouldn't want to default and lose their credit score too easily.Well, after telling you how well everything goes, one might ask why did I leave Lending Club. Firstly, if you do want to invest there, I think my strategy is working. However, I still have my fears. The biggest fear is the lack of transparency. It makes it much harder to understand my investments. It works really nicely right now as unemployment is low, and the economy is growing. However, with lack of transparency it's hard to predict what will happen in case of slower economy, high unemployment or even a recession.Why I didn't like it as a lenderAs I said, transparency is the major issue. If I am to lend money to someone, I need plenty of information about him, and the goal of the loan. I believe that people who look to lend money from Lending Club are looking for better interest than they could get from the bank. Banks have plenty of information on their clients, while I got insufficient amount of data.When there are problems with the payments, I barely got enough information. I only got short messages saying that they tried to contact the borrower, and whether a message was left. I need to understand what is going on with the loan, if there is a problem collecting the payments. These way I can know whether I should try and sell the loan for example.Loan goals are not diversified enough. Sometimes it is really hard to understand what the borrower needs the money for. If you want to lend money for medical expenses, a lender should have much more information. A 70 year old guy dying from cancer is a different lender compared to a 35 year old guy who needs a lower back surgery. Without the necessary information, how can I choose where to invest my money. Compared to the world of stocks, where companies release quarterly transparent reports, it feels almost like gambling.The clients coming from Lending Club are usually looking for a better interest rate than they could get from their bank or credit card. If the banks decided to charge higher interest rate, why should I give them lower rate, with less experience than the bank with much less information? It felt too much like gambling sometimes.Why I didn't like it as an investorWhen I analyze a company, I try to see if the products or services it offers are attractive. I don't find Lending Club to offer an attractive service for the lenders. Moreover, the company cannot create strong cash flow. It still loses money, and the inability to show significant free cash flow is frightening. Right now the economy is growing, unemployment is low, and most people pay their loans. If in this situation the company isn't highly profitable, what will happen in times of recession?In addition, there are plenty of uncertainties in the bushiness right now. The first one is the SEC investigation regarding the founder's role in buyback plan, and whether information was withheld from the board. If this is the way a company is run, I am very concerned as a lender, but much more as an investor. If the board doesn't know, investors will have no knowledge as well. Lack of transparency for both the lenders and investors is a terrible way to do business.Another aspect of uncertainty is the large change in the management team back in August. It doesn't make me feel more comfortable, and it might show that the previous management wasn't able to bring results. With such norms, like withholding information from the board, I wouldn't trust the new management as well.The company offers an inferior service, can't give good service to the lenders, and isn't able to create profits in times when the economy grows. I believe that something isn't working the business model, and the SEC investigation for sure won't help. If the platform fails, who will help me as a lender to get my money back?Let's take a deeper look into the fundamentals and valuationFirst, look at the revenues of the company. The company managed to grow its revenues pretty quickly, which might be a good sign for investors. It means that the fee based service is generating a growing stream of revenues. I anticipated it as people are seeking more credit. Growing demand for credit, created huge surge in the top line.LC Revenue (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsHowever, when I analyze a company, the most important metrics for me are earnings and free cash flow. I want to make sure that the company I invested in, has a surplus of cash attributed to its shareholders. I know that some investors like to invest in companies that are losing money, because they are still growing, but this is far from my philosophy.LC EPS Diluted (TTM) data by YChartsAs you can see in the graph above, Lending Club just can't create positive free cash flow and earnings. This is a major risk for investors and lenders. As the revenues grew by over 400%, the FCF and EPS actually declined, which is worrisome. The company might have to raise the fees it charges, as its business model is already very thin compared to traditional lenders like banks and credit cards companies.While I discussed the risks to the company and the fundamentals, it is also important to look at the future opportunities that can drive the company forward. The current structure is much thinner and cost efficient, and allows the company to offer more attractive rates. Moreover, I believe that Lending Club can be a target for acquisition, because it holds the technology and the platform that can benefit traditional lenders. The valuation is very low when as the share price collapsed, and revenues are up. A buyer will probably use the technology and the platform, and will try to make the business profitable. The premium will be significant as valuation is very low right now.However, the current situation is still too bad. The economic environment encourages people to take loans, and the percentage of charge offs is low. It cannot really get much better than that, and it may as well be the top of the cycle. Moreover, another huge risk is the regulation. If Lending Club and its peers will be regulated more tightly like traditional banks, it will have a very negative effect on earnings and cash flow.Moreover, under president Trump, banks might enjoy deregulation, and will be able to compete better with peer to peer lending companies. I truly believe that the deteriorating fundamentals with several major risks, and not enough opportunities should drive investors away.What to do?I believe that investors who look for fixed income should concentrate on bonds ETFs. Sure, the yield might be lower, but there is no free lunch. The higher rate in Lending Club is due to higher risk. While bonds will offer lower yield, they contain lower risks and much more transparency, as you have plenty information regarding the company you lend to.If you are looking for higher yields with higher risk, you can try investing in junk bonds ETF. While there are ETFs that offer a yield of over 25% with huge amount of risk, I like the larger ones. I prefer the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) and the SPDR Barclays Capital High Yield Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:JNK). They offer yields of 5.5% and 6% respectively, which is a great yield in the current environment with modest risks.A more sophisticated investor can try and combine several ETFs. Try combining some high risk junk bond ETFs with medium risk junk bond ETFs. You can also add safer treasury bonds, and even short TMF. Shorting TMF will be profitable as interest rate will go up, and long term treasury bonds will suffer from lower prices.Is it the same?I will start with the short answer- no. While the highest rated note in Lending Club will offer almost 6% return, which is higher than most bonds, investors should remember the difference. Bonds will allow you to create the yield you are looking for with the risk you are willing to take, with much more transparency and no fees for the platform. I believe that investors should keep in mind that there is no free lunch.The higher yields in Lending Club are the results of higher risk. I believe that getting the same yield in the bond market will be much less risky. Start screening for ETFs, and build your own synthetic ETF with the yield you choose and the risk you want to take.ConclusionWhile the risk seems negligible, it is much higher than it seems. You might think, what can go wrong with lending money to average Joe in America. Well, as banks suffer from charge offs, you will suffer them as well. Banks have much more experience than you building a loan portfolio, so you should be very careful. If the bank didn't want a client or offered him higher interest, it probably had a good reason to do it.I invest in stocks for the long term. That is why Lending Club seems very odd to me. Stocks are transparent, easy to liquidate, and you own them directly. These are three major advantages they have over Lending Club loans.Lending Club might bring you similar returns when compared to stocks, but don't get confused, it isn't safer as you might think. The market is smart, and for the long term it is almost impossible to beat it. If it prices assets for a certain price, there are reasons for it.I find Lending Club to be not good enough for lenders which are the clients. If the clients are not happy, it won't be good for investors as well. I advice you to avoid it both as a lender and as an investor."
4017210,40251,2016-10-31T12:59:03-04:00,"LendingClub was a good investment for those who got in cheaply during May. But now is time to take your profits and run.The shares are crashing and I expect it to continue.The FinTech industry is rapidly changing, and it won't benefit the current online lenders. I believe the banks will start cutting them out and offer cheaper loans.LendingClub will probably be acquired, but we don't know when or at what price. Current investors could be sitting on dead money for a long time.Sell your shares and take your profits. Don't try to ride out this storm.","LendingClub (NYSE:LC) was the pride and joy of my portfolio since May. The day after the CEO scandal was announced, I wrote an article about why LC was a good investment at a bargain price. And it was a good investment. My capital gains went as high as 58% in four months.Since then, I've evaluated new variables and older variables that I underestimated in my previous analysis. These led me to sell LC. I sold it at a sizable gain, but significantly less than the high of $6.43 in September. My current belief is that it's time to lock in those gains (for those who entered after May).However, these reasons have nothing to do with baseless attacks from the doom and gloom crowd who accused LC to being risky and fraudulent. These analysts were predicting imminent collapse, and they were off to say things lightly.So what was my original investment hypothesis, and what changed for me to sell my shares?Original HypothesisMy decision to invest in LC was based on its cash flush balance sheet and low market cap in relation to cash. Even now at $4.70 per share, LC is selling for about 2x its cash.But there was more. LC became profitable during the quarter prior to the CEO scandal and it was growing revenue 80-100% annually. My belief was that the scandal was minor and LC would recover its growth (or at least recover to a lower growth level that was still high).Even cutting the growth of 80% in half to 40%, and assuming a P/E of 20 once LC started making money, that would put the price-to-earnings-to-growth (i.e. PEG) ratio at 0.5. Anything below 1 is considered outstanding, especially for rapid growth companies.So with a low PEG ratio, low enterprise valuation (removing cash from the calculation), and combined with rapid growth of 30% or more annually, we had a potential multi-bagger stock investment.I invested in LC thinking I had a ten-bagger.So what went wrong?Newer Developments Since MayThere are roughly four variables that I failed to foresee and/or underestimated.The Share Crash And Revenue DeclinesI get it. Old school value investors don't like to sell shares just because they're going down in the market. But I disagree.A rapid decline from the September high of $6.43 to $4.70 is a glaring red flag. It demonstrates a negative market sentiment toward this company, and it implies share appreciation will be hard fought. Anything less than absolute recovery will be viewed cynically. If we tried to hold through this mess, we could be sitting on dead money for a long time.But why did the shares crash? It seems the upcoming quarterly will show more revenue decreases. It's easy to foresee LC's revenue because their loan originations get released as public documents. Therefore, the share price is a good prediction of LC's performance and more so than with other companies.And if revenue growth doesn't pick up, LC has absolutely no reason to appreciate in price.FinTech Industry HeadwindsAs already noted by another SA author's article, other online lenders such as OnDeck (NYSE:ONDK) and Prosper have experienced declining fundamentals. It's not just LC. The trend seems to be working against LC, not only in regards to market sentiment, but industry headwinds.The Launch of Goldman Sachs' MarcusLast but most important, the launch of Marcus showed the writing on the wall. I don't think Marcus itself is a huge threat to LC. However, Marcus represents a trend that I foresee destroying the LC business model.LC functions by brokering loans between borrowers and lenders. In order to make money, they charge loan origination fees. Many banks have been willing to act as lenders through the LC platform. But the Marcus business model represents a new trend and existential threat to LC.Marcus doesn't broker loans. It simply sells them on behalf of Goldman Sachs. Goldman will be the sole lender and use its own balance sheet. By doing so, Goldman is able to eliminate the pesky origination fees that LC must charge. Marcus' loans will therefore be cheaper and they won't have the inconvenience of having a shortage of lenders.This is a seismic shift in the FinTech industry. My prediction is that every bank will move in the direction of Goldman's Marcus. Online lenders won't survive as brokers if banks cut them out and issue loans themselves.What Marcus is showing me is that LC is an unnecessary middleman. They won't be able to originate loans as cheaply as big banks. And I think LC will die on its own.Conclusion: Is There Hope For LendingClub?LC does have some hope. I believe that a big bank would be interested in acquiring the LC platform to avoid re-creating one from scratch. LC's algorithm in screening borrowers is valuable and not easily copied. Being the largest online lender, it also has a brand and network that is inconvenient for big banks to duplicate.My prediction is that LC will be acquired. This could result in significant upside for current shareholders. But there is a problem.We don't know when it will be acquired and that could result in sitting on dead money for a long time. For example, if they get $6 per share in an acquisition three years into the future, we're looking at 8.5% returns compounded annually from $4.70. Is that enough to take on the risk of owning an irrelevant middleman?I'll let the investor decide. But I won't buy back LC any time soon. There are too many trends going against this company. I'll take my sizable capital gain and move elsewhere.Thanks for reading."
4060004,102758,2017-04-04T03:01:29-04:00,"As rates begin to rise, people who have overextended their credit may consolidate.People seeking new credit may turn to the platform that offers better rates.Lending Club may have an opportunity to turn things around.","ThesisI believe that the tide is turning for Lending Club. I believe there are a number of factors that will contribute to its success going forward. I believe the company will leave negative PR in the dust, grow, and regain a positive EPS. Make no mistake, this is a high risk (potentially) high reward opportunity. This is not an investment for the faint of heart.About The CompanyLending Club operates as an online marketplace that connects borrowers and investors in the United States. The company facilitates various loan products for consumers and small businesses. Types of loans include unsecured personal loans, unsecured education and patient finance loans, auto refinance loans, and small business loans or lines of credit. The company provides an opportunity to retail investors to invest in a range of loans that range a variety of terms and credit characteristics. It serves retail investors, high net worth individuals, banks and finance companies, insurance companies, hedge funds, foundations, pension plans, and university endowments. The diversity of investors across the past two years is shown in Figure 1.Figure 1: Lending Club Investor VarietySource: Lending Club Q4 2016 PresentationThe company has a market cap of $2.2B. It has fallen nearly 80% since its IPO and currently has negative earnings per share. One of the major risks to the company is a fierce regulatory climate. About one year ago the CEO resigned amid a scandal. You can read more about that here. There are a lot of headwinds for the company but I believe they can overcome them.Good GuidanceNormally the first thing I address is value. Traditional valuation metrics are skewed when a company has negative earnings so I will skip right to growth. Negative earnings also results in negative ROE, ROA, and ROC. I will not include these either. However, it is worth noting the company is about fairly valued based on future cash flow.As shown in Figure 1, banks reduced the amount of money they were investing dramatically after the scandal. However, the fourth quarter showed signs of growth among managed accounts and banks. Alas there is hope in the guidance! Regarding full year 2017 guidance, Lending Club expects 17% growth, a GAAP net loss of $84 to $69m, and positive EBITDA. In my opinion the company will go positive again in 2018 if current trends continue.The company's balance sheet is a star among mud. Lending Club has no debt. It has $1.29 of cash per share and a total book value of $2.45 per share. I love a company that has no debt.The Bull CaseNow it is time for the fun part. First, I have been using Lending Club since 2014 and I love it. I say that so you take what I have to say with a grain of salt. I think the worst is over when it comes to bad reputation, barring any other unforeseen circumstances. I think Lending Club absolutely is the future of the traditional banking industry.Bull Case 1: Lending Club offers better rates. The company advertises itself as more efficient than traditional banks. For this reason, loan rates are lower. If you pay attention to Fed chatter at all, one thing is certain. More interest rate hikes are coming. As rates begin to climb, I believe borrowers will care more about finding the best rate. I believe this will lead to more borrowers turning to Lending Club.Bull Case 2: If peer to peer lending continues to grow, a traditional bank may want to get in the game. I would not be surprised if a large established lender bought Lending Club. If we take a look at what banks offer the best savings rates, they are mostly online banks. It used to be about location convenience for banks. Now that we all have smart phones, banks can be located everywhere that we have an internet connection. As traditional banks and lenders fight for market share, Lending Club could be a takeover target.Other factors include a sympathetic white house. One of the main risks for Lending Club is immense regulatory pressure. I believe over the next four years these pressures will abate. This would result in reduced costs and increased revenue.RisksThere are significant risks in Lending Club. The first I will address is further reputation damage. If anything should happen like what occurred in May of last year, the company would have it much worse. That may push away bank and other institutional investment permanently.The next major risk factor is heavy regulation. The company says in its 10-K that ""the regulatory framework for their business is evolving and uncertain"". New regulation could increase legal and compliance costs. The lending business is already strictly regulated.Lending Club is obviously at the mercy of the consumer credit cycle. It goes without saying that if borrowers can't pay their loans, the company will suffer. If charge offs increase Lending Club may lose investors providing the capital for the loans. Lending Club may also have to increase its rates which would reduce its competitive advantage over traditional banks.Finally, there are many peer to peer lending platforms. Increased competition results in smaller margins. Lending Club is certainly exposed to competition risk as the field continues to grow and evolve. If a large lender acquires a company other than Lending Club this would be worse due to significant financial resources the competition would have.Final ThoughtsMake no mistake, Lending Club is a high risk high reward opportunity. I believe now is the time to accumulate if you believe the company can pull it together. If it turns positive and regains a fair earnings multiple, I will be very happy to have owned it at five dollars and change per share. There is also the chance that it does something shady to try and prop up its numbers and does irreparable damage to its reputation. I believe the former. I use the platform and have had nothing but positive experiences. However, I have not used it during a recession. If you have a high risk appetite, Lending Club may be right for you.Disclaimer: I use Lending Club (NYSE:LC) to purchase loans. I have had a very positive experience with it so far so I am either a good example or biased. Read the following article with that in mind."
4012918,102102,2016-10-18T14:45:33-04:00,"LendingClub fell over 7% yesterday based on fears that investment could slow down.However, the market is overreacting and focusing on the wrong side of the LC investment equation.Earnings next week will give more insightful data.","LendingClub (NYSE:LC) has been particularly volatile since the scandal regarding ex-CEO Renaud Laplanche, but the stock's -7% decline yesterday is particularly noteworthy - and seemingly unjustified.Why the Drop?After the market-close last Friday, the company announced it had raised platform interest rates, mostly focused on the lower-grade, higher-risk investment tiers.Wall Street took the news poorly.Michael and others on Wall Street, however, are likely overreacting, and looking at the wrong side of the investment equation.Small Raise Has Precedence - Context is HelpfulLC announced the company would raise rates by a weighted average 26 basis points. Aside from a small absolute value, 26 basis points is also relatively diminutive for LendingClub relative to history.Since late November last year, the company has raised interest rates a few times to adjust for credit losses, amounting to a weighted average of 135 basis points.Including Friday's announcement, that weighted average is now up to 161 basis points. The additional 26 basis points, while indicating decreased loan performance, does not represent a material shift in loan interest rates or the company's business operations.Dynamic Platform is a StrengthThese precedented rate raises also represent one of LC's core competencies and competitive advantages.Real-time platform adjustments such as Friday's announcement serve to limit loan losses and increase investor returns in times of underperformance. LendingClub is able to monitor loan performance and data in real time, and act as necessary to protect investors.In doing so, the company balances supply and demand on the platform. Raising rates attracts investors with higher returns; it also limits losses by decreasing loan issuance to sub-standard borrowers.Focusing on Small VolumeImportantly, LendingClub's filing from Friday revealed lower projected returns for lower-tier investment grades, even coming below the enticing double-digit threshold I wrote about a couple weeks ago.In April, the company projected its bottom-tier loans to return from 8.5% to over 12%.Friday's projections, however, show a sharp decrease in these lower grade projected returns:However, these loans only make up roughly 20% of the platform's portfolio, and the ""G"" tier, with the largest decrease in projected returns, makes up an insignificant fraction of LC's loans.For the most part, investors want creditworthy, stable loan bases in return for lower projected returns. Importantly, these returns are not just holding up; return projections have actually increased since April.Wrong Side of the EquationFinally, the market is looking at the wrong side of LC's investment equation. ""Borrower demand,"" as Michael mentions above, does not represent the ""limiting factor"" for loan growth. There are enough borrowers and loans on the platform to satisfy investors.The ""problem"" LendingClub is experiencing is the supply side - investor financing.After the scandal on May 9th, the company's growth slowed because investors (sources of funding) left the platform. Big banks (such as Jefferies and Goldman Sachs) left the platform and could not reengage without performing due diligence to make sure LC's loans were solid.On the company's 2Q conference call, CFO Carrie Dolan explained:And with regard to future growth:Summary - And Earnings Next WeekIt seems the market overreacted (again) to an announcement from LendingClub. Raising rates should actually attract capital to the platform, which is the current limiting factor to LC's growth. Additionally, the loan mix makes the decreased projected returns on lower grades insignificant.The company is projected to report its 3Q earnings next Thursday October 27th. We will then learn more details, and LC could be in for a movement much more significant than 7%.Read more: LendingClub's Late Loan Mix And Availability - Potential Boon For Income Investors"
4016795,101971,2016-10-30T10:29:46-04:00,"Lending Club guided investors to a 3Q loss of -$15M to -$30M.This may be optimistic, as originations likely shrunk from $1.9B to $1.5-$1.75B.The company is likely to announce an adjusted loss of $20-$40M.","Disclosure: I work at LendingRobot, a RIA specializing in the peer-to-peer lending industry.An OverviewMarketplace Lending Platforms make the majority of their money from origination fees charged to borrowers. In exchange, the Marketplace Lending Platform sheds its balance sheet risk to investors, who buy the borrower's debt and wait for the borrower to pay them back.This model worked well for Lending Club (NYSE: LC), and for the majority of company's history, the company was in a race to find borrowers while the supply of investable cash outstripped the supply of borrowers. Lending Club grew at a nearly exponential rate from 2007 through the first quarter of 2016.Then the platform, and the industry it represents, had a hiccup. And like hiccups sometimes happen, multiple things went wrong at almost the same time. Leadership within the company changed, regulators refocused their attention on the industry, yields started dropping, and originations fell as some major institutional investors either withdrew their money or halted reinvestment. Unsurprisingly then, revenue fell and the company posted substantial losses in the second quarter.There are signs that the company is getting back on its feet as it deals with the issues one at a time. Leadership has stabilized as Lending Club has brought on experienced executives for top positions. Regulators have remained mostly silent. The company has tightened underwriting and eliminated nearly 11% of potential high-risk borrowers from its credit policy. And the company has announced a new product line, auto loan refinancing, hoping to get a piece of a $1T market.Brief Industry NewsLending Club was not alone in its second-quarter troubles. Some of the largest lending platforms, OnDeck (NYSE: ONDK) and Prosper Marketplace, posted losses in the 2Q 2016 of -$18M and -$35M, respectively. Circleback, one of the first Origination Platforms to securitize loans in the US, is facing a substantial drop in originations and is reportedly getting out of the lending game altogether. Despite these industry setbacks, a notable entrant into the online lending space is Marcus from Goldman Sachs.Marcus is positioning itself as a direct competitor to Lending Club's consumer loan business by offering unsecured consumer loans from $3,500 to $30,000. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) took a hard look at Lending Club's business model, identified borrower pain points, and worked to address them. The platform removed late fees, origination fees, and added flexibility to the monthly payment schedule. Since Marcus is a balance sheet lender, there are no pesky investors to deal with.But does this move, the creation of an online lending platform targeting low-value, high-volume unsecured consumer loans, make sense for Goldman Sachs? The average loan originated through the existing online marketplaces is about $15,000 and earns approximately $1,800 in revenue over a period of three years. This is a far cry from the luxury investment bank's usual high-end, high-margin deals. Marcus is now in invite-only beta mode, time will tell if it will be profitable and competitive with the existing players.An update from the second quarterAnnounced this past Tuesday, Lending Club is adding automobile loan refinancing to its portfolio of loan offerings. While the new vertical is getting off the ground, the company will be putting its massive cash reserves to work by funding these loans themselves. If the trial run in California goes well and the demand for refinancing auto loans is high, the company will be signing up institutional money to take over the credit risk.In a previous article, we noted that Lending Club had several chores ahead of it in order to win back investor confidence.Three months later, here is an update to how Lending Club has handled these issues.1) Deal with potential regulatory threatsIn this department, no news (from the Feds) is good news.The bad news is that dealing with this threat has been costly. The company spent about $15M in the second quarter on an ""increase in legal, audit, communications, and advisory fees,"" and this spend is expected to continue into the third and fourth quarters2) Adapt expenses to revenueA key competitive advantage of the online lending model is the ability to have lower overhead costs. Lower overhead costs mean lower rates for borrowers, and higher returns for lenders. The lending platform must be able to adapt to changing times, scaling operations to match the market sentiment. As the company is in a period of contraction, in order to be profitable it must contract expenses to align with revenue projections.There are two ways to lower company expenses. The first is to decrease variable costs, which in Lending Club's case is mostly marketing costs, and the second is to lower fixed costs, which takes longer and is mostly accomplished by cutting headcount.Lending Club announced that it eliminated 179 employees near the end of 2Q. The company would be realizing $2.6M in severance costs in the third quarter, or roughly $14,000 per employee. This severance is concentrated in Origination/Servicing.Based on these numbers, it seems that Lending Club's $30M ($20M adjusted) in expenditures for Engineering and Product Development is unlikely to decrease in the near future and will continue to be a major hit against margins moving forward.Sales and Marketing expenditures decreased 25% from 1Q to 2Q. This is the area with the largest variable spending, which is the easiest to turn up and down with lender demand for notes.As mentioned above, G&A expenditures are likely to remain elevated until the end of the year due to the increase in audit and legal expenses.3) Shore up note investor confidence in the company's efficacy and underwritingOn the plus side, Lending Club had made key hires at top positions inside the company, as Thomas Casey, an experienced executive at top companies, took over the helm as CFO.Unfortunately, one of Lending Club's investment funds posted the first loss in its history in August. While this is partly due in part to changes in methodology to asset valuation, it is also indicative of the lower borrower requirements the company introduced in 2014. Cumulative default rates have risen each year since 2013.(source: Lending Club loan data, internal forecast)The company did take steps to eliminate the series of the 'underperforming loan segment' three times this year, twice in the first quarter of 2016 that eliminated 10% of borrowers, and once in the past month that eliminated another 1% of borrowers from its credit policy. In dollar terms, this recent cut will eliminate approximately $70M in annual originations, or about $2.5M of potential annual revenue.But due to the nature of lending, changes to the credit policy will only be fully reflected in returns after the vintages containing the loan segment either mature or are charged off. This can take up to five years, meaning the last remnants of the old credit policy will be gone in the third quarter of 2021. The fact that these vintages will be contained in Lending Club's funds for the next several years may discourage additional accredited investors from joining those funds. Requested redemptions for the fund in the second quarter were listed as $442 million, which, when redeemed, will translate into a $1.3 million quarterly drop in revenue for the fund. Redemption requests in the fund also mean that the fund is unable to reinvest principal and interest payments back into new notes, which will hurt originations.Lending Club's third-quarter earnings guidanceLending Club has guided investors that there will be 0% growth in originations from the second quarter. The company has stated that they expect a $15-$30M loss on revenues of between $95M and $105M, which equates to an EPS loss of ($0.035) to ($0.077). Analysts have a consensus EPS estimate of ($.07).This number may be optimistic.A look at retail note origination(source: Compiled Lending Club origination data)Available supply on Lending Club's retail platform, which accounted for 17% of all loan originations in the second quarter, decreased approximately 20% quarter over quarter. This puts retail loan originations at between $250M and $300M, and total platform originations between $1.5-$1.75B.Lending Club also issued $14M in incentives to investors in the second quarter, which was recognized as contra revenue. These incentives continued into August, which means that we can expect to see some contra revenue realized in the third quarter.This combination means that total operating revenue will likely be reported at between $85-$95M, with total GAAP net loss of between $35-$65M and adjusted loss of $25-$45M.(source: Compiled Lending Club 10-Q data)As noted above, if Lending Club did a good job of broadly slashing the sales/marketing budget, which was by far its largest cost center, we would expect to see the adjusted loss to be closer to $25M. If the company was not able to cut very deep, we would expect losses to be closer to $45M. The likelihood is somewhere in the middle, with an adjusted loss of $30-35M, or a loss of ($0.077) to ($0.09) per share.Some additional thoughts on the 'nonperforming loan' segmentIt is difficult to see if banks or other originators are experiencing an increase in defaults for the same segments of the loan population, since data for the unsecured consumer installment loan industry is mostly opaque.Would these borrowers receive loan terms at all at any other lender?Are the increased defaults at Circleback, loanDepot, OnDeck, and Lending Club only indicative of inexperienced underwriting, or does it represent an economic signal that the credit cycle is starting to worsen among the most vulnerable?On the Marketplace Lending industryThe Marketplace Lending business has developed past its tinkerer phase, and is evolving from initial adopters to mainstream. But the main adopters are institutions, rather than individuals. We don't know if anyone has pointed out the irony in a bank using an online platform to originate loans yet, but the financial revolution for the masses has failed to materialize. Instead of revolutionizing finance into something new, the old guard has taken over online lending and is adapting it to the existing system.On Auto Loan RefinancingLending Club began as a way for consumers to obtain non-secured loans. The auto loan refinancing business represents a move into secured assets and puts further distance between Lending Club and the retail investors it once relied upon. The company noted that most auto dealers place a 1-3% surcharge on top of the loan that is backed by the bank, and the competitive advantage of the auto loan refinancing is that the company will be able to offer lower rates by cutting out the middleman.In their statement, we noted that loan servicing is outsourced. With no ordination fee charged to borrowers, and no servicing fee charged to lenders, it is unlikely we will see these loans on either the whole loan market or the fractional market. Either Lending Club will remain a balance sheet lender, or it will securitize the loans and sell them in batches to institutional investors.On the future of Lending ClubJaidev Jaradana, CEO of Zopa (Disclosure: Runa Capital is an investor in both Zopa and LendingRobot), pointed out recently that the Marketplace Lending industry is obsessed with growing origination numbers. He stated that Zopa has become profitable by optimizing the business for sustainability rather than for growth.Many pundits believe that this credit cycle will be winding down in the near future. Of course, this winding down has been prophesied since 2011, and as yet has failed to materialize. But the question remains, in what position will Lending Club be when this credit cycle ends? Still struggling to grow originations in the midst of economic headwinds, or with streamlined business model able to make a profit in a downturn?It is important to note that Lending Club still has enough cash and cash equivalents on hand to follow either path.What We're looking for in the next earnings release:1) Results from the necessary corrective actions. Scott Sandborn has been in place since May. We want to see further evidence that he is taking charge and righting the ship.2) A clear path forward. Will Lending Club assume rapid origination growth in 2017, or will it look to balance its revenue and expenses?3) A hint at something new. The auto refinance deal is mildly interesting, but lacks the 'wow' that we would expect from a silicon valley tech company. In order to maintain leadership in the online lending space, Lending Club needs something to reignite the public's imagination.The timing of Lending Club's earnings release (on 11/7, a Monday, at 5 am PT) is interesting and makes us think that the company expects the market to act positively to some sort of announcement. Alternatively, the timing could represent bad news; the only other early morning Monday earnings release was during 1Q 2016, when Laplanche's resignation was announced. Either way, the timing of the release is potentially noteworthy."
4010730,102102,2016-10-07T02:46:46-04:00,"I recently joined LendingClub as a platform investor.
        Musings about loan availability led to the question: how has LC's loan mix changed over the past few years?
        There may be increased loan availability for lower-grade, higher-yield loans.
        Income/yield investors should investigate potential returns north of 10%.","Low prevailing bond yields, coupled with all-time market highs, means finding investments to meet return and income goals is increasingly difficult.I have long heard one can earn steady income, high yields, and great diversification from the LendingClub (NYSE:LC) platform. After recently completing some initial basic research, I decided to deposit some money and begin investing in loans.When discussing this with another investor/Contributor (Ian Bezek), he said investors have complained of low availability for lower-tier, higher-yielding loans. I did some digging to investigate how LC's loan mix has changed over the past few years and the platform's resulting loan availability.Loan GradesThe platform grades its loans from A to G, with interest rates and charge-off rates scaling with loan grade.(source: LendingClub.com)This makes intuitive sense - as borrowers get progressively riskier, charge-off rates rise, and LC compensates by charging a higher effective interest rate.Upon first glance, the higher effective interest rates for lower-tier loans seem to efficiently compensate for corresponding charge-off rates. While charge-offs rise from under 2% to just above 14%, the analagous ~4x rise in effective interest rate could prove riskier loans to be more investment-worthy.Indeed, LendingClub's expected returns by tranch corroborate this theory:If you can tolerate more volatility, it seems the higher loan tranches are worth investing in.Loan Availability/Grade MixIn recent years, however, discussion has abounded that loan availability, particularly for these lower grade loans, has declined. Yield-chasing, along with increased platform popularity and increased risk appetite, could be spurring this diminishment.Is this accurate, though? Are LendingClub's lower-grade loans harder to obtain now than they were previously? LendingClub's loan mix seems to indicates this possibility.Since 2013, the platform loan mix has trended toward the more credit-worthy A, B, and C-grade loans, and away from lower-tier Ds through Gs:Due to LC's platform scandal earlier this year, however, income investors may want to take another look at loan availability.Scandal, Platform Slowdown, and Tranch MixInvestors deserted the platform after LendingClub's scandal. Loan volume, previously growing near triple-digits, actually declined -1% y/y in 2Q'16.While all loan grades saw slowdowns, the A, B, and C loan tranches still experienced y/y growth. Investors apparently still had appetite for the platform's credit-worthy customers:The sub-prime loan categories, however, showed dramatically diminished investor sentiment:Tranch E's -40% y/y growth nearly doubled to the downside Tranch A's +22% growth. D and F/G loans also performed very poorly, decreasing by nearly a fifth year over year. Loan funding in 2Q decreased almost correspondingly with loan grade.Lower-Grade Tranch Availability May Be Increasing:As a result, the availability of lower-grade loans may actually be increasing. Assuming demand is constant, less funding for lower-grade loans would indicate higher loan availability.If high-quality and large-scale platform supporters such as Jefferies and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) do not return in force to the platform, individual investors, particularly those looking for income and yield, could stand to benefit from higher loan availability.The investor/Contributor I referred to earlier, Ian, told me his deposit was confirmed and there was ample availability to invest in Ds, Es, and F/G loans.In this low-yield, high-stock-price world, LendingClub's lower-grade loans, with projected returns above 10%, become very appealing. Income investors may hope larger sources of funding do not return to the platform - they can snap up outsized returns in higher quantities."
4011528,22148,2016-10-11T15:32:03-04:00,"LendingClub is down nearly 5% on a negative analyst call.The online lending industry continues consistent growth supportive of a rebound in the leading marketplace.The stock valuation, combined with expected growth support higher stock prices and not a return to the death watch valuation of May.","After a volatile few months, LendingClub (NYSE:LC) has stabilized around $6. The online lending platform has mostly stayed out of the news over the last couple of months outside of the hiring of some industry veterans.The stock currently trades with an enterprise value of around $1.6 billion, making the news of an analyst target of $3.75 intriguing and perplexing.The biggest issue with LendingClub right now is that a lot of information surrounding the rebound in the business is almost non-existent. The key, though, is that the sector is back into growth mode. The leading platform for peer-to-peer loans is in a mode of convincing institutions to return, making it difficult to see whether LendingClub is benefiting from the market growth just yet.The Orchard Marketplace Index continues to show a consumer marketplace lending industry in constant growth mode. The index designed to measure the loan performance of online lending to U.S. consumers grew to 1,474.81 for the week of October 7, up from 1,469.58 in the prior week. The index was at 1,402 in the prior-year period.Source: Orchard PlatformThe Wedbush target of $3.75 values the stock at only $1.5 billion. Striping out about $800 million in cash, the enterprise value would drop to a meager $700 million.The business is stabilizing, with a revenue run rate of roughly $110 million expected in Q3 when removing incentives of around $10 million. Analysts forecast revenues to rebound to well over $550 million next year, based on banks returning to the lending platform.In essence, Wedbush targets the stock trading at roughly 1.3x forward revenue estimates. This valuation is commensurate with the death watch value I prescribed back in May, when the online lending marketplace was in the middle of the crisis caused by the departure of the founding CEO.For comparative purposes, other online platforms like Yelp (NYSE:YELP) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) trade at much higher multiples. Both platforms were hated by the markets, with Yelp even trading down to a similar level as LendingClub to start the year before the big rally.Sure, Yelp and Twitter rely on advertising spending rather than transaction revenues, but both provide examples of the market turning from too bullish to too negative and back to bullish. Fretting over the business prospects at the lows didn't reward shareholders in either of the above cases.The key investor takeaway is that the Wedbush price target makes no sense. If anything, investors should expect the Q3 results released in early November will likely provide more evidence of investors reengaging with the platform, making the stock a good pick-up below $6."
4007304,95386,2016-09-20T11:02:06-04:00,"Lending Club has a great model passing off the balance sheet risk of their loans to investors.The model allows them to generate revenue on all loans originated.However, revenue does not translate into profits and competition is fierce in the consumer lending market.","Let me start by saying that I truly admire the Lending Club (NYSE:LC) model. They changed how the game is played in the space of consumer lending by originating loans and then selling them as securities to investors. This provides for a win/win/win scenario between the company, investors and borrowers. What this does for LC is it transfers the balance sheet risk from themselves onto the investor who purchases the loans so they essentially get risk-free revenue. What it does for the investor is that it allows them to obtain a return that is most likely higher than their risk-adjusted returns in many other asset classes. With loans charging APRs in the 6% to 30% range, LC can charge an origination fee to the borrower and a servicing fee for managing the loan and the investor can still obtain a 5%-8% return on their investment after charge-offs which is a potentially higher return one can obtain from alternative investment assets. Also winning in this scenario is the borrower who is most likely getting a lower interest rate than they could get from traditional lenders like banks.I believe LC is very similar to Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MC) in the respect that they essentially charge a toll. V & MC charge a small fee each time one of their credit cards is used, but they do not take any risk that the credit card is not paid just like LC charges an origination fee and servicing fee, but they transfer the risk of the loan going bad onto the investor. This drastically limits the downside risk to their balance sheet. But the problem with LC is that they have yet to prove that their model produces any real net income in relation to their valuation. Over the trailing 12 months (ended June 30, 2016) LC has brought in net revenues of $509 million, but the problem is that they had negative $74 million of operating income during that period and a net loss of $72 million. Much of the net loss was due to potentially one-time items in the 2nd quarter such as Goodwill of $35.4 million, an increase in professional service fees of $14.9 million due to items previously disclosed by the board, approximately $14 million in incentives paid to investors and an increase in compensation related costs of $6.5 million associated with severance costs and a retention program. But even if you back out the $70.8 million, LC still lost about a million dollars over the last 12 months. So, the best case is that LC is essentially a break-even company with a market cap of around $2.34 billion (380 million shares at ~$6.15). They do also have ~$832 in cash as of 6/30/16 so their enterprise value is ~$1.5 billion.So why would one buy stock in a company with a ~$1.5 billion enterprise value that doesn't make money when they could just buy a portfolio of properly diversified portfolio of Lending Club notes and earn around 5%-8%? It must be the future earning power of the corporation, correct? Investors must believe that LC will continue to take market share, originate more loans, earn more in origination fees and servicing fees and generally be more profitable in the future. There are a few problems I see with buying stock rather than buying the notes.1. Competition - The business of making personal loans is extremely saturated. LC is not only competing with other peer to peer lenders like Prosper, but they are also competing with banks and other financial institutions. Many of these companies have also been in the space forever like Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Discover (NYSE:DFS), Citibank (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), etc. While LC claims they have the ""secret sauce"" when it comes to originations, one could arguably ask what differentiates their originations from the traditional lenders since they all use the same traditional scoring metrics when originating loans.2. Economic Downturn - What happens to LC notes if/when an economic downturn happens? Most likely charge-offs would increase and investor returns would be affected. Investors may stop using LC to invest and drastically slow the amount of originations.3. Profits - This is the big one to me. LC has been around since 2006 and has yet to really be profitable. Their best year was 2013 where they earned $7.3 million. In 2014 they lost $33 million and in 2015 they lost $5 million. While 2016 is not over, given the poor 2nd quarter they had this year, 2016 will most likely be another money losing year (they are currently sitting at ~$80 million in losses for 2016).My advice would be for investors to purchase notes off the Lending Club platform rather than stock of the company, at least until the company proves they can actually make money. I believe better returns can be achieved by buying a diversified set of their notes and potentially achieving their historical returns of 5% to 8% per annum versus the stock which is overvalued."
3999961,101971,2016-08-16T12:38:24-04:00,Blaming the company's woes on the former CEO is overly simplistic.Negative origination growth most likely started in April.Cost cutting is probably lower than implied.,"Disclosure: I work at LendingRobot, a RIA specializing in the peer-to-peer lending industry.Lending Club (NYSE: LC) released their second quarter results early last week. As widely expected, the company presented an adjusted EBITA loss of $30.1 M (less that I predicted in my earlier article) on revenue of nearly $102.4M, which includes the contra revenue incentive expense (meaning that Lending Club is counting its investor incentive program as negative income, rather than as a liability) of $14 million.2016 Projected Revenue and OriginationsLending Club's guidance on third quarter is revenue in the range of $95-105M (which equates to originations of approximately $1.85B) with an EBITA loss of $15-30M. This represents a $32-$47M decrease from the third quarter of 2015, when the company listed an adjusted net income of $17.9MFourth quarter guidance was a bit hazier, the former CFO Dolan danced around the question when asked directly, but likely to be also be an adjusted loss of some $15 - $20 million with originations hovering around $1.85B (""we anticipate origination volume to be roughly in line with third quarter levels"" she said). This would put 2016 annual adjusted revenue in the range of $430M to $470M, with a total EBITDA loss of about -$35M.If these origination projections hold, they represent a year-to-year decrease of quarterly issuance of 24% and 43%, respectively. 2016 annual origination growth will be roughly flat year over year at approximately $8.5B, while the platform cumulative originations at the end of the year will be around $25B.Three interesting items from the quarter's data1) Non compliant behavior is very costlyAlthough this should be obvious after the housing market collapse (it should have been obvious before the housing market collapse, too), inappropriately changing data on loan applications is wrong, and very expensive. The Jefferies incident cost the company tens of millions of dollars, as the adjusted G&A expenses in the second quarter increased $15.4M, attributable to an ""increase in legal, audit, communications, and advisory fees."" The added legal and compliance expenses are expected to continue into the future, as Dolan noted that these ""unusual expenses"" were expected to drop 80% by the fourth quarter of the year. This means that fraud cost the company about $25M, without even considering future lost business, for a deal that would have brought in revenue of less than $2 M.As my grand dad used to say, ""an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.""2) Negative origination growth started in AprilThere were a few other interesting items to pick out of the quarterly filing, as well as looking at the loan files that Lending Club released a few days ago.The first is that Lending Club made many references to Lending Club founder and former CEO Renaud LaPlanche's exit, and implied that the negative press surrounding his departure were responsible for the decrease in loan demand.As quoted from the call, Dolan mentioned that, ""following May 9th, we faced a significant disruption in our capital supply"". In addition, the former CFO stated that ""this (second) quarter started off strong in April, then following the announcement we made on May 9th, many investors initially paused or reduced their investment activity.""It is correct that there was a significant decrease in new originations following May 9th. Most of May's originations are from a specific loan release in the first week of May, when the company released over 5,500 new loans to their whole and retail marketplaces. While it is absolutely true that investors paused and reevaluated their investments after May 9th, interestingly, the loan file Lending Club released shows that publicly available originations had decreased significantly month over month from March to April (by nearly half a billion dollars), and had decreased year-over-year from April 2015 to April 2016 by $2.1 million. Lending Club may have been planning a significant marketing push in May or June that never materialized due to the circumstances. It is difficult to say how May and June originations would have progressed, as Lending Club's monthly loan originations have tended to vary significantly since mid 2014.The data also shows that the 99.96% of publicly available notes were purchased by investors, with Lending Club pitching in just over $600,000 in funding for their prime standard loan program, which means that the $40 in additional loans the company financed from their balance sheet were not part of the standard loan program.The standard loan program represented 74% of platform originations in Q2, and are loans that available to the public and that data is released publicly. Lending Club also has two other loan programs that are only available to institutions and accredited investors: custom personal loans, which are either 'super-prime' borrowers or 'near-prime' borrowers; and custom loans, which include education, medical, and small business.(source: compiled Lending Club Loan Data)Although the company would like to blame the decrease on the negative publicity surrounding Laplanche, the data suggests that the slowdown began in April. If this is correct, then the simplistic story of Lending Club turning itself around after the resignation of its CEO neglects the challenges the company was facing near the end of the 1q2016. This far out, it is easy to forget that the viability of Peer Lending started to be questioned as OnDeck and Prosper announced huge losses and layoffs, Lending Club's underwriting was being scrutinized as charge-off rates soared, numerous regulatory agencies were taking a closer look into Peer Lending, and the Ezubo Ponzi scheme collapsed costing Chinese investors $7.6 billion.In other words, the numbers the company just released indicate that Lending Club was already facing some (temporary) loan funding issues before the unsavory events of May 9th.3) Cost cutting is probably lower than impliedOne of the encouraging items to come out of the second quarter report is the news that Lending Club was able to adjust costs to match the decrease in revenue, and pointed towards a decrease in marketing costs of $16.3M, as well as a reduction in the workforce of 179 positions.(source: compiled Lending Club 10Q Data)This comes with a caveat, though, as we can see that if we compare quarters year over year. This marks the fifth straight quarter of increased sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue. This means each dollar in revenue has cost more to get than in the year previous. Typically these increases in sales and marketing costs have been more than offset by a decrease in origination and servicing costs, but while the company was able to cut back on marketing this quarter, it was unable to cut back on origination and servicing costs, which increased $1.5M from q1. Overall sales, marketing, origination and loan servicing ate up 69% of revenue for the quarter.(source: compiled Lending Club 10Q Data)Hopefully marketing and sales costs will stabilize in the face of flat revenue expectations, but statements seem to indicate that this may not be the case. The former CFO noted that fourth quarter ""sales and marketing expenses [are expected] to increase relative to third quarter"" and positive margin expansion is only expected sometime in the first half of 2017.Meanwhile, the news that the company cut costs by eliminating 11% of the workforce isn't fully reflected in the numbers yet. While the company eliminated 179 employees, the total headcount of employees + contractors only decrease by 46 from the end of Q1, from 1,545 to 1,499. This represents a Q/Q decrease in employees represents a 3% decrease in personnel. The announcement was made on June 28th (a Wednesday), and some employees who were laid off may have had their last day in July. We'll know more about the total headcount when the third quarters numbers are released.Lastly, the company listed that facilities expenses increased by $4.8 M from 1Q2016, which is a notable increase in fixed costs in a period of extended revenue contraction.ConclusionLending Club's management did its best to put a positive spin on a very unhappy quarter, and reading between the lines shows that the company is expecting a contraction in originations and revenue for the foreseeable future.The story that the company implied for the cause of this contraction (Renaud LaPlanche's missteps caused the board to fire him, which caused investors to become nervous and withdraw funding, which caused the massive drop in revenue, but we're groovy now) is easy to buy into because it is partially true. But the reality is much more nuanced, as it leaves out the considerable headwinds facing the industry as a whole.It was inevitable that the company would eventually face a period of contraction, especially after seven years of exponential growth.Lending Club can be praised for its transparency and the willingness it demonstrated to put things in order. But maybe it can also be appraised for its ability to spin a good story. In the three envelopes joke, remember the first envelope says to ""blame it on your predecessor."""
4006151,101296,2016-09-14T11:51:44-04:00,"Lending Club might have some value, but we aren't interested.Mgmt dishonesty reflects poorly on the entire online lending industry.Looking forward, trust is needed for success.","How We Define ""Fin Tech""The word Financial refers to the finances or the financial situation of an entity or individual. It factors in any item pertaining to or related to money matters. It can also refer to the management of money, banking, investments and credit. As a sector or industry, Financials are often considered to be traditional banks, insurance companies, broker dealers or asset managers.Technology can be defined in numerous ways. It is the practical application of science or knowledge to solve problems or invent useful tools. It is an activity that forms or changes culture. As a sector, Technology companies are classified into categories like software, hardware, services, online and consulting.Most Financials Are OpaqueFinancials are typically credit sensitive. They tend to be cyclical in nature, unpredictable and difficult to model. Most banks, insurance companies and broker dealers have complex and opaque balance sheets. Our preference, which can be challenging to spot in the financial sector, is to identify transaction-based businesses. These businesses tend to be recurring revenue models that generate predictable and sustainable results. We strive to remain disciplined around transparency, low credit or balance sheet risk and to find companies that specialize and differentiate themselves in commoditized businesses.For Example ~ BanksIn the US, there are 12,500 banks, credit unions and financial institutions. We would argue that traditional banking is a commodity business, with the commodity simply being the US dollar. In its simplest form, a bank earns the spread between its borrowing costs (i.e. a savings account) and its loan income (i.e. lending rate). This spread is often a function of interest rates, which tends to be driven by numerous macro factors. The Fed bases its Federal Funds rate on employment and inflation expectations.In our opinion, when a bank is making long-term loans, too much risk and uncertainty exists. We prefer to understand how our companies generate their revenue and income. We model these businesses in excel and make various assumptions about future results. Opaque balance sheets, unpredictable trading results and untimely credit risks are not desired traits we look for.Fin TechOur view of Fin Tech is fluid and somewhat unique. We are looking for any business that is utilizing technology to change an established process or its normal routine. This can range from altering workflows or simply changing from paper to a digital process. Within outsourcing, it could be moving a human interaction to one that is more computerized. Any opportunity to disrupt the normal flow of money or business is the essence of Fin Tech. We realize this is quite broad, but we prefer not to be restrained with category classifications.We have seen estimates that Fin Tech is only a $55 billion industry each year. We have also seen guestimates that Fin Tech approaches $1.3 trillion annually. We are confident it is somewhere between these two figures.In our opinion, a business does not need to be a financial or frankly even a technology company to be a Fin Tech investment. We prefer to deem it anything that simplifies or makes a transaction more efficient.Ideal CharacteristicsWhen we look at businesses to invest in, our companies typically have the following characteristics:Online LendingThere are numerous online lending marketplaces attempting to efficiently bypass the traditional banking model. Many consider this industry to be the ultimate Fin Tech sector, as it is bringing technological advances and change to an ""old school"" business.Following the Financial Crisis, lending slowed. Banks were hoarding valuable cash on their balance sheets, either to be conservative or to adhere to newer and stricter regulatory rules. Online lending was perfectly positioned to capture market share from traditional players and the unsecured lending business was ripe for disruption. The Internet connected individuals seeking to borrow money with lenders anxious for yield. The process to apply for a loan was remarkably simple, even easier than applying for a credit card. Funds were made available in a matter of days, not weeks or even months. The flow of money was loose, as many online marketplaces were simply making it convenient and easy to borrow.Desperately Seeking YieldWith interest rates historically low, banks can bypass paying any interest to depositors and profitably lending it out to needy borrowers (earning the spread). Global growth remains sluggish and central banks continue to advocate loose monetary policies. This includes massive bond purchases and cutting interest rates. Negative yields are rampant and interest rates continue to decline. Recent estimates state that the global amount of debt securities with negative yields is $11 trillion.Investors are frustrated with historically low yields and are desperately seeking investments that will generate any kind of positive return. In a world with miniscule bond yields and stock markets at all-time highs, investors are left with few alternatives. We continue to see references to T.I.N.A., or ""there is no alternative"". Over the last few years, the yield-hungry public embraced the opportunities the online lending sector was offering. These investments were deemed to be high quality, solidly underwritten, low default rates and provide ample yields on average of 9% to 10%. One online platform (Orchard Platform) has a weighted average coupon yield of nearly 14%. It is not just the retail environment chasing yields. Despite an unproven business model, institutional investors are attracted to double-digit lucrative yields.Lending ClubLending Club is the largest online peer-to-peer lending marketplace. Having helped fund more than $18.7 billion in loans to date, the company itself does not assume the credit risk of the loans it helps to sell, but it acts as an intermediary simply connecting borrowers and investors. This online platform is a great example of a ""Fin Tech"" business.Since its inception in 2006 and its wildly successful IPO in late 2014, Lending Club has made over 1.6 million loans worth nearly $20 billion. It anonymously matches users, who need smaller-sized loans, with investors willing to lend. Lending Club does not assume the credit risk of the loans it helps to arrange. It simply connects borrowers and investors through its online platform. Lending Club's loans are under $40,000 in size and are intended for high-quality borrowers only. These borrowers, with FICO scores above 660, seek funds for anything from weddings to medical procedures to home renovations. The loans are divided into $25 securities, which any investor can purchase. Lending Club assigns an interest rate on this security, utilizing its proprietary algorithms. This branchless model leverages the power of the Internet, with an unprecedented amount of data, to connect borrowers and lenders. The concept and premise is a wonderful ""Fin Tech"" opportunity.ManagementThe CEO and founder of Lending Club was Renaud Laplanche. He was a polished, professional securities lawyer from a well-known firm. Lendit is the industry's annual online lending conference and it chose Laplanche to be its keynote speaker four years in a row. Lending Club was the most reputable company in the industry and it wisely added established people to its board of directors including former CEO of Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), John Mack, and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.Early SuccessLaplanche started Lending Club with the stated goal of overturning the old financial order. Lending Club was worth over $10 billion and was widely considered the darling of an emerging ""Fin Tech"" industry. It was transitioning from a Silicon Valley start-up to an established financial innovator.The demand from investors was dramatically rising. Private investment funds were created solely with the intention of buying Lending Club loans in bulk. Laplanche was even successful at attracting banks to purchase Lending Club loans for their own balance sheet. The market was embracing this industry and things could not have been better.The Business ModelOnline peer-to-peer lenders have one of two distinct business models. Balance sheet lenders use their own capital to originate a loan. In our minds, this is as close to the traditional banking model as it gets. The loan underwriter takes all of the credit risk and earns the net interest margin or spread. This, like a bank, is the difference between its cost of capital and its yield. Under this balance sheet model, the underwriter and owner of the loan take on all of the credit risk. It accepts any risks from charge-offs or defaults and eventually can earn greater cash flows. With this model, the lender usually has a formal application process that investigates prior bankruptcies, credit scores, financial resources, employment history and the ultimate use of the loan.The marketplace business model is much more aligned with our investment style and this is the track that Lending Club pursued. Under this scenario, lenders connect borrowers and investors. For each loan made, the platform earns transaction-based revenue in the form of an up-front origination fee. In the case of Lending Club, up-front origination fees accounted for over 85% of its revenue and averaged nearly 4.5% per loan. In order to generate revenue, this model must maintain and grow its lending volume.In addition, some online lending platforms can earn a servicing fee throughout the duration of a loan. This revenue is less predictable, smaller in size and entirely dependent on the quality of the loan. In our opinion, these fees are reliant on generating quality loans. However, driving loan growth runs counter to a platform with less standards, less controls and lower levels of due diligence. In fact, there may be an increased opportunity for borrowers to commit fraud due to lax controls on the ultimate use of funds. For example, in the event a loan is designed to aid in debt consolidation, the marketplace model does not lend itself to repeat customers. On the first-quarter 2016 call, Lending Club's management stated over 10% of all loans were made to repeat customers. This should have been a warning that something was not kosher.TransparencyThis industry has a short history and it has not lived through a full economic cycle. Time will tell how its credit withstands external pressure. It is attempting to re-create the underwriting practice and utilize significant amounts of data to score each loan.Silicon Valley has a somewhat dubious history of generating metrics it feels Wall Street wants to see. Going back to the dot-com era, there were numerous tricks to boost page views or ""eye balls"". In the Valley, this is known as ""growth hacking"". Lending Club seems to have fallen to the allure of creating a model to push growth rates regardless of lending standards or protocols.It is our preference to identify transaction-based business models. In the payments industry, we are attracted to merchant acquirers and processors, as well as the payment networks. These businesses earn small amounts of revenue each and every time a purchase transaction is made. In addition, we like the derivative exchanges, which post real-time transaction data. This allows us to simply model revenue, earnings and free cash flow. On its website, Lending Club publishes vast amounts of information on its loans. In daily filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Lending Club provides 100 fields of data, from job titles to locations to use of funds.AlgorithmsLending Club was relying on its new-age algorithms and decided it did not need to verify the incomes of its borrowers. Management stated that this was not necessary as its unverified loans performed just as well as verified ones. Have we heard that before? If the claim that Lending Club had standards that were more rigorous than conventional banks, this seemed odd to us. Investors simply believed management when it stated, ""we evaluate each borrower's creditworthiness based on the most up-to-date data"". A ""Monday morning quarterback"" would claim that this should have been a red flag warning. Some counter that since credit card issuers do not fully vet and verify incomes, neither should online lenders. We disagree.Card issuers earn roughly 70% of the merchant discount rate. Since they take on the credit risk, they justifiably earn the bulk of the transactional fees. At Manole Capital, we do not invest in card issuers because there is too much uncertainty regarding their credit sensitivity. We prefer the more reliable, sustainable and predictable merchant acquirers, processors and payment networks. Like a credit card issuer, there is too much credit risk associated with online lending. Lending Club was attempting to offset this credit risk to lenders and simply become the de-facto platform connecting borrowers and lenders. While admirable in theory, it seems almost impossible to accomplish.The CollapseEverything changed in early May of this year. The CEO of Lending Club, Renaud Laplanche, was forced to resign. Numerous ethical breaches, including misdated loans and conflicts of interest, were cited. The initial cause of his resignation was from misrepresented details on a $22 million loan package sold to Jefferies. Once the board began to investigate this loan, additional information surfaced. Laplanche owned a personal stake in an external investment vehicle, which he was proposing Lending Club co-invest in. This vehicle was set-up specifically to invest in Lending Club loans. In our opinion, this appears to be a clear violation of self-dealing rules.Starting in 2009, the management team of Lending Club was pushing the practice of insider borrowing. In its early days, it was widely known that it advocated insiders taking out loans to lift important metrics like loans issued and dollar volumes. Executives and insiders claim that these insider loans were widespread, but ""not important"".Lending Club recently disclosed that back in December of 2009, Laplanche and three of his family members had taken out 32 loans totaling $722,800. While we have no insight into Laplanche's financial condition, we assume he did not need the funds for personal use. We imagine that these 32 loans were made to boost platform loan volumes before year end. Loans made with misleading information on SEC registered securities could be considered fraudulent. Even if it does not qualify as fraud, it certainly is a poor reflection on management's integrity.Three months later, CFO Carrie Dolan resigned. Shareholder lawsuits have ensued and the company has lost over 80% of its peak market value. One month later, the company was notified that the SEC was opening an investigation and that Lending Club received a subpoena from the US Department of Justice.New CEO Scott Sanborn is the former chief marketing officer of the company. He believes prior problems were ""isolated"" and that Lending Club is ""back on track"". When questioned about its past activities, one board member does not believe the type of behavior mentioned above was illegal or even unethical. Some might claim that these are only mildly deceptive tactics used to lift the prospects of a scrappy start-up. The Board and insiders stated that these loans only generated $25,000 in revenue and it should be deemed inconsequential. In our opinion, it goes to management credibility. Financial companies tend to be asset-light. The value of many financials is in ideas, service, brand, culture or the quality of its people. In the event a financial loses its trustworthiness, who would look to work with it in the future? Loan originations are the key metric for Lending Club, as it indicates the volume of loans processed on the platform. In the most recent quarter, it rose 2%. Growth was 68% the prior quarter and 90% in the year-earlier quarter. In our opinion, this is a tainted company, with questionable prospects.Valuation2015 was a successful year for Lending Club, as it posted revenue of $430 million, EBITDA of $70 million and $0.14 in earnings per share. The news and hiccups this year essentially wiped out any profitability and dramatically lowered the growth profile for this year and next year.Lending Club currently trades at $5.50 per share implying a market capitalization of $2.1 billion (with 383 million shares outstanding). Earnings expectations are now expected to be negative this year and Wall Street is looking for only $0.07 in earnings per share in 2017. At this stage in its life cycle and growth, one could argue a P/E is irrelevant. Even if there were not questions about Lending Club's future growth, we would feel uncomfortable owning this company at a P/E approaching 80x. The problems of 2016 wipe out more than a full year of growth for this early-stage business, but they also highlight a going concern issue.Earnings can be manipulated, so we tend to focus our attention on cash flow. The cash flow statement rarely lies. Before the surprising revelations in May, Lending Club averaged nearly $50 million of cash flow from operations for three quarters straight. This was promising, as Lending Club was widely considered by many as the leading platform for online lending. It had a bright future and was expected to continue to leverage its position to drive growth higher. Now that there are questions about its platform (and integrity), future business is uncertain. Cash flow went negative last quarter and will likely stay this way for a few quarters. Will investors look to purchase Lending Club loans? Will Lending Club only draw the most risky borrowers to its platform? These are troubling questions we struggle with.We unfortunately do not have confidence this is the winning company in this emerging industry. The sell-side analyst community appears to agree with us. There are 17 sell-side analysts covering Lending Club with of one buy, 15 holds and one sell rating. The investment community also appears to agree with us, as there are 62 million shares short or roughly one-fifth of total shares outstanding.The Industry ImpactThe need to diversify the funding sources and bring in institutional investors is important. This will favor the most established and well-known players. For these online lenders to build scale, the industry needs to provide increased transparency and value additive information around loan performance. An influx of capital into online loans is made possible with heightened transparency. If tools are available to analyze single and packaged loans products, the industry can mature and prosper. Over the next one to two years, we anticipate that the market will continue to mature. However, institutional investors and the important secondary market for such loans might struggle. The key element is trust. How will lenders and the institutional community embrace these loans when so much dishonesty has occurred? Trust is necessary to advance this industry and this just might have been tarnished by a few individuals.We are now seven-plus years from the financial crisis. We are eventually going to encounter another industry downturn and questions remain over how this new sector's credit scoring and how its algorithms will perform. Are some borrowers using online lenders because it is an easier process or because traditional lenders denied borrowing requests?ConclusionSince we are ""Fin Tech"" investors, one would expect many of the items we highlighted for the online lending industry would lead us to participate. The one item that prevented us from initially owning Lending Club was a worry about its credit. Since it avoids bringing the loans on its balance sheet, we were intrigued. Since Lending Club provided huge amounts of data for lenders, we were comforted with its transparency. The last checklist item was Lending Club's management team. We never had an opportunity to meet or hear it speak. Now that details are emerging about its past, we are happy to avoid this company. As of today, there simply is too much evidence of a disturbing culture of mis-information and dishonesty. In terms of investing specifically in financial companies, we continue to focus on credit risk and management credibility. For this reason, we remain on the sidelines.At the 2002 Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) annual meeting, the legendary duo of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger had some wonderful comments regarding investing in financials. After Munger discussed how he is often uncomfortable around most financial institutions' lack of transparency, Buffett had this great financial quote:In terms of Lending Club, we see a company struggling to right itself following years of mis-management. While we do not believe this is another ""iceberg situation"", we believe we can find better investments elsewhere. Unfortunately, the culture of this peer-to-peer lending pioneer was apparently tainted from the beginning. What started as a wonderful ""Fin Tech"" idea morphed into an entity desperately seeking growth - at any cost.There probably is some value in this company, but this is not our type of investment. There is too much uncertainty and too much risk for us to become involved as investors. In the event Lending Club posts better-than-expected results next quarter, one would anticipate a positive response from a short squeeze. In the event it disappoints (on any of its important metrics), we would expect a sizeable fall from its still lofty current valuation. This type of volatility is not to our liking. With this type of odds, we would suggest visiting the roulette wheel in Las Vegas and betting on either black or red.DisclaimerFirm: Manole Capital Management LLC is a registered investment adviser.

Q2 operating income was -$85.3 million.Originations declined 29% quarter over quarter, leading to lower transaction revenue.Cost cutting initiatives are working.There is no clear roadmap regarding the revival of institutional capital.There seems to be no major problem with managed accounts, which have been quite resilient amid the funding downturn.","Lending Club (NYSE:LC) reported Q2 earnings on Monday, and it wasn't pretty. As I've mentioned in previous articles, investors should have expected a significant deterioration in profits. Operating income fell from $4.3 million in Q1 to -$85.3 million in Q2. After adjusting for the $35 million impairment expense, losses still amounted to $50 million.Loan originations, the bread and butter of the business, declined by 29% quarter over quarter from $2.75 billion to $1.96 billion. This was better than expected (guidance was -33%), but negative growth is still negative growth. Transaction revenue, which depended on originations, still shrank from $125 million to $97 million.On the bright side, the management did make some progress on cost cuts. Cost cutting initiatives were revealed in June when it was reported that the company was pulling back direct mailings by as much as 75%. This was reflected in the drop in marketing expenses, which decreased from $66.6 million to $49.7 million quarter over quarter. Investors should not treat this as the cause of the revenue decline, as this was very much a reactive measure to save costs, not a precautionary move that resulted in lower revenue as collateral damage. If the latter were true, then the problem of declining originations could be solved by simply ramping up marketing. Unfortunately, as I explained in previous articles, the lack of capital was the real limiting factor (read The Scandal's Financial Consequence).The management did hint at potential improvements in funding, but did not give a clear roadmap. For example, when asked about bank funding, the CEO responded that: ""We've got a quite clear working plan with banks, meaning we have their diligence lists. We are making very good progress at ticking through them."" The good news is that Lending Club seems to have its managed accounts under control. There was a rumor that the company was mulling about shutting down a fund, which would lower origination volumes even further. Funding from managed accounts still dropped from $811 million in Q1 to $688 million in Q2, but we can see in the graph below that they have been more resilient than other institutional investors.Source: Company PresentationThe fact that the company is keeping a more permanent capital base is good news. Still, if the company wants to ramp up growth as the market expects it to, it is unlikely that managed accounts will be sufficient by themselves, as half of existing funds still come from other institutional investors. While there is no clear plan on how the company will revitalize institutional capital, the new hire Patrick Dunne should be putting up results soon (read Patrick Dunne Can Save Lending Club).Overall, Q2 confirmed my suspicion that the company will start to post heavy losses. The company could solve the capital issue with the introduction of Patrick Dunne. While I have faith in Patrick Dunne's ability, investing isn't about faith, it's about facts. Given the lack of guidance, it's difficult to like the company from an objective standpoint. Hence I maintain my position that the stock is only suitable for aggressive investors who are not afraid to take a big loss if the capital issue isn't resolved.Click the ""Follow"" button beside my name on the top of the page to be updated with my latest insights.

4009799,102114,2016-10-03T14:15:47-04:00,Lending Club's credibility is in question as investors find out about the growing number of issues.Most of the problems happened in the company's early days in 2009.Online lending isn't going away any time soon -- but is it worth the risk to buy the shares now?,"Lending Club IntroductionFor those of you who are not familiar with Lending Club (NYSE:LC) business model, it is a company that cuts out traditional lenders like banks and credit unions to make loans to borrowers for various purposes that include debt consolidation and home improvement (among others). By cutting out traditional lenders, Lending club is able to provide investment opportunities that typically carry a higher risk profile in exchange for a higher-than-average return yield. To limit the risk that a given loan will default, LC makes it possible for an investor to buy as little as $25 of a loan. Currently, LC caps the maximum loan size on the personal side at $40,000, and the maximum business loan at $300k.How Does LC Make Money?Because LC provides the platform to fund loans, they do not bear the responsibility of the outcome of a loan (whereas a bank or a credit union will have a vested interest in the payback of a loan because a default will result in a charged-off loan). Lending club makes its fees at the time of funding, and I have uploaded a graph that shows how the fees charged varies based on creditworthiness.As you can see, the company provides a significant amount of latitude for the most qualified of borrowers, but as the credit risk increases, they eventually charge as much at 6% of the outstanding loan amount as the initial fee for having originated the loan. It is important to realize that this risk is passed on to the investor of the loan because LC receives this fee up front, regardless of whether a first payment is made or not.LC continues to make money from the investors as the loan is repaid, by collecting $.01 per payment on an invest amount of $25. In other words, the return of the investor will also be slightly less than the projected amount because the small servicing fee does eat into an investors interest income. LC also charges fees for late payments, payments by check, and for unsuccessful attempts to take money from a borrowers account.Unlike many lenders, LC offers a generous grace period of 15-days (my credit union offers grace period of 10-days and that is considered above average in the financial industry).What's the Controversy?LC has been thrust into the spotlight after questionable lending and internal loan audit processes that permitted insiders and their family members to prop up the company's numbers during its infancy. The situation that sunk the previous CEO Laplanche was a series of loans that were taken out by him and family members for nearly $750k, and the purpose of these loans were to inflate the company's numbers. LC had a strict policy in place by 2008 that specifically excluded all directors and executives from borrowing using the company's platform.Although the total number of loans were inconsequential, where Laplanche crossed the line was that much of the information used to originate these loans included altered addresses and other falsified information, and this falsified information was tied to SEC registered securities (Bloomberg).Lending Club StrengthsLC is able to do loans that would be otherwise denied in the ""traditional"" banking and credit union industry. At my credit union, we are only allowed to extend someone up to 3x their gross monthly income in unsecured debt, and even then we often do not push this boundary unless the borrower is considered well-qualified. To break these limits is deemed an ""exception"" for which we are only able to have 10% of loans be classified as. For example, a borrower making $5k/month could borrow up to $40k from lending club, but would be unlikely to get $15k from my credit union using the same qualifications. Rates are competitive even when the origination fees are considered. (Especially for A-Paper borrowers). When I applied for a loan through LC I was looking at an interest rate of 6.49% and an APR of 7.86% with all fees considered, meanwhile, a loan from my credit union would have carried an interest rate of 9.99% at a minimum. LC provides enough information that an investor can actually ""underwrite"" a loan when determining whether or not they want to provide capital for a loan. I currently have 44 outstanding notes (with the oldest being from April 2016), and I am currently earning 14.18% Adjusted Net Annualized Return with no delinquencies or defaults. This isn't to say my portfolio will remain perfect, but I am beating the historical average benchmark of 5.7% - 8.32% stated by the company. I feel confident enough in the information that they provide that I can make a better risk-adjusted investment. With every payment made by the borrower, it returns both principle and interest. This is extremely advantageous because the conventional alternative is a CD from a bank where they tie down the capital for a set period of time that can be as long usually as 60 months. By returning capital to investors it benefits LC and the investor, by giving investors money to reinvest into new loans, and by reducing the risk to the investor since a default later on in the loan would represent less risk and setback than a default in the early stages would. LC has operating costs that are almost half of the industry standard costs. The chart below shows how LC has less physical infrastructure and no loan-loss reserve requirements since they have shifted the liability away from their company to the investor. The company also doesn't need to pay for FDIC and other insurance policies that protect the institution from large defaults and system risk.Lending Club RisksLC's reputation has been tarnished by the Laplanche scenario, which in turn has damaged the company's short-term stock valuation. Fundamentals such as loans originated and fees collected would need to dramatically increase before LC can move beyond the scandal. Access to adequate lending capital is still uncertain, and relationships with investment banks and large private investors has been impacted by similar scandal. In January of 2015, LC was put in direct conflict with investment bank Jefferies because a portfolio of $22 million in loans that was sold to them had been misdated. Companies like Jefferies are absolutely essential for obtaining necessary capital to continue funding loans at the rate LC needs. Situations like this further diminishes LC's credibility. The graph below shows how investment capital from all groups was reduced in the 2016 Q2.LC was forced to limit the amount investors were able to withdraw after the beginning of the Laplanche scandal. At one point, clients requested $442 million, or 58% of all assets for withdrawal (Bloomberg). Capital flight like this is clearly concerning and actions like this will obviously make it difficult to attract new and diversified investors. On its most recent quarterly call, LC reported (.09) EPS vs consensus of (.02) . This was also the first quarter that the company has not shown quarter over quarter growth in over 5 years (see graph below). It should be noted Orchard Platform noted an industry wide drop in originations that was greater than LC's. LC's originations dropped by 29%, while the industry as a whole dropped by 34%.Competitive risk from other lenders is growing. While LC is considered an industry leader, it is also working against companies that are also constantly innovating and improving their processes. One competitor, Upstart takes into consideration an individuals' credit score along with their educational history when determining a rate. Most of the competition (like Upstart) is small and privately funded, but the largest competitive risk in my opinion is Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) and this because they offer competitive rates with no origination fees.ConclusionLC is currently facing difficult times, and although there are significant forces pushing against them, I personally believe that the current atmosphere is overly pessimistic considering what they have achieved. As noted in the company strengths, a lot of my optimism comes from the benefit to investors who can invest money in loans that will provide returns that make the average CD look worthless. As baby boomers retire and steady cash-flow income becomes more relevant, I believe that many baby boomers will turn to alternative investments like this. I believe that the benefit to the investor and the consumer is being overshadowed by a continuous string of bad news.LC has already hired two executives from Blackrock and Morgan Stanley in order to repair the relationship with institutional and retail investors. Both of these executives have meaningful and relevant track records that make them the perfect candidates for repairing the damage that has been done.At this point I am rating LC as a HOLD, but would be very willing to change that to a buy on an improvement of fundamentals going forward. In my opinion, the online lending platform is not going away any time soon, so the situation should only continue to improve for LC going forward. LC has a competitive advantage in that it was founded on Silicon Valley principles and maintains a cost of capital that is significantly below the largest financial institutions in the nation.**Although I am rating the stock a hold, I am going to continue making regular contributions to my LC investment account. I feel more comfortable investing my money through this avenue for reasons mentioned above, and also because I have experience underwriting loans so I know what I am looking for."
3997691,22148,2016-08-09T09:49:57-04:00,LendingClub reported mixed Q2 results.The online lending platform made progress in reengaging investors that left after the founding CEO was forced out.The stock remains appealing below $5 as the platform rebuilds.,"For LendingClub (NYSE:LC), the best hope on for Q2 results were some sort of stability that the company could build on going forward. The departure of the founding-CEO left the online lending marketplace on shaky ground.The stock has tread water below $5 since that time period. The valuation is extremely compelling at these levels with the market focused on quarterly results, but the real question remains whether platform investors will reengage at previous levels.The initial signs are that all investor categories are reengaging in the online lending platform. LendingClub already has 15 of the top 20 investors back on the platform. The biggest issue is that the volumes are lower though some investors have taken advantage of attractive rates and incentives to actually increase investments.Possibly the best sign is that the investor mix was largely dictated by the investor type and the regulatory requirements for due diligence. Investor types such as self-managed individuals and managed accounts were less impacted by the May 9th events with the investor groups more focused on investment returns than regulatory restrictions.The banks were not surprisingly the ones most impacted. This group reduced the funding of LendingClub loans by roughly $400 million sequentially for Q2. The managed accounts that includes the LCA investment funds only saw a minor $123 million dip in loan funding despite a Q1 investment level similar to banks.The following chart better highlights the investment scenario after May 9. As LendingClub highlighted on the earnings call, the origination volumes after May 9 amounted to 49% of the $1,955 million for the quarter or $958 million. Based on only 12% funding after May 9, the banks invested only $115 million on the platform despite the period covering 58% of the quarter.In possibly the best sign that real value exists in the platform loans were how new dedicated funds joined the platform to push the managed account category to 54% of the investments after May 9. These funds invested an incredible $517 million when times got difficult after only investing what amounts to $171 million through May 9.In total, LendingClub generated $111.2 million in revenue for the normal transaction, servicing, and management fees categories. The revenues were hurt due to $14 million in incentives to get funds to invest on the platform.The somewhat weak guidance for Q3 takes into account that LendingClub expects to eliminate the incentives at the end of August. As well, the guidance for revenues around $100 million assumes investor incentives of up to 125 basis points of originations that will reduce the revenues somewhere in the range of $10 million. The Q2 incentives of $14 million amounted to 145 basis points.In essence, normalized quarterly revenues for the Q2 origination volumes are around $110 million. This assumes LendingClub can retain volumes without incentives, but no signs exist that loan performances were impacted. The immediate addition of funds is a prime example of how the loans are attractive even during the upheaval.The key investor takeaway is that LendingClub is far from out of the woods yet. The stock valuation though is attractive on dips with stable revenues in the $400 million range and $832 million in cash for a stock worth only $1.8 billion.The stock is definitely appealing on any dips, especially if the CFO exit causes negative headlines that pressure the stock."

This viewpoint of an imminent collapse is simply wrong.There are two main points in the article: The first is that LendingClub is clandestinely issuing supposedly ""shady"" loans to repeat borrowers, and the second is that LC as a company is hemorrhaging investors and cash.Repeat BorrowersA recent post on LendingRobot analyzed the performance of LendingClub's repeat borrowers (Disclosure: I work as an IAR at the company that posted this analysis) and concluded that:How Bloomberg's Article Got it WrongThe Bloomberg article uses misleading language to conclude that LendingClub is in an untenable position. While there are many examples, I've highlighted a few.The Bloomberg article states:Saying that the loans are problematic supposes that these loans perform worse than average. As seen in the previously mentioned study, repeat borrowers perform better than the average loan.The Bloomberg article states:It shouldn't be a surprise that a borrower can have more than one loan since the following is stated on LendingClub's website:(Source: LendingClub)The Bloomberg article states:The article neglects to show the data on LendingClub's income verification. In fact, LC has verified the income of over 50 percent of borrowers since 2010.(Source: LendingClub)What is more interesting is looking at the charge-off rate of these loans. Write-offs for non-verified borrowers are consistently several percentage points lower than verified borrowers.((Source: LendingClub)The article states:This is partially true. Data for issued loans is publicly available, though the company redacts personally identifiable information. Data for applicants who did not receive a loan is heavily truncated. Here is a sample of these entries:(Source: LendingClub)The article states:This statement leads the reader to believe that all investors are jumping ship. Most surveyed analysts don't recommend selling the stock.In addition, the article leaves out that, as one major investor was selling, another was buying. After all, there are two sides to every stock transaction. For instance, Shanda Group bought an 11.7% stake in LendingClub in May, and purchased an additional 3.4% of the company in June to become LC's largest shareholder.Regarding the stock price, the article notes that after Renaud left the company:The article neglects to share that the stock has rebounded 60% from its lows in mid-May.The article states:Actual cash and cash equivalents listed in the SEC filing is $572.9 million. The article neglects to mention that LendingClub also has an additional $259.5 million in sellable securities, which brings the company's total available reserves to $832.4 million. The company could lose $80 million per quarter for more than two-and-a-half years before this reserve is exhausted, something other peer lending companies probably envy.(source: Lending Club)The article states:These two sentences put together imply that the CFO was forced out due to the company losing $80 million. The article leaves out that the CFO decided to leave earlier in the year, and was asked to stay until the company was able to ""navigate current events.""In addition, more than half of LendingClub's recent losses were in one-time costs, including a $35.4 million goodwill impairment for Springstone Capital, a company that was acquired in 2014. The authors also leave out that two very experienced individuals were joining LendingClub: Timothy J. Mayopoulos, president and CEO of Fannie Mae (OTCQB:FNMA), as an independent director on LC's board, and Patrick Dunne as chief capital officer.Purposefully misleading narratives like the one that Bloomberg published add unnecessarily to investor anxiety, as well as cause knee-jerk investors to sell their investments prematurely. Does LendingClub still face an uphill battle? Undoubtedly. Did the authors selectively pick facts to suit a specific narrative? Unquestioningly.The Long ViewAlthough investors in the stock shouldn't feel anxious, there are items to keep on the radar for the next few quarters.This means that LendingClub's business model of low overhead will be tested, as the company will be required to halt its spending growth to match the lower projected revenue. LendingClub has shown willingness to cut spending already by slashing its marketing spend and decreasing headcount 11%.RegulationThis may be one area where no news is good news. The Justice Department and SEC opened an investigations in May following the scandal, and LendingClub has stated that it has cooperating fully. LendingClub had $14M in increased compliance, oversight and legal spending in the second quarter as the company deals with issues surrounding its origination process.Winning Back InvestorsWinning back institutional investors is key to LendingClub's long-term success. While the majority of large investors have returned to the platform and have resumed investment, as of the August 8th, 2016, 25% of the largest 20 institutional investors have not returned to the platform.Shifting from Growth ModeAfter an extended period of hockey-stick growth, LC is stuck with an extended period of stagnant origination and revenue growth. On top of lower loan demand, LendingClub cut roughly 10% of loans from its credit policy in the second quarter, which could account for roughly $360M in decreased originations for the remainder of 2016. Originations will end the year flat at $8.5B, and I expect adjusted revenue to be between $430M and $470M, with a total EBITDA loss of about -$35M.Moving ForwardReading articles like the recent Bloomberg piece makes it sound like there are still ""shady things"" to be uncovered, but this is unlikely. With the stock currently trading at 2x book value, the bad news of lower revenue and originations for the next two quarters has already priced into the stock. I expect that if the company's recent key hires succeed in quelling regulators and attracting institutional money, the stock will rebound quickly."

These two key business advantages imply an ability to adapt to changing market conditions, quickly increasing capacity in times of expansion and decreasing capacity in times of contraction.It has been three months since the departure of former CEO Renault Laplanche shook the Peer-to-Peer lending industry and bumped the company from its hockey-stick growth projections into a contractionary period. Therefore, the second quarter earnings report will represent an important validation of the Peer-to-Peer model. How well will Lending Club's (NYSE:LC) internet-based business model adapt in periods of contracting revenue?Laplanche's departure amid allegations of scandal set the company on a month long damage-control mission. Further upsetting markets was the news that regulatory agencies would be closely scrutinizing company transactions. In addition, the company disclosed that pockets of loans were underperforming expectations. This triple whammy caused the stock price to tank and wary investors to pause funding of new notes.To restore investor and note investor confidence, the company was tasked with three important missions:First, the bad news: second quarter earnings expectations are dismalThe platform lending model has been marketed as a method to reduce costly overhead and provide flexibility to adapt to changing economic landscapes. Lending Club did not fully appreciate the impact of Laplanche's departure would have on investor confidence, and therefore did not begin cutting expenses prior to May 9th 2016.What is impressive is that within two months, Lending Club reacted by reducing headcount by 179 positions (11.5% of its workforce), tightening underwriting policies, and increasing oversight.Despite these quick changes, the company has made no secret that this quarter's results will be drastically lower than previous quarters. Total operating revenue is likely to be between $110M-$125M, a decrease of $27-$42M from the first quarter 2016.This decrease in revenue, combined with several large one-time write-downs, means that the company is likely to report a second quarter loss of between $90-$120 million, or $0.23-$0.31 per share.The company's cash will be decreased by a further $40 million, as the company was obliged to fund approximately 2% of loan originations from its balance sheet. From a historical perspective, this will represent the largest percentage of loans funded from Lending Club's balance sheet since December 2011. To add perspective, in Q1'16 the company funded just under $1M from its balance sheet, or 0.05% of originations.Though diminished, the company's cash should remain significant at approximately $420M. This cash reserve allows the company some flexibility moving forward.Internal Auditing has only turned up minor infractionsIn response to the increased scrutiny, the company launched an internal probe. The auditors turned up revealed two infractions.Lending Club reported that they have instituted policies and procedures to ensure that infractions of these sorts do not happen again in the future.While internal auditors have completed their investigation, government regulatory agencies have not yet released any findings nor announced any fines. This suggests that fraud was limited in scope and affected only a small fraction of notes.Adjustments moving forward: how tighter underwriting policies will affect revenue potentialAs mentioned in my previous article, Lending Club earns the majority of its revenue from loan origination fees, which presents a potential conflict of interest. The company has a short term incentive to lower the threshold required to obtain a loan so that more loans are issued and revenue is increased. If loss projections are higher than anticipated, the risk/reward ratio becomes threatened as yields fall. As a consequence, note investors will pull funding.Lending Club's credit policy has evolved since its founding in 2007. Since December 2010, most of the evolution has been in the form of loosening credit restrictions for high-risk borrowers. Loosening restrictions widened Lending Club's target borrower market and fueled faster growth.(source: Compiled Lending Club 8k Reports)In September 2014 the company loosened its credit policy and raised the acceptable level of a borrower's DTI from 35% to 40%. Borrowers who fell inside this new category represented an immediate increase of 3.2% of originations in August 2014, which has nearly doubled to 6% as of March 2016. Most of these new borrowers fell into grades D-E, which corresponds with higher risk.In early 2016 Lending Club announced that it had discovered 'pockets of loans that were underperforming expectations'. According to SEC filings, Lending Club tightened credit requirements effective June 7th, 2016, returning DTI limits to 2014 levels. Their reasoning was explained in a 8k filing:Lending Club did not release statistics on how these underperforming segments were affecting investor return. The two questions are therefore,(Source: Compiled Lending Club data)Although not directly comparable due to improvements in the company's overall underwriting algorithms, we have some reference to how these borrowers have done as a population as credit was extended to this category from the company's founding until late 2010. All of these notes have now reached maturity, which gives us the opportunity to calculate a definitive ROI. The results are stark: while the platform average return during this period was 7.7%, notes with similar characteristics to the underperforming segment returned -33%.LendingRobot estimates that the elimination of these poorly performing segments will raise the platform average return by 0.6% to 1%. For those investing in higher-risk borrowers (grades D-G), returns may increase 2% to 3.5%.While this move will benefit note investors (and hopefully lead to greater investor retention), in the short term the move will hurt company revenue and impede company growth. The segment that Lending Club cut from their credit policy represents a permanent decrease in annual originations and revenue of between $400-$600M and $20-$30M, respectively.Investor appetite for notes is returningWhile Lending Club has not yet released data files pertaining to loans released in Q2'16, a look at the retail loan inventory on their website offers an insight on investor sentiment.(Source: Internal LendingRobot Data)From April 1st to May 9th, Lending Club released an average of 495 loans per day. From May 10th to July 10th, Lending Club decreased the amount of loans released in its retail channel to 279 per day - a 56% drop in new loan offerings. Even though new offerings fell considerably, inventory remained high for another month, representing a sharp decrease in investor demand and a reason why Lending Club was forced to use their balance sheet to fund some loans.Since July 10th note releases have returned to 90% of their former levels and inventory levels have returned to historical levels, both of which suggest that retail note investors are returning to the platform. Although inventory levels and loan data will need to be watched, this data seems to point to origination growth resuming in Q3'16.An important milestoneLending Club has stated that second quarter loan originations are approximately $2B. Following this quarter, the company will break an important milestone: $20B in total originations. This represents growth of 185% in the past year.Stock buy-back imminent?As a reminder, in February 2016, the board authorized $150 million to repurchase shares in the open market. While the company's available cash has decreased over the past quarter, the current depressed share prices may represent an opportunity for the company to use its war chest to buy back shares once cash flow has stabilized. Although there are many options for the company's cash, a strategic share buyback would send a clear signal to the market that the company believes its is undervalued and sees continued growth ahead."

Monster Worldwide is acquired for $429 million, or $3.40 per share.Qualcomm is involved in a security flaw that leaves 900 million Android devices at risk.","Twilio Reports Strong Quarter and GuidanceAlthough Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) still reported a loss for the quarter, it was able to top earnings per share estimates, reporting a loss of 8 cents per share, besting the consensus estimate of a 15 cent-per-share loss. Revenues climbed a whopping 70% year over year to $64.5 million.As for expectations, the company guided for Q3 and full-year revenues of $63 million to $65 million and $253 million to $257 million, respectively. As it stands, analysts were looking for $61.14 million in sales for Q3 and $242.37 million for Twilio's full-year.Despite these numbers, shares climbed just 1.2% on the day, but I guess that's what happens when the stock is up almost 200% from its IPO price a few months prior.Guidance for both numbers are decisively higher than estimates, and in combination with the top and bottom line beat for this quarter, perhaps some investors are perplexed by the stock's reaction - although it did hit a fresh high before pulling back in Tuesday's session.Perhaps investors will also recall analysts' ""subdued"" reaction when they were able to issue their new ratings for the stock, with five of six analysts rating it with a hold or equivalent, and just one analyst recommending it as a buy.So where does that leave investors? Despite the company serving a slew of big tech players, like Airbnb (AIRB), Uber (NYSE:UBER), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), the stock has its work cut out for it.Big sales growth and industry-leading customers will help, but trading at 17x revenue is a rather large hurdle to clear. Case in point, the company expects to do about $255 million in sales this year. Its market cap is ~$3.5 billion.That's where the issue lies within the stock, although it is a very good company with strong growth and quality customers. Its valuation is another story.LendingClub Searches for Bottom, C-Suite Exodus ContinuesWhile Twilio may be the headline for successful (so far) IPOs, LendingClub (NYSE:LC) is certainly in the littered field of disastrous public debuts. Shares are down 80% since late-December 2014 and more than 50% this year alone. The company originally priced its IPO at $15 per share, but opened its first day of trading at $24.75.Shares currently trade below $5.This is really one of the most painful charts that I've come across in a while. I mean investors have been underwater from day one, unless they were in it for a quick bounce.Although the company has struggled, the bottom really fell out in May when its CEO resigned alongside three other senior managers after several ""dodgy loan sales"" had surfaced. A Justice Department subpoena and several probes followed as a result.On Tuesday, the company reported an earnings per share loss that missed analysts' expectations while also announcing its CFO would be resigning. After initially falling Tuesday, the stock has actually rebounded quite a bit, closing flat in the session at $4.79.This could be investors deciding that all of the negatively is already priced in. It could also be short covering, given that the stock is down immensely from basically any point pre-May 9th. As of the most recent reading, about 20% of the stock was sold short.Investors are now getting into an interesting situation. With shares this low, a lot of the risk is clearly baked in, with shorts likely tempted not to press their luck too much. With that being said, the company has seen its top leaders go and sales growth plummet. Revenue growth of just 6.5% pales in comparison to the 97% growth it put up in the same quarter last year, and even the 86.6% growth is registered just last quarter.Analysts weighed in, here.Monster Worldwide Reports Earnings. Oh Yeah, and Sells ItselfMonster Worldwide (NYSE:MWW) has agreed to be sold for $429 million. The announcement came at the same time the company reported earnings, which resulted in a loss of 2 cents per share on revenues that fell 10% year over year to ~$151 million. Both results missed expectations.From the press release:The deal came at a 22.7% premium to Monday's closing price, but some investors seem torn. Shares are trading near $3.60 per share, perhaps on the expectation (Read: Hope) that another bidder will emerge, boosting the price of the takeover.The company trades with a minuscule valuation on an earnings basis, and at just 64% of book value. That to some warrants a higher buyout price.On the other hand, the company has been struggling to turn a profit and has seen revenues fall for each of the last four years. So to many, Monster is lucky to have gotten off a sale, given that it is somewhat of a sinking ship.Perhaps the deal works out for best parties. Randstad gets a property at a discount under the current deal, and Monster gets out at a higher price. However, one could argue that the company could have been turned around without being acquired, likely causing frustration for some investors given the valuation.Shares are down 65% over the past five years and 39% this year, even with Tuesday's rally.Qualcomm Exposes Risk to 900 Million Android PhonesQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has been on quite a tear lately - and it's been a while since anyone was able to write that. The stock is about a buck per share off its 52-week high, is up 24% this year and approximately 45% from its lows in February.However, there appears to be a security issue at hand, not that you'd be able to tell by the stock price's reaction, up 0.7% on Tuesday. Actually, it's a pretty serious security flaw.Wired did a great job explaining it in the excerpt below (bold emphasis added by me):The damage is widespread too, affecting some 900 million Android devices. The fact that it's Android really makes a different too. Not that iOS devices aren't vulnerable to their own security issues. But because Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) controls both the hardware and the software, it can make software updates a breeze. However, with so many different manufacturers using Android, the same cannot be said.For instance, only 15% of Android devices have updated to the latest version, Android 6.0 Marshmallow. If you're assuming it's because users need more time, it seems that's not the issue: Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) released this version in October 2015.It's proving difficult, without question, as Qualcomm has already released fixes for all four issues over the past few months, but they have not been fully rolled out yet.So what's the outcome and who's on the hook? It's hard to say at this point. While the problem starts with Qualcomm, the patches have been made and now it's up to others to get the updates pushed through. If any hackings occur, someone (or multiple companies) may suffer as a result. For now though, the stock is carrying on as usual.Tech TidbitsAlphabet's shares hit a new high in Tuesday's session, climbing to $813.33 at its highs.

Loans originated via Lending Club's website are often ""crowd funded"" by large group of individuals contributing small amounts (which is why these loans are sometimes referred to as peer-to-peer loans). This model stands starkly opposed to that of more traditional creditors such as banks.Perhaps the most important difference in its model to note is that Lending Club itself does not act as the creditor for the loans it originates, and thus it is not exposed to the risk of borrowers defaulting. Lending Club is merely providing market transparency and price discovery in the market of personal loans. In return, Lending Club captures a fee: partially from the borrower, partially from the returns lenders make. Thus, unlike traditional player in the credit services industry, Lending Club is not only offloading the credit risk of borrowers, but it is also actually paid to do so!This unique business model gives Lending Club some significant cost and risk advantages over others players in the credit services industry, putting it in ripe position to be an industry leader as the company recovers from a recent messy transition period and a scandal involving its recently departed previous CEO.Recent Struggles and Recovery ThesisIt's no secret that Lending Club has been going through some tough times of late. Its previous CEO Renaud Laplanche recently left amid scandals that the company sold $22 million of loans to institutional buyers which did not meet the buyers' criteria (investors/lenders on Lending Club include both retail individuals and institutional investors). Obviously, Lending Club requires both a demand for loans from borrowers and a supply of capital from investors in order for the company to capture fees and revenues, and the threat of less loans originating as institutional investors back out has hurt its share price.LC data by YChartsSince Laplanche's departure though loan origination volumes have already begun to show signs of recovery, picking up from weekly lows to their highest levels since Mr. Laplanche resigned. There is likely still some short-term fallout to be had as we near the company's rescheduled Annual General Meeting on June 28, however, there are several compelling reasons Lending Club is well positioned to be a credit services industry leader whose stock is set to recover:1) Lending Club's business model remains intact, flexible for a variety of economic environments, and gives it a fundamental advantage over other players in the industry2) The company is healthy, its financials are solid and loan originations continue to steadily grow3) LC is supported by tailwinds to the industry and more specifically to its niche model of crowdinvestingBusiness ModelThe years since 2008 have seen a crackdown on consumer lending by both regulators and risk-taking investors themselves. Much of this was needed; clearly, the rampant mortgage lending that led up to the crash was unsustainable. Yet, while more conservative lending practices have overall been healthy and necessary, investors and lenders may have over-corrected to some degree (as markets tend to do). As a result of the much tighter credit markets, many individuals and small businesses that are otherwise well qualified for loans have found it difficult to find credit and financing.This has begun to change somewhat, with strict lending requirements in the last couple years beginning to loosen once more and debt burdens picking up from post-recession lows, however, overall household debt burdens are still well below their long-term average and their pre-crisis highs. The above chart of the mortgage credit availability index is nearly laughable (if it wasn't so tragic).US Household Debt Service as Percent of Disposable Income data by YChartsWhile many lenders remain wary to get involved, for the savvy investor with longer time horizons and higher risk tolerances, the very inefficient marketplace of small consumer loans represents an opportunity to diversify into a highly uncorrelated source of income, with a potential for relatively high returns as well - inefficient marketplaces reward market makers and liquidity providers (in this case lenders) at the expense of liquidity takers (in this case borrowers).In an environment where credit is hard to come by, even for qualified borrowers, peer-to-peer loan sites such as Lending Club offer a unique value add to its borrowers and lenders alike.The recent trouble LC has run into does nothing to change this basic dynamic. Its business model remains sound, and both isolates LC from loan default risk while giving it a strong competitive advantage over other industry players.One could even make the case Lending Club is uniquely positioned to gain from a continued stagnant or worsening economic environment. In an economic slowdown, if defaults rose, traditional creditors would be punished while - all else equal - Lending Club would take no direct hit. But even putting defaults aside, or even if we make the clearly optimistic assumption that they would remain constant in such a scenario, as traditional creditors become less willing to lend borrower demand on Lending Club will rise - and just as we saw post 2008 - this rise in demand may come in large part from reasonably qualified borrowers, the loss rate for investors who diversify in a large number of LC's loans may surprise you, especially when considering that nearly the company's entire life as a business has played out during one of the worst economic periods of the past several decades.Thus, an economic slowdown would seem to stand to benefit Lending Club itself (though arguably not the investors in its loans) proportionally more than LC's industry peers, making its business model uniquely resilient to economic fluctuations compared to that of its competitors.Company is Profitable and Financials are HealthyA sound business model is nice, but it's far from the only thing a company needs to be an industry leader, so let's talk some numbers. LC's recent results from Q1 (ended March 31, 2016) showed that the company was able to turn from a net loss to a profit with revenue of $151 Million and a net income of $0.41 Million. Cashflows from operating activities have also continued to grow steadily, as have loan origination rates.Since Lending Club derives its revenues from fees (a portion of the value of loans made), its revenues are directly correlated with the rate of loans originated in its marketplace. It is highly encouraging then to see that quarter-to-quarter loan originations are consecutively and consistently growing.It is only fair to note that the impact of LC having to buy back some of the loans related to the recent scandal will only fully be seen once the company reports its Q2 results on August 2nd, however, if this can be limited to a one-time event, LC will have no problems recovering. As the company's acting CEO recently mentioned, the robust state of its balance sheet (with over $800 million in cash) means it is in no immediate danger.As long as the company can continue to grow loan originations, which it has been able to steadily do so far, the growth in operating income and revenues will continue to follow.LC Revenue (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsWith a business model that scales efficiently, now that LC has broken a profit, and as revenues continue to rise, margins and earnings should continue increase as well - and at an even greater rate than revenues.Tail Winds and Industry GrowthLastly, not only is consumer demand for sources of capital growing - arguably benefiting many of Lending Club's competitors along with LC itself - its niche within the industry is growing faster than the general industry.The rise of the sharing economy, crowdfunding, and crowdinvesting- like peer-to-peer loans - further serves to underpin LC's competitive advantage over its industry peers. There are obstacles to face, as with many industry pioneers (especially those in financial services), the threat of unfavorable regulation is always present, but the flip-side of that threat is the first-mover-advantage leaders like LC have against others seeking to emulate its model.Politically at least, with relatively pro-business candidates having locked down the US presidential nominations for each major party, the risk of LC facing tighter regulation in the near future is arguably far less than it was a mere few weeks ago.Either way, the trend of increasing marketplace lending is real and likely here to stay. Already the practice of peer-to-peer lending is on the rise in other countries, such as China, and while this does not directly benefit LC, as the practice becomes more commonplace, the risk of a negative perception from regulators also decreases. With peer-to-peer loan origination rates rising in the US and around the globe, LC is perfectly positioned to fully capitalize on a burgeoning market trend.ConclusionWe can't simply outright dismiss the recent turmoil shareholders of Lending Club have had to endure, but the company is actively making changes, its business model remains intact and gives it advantages over its industry peers, the company is financially healthy and growing both loan originations and revenues, and there are healthy tailwinds supporting the industry and LC more specifically.For these reasons, despite recent troubles, Lending Club stands to act as a leader in its industry, and the recent dip in share price may represent an excellent opportunity for investors to ""buy when others are fearful.""Thank you for reading.

Previously, I talked about why Lending Club (NYSE:LC) will have a tough time bouncing back (read Lending Club Has One Year). Between falling origination volume and a lack of capital, it was just only a matter of time before the company folds - unless the management can find a way to regain investor confidence. Until now, the company has not been successful. Just three weeks ago, private letters leaked that the company may be planning to wind-up one of its funds. So what happened? By hiring Patrick Dunne as the Chief Capital Officer last week, Lending Club has taken a huge step forward in restoring investor confidence.Why This Is A Big DealA Chief Capital Officer's duty is to source capital. Over the past two months, the management has tried to accomplish that very goal, but to no avail. There are two reasons. First, there is no trust between the existing management and outside investors. You can't really blame the capital providers and brokers (i.e. hedge funds, investment banks). If the management was willing to lie to their faces, why should they trust the management now? Secondly, no one wants to work for a sinking ship. With the stock down in the gutter, ex- CEO dumping shares, and the whole Street going against the company, where is the future?And so it's a miracle that Lending Club was able to nab Patrick Dunne. He had recently retired from BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), so it was quite a coincidence. Considering that Patrick would not have to put his professional career on the line by working with a failing company, Lending Club got very lucky.Why is this man the key to Lending Club's survival? Let's take a look at his past titles. He has served as the President of BlackRock Asset Management International, the Head of iShares Global Markets and Investments, the Global Head of Securities Lending And Cash Management, the COO of Barclays Global Investor Services Europe, and the Head of Strategy at Global Investor Services North America, just to name a few.What's so special about these job titles? First, Patrick clearly has a global network, given his service in international divisions. Secondly, he is a master marketer. Perhaps this is not obvious from the job titles, but one of his biggest roles at any of the firms listed above would've been marketing.Take the iShares business. There are literally thousands of ETFs under the iShares brand. Many fail (like Lending Club) every year, Patrick was able to grow that business nevertheless. So even though many products failed to perform (much like Lending Club) and were eventually shut down, Patrick was able to convince more and more investors to buy more of iShares' products anyways ( check out the growth in Australia). That is a rare skill to have. Given the growth of the iShares business, we can be sure that investors trust him no matter what.His experience as a Head of Strategy is also worth mentioning. The name is a bit of a misnomer in my opinion, as a strategist's job is not to make money for clients, but to pitch ideas so that the bank can make money. This is certainly a good experience to have when he deals with Lending Club's assets, which have been eschewed by some of the prominent hedge funds. He can draw on his experience as a strategist to ""spin"" Lending Club's assets as a potentially attractive investment.By combining Patrick's global reach and his unique skill set, I believe that Lending Club's need of capital could be fulfilled soon. Of course, it is yet to be seen whether Patrick can overcome Lending Club's stigma. Nevertheless, I believe that daring investors may want to pick up a few shares to bet on a continuation of rapid growth once the money flows again.Click the ""Follow"" button beside my name on the top of the page to be updated with my latest insights.

        Shares are down 80% since the IPO and a corporate governance shakeup is in order.
        A private equity firm has bought up 15% this year already.","LendingClub (NYSE:LC) could be begging for an activist investor. The company has seen its shares cut down by 60% in 2016, and now down 80% since its Dec. 2014 IPO. All this because of some falsified documents, which ultimately revealed some corporate governance weaknesses.The big issue is that LC sold some loans to investors, and the documents on those loans weren't 100% accurate. In particular, LC founder and then CEO, Renaud Laplanche, also owned a stake in a fund that LC invested in, of which, wasn't disclosed. However, the founder and CEO has already stepped down given the issues.Do we already have an activist?Renaud Laplanche, the French entrepreneur, could be the activist LC was looking for? Now, what we could see is a founder turned activist. This is something that's not uncommon, where we've seen this to some degree with Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) and Chip Wilson. Basically, a founder gets ousted, but loves the business and knows the potential, thus they work to take the company private.Laplanche been talking with banks and private equity players to see about raising some money to take the company private. With the company trading at a $1.8 billion market cap, it's still a decent size deal. However, it does have about a third of its market cap covered by net cash.Then there's the pseudo activist, the Chinese private equity firm Shanda Media, which has taken a 15% take in LC over the past few months. Shanda has been looking for growth opportunities in the U.S. Certainly, P2P lending is still a growth investment - especially if we're on the cusp of another recession. What's interesting is that Shanda was a buyer of LC before the allegations were revealed.But even after the news, they took advantage of the cratering stock price to buy more. Would they team up to buy all of LC? That doesn't really fit their modus operandi, but I think they'd certainly support a buyout. Shanda has filed as an activist, although it's generally known as a passive holder. However, they have said they plan on having a continued dialogue with the company.Is LC the next Ocwen (OCN)?Let's face it, there's still a lot of hate for the big banks. Conventional lending remains broken and there's still plenty of room for disruption in lending. The P2P (peer to peer) economy was born from the last finanical recession. By all accounts, we could be headed for another recession soon, which could be just what LC needs.But the NYDFS (New York Dept. of Financial Services) is on the prowl. These guys have it out for the lending industry, having put the hurt on Ocwen. They're now looking to probe the LC's lending practices. They have a subpoena from the Department of Justice.LC has a leadership position, being the largest P2P lender. They have an installed base and name recognition. It's a little different than the OCN case, but that's the big worry - a regulatory crackdown that fundamentally hurts the LC business model. So, the question remains, is it the next Ocwen? Or is this a generational buying opportunity? The business model is solid and there's long-term viability. LC does some $8 billion a year in loans, while the entire consumer lending market is said to be worth $3.5 trillion. LC remains a threat to conventional lenders, with JPMorgan's (NYSE:JPM) Jamie Dimon noting that Silicon Valley is coming for conventional lenders.Are things really all that badLC has been knocked down to reality, now trading at 1.6x book value, which is more in line with conventional credit servicers. The market has forget about the growth potential at LC overnight. But in truth, LC is cheap compared to top non-conventional lenders Discover Financial (NYSE:DFS) and Capital One (NYSE:COF), which both trade north of 1.7x sales. LC is at 1.6x. Book value wise, Discover trades at 2.2x.The other beauty is that costs remain low thanks to no branches, low bank regulations and automation - all of which help keep rates lower for borrowers. It's a win-win where investors can get 8% returns - above comparable debt instruments - and borrowers pay 12% or so for a loan to consolidate credit card debt that they're paying nearly 20% on.As with anything, it takes time to re-build trust. Investors paused making loans on the LC platform, but assuming the fallout is contained, investors should quickly come back around. LC brought on Pat Dunne from Blackrock as its Chief Capital Officer. He's handing the investor group, which handles partnerships.How I think of LCLC is the Uber of loans, seamlessly matching lenders with borrowers. Yet, it trades like a old world bank stock with no growth. The business is pretty streamlined, where LC has computerized the analysis of risks and rates. LC has already solved the chicken and the egg problem with any marketplace. Creating a platform for buyers and sellers that has enough value to keep both parties coming back.The next level for LC is breaking beyond credit card consolidation into medical and small business lending. They don't have to deal with loan brokers - which is something OnDeck (NYSE:ONDK) utilizes - and can lead to force and irresponsible lending. I like LC as a put against the market. If the economy starts to show, there should be a return to the P2P lending industry and LC. Trading at 1.6x book value it's cheaper than the majority of the modern credit lenders and servicers."
3983950,22148,2016-06-23T14:14:06-04:00,LendingClub has seen the stock rebound from the death watch lows from mid-May.The fintech sector is starting to show some signs of improving data points after a disastrous period.The stock remains attractively priced even if the loan demand doesn't rebound.,"The fintech sector might be beaten down, but the sector is finally showing signs of revival. Numerous sector participants hit speed bumps over the last few months leading to significantly lowered valuations.For its part, LendingClub (NYSE:LC) remains under extreme pressure as the company deals with the fallout of the CEOs departure due to lack of internal controls. The stock has rebounded to the $5 level as Q2 comes to a close and key loan origination volumes show improvements, though down from the fast growth.The question now is whether investors should continue buying LendingClub despite the nearly 40% gains from the death watch price in mid-May?Sector ThawingInternal data from LendingClub, a securitization from fellow fintech player SoFi, and a retail investor survey all provided positive signs that the late Spring freeze in the sector is starting to thaw.Data from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) suggests that a May swoon in LendingClub retail funded loans is now stabilizing close to flat over the prior year. The amount is still a sharp decline from the prior growth rates, but stability will allow the platform to start moving back to normal.In total, the analyst forecasts that Q2 originations on the LendingClub platform will only grow 5% YoY. Such a low growth rate will pressure the revenue estimates. The online P2P lender obtained over 80% of revenues via the transaction fees of loan originations during Q1.Possibly the most interesting news of the week is that SoFi completed a $380 million securitization that included 28 investors. The deal had investor demand for nearly 3x the amount suggesting that institutional investor demand for at least highly rated online loans is returning.Kroll Bond Rating Agency gave the bonds a single-A rating. The one downside is that the demand doesn't clarify whether institutions are willing to invest in the more risky loans that LendingClub lists as Grade C or below that account for roughly 50% of the originated loans in past periods.An AlphaWise survey of retail sentiment suggests that 70% of respondents plan to increase investments in loans on the LendingClub platform with only 18% planning to discontinue investments. More importantly, 23% of respondents expect to stop investing on a temporary basis suggesting that retail investment appetite is due to rebound.All of these data points are further signs that the top players in the sector can thrive in the future as the dust settles.Difficult To ValueThe biggest issue with valuing LendingClub is the current disruption to the business model doesn't provide a clear view of the future. If the company generated $85.6 million in transaction fees last Q2, the market should expect roughly $90.0 million in fees this quarter based on only a 5% increase in originations.The good news is that other revenues should more approximate the recent Q1 totals with servicing fees likely above the $16.9 million due to a higher balance in the servicing portfolio. Assuming management fees and other revenue stays the same sequentially at $9.8 million, Q2 revenues would reach $116.7 million.The company had operating revenues of $96.9 million during last Q2 so possibly LendingClub ends up with 20% revenue growth. The growth rate will slide going forward unless originations improve.So if loan demand is rebounding, investors get a stock with an enterprise value of roughly $1 billion with a big asterisk as the $868 million cash balance is at risk in short-term loan purchases. Of course, based on historical loan performance, LendingClub will actually make a profit on these loans temporarily held for sale.If revenues reach $500 million for the year, investors get the stock for an enterprise value of roughly 2x the revenue run rate.TakeawayLots of risk still exists as the company remains under regulatory scrutiny and the new CEO has yet to get out in front of the investment community. The stock though remains a bargain below $5 as the fintech sector starts showing signs of improvement.Investors might want to hold dry powder in case LendingClub's stock sees another blip, but the recommendation is to build a position or maintain the one previously built on the death watch price from last month."
3985327,101971,2016-06-29T16:05:08-04:00,Lending Club will be taking one-time q2 write-off of between $45-70 million.Q2 2016 Originations are expected to be approximately $1.4 billion - a third lower than Q1 2016.Lending Club's Underwriting has remained consistent over time.Lending Club has had a history of actively managing borrower/investor equilibrium.Lending Club remains a viable company with a bright future.,"Disclosure: I work at LendingRobot, a RIA specializing in the peer-to-peer lending industry.Lending Club's Shareholder MeetingLending Club (NYSE: LC) held a momentous shareholder meeting on June 28th. There were several notable items reported by the company:Reading between the lines, the company is expecting to plunge into the red in Q2 2016 in the ballpark of $90-$120 million due to the reduction in revenue combined with several large one-time expenses. In addition, revenue growth is not expected to rebound to previous levels for the rest of 2016.Does this report spell the death-knell for the company? Probably not. When evaluating a business's long term potential, it is easy to get caught up in the latest crisis and forget that a valuation of the business should include an examination of the core business model.A look at Lending Club's Core BusinessLending Club was founded on the premise that banks are not optimal vehicles for issuing personal loans, and that the process of underwriting can be more efficient. Lending Club uses efficiency gains as a business advantage, and passes on the lower expense ratio in the form of lower rates for borrowers and higher returns for lenders.With the business advantage of lower costs, it is important that the company find the appropriate risk premium to maintain an equilibrium between the supply of borrowers and supply of investors. If Lending Club charges too much, there will be no demand for loans and if too little is charged then investors will find investment opportunities elsewhere.These two aspects represent the fundamental core of Lending Club's business, and ultimately form the base for how Lending Club should be valued as a company.Lending Club's Cost Advantage(source: compiled Lending Club 10Q Data)Through the past 13 quarters, Lending Club has maintained its cost advantage and has even steadily widened its contribution margin. Although Lending Club still spends most of its revenue on sales and marketing expenses, so far they have avoided committing to heavy fixed costs. Theoretically having lower fixed costs provides Lending Club the flexibility to adapt to natural swings in loan availability. Q2 and Q3 2016's earnings report will therefore be quite interesting, as the company is anticipating the first decline in quarterly loan origination and revenue growth since the company's founding. This decline will prove to be a test of Lending Club's ability to adjust on-going expenses in response to a decline in revenue.The second critical aspect of Lending Club's core business is the ability to maintain an equilibrium between the supply of borrowers and investors. Lending Club has often stated that they do not want to take on credit risk; the company would prefer to function as an intermediary between investors and borrowers.Supply / Demand ManagementIt has been pointed out that Lending Club has been required to fund a larger percentage of loans originated on the platform in the past month. Lending Club reported in their shareholder meeting that they have purchased approximately $40 million of loans (representing approximately 2% of total originations) in May and June 2016. The company is hoping to sell these notes at a later date, and has also taken great steps in extricating themselves from credit risk, going so far as to offer $9 million in recent investor incentives.A look at borrower/investor equilibrium shows how well Lending Club has managed to avoid funding loans themselves over time.(source: compiled Lending Club Loan Data)This chart shows the quantity of loans funded by investors as a percentage of all loans originating on the platform. In the early days of the company's history, Lending Club took on more credit risk as the company struggled to spark investor interest in borrower notes. Between January 2013 and April 2016, between 99.91% and 99.99% of all loans that have originated on the platform have been funded by investors.This is quite a remarkable balancing act, especially considering loan origination volume grew nearly 9-fold in the same period. To accomplish this, Lending Club actively managed borrower marketing campaigns (consistently allocating approximately 39% of revenue on marketing) and borrower interest rates (adjusting rates over 50 times since the company was founded).A Potential Conflict of InterestIt is not enough to just look at the borrower/investor equilibrium over time to see how well they are managing supply and demand. Entering into this equation is a potential conflict of interest, as Lending Club earns the majority of revenue from loan origination fees. Especially since Lending Club's IPO in 2014, this means that the company has a short term incentive to lower the threshold required to obtain a loan so that more loans are issued and revenue is increased. While this temptation exists, lowering this threshold would be detrimental in the long run, as a lower quality of underwriting would result in increased defaults and increase the risk premium demanded, which would upset the supply equilibrium.Although critical to the long term success of the marketplace, detrimental changes to the underwriting may not be readily apparent to the outside observer since risky borrowers typically take a few months before they default. In addition, Lending Club has been growing at an exponential pace since inception in 2007. Since cumulative defaults increase as loans get older, this means analyzing charge-offs is not trivial.However, drastic negative changes in underwriting can be detected by graphing the total number of defaulting loans against the volume of new loans issued and observing the difference in slopes.(source: compiled Lending Club Loan Data)The graph shows the slope of the normalized log issued and default loan counts. Holding the increase in default loan counts constant, we can see that growth of new loan counts is greater than the growth in default counts (with a slope of 0.0459). This suggests that the platform's underwriting policy has remained resilient to short term growth pressure.ConclusionIt is important to note that Lending Club has popularized an asset class previously reserved for institutions and the rich. This asset class has provided returns for investors that are much more stable than equities and bonds, as seen on the historical performance chart at LendingRobot.com.Despite the recent setbacks, Lending Club's core business of efficient underwriting has not changed. Lending Club has maintained consistent underwriting policies, used a variety of tools to actively manage borrower/investor equilibrium, and has had a history of lowering their expense ratio. Lending Club remains a viable company with a bright future."
3983934,101938,2016-06-24T13:29:03-04:00,"LC needs institutional capital to grow, and institutional capital has become scarce for reasons that have nothing to do with the recent scandal.The growth investor base of LC may flee.Q2 is going to be ugly.","Since the announcement on May 9 that its founder and CEO, Renaud Laplanche, would be stepping down at the behest of the board, Lending Club (NYSE:LC) has been on a wild ride. The stock got cut in half, from $7 down to $3.50, a Department of Justice investigation was announced, and numerous articles in the financial press have sought to dig out the juicy details and inside dope of the scandal and its aftermath. Here on Seeking Alpha, a dozen or so articles have been published in just the last month, which must be some kind of record for a company of this size.I will not detail the company's business model or its recent foofaraw, as those have been summarized ably elsewhere. I get into the details that I need later in the article. For now, suffice it to say that LC is a marketplace lender: they make unsecured personal loans to individuals, and then resell those loans, or portions of them, to retail investors or in larger chunks to institutional investors. The question is whether, and how much, the Laplanche scandal imperils the company.The bull case has been made several times. It is pretty simple: the troubles surrounding Laplanche's exit are minor, and the issues from a business perspective are superficial. Lending Club loans are a good investment, and this fact will inevitably draw capital to fund the loans. Therefore, institutional capital will come back, the company's growth will continue, and all will be well. In the scheme of things, the current troubles are a minor hiccup.The bear case has not been made so clearly, and that is my goal in this article. There are actually two separate but related threats in the current situation to Lending Club: a threat to the business, and a threat to the stock. At the end of the article, I will give my outlook for the company.I. The Threat to the BusinessThe first thing to acknowledge is that, at its current size, Lending Club barely makes any money. It only turned profitable in 3Q15, and profit margins are 2-3%. Nor is it a particularly efficient business. Return on equity is less than 0.5%. Because a lot of that equity is cash idling on the balance sheet, ROIC is higher, but still unimpressive, at less than 5%. If LC were steady in its current state, it would not be an attractive business, with a P/E over 100. (See most recent 10-Q for numbers.)Nevertheless, each quarter these metrics improve, because each quarter LC grows. And it has grown impressively:(Source: company presentation, company financials)The bottom line is that, to be a viable business, Lending Club needs scale, and to get scale, it needs its growth to keep up.Can Lending Club grow?Lending Club started out as a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) app, a literal club where members would lend to people. The original idea was that the loans it made would be funded by individual, retail investors. The problem with this model is that there just is not enough retail capital to get LC to the size it needs. LC discovered some time ago that it needed institutional capital in order to sustain its growth. In 1Q16, institutional capital made up 55% of the funding for its loans.A year ago, LC's growth was demand-constrained: it could not find enough quality borrowers to take the institutional money that was beating down its doors. Today, the situation is reversed, and LC is supply-constrained: it cannot find enough institutional capital to fund a growing volume of loans. To grow, LC needs institutional capital.Can Lending Club find institutional capital?In the short term, no. We know this because they have tried and failed, repeatedly. The financial press has been full of articles about Goldman (NYSE:GS) and Jefferies withdrawing plans to invest with LC, Citigroup (NYSE:C) stepping aside, and approaches to hedge funds, which went nowhere. In each case, the news is negative. If there were some success to report, we'd hear about it.Will institutional capital come back in the long term?The bull case for LC rests on the idea that institutional capital has only shied away briefly. There are two basic arguments for this optimistic view, and they are both wrong.Argument 1: ""Institutions have been scared off by the Laplanche drama. But fundamentally, the issues surrounding Laplanche's exit were minor, and after a short cooling-off period, the big money will be back.""Institutional capital is not drying up because of the recent scandal, although that certainly hasn't helped. We know this for two reasons. First, capital has been drying up across the marketplace lending space. OnDeck (NYSE:ONDK) has had to fund more of its own loans. SoFi has set up a hedge fund to invest in its own products. Prosper (PRMA) could not find as much funding as it would like, and neither could Avant (AVNAT). Blackstone bailed on plans to enter the category. The causes of institutional capital flight, therefore, are not unique to Lending Club.Second, it was capital drought that drove Laplanche to take some of the actions he did. Laplanche suggested that LC invest $10M of its capital in an entity called Cirrus (which LC eventually did. The board's problem was not with the investment, but Laplanche's lack of disclosure of a personal stake in Cirrus). The idea was that Cirrus would leverage this money and invest, say, $20M into LC loans.This is a backdoor way of taking lending risk onto its balance sheet, which violates the asset-light business model LC had advertised and operated with from its inception. (From the 2015 10-K: ""Our business model is not dependent on using our balance sheet and assuming credit risk for loans facilitated by our marketplace."") Why would Laplanche suggest such a departure from his original vision? Because he couldn't find any other capital to buy LC loans, and he had to keep the growth up.So institutional capital has been leaving, not just LC, but the entire marketplace lending sector, and it was leaving before Laplanche got himself in trouble.Argument 2: ""The returns on Lending Club notes are so good, and so reliable, nobody with a profit motive could stay away for long.""According to Lending Club's statistics page, a sufficiently diversified median investor, holding to maturity, has received a 7% return on their portfolio with virtually no risk of loss. Where are you going to find those kinds of risk/reward setups in today's market?If you are driving by looking in the rear view mirror, that's a great argument. The flaw shows up when you look forward. LC returns have occurred during one of the longest and steadiest economic expansions since WWII. Institutions are looking ahead and forecasting worse returns, possibly due to a recession, in the future. I do not know what canaries in the coal mine they are watching, but the fact that investors across the marketplace lending space are withdrawing says they are seeing something. Two additional factors matter here.The first is that, at institutional size, there is virtually no secondary market for LC notes. So institutions have to buy and hold. That means if they forecast a recession (and therefore underperformance) within the next 3-5 years (the duration of LC loans) they have a reason to shy away from investing today, and stay away until they think the macroeconomic coast is clear, which is more likely to be a matter of years than months or weeks.The second additional factor is that institutional money is managed by people who take all sorts of risks into account - credit risk, interest rate risk, default risk - but who are most strongly motivated by career risk. When you are a financial professional, it is okay to underperform, as long as you do it in a conventional, orthodox way.What is not okay is to underperform in a way different from the herd. ""I could have gotten 6% with LC notes, but got 3% with investment-grade corporate bonds instead"" is an acceptable outcome. ""I could have gotten 3% with corporates, but got 0% on LC notes instead"" will get you fired. So institutional money managers have a second reason to shy away from LC notes in the face of macroeconomic uncertainty.Therefore, the (career-)risk-adjusted returns on LC notes may not be as good as more conventional alternatives over the next few years.To sum up, then:Now, all that said, is LC going to go bankrupt? No. LC can stumble along indefinitely, barely profitable, funding its own loans, borrowing, doing equity raises, etc. That is not a scenario in which LC is a company you want to own, though.II. The Threat to the StockAs already established, LC is not attractive unless it is a growth stock. So far, it has been an incredible growth stock.(Source: company presentation)This kind of rapid, smooth, unbroken growth is a growth investor's dream. Consequently, most investors are in LC because it is an incredible growth stock.Unfortunately, the coming second quarter is not going to be a growth quarter. For the first time, originations and revenue are going to decline sequentially. (Details below.) What happens if Q3 is similar? How many weak hands will fold? Maybe you, brave reader, have the market savvy and intestinal fortitude to hold your shares through a couple of down quarters.But what will the marginal LC shareholder - who has probably watched his stock decline from somewhere way north of where it is now, and has held on to the promise of growth eventually taking it back again - what will that investor do when the growth story looks broken? I think a lot of those folks will sell.In that case, the stock could trade down to a level more attractive to a value investor, say to its recent floor of $3.50. In a few more quarters, maybe the growth story will reignite. But that will take time, again measured in years, not months or weeks.III. OutlookThe short version: Q2 is going to be ugly.The longer version: LC has three channels through which it resells its loans. The most familiar one is the ""standard loan program,"" in which notes (representing fractions of borrower loans) are sold to retail investors. But LC will also sell whole loans, and it will sell larger-denomination certificates representing a pool of loans through investment funds. The latter two channels are available only to Big Money.Every time LC funds a loan through its standard loan program, it issues an amendment to its prospectus. You can, therefore, keep tabs on LC's progress through a quarter by keeping track of these prospectus updates. These updates are voluminous and tedious to wade through, and I have not done it in detail. A company called ThinkNum has done it, though, and a Goldman Sachs analyst has issued a (bearish) opinion using ThinkNum numbers for the upcoming quarter. I don't have access to that report, but a number of financial outlets have reported on it. The following is what I can glean from their reports.At about five-sixths of the way through the quarter, LC had originated about $1.5B through the standard loan program. Last quarter, the standard loan program was 76% of originations; holding that percentage constant, we get $2.37B for the quarter. (1.5 ÷ 5/6 ÷ .76). This is an optimistic number, however, because institutional money has probably fled the other two channels disproportionately. So call it $2.1B in originations for the quarter (versus $2.75B for Q1). I should point out that at least $26M of this is LC's own capital, possibly much more, and that does not count the investment in Cirrus.Last quarter operating revenue was 5.5% of originations. Using that (optimistic) figure, we get $115M operating revenue, versus $141M average of analyst estimates. Using recent (optimistic) profit margins of 3%, we get net income of $3.5M, or less than 0.01 EPS, versus analyst expectations of 0.02. In short, LC is going to miss on both top and bottom lines. Both lines will be sequential declines, and this will damage the growth story. LC needs about $2B in originations just to break even, so it is possible they will be in the red for the quarter.There are no predictable, significant, near-term, positive catalysts. The possibility of a buyout is one that's unpredictable. And of course, some large institution might decide to come back and fund LC loans. I've already argued that's unpredictable too, but see the anonymous attributions in this recent SA article. Finally, smart money is coming in and buying stock below $5. That is not a positive catalyst but if it keeps up, it may limit the downside.My base case, therefore, is for an ugly reaction after Q2 earnings come out. If you are long-term bullish on LC, at least wait until then to buy, because you'll probably get a better deal. Depending on what happens, I might dip my toe in for a trade. If you are bearish, especially macro-economically, wait a little longer and see what happens.Supporting Documents"
3985568,67855,2016-06-30T15:02:09-04:00,"The management is guiding that originations will decline by around a third.Only 2% of loans were funded with the company's own cash, but this masks the underlying problem.Leaked letters show that investors are demanding to withdraw capital from one of the company owned funds.Savings from layoffs won't be realized until next quarter, and they likely won't be enough to offset the revenue decline.","Tuesday was quite an eye opener for investors. Lending Club (NYSE:LC) held its annual meeting and made some new revelations about the current situation, including ""inappropriate"" (read borderline fraudulent) transactions made by the former CEO back in 2009. There was a lot of speculation regarding the outlook of the company in terms of the financials, but now we have solid numbers.Poor GuidanceThe management guided for a 33% quarter over quarter drop in origination volume for Q2. In my previous article I talked about the financial impact of the potential decline (read The Scandal's Financial Consequence), and the guidance has cemented my negative outlook.On the surface, management's estimates were more positive than my previous forecast of a 50% decline. However, because the entire month of April (i.e a third of Q2) did not suffer from the scandal, the run rate for originations is likely overstated. If we assume that originations did not grow in April, but declined 50% in May and June, total originations in Q2 would be 33% lower than Q1, matching management's guidance. In other words, I believe that there indeed has been a massive drop in originations, as I suspected.While the decline in originations can be concealed somewhat, the financials will still be significantly impacted. In the first quarter the company generated $125 million of transaction fees (i.e. fees from origination), the expected decline in volume would result in a revenue loss of $41 million. Because there is no direct cost of revenue, the $41 million loss will directly flow to the company's bottom line, which was a paltry $4.1 million in the first quarter.Capital Outlook Continues To SourI've also expressed concern over the company's ability to fund loans. While the management stated that the company is just funding 2% of the loans with its own cash, leaked private investor letters suggest that the company is using Band-Aids to fix cracks in the dam. According to the letters, one of Lending Club's funds, the Broad Based Consumer Credit Fund, received redemption requests for $442 million, or 58% of assets under management. Of course, the company isn't about to let half a billion of funds just leave like that, so the fund decided to impose restrictions on the redemption requests in a bid to slow the capital flight.The implication is huge. $442 million equates to a whopping 24% of expected Q2 originations, such a potential loss of capital will have serious impact on the company's ability to fund future loans. The redemption requests account for 50% of the company's cash balance as of Q1, and likely more in Q2 as the cash balance may decline due to the aforementioned lack of external capital. Once the redemption requests go through (and they eventually will), the amount of time Lending Club has to regain investor confidence will be significantly shorter as less funds will be available to purchase loans to keep the company going. I previously estimated that the company can keep operating for around a year if investor demand doesn't pick up (read Lending Club Has One Year), but if half of the cash is gone, the company will have less than 6 months before capital dries up.We also haven't taken the other funds into account. Because the funds controlled by Lending Club are private, there is no public information for the other two funds (Conservative Consumer Credit Fund and High Yield Consumer Credit Fund). However, it's reasonable to suggest that they are likely to be under similar pressure from investors to return capital, exacerbating the capital deficiency.In a way, the restrictions placed on the redemption requests could be seen as a positive, as it is possible that the delay could be long enough for confidence to be restored. However, this new information does reveal that institutional investors are still on the fence. If Lending Club's wholly owned funds are under such pressure to return capital, I can only imagine what sort of appetite (or lack thereof) other institutional investors have. Keep in mind that the company only had to spend 2% of its own funds to fund the loans because these investment funds are propping up the capital base. Once they are gone (either through a substantial decline in AUM or a potential closure as reported by the Wall Street Journal), every dollar lost will have to come from the company's own pockets.It Could Get WorseI also believe that the amount of loans funded by the company will increase significantly in the future. Because the financial impact on the business only started to show in June (as evidenced by the $18.7 million loan purchase), a large portion of Q2 (i.e. prior to the debacle in May) still benefited from positive investor sentiment. The third quarter will be ruthless, the company will be dealing with lower originations (lower revenue), depleting capital from the funds (depending on how restrictive the provisions are), and the full impact of lower investor demand.To cope with the upcoming challenges, the management decided to lay off 12% of the workforce. While we won't be seeing any savings in Q2, which means that the drop in transaction fees will likely have full impact on the bottom line, the company could save some cash in the upcoming quarters. However, the savings are unlikely to offset any potential loss in revenue. A 12% reduction in operating expenses will generate $18 million of savings every quarter, but it will not offset the potential decline in transaction revenue ($41 million) nor does it solve the problem of funding, which won't even show up on the income statement.The planned layoff also brings up an interesting question. In my previous article I mentioned that the management seemed to have decided that the company will keep operating in the hopes that investor appetite will rebound. This sentiment was reiterated in the press release (e.g. growth will rebound in H1 2017). However, if the management is this confident in that growth will pick up in less than a year from now, why bother laying off a significant portion of the workforce now? Could it be that the management is accepting low growth (1% revenue increase would still be ""growth"") in the foreseeable future?

Being so, I pointed out in a previous article on LendingClub (NYSE:LC) that despite the company's hardships, management is being rewarded to a great degree. My article was not exactly well received for two reasons:While the first point is justifiable, I still disagree, and I implore you to read my previous article as to see my viewpoint. As I mentioned previously, I attempted to reach out to LC for clarification but received no response. As insiders know more about a company than we investors do, they likely know quite well that they are in dire straits, which brings me to my next point.The second point was a misunderstanding. I am already assuming that LendingClub will eventually perish. I did not make this thesis clear in my last article, but I plan to do so today.Why LendingClub Must Go BankruptLendingClub's business model is a race against time, but without a finish line. Everything I'm about to say also applies to OnDeck Capital (NYSE:ONDK) and all other p2p lending businesses. LendingTree (NASDAQ:TREE) is an exception, as this company uses a different business model and should be dissected as a lead-generation company.LendingClub's business model relies on probability theory. Specifically, the company uses an algorithm to quickly determine the probability of a loan applicant defaulting. The algorithm uses this probability along with an expected ROI to arrive at a decision on the loan and has been increasingly relaxed, allowing for higher default rates.Finding a BenchmarkThis business model has a number of problems. First, it is relatively new. The p2p lending industry does not yet have benchmark default rates.Without a benchmark, LendingClub is grasping in the dark, somewhat arbitrarily determining an acceptable write-off rate. Of course, over time, the p2p lending industry will find its benchmark and can more effectively choose its applicants. But until that point, a huge set of problems plagues the company as it lowers interest rates and increases the default rates arbitrarily.A Broken AlgorithmAlready, LendingClub's algorithm is underperforming. The actual write-off rate is roughly double that of the company's internal estimates. This alone should be a red flag: The algorithm is not working, as a simple look at the actual versus expected write-off rates reveals:Of course, with plenty of cash on hand, LendingClub has time to iron out the kinks. But while it does so, it exposes itself to what is possibly an insurmountable amount of risk. Much of this risk is passed onto investors, who are forced to trust the grades LendingClub gives to loan applicants.Exploitation of the Loan Time frameInvestors burned by this system will be the nodes in a system that dismantles LendingClub's reputation. But that's only one side of the story. The other side lies in the debtors exploiting LendingClub's algorithm.The algorithm is only a soft check and is restricted by time. An applicant can stack loans from one or more p2p business in a manner undetectable to these algorithms. For example, an applicant can apply for and receive a loan from OnDeck and then immediately turn to LendingClub for another loan.The second loan is given without regard to the first loan. In other words, while the algorithm should recognize an increased risk of default because of a new, outstanding loan, the increased risk simply does not register. With p2p lending companies reporting loans monthly, applicants can stack multiple loans within a 30-day period without experiencing a change in their risk profiles.Clearly, more time is needed for LendingClub to fix both the algorithm's accuracy and the ability to exploit the algorithm. To run on algorithms and not human credit checks is possible but not currently working. Essentially, LendingClub is running a trading algorithm that looked good in the backtest but fails on the live market.A Recession will Kill LendingClubBut a much larger problem is that LendingClub's only solution to this problem is time, and time is also LendingClub's guaranteed executioner. Eventually, the market will see a recession. I explain the two types of recessions in this article, but for LendingClub, either recession will cause the company to fail.In a Type I recession, which is a natural phase of a business cycle, default rates increase. LendingClub might have internal models that predict the company can withstand a significant default rate increase. However, as we've seen, LendingClub's models are unreliable.In addition, companies typically use the most recent recession data to predict the next recession. Companies take the most recent data to construct a distribution of all possible outcomes, ignoring the data that we have not yet witnessed in the past. The result is a Guassian distribution that neglects both kurtosis risk and skew risk, giving companies an overly optimistic representation of the probability set of outcomes when in fact the true distribution is a Taleb distribution, not a Guassian distribution:LendingClub and other companies have fallen into such a trap, as evidenced by the insignificant amount of cash held to cover for losses. LendingClub's cash, for instance, cannot cover one year's worth of loans. The company's statement that it can cover for a recession should not be taken as fact as it is built on a faulty assumption of the magnitude of the average recession.While single-digit yields might attract applicants, at the end of the day, the loans are unsecured loans. The rate of income cannot keep pace with the rate of losses via defaults during a Type I recession. LendingClub is exposed to significant downside without the tools that other financial institutions (e.g., banks and credit card companies) use to weather a Type I recession.The much more rare Type II recession is equally deadly for a company such as LendingClub and is part of the ""fat tail"" in the Taleb distribution that is not the basis for the Moody's recession simulations on which LendingClub built its recession scenario. In this environment, businesses and households shift their focus to paying down debt and therefore have no need for loans. Without loan applicants, LendingClub has no business. As Japan has shown, changing interest rates has no effect during a Type II recession, and LendingClub will therefore have no tools to attract borrowers.Because one of these recessions is inevitable, LendingClub will eventually go under. Right now, it struggles to evolve its algorithm in ignorance of the endgame. The company could very well improve in the short term, but any money you put down on this stock will eventually be gone with the wind.A note for TREE investors: Despite having a different business model, TREE is unfairly punished whenever LC or ONDK suffers bad news. TREE will hurt, too, during a recession, especially during a Type II recession, in which borrowers disappear. But as long as the market conditions are still good, as they are now, TREE investors should look to buy on the dips brought about by negative news from LC and ONDK.Learn More about EarningsMy Exploiting Earnings premium subscription is now live, here on Seeking Alpha.

As of June 20th, 2016, Chen Tian Qiao owned 57.7 million of Lending Club shares, representing a 15% stake in the company. Could he be thinking about a buyout? Wall Street Journal reported that Shanda has no such intentions, but this hasn't stopped investors from speculating.Source: en.people.cnChen Tian Qiao isn't famous outside of China like Jack Ma of Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), but he did found one of the biggest gaming companies in China: Shanda Interactive Entertainment. He has since sold the stake in the company and has moved on to asset management through Shanda Group. Note that Shanda Group is not a traditional money manager (i.e. mutual fund), which would negate any possibility of a takeover.Strategic RationaleShanda does a little bit of everything, consistent with the diverse interpretation of asset management. For example, the company has been seeding various virtual reality focused start-ups such as UploadVR and Solfar Studios. Of particular interest is Shanda's stake in a social platform called ""Youni."" In addition to the typical social aspects of such communication platforms, Youni has also been experimenting with social payment, which enables money transfers between users and possibly businesses directly through Youni.Unfortunately, Youni has been completely eclipsed by WeChat in China. But by integrating Lending Club's technology into Youni, it's possible that the app can be reinvigorated. From this perspective, taking over Lending Club could make some strategic sense. Whether it would be a financially sound decision, I cannot say since Shanda Group is private. However, one must wonder why Chen Tian Qiao would want to purchase a foreign P2P lending company when there are already plenty of P2P lenders in China. There is even one listed on Nasdaq, Yirendai LTD. (NYSE:YRD). Furthermore, there is rising regulatory concern concerning P2P lenders in China.Speculative Option PositionsWe can learn a lot from how Chen Tian Qiao built up the stake. In May and June, he opened large option positions covering 27.6 million shares (roughly half of his current holding), consisting of long calls with strikes at $3 and $4 and short puts with strikes at $4 and$ 5. This is a classic speculative position, with the puts financing the calls at the expense of higher risk exposure.The puts were sold close to the money to increase the premium, again at the expense of higher risk. The durations of the options also tell the same story. They ranged from a little over a month to just three days. The only way these trades could have been profitable was if Lending Club's stock rose significantly in a short period of time (thankfully, it did). If Chen Tian Qiao's intention was to execute a strategic acquisition, then the trades he made were unsuitable, even if they made him money.ConclusionAlthough Chen Tian Qiao could be eyeing Lending Club to complement Youni, there are plenty of substitutes in China alone. From the option positions, we can tell that he set up the trade to take advantage of short-term fluctuations of the stock, which is not characteristic of a strategic buyer. Given the above, I believe that the chance of Chen Tian Qiao bidding for the entire company is small. Of course, that is not to say he won't change his mind.Click the ""Follow"" button beside my name on the top of the page to be updated with my latest insights.

3983410,85726,2016-06-21T14:32:04-04:00,"LendingClub is the leading platform in an absolutely massive addressable market where size may bring advantages.No balance sheet risk and healthy cash levels limit the downside,book value is likley just under $3.The company has over-corrected for a serious but small offense, and this may be a big opportunity.","In keeping with my theme of ""broken disruptors,"" (I recently covered Chipotle), another rare opportunity seems to have emerged in LendingClub Corporation (NYSE:LC).LendingClub is the leading platform for peer-to-peer lending, which enables consumers to get unsecured consumer loans through the LendingClub website. Borrowers enter data into the platform, and based on LendingClub's proprietary algorithm, loans are offered, usually within 1-5 days. Similarly, consumers can invest in others' loans, and can select a diversified portfolio of securitized loans. Loans on LendingClub are graded like school grades are, A through G, and not only use traditional metrics like FICO scores but other data such as employment, salary, and current indebtedness, and claims that its algorithms are actually more accurate than traditional bank lending criteria, which LendingClub and other marketplace bulls claim are subject to human biases.Moreover, LC's cost of originations is much lower than those of traditional banks, which need to invest in physical branches and employees to originate the loans. While still in the early innings, LendingClub's cost of originations is roughly 2%, while that of traditional banks are 5-7% (Macquarie Research Report, May 2016). Because of the low costs, LendingClub is able to offer high-quality borrowers (FICO 600-720+) rates on unsecured loans at are seven hundred basis points lower than credit card companies, and likely much lower than banks would offer as well. A majority of LendingClub's current borrower base (~69%) uses the loans for refinancing, mostly credit cards, while the other 30% of customers loans for other purposes, such as Home Improvement, Major Purchases, Medical (1%), Business loans (2%), and other purposes. The education and patient loans are a very small part of the current mix, and was enabled through the 2014 purchase of Springstone. In March 2014, LendingClub also began to finance unsecured small business ad offer lines of credit. The education, patient, and small business loans are only offered to private accredited investors and not available to other retail investors on the platform. Management has also indicated it would eventually go into other lending verticals such as mortgages.Consumers with excess savings can invest in the loans of others through the platform in the form of notes available through the LendingClub platform. You and I can go on, select the criteria for loans in which we want to invest, and the LendingClub algorithm will match your investment to loans available on the platform. Notes are securitized versions of loans. You can invest in LC loans in increments as small as $25.In addition to the Notes, accredited investors can invest in Certificates or Partnership Units of LendingClub-managed accounts. In this instance, LendingClub acts essentially as a fund manager for accredited investors, who often invest larger dollar amounts and in a more ""hands-off"" way than others on the platform.Finally, the platform offers to sell entirely Whole Loans to institutions such as banks, who have the low cost of capital in the form of checking and savings accounts, and can benefit by using LendingClub to invest in loans outside their geographical footprint, and to earn interest on pools of consumer loans that may be too small on an individual basis for big banks to typically bother.The value proposition is that borrowers can get lower rates than credit cards, and access to credit for which they might not have qualified while investors can achieve mid-high single digit returns, which is greater than the near-zero one gets from savings accounts and treasuries.HistoryLendingClub was founded by Renaud Laplanche in 2006, and actually began as an app of Facebook, and stressed the social networking aspect of lending to others over the internet. The company received several rounds of venture funding since, and has become more its own platform, and now emphasizes the automation/algorithm/ big data aspects of the business. The current board includes high profile names such as John Mack, former CEO of Morgan Stanley, Larry Summers, Harvard Professor and Economist, who advised the Obama administration and many others at high levels of government, Mary Meeker, of Kleiner Perkins Caulfield &Byers, and other venture capital executives from LC's venture funders such as Daniel Ciporin, Jeff Crow, and Rebecca Lynn. John Mack invested a personal stake in the company, and Google invested in the platform as well.LendingClub is the largest and most sophisticated of all of the P2PLending Platforms out there. In 2015, there were roughly 16 billion in loans that were originated and invested in through online platforms. LendingClub originated 8.4 billion in 2015, which was a ~100% increase over the prior year. That means LendingClub has well over 50% market share in this high-growth area. As the platform has grown, the company's investor base has become increasingly populated by banks and financial institutions (roughly 33%); however, individual retail investors are still the majority of investors.LendingClub went public in late 2014 at a price of 15$/ share, though the stock quickly shot up to an all-time high of $27.90/share, on the promise of the disruptive prospects for the company and large total addressable market to reshape the 3.3 trillion dollar U.S. Consumer loan market; however, concerns about the business model, regulatory risk, uncertainty about performance through cycles, and uncertainty about maintaining a high growth rate in the face of a slowing U.S. economy in early 2016 caused the stock to fall to 8$/ share this past winter. LendingClub has raised its interest rates on its lower quality borrowers (graded C and D), as that segment had faced increased defaults in early 2016, but only on its lower grade loans, and a relatively small increase.Adding to the downturn was the shocking scandal in May of this year which led to the resignation of the CEO: ""In April 2016, a LendingClub employee reported to Laplanche that the dates on approximately $US 3 million in the firm's loans appeared to have been altered. LendingClub's internal auditor engaged an outside firm to investigate the report. This investigation found additional problems with loans, including that $US 22 million in loans which had been sold to the Jefferies investment bank did not in fact meet the bank's investment criteria. LendingClub bought these loans back from the bank and resold them."" (Wikipedia, NY Times)Adding to this was the fact that Laplanche did not disclose that he was invested in an investment fund that bought LendingClub loans, which LendingClub itself was considering purchasing (WSJ).This led to the board declaring they no longer had confidence in Laplanche, and Laplanche resigned on May 6, 2016. The stock, plunged from $8 to under $4. Three other managers relating to the Jefferies loans were also fired. Some institutions paused their loan-buying program. LendingClub made it clear that it would have to step in and use its balance sheet to buy loans in the meantime, although the company expects to resell these loans once the institutional buyers start up again.Separating the Good from the BadIt is my thesis that LendingClub's current problems are relatively minor and fixable, and that the share price has overshot to the downside. Should LendingClub reinstate loan buyer confidence in the coming months and continue its leadership and transparency as the leading P2P platform, the upside is massive, and the downside I believe to be limited thanks to a healthy balance sheet. Because LendingClub has no debt and *typically* does not bear the credit risk of its borrowers, the company is thus asset-light, very well capitalized (the company has ~900M in cash and marketable securities and no debt, on a current 1.8B valuation), there is no near-term risk of insolvency. The company's book value, which is mostly excess cash is roughly 1B. If the entire P2P concept were outlawed tomorrow or people lost confidence in funding loans, I therefore below the downside is roughly book value, so maybe 40% downside from here ($3). On the other hand, the upside is incredible.I will first delve in to the potential earnings power of the platform, then look at current and potential problems, and explain why I believe the problems are fixable, or not as dire as the stock price reflects.Peer to Peer Lending PotentialEstimates for the peer-to-peer lending market by 2025 vary widely, yet all seems to point to significant growth. Foundation Capital, which is LendingClub's venture investor, believes the peer-to-peer market will be $1 trillion by 2025. A recent PWC paper on the included a ""conservative estimate"" (their words) at $150 billion by 2025, which would account for 10% of the $800 billion revolving consumer credit market (credit cards, etc.) and 5% of the $1.4 trillion non-revolving consumer credit market (home equity, car loans, small business loans). The International Securities Commission estimates that the market will be $70 billion in the U.S. by 2020. The US Consumer Debt Refinancing opportunity alone (or the ""Core"" business for LendingClub) is a $465 billion-dollar opportunity.I also was able to track down an institutional buyer of LendingClub Loans. His quotations will be referred to throughout the rest of this writeup. When I asked about the total addressable market for these P2P platforms, the response was:""I'm not sure $1 trillion is the number by 2025, but it will certainly be hundreds of billions of dollars, possibly half a trillion within the next 10 years. It is without a doubt the wave of the future. People want to be able to apply for a loan in their homes on their own time, they want an answer in seconds of days and I don't want to have to go into a branch to sign the loan documentation. online platforms allow all of the that.""While this is somewhat of a small sample, with all of these informed sources painting a bullish picture, combined with the current growth rates and innovation, I would say it very likely that this market will be huge.LendingClub Competitive Advantages/Leading PositionLendingClub is currently the largest and most established platform, with over 50% market share of all peer-to-peer lending platforms. It is bigger than the next four platforms combined. The question is, does LendingClub, through its first-mover status and scale, generate any sort of competitive advantage through network effects, and if so, are those advantages still intact after the current troubles?LendingClub believes that it does in fact have these advantages. The company proclaims that investors want to go where the most borrowers are so that they can diversify, and not be a disproportionate amount of any one marketplace's notes… Perhaps some institutions may like that kind of negotiating leverage, but it is perhaps more comfortable for big banks to go where everyone else is, so that all competitors share the same risks.The real interesting advantage is the scale that can feed more data into the LendingClub algorithm. The more loans that are made, scored, and tracked, the better the algorithm will become. If this is true, and I believe there is some truth to it, LendingClub may very well become a dominant share of the market, perhaps even larger than it is now; however, there are a lot of unknowns, and while new competitors have sprung up, most are small and not yet public.My aforementioned primary source, an advisor to an institutional buyer of LendingClub loans, seemed to indicated that LendingClub does in fact have these advantages, and that the scrutiny of being a public company is actually likely what aided in identifying the current controversy, and that this kind of transparency and SEC regulation is actually a benefit. The advisor said:In this regard, it is possible that LendingClub may become even more of a trusted destination due to having had gone through these growing pains. This is the same type of scenario that happened with Netflix in 2012, and what I believe is may happen with Chipotle.Parsing the ControversyAfter all, the loans that they were ""doctored"" have since been bought by LendingClub and since re-sold. It was only 22 million worth of loans, while the company originated 2.75 Billion in loans in Q1 alone! That is virtually nothing. An internal audit has verified that all of the other loans are kosher.My guess is that with the stock price coming down and with the company being relatively newly public, there was great pressure to execute and show growth to justify the price. This led to some ""skimming"" around the edges of a borrowers' stated criteria, which management probably felt was so immaterial that it wouldn't matter. Instead, the problem was detected and disaster ensued. Still, a 50% drop in the stock on top of the 60% drop the stock had prior to the controversy seems to me overdone based on my valuation estimates below. IT was a stupid decision, but this kind of things happen when management sees a growth opportunity, and aggressiveness overwhelms prudence. One needs a healthy dose of both to be a successful entrepreneur, but, especially with a finance-related company, trust and integrity are even that more important. This is why institutional buyers of the loans have ""paused"" in the wake of the crisis, such as Jefferies and Goldman Sachs.With some institutions pulling back, LendingClub is looking to reassure investors and to lure others back in to buy loans. While Jefferies and GS have pulled back, the company is currently in discussions with Citigroup, as well as hedge funds, to resume lending. In the near-term, LendingClub has begun funding and holding some loans. This should be temporary, and LendingClub has roughly 900 million in cash and marketable securities with which to do this, which should be more than enough to fund loans for a prolonged period.The institutional advisor I talked to also had paused its buying program, but did indicated that he believes the program will start again by the end of this month.This tells me that the problem was small, these managers were pretty stupid, but that the value proposition is still there for institutional buyers.Loans Have Performed WellInstitutional buyers are likely to be there because the portfolios have historically performed well. My source indicates that their portfolios of highly-graded borrower loans have returned between 6 and 8 percent, including charge-offs. My source indicates that these returns are ""better than our models anticipated.""LendingClub has very high customer satisfaction, and that fact that it has been able to grow its retail base of investors over 7 years seems to prove that the model works. It certainly works for borrowers, who consistently rate LendingClub with a Net Promoter Score in the high 70's, much higher than substitutes of Credit Unions, Community Banks, Regional Banks, Credit Cards, and National Banks.But How Well Will It Perform in a Downturn?One of the criticisms of LendingClub, especially after having to raise its rates on lower-end borrowers this year, was how these loans would perform in a downturn. LendingClub's 2008 vintage has returned on average 2.5%, which is not bad considering that vintage was originated right before the biggest downturn in this country since the 1930's. Vintages since on average have returned between 6-8%.Moreover, my source has claimed that ""We have modeled down credit cycles, noodling building in default rates similar to what occurred in the unsecured installment loan market during the 2008-2010 recession, and the portfolio still performs satisfactorily.""Again, this is a small sample, but think about this: The credit card has been around for a long time and has weathered downturns… Just because the industry has not gone through a full cycle while at this scale doesn't mean that it will suddenly implode when one happens.Recent Bad News and PressThe credit markets tightened a lot in Q1 2016 after the fed raised rates, and there was a minor 22-basis point uptick in defaults. These defaults were concentrated in the lower-grade loans, according to LendingClub, and LendingClub has raised its rates for that tranche of borrowers.In light of the current controversy, LendingClub has also raised rates slightly, an average of 55 basis points, across its loan pool, partly in an effort to get all of these consumer loans funded in the wake of the crisis.While not terrific news, this is hardly an earth-shaking development, but rather seems to be a tweak to the existing model, which is an ongoing and organic process. No one can reasonably think that the LC algorithm will be exactly the same next year or five years from now, but various news reports seem to emphasize this as some kind of disaster.In the wake of Laplanche's resignation, as well as that of 3 senior executives, Scott Sanborn, the Chief Marketing Executive, was promoted to CEO. On June 7th, the company abruptly canceled the annual meeting of shareholders and postponed it until June 28th. While certainly not confidence-inducing, it seems plausible that since the founder and CEO resigned only on May 6th and several large investors paused their purchasing of loans recently, that the company may need some extra time to pull things together and give a clearer picture of the state of the business to investors. The annual stockholders' meeting is to be held on June 28th. While not necessarily a catalyst, any positive surprise could lead to a big move up in the stock, while any lackluster announcement or lack of things ""getting back to normal"" may have the opposite effect.ValuationWith a growth stock like this with many uncertainties, valuation is somewhat difficult but not impossible. I always strive to get to an intrinsic valuations, as the relatively new industry and unique company positioning in it make comps difficult. Sell-siders usually value the company based on future projections of EBITDA, as the company is near breakeven.I put various inputs into a 10 year 3-stage growth DCF. Since many market studies seem to put numbers out to 2025, this fits in quite well.In my DCF, I put in a 30% revenue growth rate for 5 years, decelerating to a 1.75% terminal growth in 2025 (the 10-year T-note, roughly). At this rate, LendingClub would be making about 3.4 Billion in revenue in 2025. This equates to roughly $ 60 Billion in loan originations. When compared to the ""conservative"" PWC estimate of 150 Billion, this is roughly 40% market share, which, since LendingClub is over 50% of the market now, may also be conservative, but I think reasonable.I once again capitalized R&D and operating leases, and amortized the R&D asset over 5 years. On that basis, LendingClub would be profitable (LendingClub made about 70 million in operating cash flow in 2015). I have margins expanding to about 40% in 2025 (while capitalizing R&D and leases). On a GAAP basis this would lead to operating margins in the mid-30's, which is high but around where enterprise software with dominant, sticky products, such as Oracle, reside. I used a sales to capital ratio of 1.1, which is around what the company currently achieves when you take out most of the cash from the balance sheet. Typical internet companies have around a 1.3 sales to capital ratio, so this may prove conservative.I used a fairly high discount rate of roughly 10.5% (1.5 beta on a 6% risk premium to the 10-year, slightly reduced by capitalized leases), which, when you have a risk-free rate and a debt free, cash-rich balance sheet, seems pretty conservative, but this is a new industry with many unknowns.I also modeled in a 10% chance of the firm failing, and shareholders getting 75% of the current book value (which is mostly cash) in that scenario.These assumptions spits out roughly a $10.30/ share stock price, or more than double from current levels.Bear Case: At the current price levels, the assumptions for revenue would have to go down to 20% for the last five years (remember the company has grown ~90% y/y in the most recent quarter) and for margins to expand to only 25%, while the Sales-to-Capital ratio would drop to 1. These are pretty low estimates and points to the fact that the market is pricing in the current problems or model really struggling to achieve its potential, (1.9 billion in 10 years) and having margins be far lower than other platform/ software companies, and that achieving this will take more capital investment intensity than even current levels.As for the bull case, really, the sky is the limit. A 50% growth rate CAGR for the next five years, decelerating to maturity in year ten, would leave 2025 revenues at just under $10 billion dollars, which equates to 200 billion of loans originated. While a big number, this equates to roughly 20% of the trillion-dollar estimate thrown out there by Foundation Capital.With 40% operating margins and a sales to capital of 1.3 (roughly what other internet companies do), the value is $26.94.Thus, the market seems to be pricing in the risk of the entire model just going away, or only being able to achieve a fraction of its potential.If you believe that this is a possibility, then stay on the sidelines.If, however, one believes that this is a hiccup, and that LendingClub's issues are temporary, there is substantial upside.And, what is the downside? The book value of the company is about 1 billion, and most of it is in cash. If things fall apart, what is the downside? 3$/share? $2.50? The risk-reward seems asymmetric.ConclusionLendingClub has the possibility of coming out of this crisis a better company, and it has the early lead in a massive potential market where size may be a competitive advantage through powerful network effects. Given that the book value of the company, which is mostly cash and marketable securities is more than 50% of the current value, while the upside is multiples of the current price, I would advocate taking a position at these historically low levels.RisksSupporting Documents"
3985224,22148,2016-06-29T11:04:03-04:00,"LendingClub released updated metrics including loan originations for the annual stockholders meeting.The company reduced the workforce in a big negative sign that growth isn't returning to the online lending platform anytime soon.The stock trades at an attractive valuation, but plenty of questions persist on whether the new CEO has the capability to drive the next growth phase.","Anybody following my past articles on LendingClub (NYSE:LC) knows that my stance has been bullish on the valuation and cautious on the short-term business metrics. The replacement of the founding CEO can have a profound impact on the long-term growth of any company.The stock rallied 7% due to the details released for the annual stockholder meeting to close at $4.61, but LendingClub still trades below the recent cap at $5.00. The question now is whether some clarity on origination volumes is enough to push the stock higher?Updated Origination VolumesThe key to the investment story on LendingClub was if and when the online lending platform would recover from the May collapse in volumes caused by the resignation of the founding CEO. My previous research focused on the numbers based on the forecast by Goldman Sachs that Q2 loan originations would grow 5% YoY.To remind investors, LendingClub produced record marketplace loan originations of $2,750 million during Q1. The number was 68% growth over the prior year period. Only slowing down growth to flat sequentially would've been a huge step back for the platform that seemed to have unlimited growth opportunities.Source: LendingClub Q1'16 presentationInstead, the online platform predicts that volumes will be roughly one-third lower than the Q1 levels. The number amounts to the neighborhood of $1,833 million in Q2 loan originations. The volumes are actually down 4% from the prior year levels of $1,912 million. The end result is that the Goldman Sachs numbers were actually way too bullish.The real unanswered question is the cadence of the monthly origination volumes knowing that April was solid and May was horrendous. The company didn't provide any forward-looking numbers other than ""plans to resume revenue and EBITDA growth in the first half of 2017"".To reach origination YoY growth in Q1'17, LendingClub would need to achieve 50% growth in volumes to exceed the Q1'16 levels. Unless the company is talking about sequential growth that would suggest still negative June numbers making Q3 difficult to achieve anything other than flat loan originations.Either way, a workforce reduction of 179 employees on June 22 isn't the way to spark growth. Not only does it signal that a big rebound in volumes isn't near, but the company removed a bunch of online lending evangelists from the market. If the company is going to reinvigorate growth, why cut all these employees that amount to roughly 12% of the workforce to only need to rehire people next year.Updated ValuationAs the last article highlighted, the stock is difficult to value not knowing where loan originations are headed in the next year. The fact that volumes declined from last Q2 will hurt the transaction fees placing the total from that revenue category closer to $80 million from the estimated $90 million.The other revenue sources are likely to grow slightly from Q1 levels as the service portfolio will see peak volumes in Q2. The servicing portfolio provides recurring revenue that amounted to $18.2 million last quarter, but the portfolio requires consistent loan originations that exceed the repaid loan balances to grow the portfolio.Source: LendingClub Q1'16 presentationUnder this scenario, revenues hit at least $105 million during the quarter. The lowest analyst revenue estimate is $107.5 million questioning whether the investment community is realistically prepared for the actual results.The encouraging part is that LendingClub expects to only hold $40 million in loans held for sale at the end of Q2. The number should help keep the cash balances over $800 million. In reality, the balance is closer to $850 million as this $40 million investment is in low-risk loans that should actually earn the company income.The one encouraging piece from the annual shareholder meeting call was the discussion of an asset manager that has invested $200 million on the platform since the start of May and plans to invest $1 billion this year. Other banks are taking longer to complete due diligence, but LendingClub provided some hope that all the original institutional investors would eventually return.In those regards, the stock trades at the reasonable enterprise valuation of 2.5x revenues.TakeawayThe upside appears capped in LendingClub through the summer. Investors can obtain solid valuations buying the stock below $5 over the next few months, but the online lending marketplace still needs to prove that the new CEO has the capability to reinvigorate the growth needed to spur the stock to higher valuations."
3983013,67855,2016-06-20T07:34:09-04:00,"Recent weekly report suggests that Lending Club has to spend almost $1 billion to fund its own loans.Given the cash on hand, the company can last just one year assuming that it can break even on operation.The rapid growth that is desired by many investors will actually make the situation worse, but growth is unlikely to materialize.Lower transaction fees will increase cash needs, but this could be offset by lowering marketing expenses.","Source: lendingclub.comLast time I talked about the two paths that Lending Club (NYSE:LC) can pursue: shut down and preserve capital, or take a gamble and keep going (read Shutting Down Is Not The Best Idea). I believed that a safe decision would be to wind down and save equity holders some money. The more risky, but possibly more lucrative decision would be to keep operating in hopes that the company can instill confidence in loan buyers again. According to a recent weekly report, it has become apparent that the management has chosen the more risky route. The clock has begun to tick.During the second week of June, Lending Club purchased $18.7 million of its own loans and retail loan sales volume recovered a bit to $23.2 million from the 2016 low of $18.9 million. While retail volume is recovering (still half of 2015's high), the company is now hemorrhaging cash to fund the loans that it originates. At a rate of $18.9 million per week, we are talking about $983 million per year. Furthermore, this cash drain will likely increase as volume of originations rises, since the company would have to spend more of its own cash to plug the funding deficiency. However, this may not be something that we have to worry about.As I mentioned in my last article, the company has tightened its lending policies by raising interest rates. This will draw in new investors at the expense of the volume of originations. We don't have the full picture yet, but this is a logical conclusion. The V20 Portfolio holds a position in a retailer (NASDAQ:CONN) that also acts as a lender, and recent credit changes have caused same store sales (i.e. demand) to decrease by 7%. If Lending Club ""suffers"" from the same fate, it may actually be beneficial for shareholders as the company won't have to fund as many loans with its own bank account.A key question that everyone wants to know is how long Lending Club can last given the current circumstances. The biggest factor is whether institutional lenders will return; but if we assume that the cash drain of $983 million per year will be the norm in the near-term, I believe that Lending Club can last one more year at most before being forced to wind down. At the end of Q1, the company had $973 million of monetary assets, including restricted cash (we are being quite liberal here). Assuming that the company can break even from operation, then the cash on hand should roughly give the company another year before capital dries up. One year may seem like a long time, but is our break-even assumption realistic?In my previous article, I forecasted that originations could be halved, which would add another $232 million of cash outflow as transaction fees drop. However, given the rumors that the company is drastically cutting marketing spend, it's possible that this extra cash burden can be dramatically reduced. Of course, this would be detrimental to the company's long-term prospects as competitors (e.g., On Deck Capital (NYSE:ONDK)) would be busy gobbling up market share in the meantime.TakeawayThe management has chosen to take the gamble and fund originations with Lending Club's own cash, giving the company a year to regain the trust of institutional investors. Even though the company has almost $1 billion of funds on its balance sheet, this is only a short-term remedy, as demand for loans far outpaces the supply, to the tune of $983 million per year. Keep in mind that I'm not implying that the cash used to fund the loans will be lost, as the assets (i.e. the loans) will still be on the balance sheet. But if the company doesn't find additional sources of capital soon, it will be forced to wind down. At that point, equity investors have no choice but to take a significant loss, depending on how aggressively the company will cut costs over the coming quarters.Click the ""Follow"" button beside my name on the top of the page to be updated with my latest insights.

3980172,67855,2016-06-06T12:54:39-04:00,"Lending Club is a like a bank on steroids. As such, we can analyze it using book value.Lending Club is experiencing a ""bank run.""The book value does not offer significant protection for equity investors.The book value will deteriorate as origination falls due to the lack of capital.Q1 results show that growth already slowed down despite massive marketing spend.","Lending Club (NYSE: LC) is a peer-to-peer lender. In many ways, it is essentially a bank on steroids. Powered by emerging financial technology, the company was able to open up a new market for consumer loans by engaging in peer-to-peer lending. As is the case with most financial institutions, Lending Club acts as the bridge between the borrower and the lender to earn a spread. The distinction is less clear for commercial banks, but depositors are essentially the lenders, and anyone applying for a loan can be treated as a borrower. If we accept Lending Club as a bank, then we can value it from a bank's perspective.A bank needs capital. Despite Lending Club's image of being ""retail investor friendly,"" a significant portion of loans are in fact purchased by institutional investors (banks, hedge funds and the like). As you may know, the recent scandal that saw the resignation of thr CEO dried up sources of capital, sending the company on a frenzy to find more capital to satisfy new loan demands. A bank without access to capital (think about a bank run) is nearly worthless, yet it would appear that the market has priced in a valuation floor for the company. At a share price of $4.73, the company has a market cap of $1.81 billion. This compares to a book value of $1.05 billion as of Q1.One of the most important metrics that we should look for when valuing a financial institution is the book value. Banks have a variety of other regulatory headaches to worry about, but Lending Club's balance sheet is very straight forward, so the book value is a fair approximation of liquidation value.The problem is two-fold. Because the market cap is substantially higher than the liquidation value of the company, investors really only receive protection for 58% of their investments. Secondly, the book value will likely begin to deteriorate. I'm not predicting this based on any macro data. Future impairments just seem to be the logical outcome as sources of funds disappear.The spread that Lending Club earns isn't interest. It's a flat fee levied on each transaction. This means that volume is key. As more loans are originated (regardless of quality), the company can pocket increasingly higher amounts of cash. However, this operating leverage works in reverse as well. As origination falls, revenue will drop like a rock while expenses remain flat. To illustrate, every 100 bps decline in origination (and hence revenue) will erase $6 million of profits (and hence book value) every year. This figure was calculated based on Q1's revenue.If the company is truly starved for capital, it isn't much of a stretch to think that origination could fall 10% or higher. Growth in Q1 (i.e. pre-scandal) already took a hit, coming in at just 6.6% quarter over quarter. This occurred despite a 24% jump in marketing spend, from $53.5 million in Q4 2015 to $66.6 million in Q1. If we look at the statistics from a macro stand point, wouldn't a softening economy increase loan demand for alternative lenders such as Lending Club? Regardless, I believe that the impending capital deficiency will result in serious impairment to the company's book value.TakeawayLending Club's book value doesn't offer enough protection based on the current liquidation value and the future prospects of the company. If the management decides to wind down (not out of the question given the public FAQ regarding going concern), shareholders stand to lose at least a third of their investments. If the capital deficiency problem isn't resolved soon, negative growth will directly impact the book value as originations (and the associated fees) decline.Click the ""Follow"" button beside my name on the top of the page to be updated with my latest insights.

3981715,101906,2016-06-13T15:25:02-04:00,"LendingClub recently suffered a major blow in investor confidence after Renaud Laplanche, CEO and founder of LC, was forced out by the board.This article provides nine steps that LC should consider for winning back the trust of investors.I composed these steps, but drew heavily from investor feedback on P2P lending forums such as Lend Academy as well as articles from the WSJ and SA.","LendingClub Corporation (NYSE:LC) provides a valuable service. Investors receive an alternative asset class that generally will have low correlation with stocks and returns in the 5-9% range. Borrowers receive credit at lower rates than a traditional credit card and payday lenders. This is as true today as it was before Renaud Laplanche, CEO and founder of LC, resigned on May 9th. Dozens of articles have been written on the nature of his departure and what it means for LC and its future. However, most of these articles appear to be written by folks who have never used the platform.I am a professional in the finance industry who is an investor in both the stock and the loans of LC. My diversified loan portfolio has given me a 10.18% return by investing in primarily C Grade loans on LC's platform. This is a bit higher than the 8.47% average published on LC's website, but not uncommon. A dozen or so small businesses have grown up around LC to help investors like myself analyze the historical performance of their loans and make more educated decisions. For details go to lendacademy.com and check out the forum which lists discussions on the tools available as well as tips on how to boost returns.What should be apparent to anyone who has reviewed the historical returns and posts from investors and borrowers alike is that the world is a better place because of LC. For decades, banks have had a monopoly on consumer credit via credit cards that charge prime borrowers around 13%. Subprime borrowers have been charged upwards of 30% if they were ""lucky"" enough to get credit at all. In an emergency, the rest of us had no other option than payday lenders who charge annualized rates of nearly 400%! At the same time, regular folks looking for a decent return on safe investments have been hard pressed to earn much more than the rate of inflation. With the emergence of P2P lending, I have the ability to help my fellow Americans get out of credit card debt while earning more than I expect to get from the stock market.Those who have compared LC's business model to subprime mistakes from the Financial Crisis are mistaken. LC doesn't make subprime loans and it publishes its data so everyone can see what it is doing. All borrowers have to have a FICO of at least 660. My typical borrowers have a FICO score of 690, debt-to-income of 20% and have held their job for five-plus years. About 97% of my borrowers have not missed a payment and about 95% have improved their credit score.Those who think that the next recession will be a disaster for LC are also mistaken. We have some insight into how well consumer loans perform through the cycle from historical annualized charge-off rates published by the Federal Reserve Bank, which got as high as 10.76% in 2010. This is bad but would in many cases be largely if not entirely offset by interest payments. In contrast, SPY dropped 50% peak-to-trough in less than a year with dividends offsetting less than 2%. The credit quality of LendingClub's borrower FICO scores and DTIs appear to be quite reasonable compared to the overall industry for consumer credit, so I see no reason to suspect that LC's borrowers would perform worse than the industry average in a recession.The challenge for LC is how to grow this valuable service in a manner that is sustainable, grows the trust of both stockholders and loan investors, grows the trust and appreciation of borrowers, and convinces regulators and the public more generally that LendingClub is a win-win for all parties involved. In my view, LC's management should consider the following eight steps to win back the trust of both stock investors and those investing in its loans. Investors would be wise to look for these changes in future transcripts and earnings reports. In short:How to win back the trust of stock investorsHow to win back the trust of retail loan investorsHow to win back the trust of stock investors1. Convince them that growth in loan originations going forward will be sustainable.LC's stock price fell from $25 at IPO to $7 by May 6th in part because investors saw LC become increasingly dependent on institutional investors for growth. Institutional investors such as banks, pension funds, and hedge funds accounted for 56% of 2016Q1 originations, up from 0% in 2011. Stock investors saw these new note buyers as potentially more risky because of the added concentration. More sales were coming from fewer buyers who may not show up tomorrow. Retail investors are less likely to bolt as a group unless they lose faith in the quality of the loans on the platform and/or feel they are competing at a disadvantage with wholesale investors. While banks would need to hold reserves against potential loan losses, retail investors have no costs of capital considerations. This original advantage to retail consumers is in large part how the original P2P model justified an IPO $10B market cap for LC. Management can convince stockholders that loan origination growth is sustainable by employing tighter internal policies as well as rules to prevent evaporation in institutional investment. Tighter internal policies may include third-party audits of all management and board investments in companies purchasing LC loans. Rules preventing an evaporation of demand from wholesale investors may include lock-out periods and penalties for changing purchase agreements. Additional restrictions should also be in place to prevent any single counterparty from consuming more than around 5% of originations per quarter. Shareholder, employee, and loan investor input should be considered before establishing any of these policies.2. Segregate growth in loans that are potentially in violation of state usury laws in financial statements.Another reason LC's stock price fell is because investors fear the impact of loans originated at higher interest rates than state usury laws permit. Banks routinely circumvent usury laws, thanks to a 1978 court case Marquette National Bank of Minneapolis vs. First of Omaha Service Corp. This ruling essentially allows banks to issue credit cards at higher rates than the borrower's state allows as long as the bank is in a state where the interest rate is permitted. LC underwrites loans through WebBank, which is based in Utah in large part because Utah has no usury law. LC management believed its arrangement with WebBank was sufficient to avoid conflicts with usury laws in other states until the Madden vs. Midland decision, which essentially forced LC to structure its fee arrangement with WebBank, so WebBank had some ""skin in the game"". However, a class action lawsuit filed in April has investors questioning whether this new arrangement is sufficient. The reality is that roughly 90% of LC's business model doesn't conflict with state usury laws, and there is good reason to believe that further modifying its relationship with WebBank, if necessary, could allow the company to remain active in providing credit to the remaining 10%. Segregating out its growth and earnings statistics to illustrate this will help investors put the ""Class Action Lawsuit"" headlines in perspective.3. Convince them that LC's underwriting model is consistent with Fair Lending laws.The Treasury department came out with a report on May 10th that listed many useful suggestions for the industry. Fair Lending was listed as a top concern of regulators. Some LC investors think that because LC uses an automated underwriting model, it cannot be in violation of ""The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) of 1974"", which states that ""financial institutions and other firms engaged in the extension of credit"" must make credit equally available to all creditworthy customers without regard to sex, marital status, race, national origin... etc. After all, how can a credit model discriminate against someone without facial recognition software. The reality is more complex. While not having any face-to-face aspect to the underwriting process helps reduce the risk of violation with the ECOA, it does not prevent the possibility. The underwriting process may inadvertently disfavor a protected class. For example, a variable indicating whether a borrower is a ""renter"" vs. ""owner"" is readily available for online retail loan investors to choose as a filter. Are protected classes more likely to be renters, and if so, are loan investors more likely to pass up borrowers who rent for those that own their own home? Perhaps, but even if they are, a careful read of the ECOA indicates that to be compliant; LC needs to only ensure that its underwriting model not inadvertently prevent protected borrower loans from entering the platform or receive a higher interest rate. The retail loan investor is not a ""financial institution or other firm."" However, LC would be wise to hire an external consulting firm familiar with Fair Lending practices to provide an independent review, disclose all material findings, and make any necessary changes to its underwriting model.4. Finally, stock investors will need to see LC win back the trust of retail investors.How to win back the trust of retail loan investors5. Reach out directly to P2P lenders via lending blogs like lendacademy.com and address their concerns.These more serious retail investors are the ""connectors"" that drive long-run sustainable growth in demand for LC loans. Malcolm Gladwell's book ""Tipping Point"" explains that ""connectors"" are the people who are willing to try products before others have even heard of them. Malcolm uses the example of Lexus to make his point. Lexus had to recall its first luxury car shortly after launching in 1990. This threatened its reputation, but management saw a silver lining. Who takes a chance on being the first to buy a product? Lexus's management understood that the people who went out on a limb to buy their first car are the kind of people that take pride in their investments and love to talk about them. So what did management do? It gave its first customers a first class experience. The company called each customer the same day the recall was announced. When the customers picked up their cars, they found that Lexus had washed them and filled up the tank. Customers that lived 100+ miles away received a knock on the door from a Lexus mechanic. This is LC's Lexus moment. So far, LC has given the impression of listening, but has not made any real progress in addressing the typical retail investors most pressing concerns. Comments from retail loan investors on lendacademy.com form the basis for the suggestions below.6. Construct a Bankruptcy Remote Vehicle (BRV) for all issued notes and more robust backup servicing.Prosper established a BRV in 2013. Many retail investors on the Lend Academy forum made clear indications at the time that they would switch substantial portions of their portfolio to Prosper because LC had no such BRV. What LC does have is ""limited"" backup servicing and unclear ownership of who has the rights to loan payments in the event of LC bankruptcy (see the prospectus - page 15). The easiest way for LC to boost sustainable growth would be to establish a BRV and provide a robust means of maintaining the servicing of loans should LC file for bankruptcy. The primary reason for the slowdown in retail investor interest since the IPO in 2014 is its ""counterparty risk"" or ""platform risk"" to LC, which threatens a total loss of their capital. LC has no debt, so the risk of bankruptcy is not immediate. However, it is possible that without the trust of retail investors, LC will not be able to cover expenses with new revenue and thus be forced to either reduce costs or take on debt. Taking on debt or using the cash to fund loans for their own balance sheet would further erode trust from retail investors, which currently see the $800M in cash on BS (as of 2015Q4), an untested backup servicing agreement, and unclear bankruptcy rights as the only thing standing between them and a material loss of capital. The upside is that if LC does establish a BRV to hold the loans on behalf of retail investors and provides more than adequate funding and procedures for backup servicing, the original peer-2-peer investors that were the bread and butter of the company until 2013 would likely grow exponentially.7. Ensure that institutional investors and insiders will not receive preferential treatment over retail investors.There are several reasons why retail investors have reason to suspect that they might be getting the short end of the stick. First, last month they learned that the former CEO had investments in companies that were buying LC loans wholesale. Additionally, LC manages some accounts for individual investors, which accounted for 15% of originations in 2016Q1. LC was also considering securitizations as a means of expanding its portfolio of institutional investors. All three of these practices provide incentives for LC to give institutional and wealthy investors preferential treatment. LC board members and management with stock in companies buying LC loans may be tempted to give those companies an opportunity to buy loans before they hit the retail investor loan platform.LC may be tempted to cherry pick loans with preferential characteristics for managed accounts and securitizations to keep wealthy investors and new institutional buyers coming back for more. What is to prevent employees from taking advantage of limitations in the underwriting models or anomalies in the performance monitoring systems by tweaking investments in their private loan portfolios? No evidence has come forth showing that this has happened. However, where there are incentives there is reason to be suspicious. Retail investors are generally aware of these potential conflicts of interests, which is one reason many, such as myself, have kept investments on the platform to only a small portion of our portfolio. There are many things that LC could do to give retail investors comfort that they are competing on an even playing field. For example, employees should not be allowed to specify criteria for their own private accounts besides the subgrade. LC can turn this to its advantage by having a single employee pooled portfolio that makes investments in loans that would otherwise not be 100% funded within the required time limit. By its willingness to invest in loans retail investors passed up, LC would show it believes in its own underwriting model. Moreover, it should publish the total returns of the employee portfolio by subgrade and benchmark to those selected by retail investors to show (hopefully) that there is no material difference. This would have the added benefit of encouraging the many investors who like the idea of using LC to diversity their stock portfolio, but don't believe they would be good at picking loans.8. Show how loan performance would likely be affected by a recession.The LC website provides statistics of how loan vintages have performed over time. Statistics are available for loans going back as far as 2007. The 2007-2008 vintages provide insight into how well LC loans will perform if we were to experience another recession. However, this performance is an incomplete picture because only 0.14% of originations occurred during these first two years ($26M/$18B). Moreover, 5.27% of 2007-08 originations are labeled as ""Does not meet the credit policy,"" nearly half of which defaulted. What this means is that it is unclear how well LC loans would perform in a recession. LC would be wise to publish a stress test of its portfolio each year and benchmark its performance against the industry for unsecured consumer loans. This would give retail investors some idea of how sensitive their portfolio returns will be so they don't have to make overly conservative assumptions.I bought LC notes because they have provided a great hedge to stocks and stand a good chance of outperforming them given the exceedingly high price of SPY and strong credit quality.I bought LC stock because, so many of the negative articles out there showed a panic that simply wasn't justified by the underlying business model and failed to recognize the moat of a company that owns rights to underwrite and service the largest and most liquid market for #P2P consumer loans in the country.I'll buy more of both if LC's management takes serious steps toward the above... and I'll tell all my family, friends and SA followers to do the same."

Investors have become a little more confident in Lending Club, but danger lies ahead.Wall Street Journal recently reported that Lending Club held talks with some hedge funds to discuss $5 billion of funding. Three funds were named: Och-Ziff, Soros, and Third Point. Nothing came of the talks, but that still didn't prevent investors from picking up some shares on Monday. Unfortunately, I do not think that Lending Club's prospects have improved at all. Given the lack of funding in the near-term, the management is faced with a tough decision. The company can choose to accept defeat and wind down, but preserve some value for shareholders, or to keep operating, risking total loss, but reap the rewards in the event of a success. Let's look at the two scenarios in more detail.Shut DownThere is a sound financial case for winding down the business. At the end of Q1, the tangible book value was $830 million, consisting of very liquid assets including $688 million of cash. If the company chooses to wind down, it is possible that it could even generate additional profits during the process as expenses such as sales and marketing can be completely eliminated. For the sake of simplicity, we'll make the generous assumption that the company's liquidation value is $1 billion.$1 billion is still a lot lower than the current market cap of $1.69 billion. However, should the management choose to wind down, $1 billion of residual value would be very achievable due to the liquidity of the assets. At the end of the day, equity holders get a 40% haircut, but gets to fight another day.This is the safe option.Keep GoingWhy quit now?Source: Forbes.comThe management could also choose to tough it out and keep the company afloat by accepting losses in the short-term. I'm not aware of any problems that could have influenced the borrowers, so demand for loans is likely to remain elevated. Loan originations grew 68% quarter on quarter in Q1 from $1.64 billion to $2.75 billion. Based on the $8.4 billion of originations in 2015, demand could be in excess of $14 billion in 2016. However, the company did tighten borrowing requirements to entice lenders, so demand for loans could be flat.Because there is not enough capital to fund the aforementioned loan demand, the company would have to accept negative growth in loan originations. For the sake of argument, let's assume that demand for loans stays constant at $8 billion. This means that the company will only get $3 billion of capital from retail investors. The remainder ($5 billion) would constitute the funding gap that the management wanted to fill with hedge fund capital. We can be a bit more optimistic and say that the tighter lending requirements will increase retail funds to $4 billion (more people would want to invest).If actual originations fall to $4 billion (capped by whatever capital is available), the one-time transaction fees will take a big hit. If Q1's $124.5 million of transaction fees were halved (since originations were halved), the company would have suffered a pre-tax loss of $58 million in the quarter alone (pre-tax income was extremely thin at $4.3 million). This quarterly pre-tax loss translates to an annual loss of $232 million. Since the company never paid much tax, shareholders would have to absorb virtually all of the loss. Note that in order to arrive at this number, we made some pretty generous assumptions such as an increase in retail funds (there is a question of whether retail investors still have faith in Lending Club) and no deterioration in other sources of revenues (servicing, management fees, etc.).We found out earlier that the company had $830 million of tangible book value. If this is a capital base from which the losses will be deducted, the management would have 3.6 years to fix the company before the capital base is depleted. At that point in time, there would be nothing left for shareholders.Which Path?While I am bearish on the stock, I believe that the management should take the chance to fix the company instead of winding down. As long as the company can show institutional investors that it is capable of playing by the rules, then it will regain access to capital, and profitability will follow. During the process however, equity holders will suffer as losses pile on. In the short-term, I believe there is no winning with Lending Club. If the company winds down today, investors will suffer a 40% loss. If the company chooses to keep going, I foresee the company incurring hundreds of millions of losses over the next few quarters.Click the ""Follow"" button beside my name on the top of the page to be updated with my latest insights.

At the time, I had been considering participating in the IPO, as being an investor in the platform itself had allowed me to buy shares before they hit the market. As it turned out, I decided to heed my own advice and proceed cautiously. I felt as though the IPO price was vastly overvaluing the company. The IPO ended up giving LC a market cap around $8Bn, which seemed to me as being quite excessive for where the business currently is. Since the post-IPO pop, I have felt very much like I made the right choice, as LC has done little to reward investors. The fallout from the most recent quarter, and the forced exit of Renaud Laplanche, has brought to the forefront the problems Lending Club's business model face.These problems have been discussed at length in financial journalism over the past few months, and are not specific to LC, but to all of the new wave of FinTech that is trying to disrupt traditional banking. For example, the privately-held SoFi recently announced they would be buying their own loans through a hedge fund. This situation sounds eerily similar to Mr. Laplanche's personal investment in a fund that was buying up LC notes, part of what got him in trouble. Meanwhile, other public FinTech companies, such as On Deck (NYSE:ONDK) and Square (NYSE:SQ), have shown similar issues in their business models in the most recent quarter.These failings paints a picture of an entire industry where the expectations have rapidly outgrown reality. Like 3D printing in 2013-2014, the market got way ahead of itself with the appearance of potentially disruptive products. However, the bottom line is now clear- companies like Lending Club, On Deck, Square, and SoFI do not have the access to capital that traditional banks have. Without having a sticky source of funding, such as what traditional banks receive from customer deposits, it seems to be legitimately impossible that these companies could ever meet the expectations that were set out for them just a year ago by the stock market. FinTech is an exciting, and potentially disruptive industry in the long term, but until these issues are figured out, investors should stay away from the stock of Lending Club, and other FinTech companies.However, while I would not want to buy shares of LC at this time, the platform itself is still a great place to put your money. I have been investing in the platform since Fall 2014, and although it took me a while to get stable returns due to starting with such a low amount of money, I have managed to create a portfolio with a past rate of return of 7%, and forward looking returns of 9%, as I've honed my investment strategy (see screen shots). These returns are well above the returns of the S&P in the past 18 months, and won't be affected by the turmoil in Lending Club the stock.What's really interesting about the platform right now is that, since the scandal, it seems as though institutional investors are running for the hills. Notes on the secondary market have begun selling at a ridiculous clip. I have been using Lending Robot, an automated investment service that runs on Lending Club as well as competitors Funding Circle and Prosper, for the past 12 months. One of my filters is designed to catch what I deem as extremely low risk secondary market notes. The filter has several criteria, including a discount to face value, no late payments in history, less than $10 dollars in face value, and less than 6 months of payments left. This is fairly stringent criteria, as the notes that come out of such a search are very low risk since they are so late in their payment history. This criteria usually nets me only 1 note a month. However, since the earnings release, I have seen a huge uptick in purchases. In fact, the filter has purchased more notes in the past two weeks than it has in the past 12 months combined! Curious, I took a look at the market myself to see if this was part of a larger trend. I found what looks to be a trend. Widening my parameters, I found 204,000 notes that were listed for sale with a discount and no late history. It looks as though institutional investors are not just abandoning the stock, or pulling funding for new loans. They are now also trying to sell the notes they already own.It seems as though the fear that has deservedly brought down Lending Club's stock has carried over into Lending Club's platform. However, the fear here is not justified at all. As such, Lending Club has become an anomaly for investors, one in which investors are likely to create more value for themselves by buying the product instead of buying the stock. Lending Club's business model may mean that it is not going to be able to grow fast enough to placate wall street, but the problem is one of funding, not one of demand. Demand is still very strong. Considering the amount of competitors in the industry who'd likely buy the company, and the continuing demand for these types of personal loans, even if the worst case happens - Lending Club is bought out or goes bankrupt - the notes you own on the platform will still perform. Buying into Lending Club's loans has shown to be very profitable for investors, and the current fire sale that is happening on the secondary market is allowing for investors to scoop up strong notes at a discount. I recommend investors begin utilizing LC's platform as a means of creating a strong fixed income investment in their portfolio. By using automated investment criteria, they can begin purchasing strong loans on the primary markets as well as scoop up heavily discounted, low risk notes on the secondary market."
3981272,101886,2016-06-10T11:06:52-04:00,"LendingClub's recent news and stock price meltdown have little effect on operations.Institutional investors are shying away, leaving more meat on the bones for individuals.Recent tightening of lending standards should reduce defaults.Reporting taxes is a lot easier than it was in the past.","LendingClub (NYSE:LC) is a peer-to-peer lending platform that matches investors to borrowers. Borrowers take out 3- or 5-year loans on the platform. LendingClub packages these into ""notes."" Investors can invest as little as $25 into each note. By reducing the middle-man costs of banking, borrowers, who overwhelmingly use the service for debt consolidation and to pay off credit cards, get a better rate than they would from other sources. Investors get a better risk-adjusted return on their investments than they might from other sources. LendingClub, for their part, makes money on loan origination fees and transaction fees as the loans are serviced.LC has been under a cloud lately since their board of directors ousted the CEO over an issue where $22 million in loans were issued to an institutional buyer that did not meet that buyer's criteria. The stock has since tanked as institutional investors are backing away from the platform. It has been a rough ride for shareholders.Note: I use the term shareholder for those that own LC stock, and investor for those using the platform to invest in the borrower notes.I don't see much to attract me again as a shareholder. Lawsuits and government regulators are causing the company some headaches. There is so much uncertainty as to the valuation of the company that I'm currently not comfortable as a shareholder. I have every reason to believe the company will grow and be profitable, but likely at a slower pace than their original plan.With that said, it may be the best time ever to be an investor in their notes. I've been one since 2012, and things are moving in the right direction.The turmoil in the company is unlikely to affect individual note investors. A recent letter sent to me (and probably all investors) from acting CEO Scott Sanborn addresses this:What I like about investing in my portfolio is that it is almost a distinct asset class, adding diversification. It's certainly not a stock. An investment in LC notes is a bit more like a high-yield bond fund, but since investors invest such small amounts in each note and (typically) hold to maturity, there's not as much interest rate risk. With enough diversification, there's little downside risk. LendingClub reports that historically, only about 0.04% of investors have lost money if they carry over 100 notes.Some of the complaints that I have had in the past as in investor with LendingClub are:All four situations are improving:Additionally, A recent article by James Godbout ""LendingClub - Don't Buy The Stock, Buy The Notes"" describes a method for hunting for notes on the secondary market.In conclusion, I think there's little reason to fear investing in LC notes, and in many ways, this may be the best time there's ever been for these investments."
3976702,101826,2016-05-20T14:19:20-04:00,"Lending Club is in a chaos due to recent revelations about the CEO, which led him to resign.But have borrowers deserted the platform?Similarities to AmEx 1963 scandal!","Lending Club (NYSE:LC) is the United States' largest online credit marketplace connecting borrowers and investors. Both can benefit by reducing the spreads that would have normally gone to the banks.Founded by Renaud Laplanche in 2006, Lending Club was the first peer-to-peer lending company to register its securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As per the latest Company Statistics, the company's loans funded to date are $18.732 Billion up to March 31st, 2016. When the company raised $1 Billion in 2014 through the world's largest Fintech IPO, nobody would have thought that the company would get caught up in such a deep crisis. The company started facing problems in 2016. It failed to attract investors, a scandal unearthed over some of the company's loans and revelations about CEO Renaud Laplanche led to his resignation. Lending Club had improperly sold $22 Million of loans to an Institutional Investor that did not meet the investor's standards. The New York Times later reported that the Company's CEO was guilty of not disclosing his interests in the investment fund that Lending Club was considering as an investment.All these revelations brought the share price of the company to $3.99 as on May 19th, 2016. Lending Club has suffered a tumble of around 80% from its initial price at the time of its listing.Even before the above crisis, Lending Club was not able to able to live up to its reputation of being the pioneer of fintech industry. It is being forced to compete with other unlisted Fintech lenders who do not face the investor scrutiny of a listed peer. The company had a negative return on assets for the year 2014 and 2015 of -1.13 and -0.10 respectively.The Lending Club's fall can be traced to its changing business model. Lenders have turned out to be more of Hedge Funds and sophisticated parties who prefer to lend to only a specific category of borrowers. Second, and perhaps the most important reason is that despite having emerged as a real competitive force against the banks, LC's growth has been choppy. The investors have also raised concerns about the algorithm LC uses to assess its borrowers.The worst is not yet over for the Lending Club as the company announced that a lawsuit against it appeared imminent. An internal review of the company found that LC was not confirming to its own rules regarding loans. In order to regain investor's confidence, LC in its recent statement said that it might have to offer higher interest rates to attract them and invest its own capital in loans which would again erode Company's margins. In the aftermath of the scandal, it will become difficult for LC to retain its key personnel. To retain them it might have to boost pay packages which would put an additional burden on the company.Additional analysisAs per the 3 analyst ratings posted on Morningstar, 2 have a Hold rating and 1 has a Sell rating and nobody is recommending buying the stock. As per the upgrade and downgrade data posted on Yahoo finance by various research firms like Keefe Bruyette, Pacific Crest, Guggenheim, all seem to have downgraded the Lending Club's stock. The fall of Lending Club has instigated fears in the mind of investors regarding the long-term growth potential of marketplace lending. Decelerating growth rates and emerging regulatory issues have added fuel to the fire.But one must not ignore the fact that market has also been ignoring Company's revenue and earnings, both of which either matched or beat Wall Street expectations.LC had reported a Revenue of $211 Million and $430 Million with Net Loss of $33 Million and $2 Million for the year 2014 and 2015. But during the Trailing Twelve Months, the scenario has been different. It reported TTM revenue of $501 Million and a Net Profit of $6 Million respectively. Also, if we compare the performance of Lending Cub with its peers like On Deck Capital (NYSE:ONDK), Lending Club's Performance was not a disaster in financial terms as On Deck capital reported a TTM Revenue of $261 Million and a Net Loss of $9 Million. This makes one feel positive about LC.It is important to realize that this crisis does not hurt the franchise the company has built in the eyes of its borrowers.As per latest PWC reports, the P2P Lending market is expected to reach $150 Billion by 2025. So one cannot write off LC, which has been the strongest player in this industry. At least the borrowers would continue to use the P2P platform to reap the benefits. Lending Club might be a promising Investment, if one is looking for a contrarian play."
3977522,86786,2016-05-24T17:48:01-04:00,"The information within LendingClub's 10-Q is more damning than that of the earnings report and should have sent investors scrambling to sell.Citigroup has given up on LC, turning the company down after a request for support.The company’s stock should not even be on your watch list, unless you’re looking for short opportunities.","So now that LendingClub (NYSE:LC) is a penny stock (technically defined as anything trading under $5 per share), should we be looking at it as a penny stock? Is it undervalued? Is it on its way to bankruptcy?These are obvious questions after the 50% drop after its May 9 earnings report. But more concerning to me is the fact that the stock has not moved after May 16, when LC posted its latest 10-Q. To me, the information within the 10-Q is more damning than that of the earnings report and should have sent investors scrambling to sell.The Management's New Goal: Keep LC Alive for 12 More MonthsClearly, the company is not performing. If it were, we would not have witnessed a 50% fall in the stock after the earnings report. Yet management has set rewards for itself as if the company were growing at the speed of sound.Straight from the 10-Q (bolded at my liberty):LC offers no dividend to shareholders. Yet it offers plenty of new rewards to insiders. These monies represent a significant increase from the $40,000 per year salaries that they received last year, according to the 2015 Schedule 14 A form.Does the management of a company that recently witnessed a 50% decrease in stock price deserve such a raise? Could the money have been better spent on R&D, acquisitions, dividends, and buybacks? Are investors getting the short end of the stick?These are questions that any fundamental investor must ask prior to making the decision to stick with LC after the recent earnings report. As a public company, LC's duty is to help its investors reap more ROI than the investors could do on their own. Giving the board of directors an 11-fold increase in salary does not seem to be in the best interest of the investors.Justified?The only possible justification for such an action is the belief that this 11-fold increase in the directors' salaries will lead to an equivalent increase in EPS or some other metric that ""trickles down"" to the shares in the hands of investors. For EPS, this would mean we should expect an EPS of $0.55 by the end of the year, which is unreasonable.Oddly enough, the earnings selloff corresponded with an EPS meet. The revenue estimate was not met, but in my experience in trading earnings, revenue meets and beats rarely affect stock price like EPS. Investors are possibly losing faith in LC, which was one of the few anticipated IPOs in recent memory.Perhaps investors have become disillusioned with finding the next Facebook or Apple and are grasping at straws, only later to find that those straws have thorns. Even larger corporations, such as Citigroup (NYSE:C), have given up on LC, turning the company down after a request for support. Moving forward, it seems little beyond an amazing Q2 earnings report that can save LC.And with much of the ""extra"" revenue going toward upper management, why would anyone expect the company to post solid earnings resulting from a streamlined company? Management raises, extra stock options, new bonuses, a free corporate jet… someone here is winning, and it sure isn't the shareholders.Scam?I attempted to contact LendingClub for a comment on management incentives but received no response. Still, the company itself is legitimate. Clients do receive yields on their investments, and the company has virtually guaranteed payouts on clients' loans through a third-party servicer. But while clients and shareholders must put up capital to see returns, management does not, as payment is completely unchained to performance, thereby explaining the conundrum of bonuses in light of the stock price falling.A relatively new company with clear problems in bolstering stock price should not be giving handouts to its board of directors until the shareholders are benefiting. My concern is that this company's new goal is simply to keep the gears churning so as to reap its 1-year to 4-year bonuses, as promised at the very bottom (intentional?) of the 10-Q report. If so, the company's stock should not even be on your watch list, unless you're looking for short opportunities.Learn More about EarningsMy Exploiting Earnings premium subscription is now live, here on Seeking Alpha.

A number of commenters took me to task for not having valued the cash on the company's balance sheet. I responded that in the circumstances, I did not know how much value to give to the cash. More recent disclosures have convinced me that the cash should be given little weight in valuing the company because the company is incurring increasing expenses, seems likely to endure a period of significant operating losses, and may have to use the cash to support the platform in other ways.Disclosures in the Lending Club Form 10-Q that was filed May 16th and in an 8-K filed the same day suggest to me that at least for the near future, the company will be in survival mode and, as part of that mode of operations, will change its business model significantly. Those changes may permit survival, but they do not seem to me to embody the strengths that the company was built on, and they will require increased costs. Here is an excerpt from page 63 of the 10-Q report:A company that is under attack is well advised to make bleak disclosures to protect itself from securities law liabilities. But even by those standards, the foregoing is gloomy news. Basically, it says that the business model is broken and that the company is investigating how to fix it. Management may or may not find a way through.In addition, see the next set of disclosures, which are particularly bleak if one thought that Lending Club's loan sales were more final than most securitizations:In case anyone does not recall, it was the reps and warranties on securitized loans that cost many banks and other securitizers billions of dollars in the aftermath of the GFC. Lending Club is now having to go down the road that leads to such risks. It is a costly road if one is to be certain that the reps and warranties are true, but even more costly in arrears if one does not incur the costs up front.Expenses, expensesIn addition, one can see that expenses, rather than being pared, as I might have hoped management might do as part of a revised business plan, have to be increased to assure the market that the control breaches that led to firing of the CEO have been fixed. In this regard, see the letter to stockholders dated May 16, 2016 here. See also additional measures the company is taking here. It appears that management has no choice but to pull out the stops to save the enterprise. But the costs will eat up a great deal of money.The value of all that cashThe recent 10-Q discloses about $683 million in cash, $104 million in restricted cash, and $284 million of securities held for sale. That is indeed a lot of liquidity. But much of it will be needed in order to survive. How much I would not venture to guess."
3976682,101535,2016-05-20T13:02:28-04:00,"LendingClub has been on a constant losing streak since the initial public offering.Recently, the stock has been absolutely hammered in the market.LendingClub will be either a 10-bagger or completely lose its price.","Speculative betI don't usually speculate in the stock market and my portfolio consists mainly of high quality dividend stocks. But every once in a while I make a speculative bet and I chose LendingClub (NYSE:LC) to be this year's bet. LendingClub has around 2.1 beta, which is very aggressive compared to the rest of my stocks and will provide excitement for the near, medium and long-term horizon. LendingClub's current price fluctuation is wide thanks to day traders. The stock trades up 10% just to lose all the gains the next day.Selling pressure is nothing new to investors in LendingClub. It has been on a constant losing streak since the initial public offering, but during the past two weeks, it has sold off significantly, losing more than half of its value. Main reasons are 1) CEO Laplanche's resignation, 2) Subpoena from the DOJ and other legal actions from law firms, 3) large institutions holding off until there's more certainty about the loans Laplanche made, and 4) no guidance were given. There might be some loss of confidence from borrowers and investors following these events. We can see the effects in the second quarter report later this summer and it will be crucial.Source: BloombergI bought my shares last week at $3.97, so clearly, above today's price. LendingClub represents around 1.1% of my portfolio. If it turns out to be that LendingClub goes out of business, it wouldn't ruin my performance that much. But in a case of rapid price appreciation, it would make a clear impact. I believe the company will either be a ten bagger or completely lose its price, but one thing is for certain: LendingClub's stock won't be flat. Every investor that decides to buy into LendingClub at the moment, should only make it at an amount that the investor is willing to lose most or all of it. If there is an event that the invested amount is lost, I would still be able to deduct the loss from my capital gains taxes making this investment as a speculative and potentially a tax beneficiary.Why LendingClub?Doing my research, I went through hundreds of pages of loan applications and got an idea about the applicants, at least in number terms. It amazes me that LendingClub gives all their loan data from 2008 to this day (latest was released on May the 17th). I went through quarterly and annual reports; however, what really fascinated me was the platform investors' progress reports. They demonstrate it in blogs or in YouTube, how they manage their money and diversify it over different loan grades.A1 grade is the best and has the lowest interest rates, which starts from just 5.3%. G5 grade is found deep in the junk section with interest rates more than 30%. Most applicants are in the A/B grades and have good to excellent credit scores. People really enjoy the whole process of managing their loan portfolio. It gives them and the money a sense of purpose, when they are able to loan money to other people that are in need, but at the same time getting a decent return. Applicants also like the easy process where they can feel proud that people are trusting their hard-earned money to them. It really is a revolutionary way to combine the idle cash to the people who need it.Source: LendingClub IR. Loan origination since 2011.In just over 5 years, LendingClub's loan origination has skyrocketed from $321 million in 2011 to over $8.3 billion in 2015. The company's outstanding growth, really gives an idea how fast the peer-to-peer lending has grown. Amidst all of the recent events, LendingClub's growth will most likely be slower this year.Source: LendingClub IR.This was supposed to be the year when LendingClub turned strongly to profit and would finally help the stock to go higher, but there's a chance that the slower growth will delay profits and the stock price to 2017.ConclusionsAfter I saw that LendingClub was sold off so significantly, I got interested on the stock. I looked through the figures and found a great growth story, while the stock price has been quite the opposite. LendingClub could be just a never-ending falling knife. Trying to find the bottom for this stock won't be easy. One metric that could be used is the net cash per share ratio. However, there's a chance that LendingClub's cash could shrink significantly going forward into 2016.The company has $868 million in cash and cash equivalents, meaning that of the $1.3 billion market cap, the operating business is valued little over $430 million or $1.13 per share. The company also trades at a forward P/S of ~2 and p/b of ~1.2. After looking at the figures, the company isn't such a speculative bet after all. Only time will tell, was Laplanche's mistake the end of the peer-to-peer lending or was it just a small bump on the road."

But what some may consider the end, I view as a new beginning.""What the caterpillar calls the end of the world, the master calls a butterfly."" - Richard BachCynics, I have a newsflash for you. When the automobile industry experienced turbulence, people didn't rush to trade back their cars for horse-drawn buggies. When the Internet bubble burst in 2000, people did not revert to fax machines. Likewise, we are not going to return to antiquated lending models. Millennials are not going to suddenly start liking banks more than root canals. People are not going to stop looking online for investment ideas. They are not going to resume waiting around for some stock jock to call and pitch them on 100 shares of IBM (NYSE:IBM). The FinTech train has long left the station and there is no turning back.The earth doesn't spin in reverse. What we are experiencing now is the natural evolution of an industry. In order to evolve, we must err. Stumbling is how we learn and grow. This is nothing new. Mankind has been advancing in this manner for centuries.Personally, when I detect fear and pessimism in markets, I smell opportunity. Opportunity for better business models to prevail. Opportunity for innovation to flourish. And opportunity for money to be made. Today is no exception.Last week I had the honor of speaking at Crowdfund Beat's third Annual Crowdfunding Conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. During the presentation - which focused on the catalyst that would enable crowdfinance to scale - I explained that the present turmoil in FinTech was nothing more than a nascent industry figuring out new ways to scale - as it can no longer depend on fickle hedge fund investors.To download the complete presentation, click here.Brian Dally, CEO of GROUNDFLOOR, the first online real estate lending platform catering to smaller retail investors, pins the recent industry tumult on the dominance, allure and sugar high of the over-reliance on institutional capital, and believes that the solution lies in an industry-wide cultivation of retail capital. According to Dally, ""Inherent to retail capital is certain structural safeguards for investors, platforms and borrowers alike that our industry would do well to acknowledge and model going forward.""I couldn't agree more.In fact, many in the industry are also are now starting to realize that the scalability of marketplace lending will ultimately depend upon the retail investor and his appetite for tax-deferred yield. The very same discovery was made decades earlier by a young mutual fund industry which was able to scale into a multi-trillion dollar market simply by aligning with the novel IRA and 401k.A similar growth opportunity exists for marketplace lending - if it can figure out a compliant and efficient way to engage the retail investor and penetrate the $14 trillion retail retirement market. This will require a modern self-directed retirement product technologically capable of seamlessly integrating with online platforms, regulatory support, new distribution partners and solutions, and a commitment to investor and financial advisor education.Fortunately, as I've been pointing out for quite some time, all of these elements are occurring in confluence.Last month's official launch of IRA Services' ISCP technology - the first highly scalable, bank-grade secure, cloud-based retirement investment solution - was an industry game-changer. Some of the most respected and recognized finance platforms have already begun integrating the ISCP technology.The groundbreaking new Worthy app has finally arrived to help the masses more realistically and achievably prepare for retirement. I believe that Worthy will not only transform America's retirement infrastructure, it will ultimately help redefine investment product distribution (See here).Finally, as was mentioned in our recently released white paper, a more progressive regulatory environment is materializing that will broaden access to alternative products.I launched the FinFair Conference last year specifically to highlight these regulatory shifts and showcase these innovations in retail financial products. Given the acceleration of innovation and the implementation of ""retail-friendly"" regs, I expect our next conference will be even more leading edge.Understanding how all of these dynamics will impact marketplace lending was perhaps best expressed in the final paragraph of the white paper which we released last month - prior to all of these industry jarring announcements.If this is indeed the end of marketplace lending, I would surmise that it is the rebirth of true peer-to-peer investing."

Jefferies, who maintains LC as a client, declined to buy LC loans for onward securitization.Lending Club's alleged lending impropriety will exacerbate falling securitization rates and reduce LC's capacity for loan origination eroding growth and profit forecasts.Our Take: Lending Club's cash position is likely sufficient to absorb near term losses, but without outside capital the business model will not meet growth targets.","Lending Club's Problem Just Got BiggerIn March 2016, we published an article titled Financial Tech: Falling Loan Securitization Rates Portend Rising Defaults; Threatens Industry Profitability. We argued that the recent trend of falling securitization rates likely foreshadowed future defaults for peer-to-peer (P2P) lending derived securitized loans from companies such as Lending Club (NYSE: LC).While defaults of Fintech derived securitizied loans have not had sufficient time to incubate since late March 2016, the securitzation problem we highlighted looks poised to worsen even without this catalyst. The root of the problem is alleged impropriety at Lending Club involving the mischaracterization of USD $22 million in loans sold to an investor. This raised questions on corporate quality controls and eroded confidence in Lending Club, and the broader unregulated fintech industry, which is reliant on selling loans (for onward securitization) to generate additional lending capital.Notably, Citigroup (NYSE: C) declined a request from Jefferies, an investment bank, to provide additional support for Lending Club. Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) halted Lending Club loan purchases. William Blair and Company suspended its analyst coverage of Lending Club. Stifel Nichols downgraded Lending Club to neutral from buy. The withdrawal of support from these four firms is notable in that there were involved with the December 2014 Lending Club IPO. Lending Club alluded to this lack of institutional support in their recent 10-Q filing:Additionally, Jefferies, despite being retained by Lending Club to find investors for third party loan funding, halted plans to buy Lending Club originated loans. If the very companies hired to support Lending Club are abdicating then we see no compelling reason why retail investors should buy another round of stock in what appears to be last call at the Lending Club.Reading Between The Lines of The 10-QLending Club's problems have worsened to the point that they are considering to offer equity to entice buyers to resume buying Lending Club originated loans. Lending Club released the following statement in their 10-Q report:Should this plan come to fruition, it will dilute current equity positions and is an unsustainable incentive structure, especially for a company with a razor thin profit margins of 2.71%.LC data by YChartsOffering equity inducements cannot technically be categorized as a traditional debt for equity swap. However, such equity dilution/ devaluing resembles the debt for equity swaps we are currently seeing in the US oil and gas sector, as well as among Chinese state owned enterprises (SOEs). These troubled sectors are the kind of company you would expect to find near closing time, and not the company Lending Club investors should want to keep.We note additional analysis on Lending Club's 10-Q public filing can be found in an article by SA contributor Martin Lowy titled Lending Club's Near Future Looks Gloomy.Is This a Market Overreaction?We assess the market's reaction to Lending Club's mischaracterization of loans to be justified for two reasons. First, the mischaracterization of loans that are intended to be sold for securitization is reminiscent of the 2008-2009 subprime mortgage lending crisis. While the scale of Lending Club loan derived securitization is nowhere near the scale of the subprime mortgage crisis, investors would be wise to look at Lending Club's loan practices with similar skepticism.Lending Club's current problems highlight that after 2009 a significant segment of consumer loans migrated from regulated banking institutions to unregulated, non-bank lenders such as Lending Club. The recently announced Department of Justice investigation into Lending Club serves to feed investor fears about potential for additional downside at Lending Club and could portend increased regulation in the non-bank lending sector (Fintech included), which thrived in part due to the absence of cumbersome regulation.Additionally, investors should remember that the market opportunity for higher risk consumer P2P loans was made possible because American financial institutions largely vacated the space of subprime consumer loans (including home mortgages) due to the after burn of the subprime crisis, new regulatory requirements (Dodd-Frank), and a desire to avoid higher risk lending business. As a result, loan loss rates at large American banks remain near historic lows. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and other early Lending Club backers running to the door suggests they do not want to get burned by the same fire twice.Our Take: Trolling At Last Call is Not For UsLending Club has approximately $1 billion in liquidity and reported positive earnings ($0.05 per share) last quarter. We assess that this capital buffer will enable them to maintain marginal profitability, but the capital on-hand will not be sufficient to achieve growth. Industry analysts project that Lending Club will require US $6-$8 billion in new funding to meet growth targets. Failure to meet these targets will send remaining investors to the exits. Therefore, we assess the most likely endgame for LC is to get acquired at a discount to current valuations.We do not see where Lending Club will find the capital needed to grow given: 1) the recent slowdown in securitization rates beginning in March 2016, 2) a high likelihood for further securitization origination deterioration due to the absence of loan buyers, and 3) disappearing interest from institutional investors such as Citigroup to inject new capital into Lending Club. With only $1 billion in cash and no new capital injections on the horizon we believe Lending Club's core lending business will be hamstrung.We will continue to watch for additional signs of collapsing institutional support for Lending Club, especially among Lending Club's IPO underwriters and book runners including: Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS), Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS), and Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC). The emergence of significant institutional support for Lending Club would compel us to reassess our position.However, at this juncture, a building wave of shareholder lawsuits, regulatory headwinds, falling securitization rates, increasing loan-loss rates, and a lack of capital to meet growth targets are reason enough for us to stay away from trolling the last call at the Lending Club."

The stock now trades at a death watch valuation despite no fundamental change to the performance of the loans on the platform.LendingClub dropped to $3.50 on Friday for an incredibly low market valuation of $1.34 billion. With $868 in cash, should investors run towards the online lending platform while everybody else is running away?Business ProspectsThe key to the future of LendingClub is the success of both borrowers and investors on the lending platform. My last article highlighted how the investments of the institutional lenders on the platform was crucial to the short-term success. The ramifications of the questionable lending practices regarding the CEO's resignation centered primarily on the trust factor with institutions that only recently starting using the platform in volumes.Consumers appear less at risk considering the 10-year history on the platform and the less formal process of investing. It's one thing to convince a committee that LendingClub loans are worth the risk than an individual's simple decision based on experience with the platform.As long as the prospects that created the network that originated over $2.7 billion loans during Q1 remains generally intact, LendingClub will survive and eventually thrive from this short-term impact.The platform still offers a compelling proposition even if a vast majority of the institutions including Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, and the small business BancAlliance have all suspended lending money to purchase loans. The value proposition hasn't changed from the below equation. As long as borrowers save money, and lenders make money, the removal of a CEO isn't likely to usher in a new era for the company.Source: LendingClub Q1 presentationThe biggest fear is that the platform craters from not having enough lending to support new borrowers that eventually move on to another platform. The net annualized performance of loans continues to suggest that the platform is only getting better with age. Why would lenders move on with these net annualized returns?Source: LendingClub credit statsDeath Watch ValueWith the stock closing the week around the lows of $3.50, LendingClub is now only worth $1.34 billion. With $868 million in cash on the balance sheet, the stock has an incredibly low enterprise value below $500 million.At this level, the market is valuing LendingClub at a death watch value when the expected annual revenue streams exceed the enterprise value. The Ychart metrics don't accurately portray the enterprise value metric for LendingClub, so the below chart uses the forward P/S ratio to compare the valuations of online platform stocks like Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Yelp (NYSE:YELP).Of course, the companies depend on different business models with Twitter and Yelp reliant on advertisers as opposed to loan origination fees. The chart does highlight how investors started 2015 valuing the fee based business of LendingClub more favorably than the platforms of Twitter and Yelp. After all, LendingClub is the leader in the category and most will argue that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) easily dominates the social media category over Twitter.In addition, the above chart doesn't accurately reflect the enterprise valuation proposition of LendingClub. Even the hated Twitter and Yelp trade with an enterprise value of roughly 2x forward revenues. LendingClub's stock would need to reverse course and at least double to match the multiples of these other hated platforms.TakeawayThe key investor takeaway is that until the performance of loans on the platform changes, the business model of LendingClub is likely to survive and thrive this disruption. The stock offers a death watch value with the multiples now trading below the lows of other hated online platforms like Twitter and Yelp.The real key is knowing when the stock ultimately hits bottom and that is unknown at this point. Nothing prevents more negative news flows next week with regulatory scrutiny the biggest fear at this point. The reality though is that nothing suggests anything is wrong with the business model making the stock a bargain at these levels whether or not LendingClub trades even lower next week."
3973652,40561,2016-05-11T07:30:07-04:00,"LendingClub recently announced that its CEO resigned following an investigation that proved the CEO sold unqualified loans to an investor.This could just be the beginning of a series of issues for LendingClub and the industry, whose entire business model is based on their access to capital.It's only a matter of time before these peer-to-peer lenders start getting regulated much more and lose their 'competitive advantage' on traditional banks.","I never trusted the whole peer-to-peer concept. The idea of having a computer analyze a bunch of data to properly determine a counterparty's creditworthiness seemed a little too sketchy. My biggest gripe with the industry is the strong incentive to grow fast, really fast, even if it sacrifices credit quality. Peer-to-peer lending isn't regulated like a traditional bank. It's only a matter of time before they become much more regulated, and lose some of their competitive advantage against traditional banking.Cracks Starting To EmergeOn Monday, the company informed the public that the CEO resigned because of improperly handling a loan. Essentially, the CEO and some members of the board knew that part of the loan didn't meet the investor's standards, so they changed a few things just enough to make it 'comply'. For what? Maybe a couple extra basis points? This is the problem with the industry, the incentives are completely off.Let's think about this for a second. LendingClub (NYSE:LC) is essentially playing the middleman role. They connect borrowers with lenders. The don't take on the credit risk like a normal bank. It seems like a nice little model. Since they make their money based on the volume of transactions, their first instinct is to grow, grow, grow, which they've done a spectacular job of over the last few years. They aren't the only ones out there, though. OnDeck Capital (NYSE:ONDK) and LendingTree (NASDAQ:TREE) are trying to do the same thing. Being the biggest and fastest is pretty crucial here.The second key factor is trust. Each of these companies will rave about their proprietary database that allows them to underwrite loans with extreme accuracy. Wonderful. Everybody loves anything 'big data' related these days. The issue here is that trust can evaporate really quickly. If that one loan was mishandled at LendingClub, you can be sure there's many more just like it.How It All Falls ApartLendingClub is the biggest player in the peer-to-peer lending space with over $400mm in revenues and over $8 billion in originations in 2015, compared to about $250mm for LendingTree. Unfortunately for them, it's not that hard to break apart their business model if trust erodes.We know that the peer-to-peer lending concept is quite unregulated and primarily built on volume and trust, with executives incentivized to carelessly grow fast, and try and sneak off some extra basis points by mismatching lenders with investors. When the incentives are out of whack, you never get a good result.Let's try another exercise. Now that investors know there's some sketchy stuff going on behind the scenes with the handling of loans, how do you think they'll feel about trusting the system to properly analyze the risk of a potential loan to invest in? I'd be a bit skeptical. Who knows how widespread the issue is, but this bit of recent news should be extremely worrisome to current and potential users of LendingClub's platform.If the trust starts to erode, the volume will follow along with it. If peer-to-peer lenders like LendingClub can't continue to grow their volume, the business model starts to fall apart. We haven't even touched on the possibility of various regulations either. That could be a whole other beast for these companies to handle, and could have severe side-effects on the whole industry.What's Next For The Company1) The Trust Issue - At the end of Q4 2015, the company guided to revenues in the range of $730mm to $740mm, almost double what they achieved last year. Those numbers are going to be extremely hard to hit if they start to lose their customers' trust, and have a hard time continuing to grow their platform at the speed they planned on. With this debacle happening in the first quarter, I doubt they come close to hitting their guidance for the year.2) The Regulatory Issue - If a business seems to be too good to be true, it's because it usually is. One of LendingClub's selling points is that it has much less overhead than your typical bank, and therefore can offer much more attractive rates. Sure they might not have the physical presence of a bank, but they're bound to be hit with additional regulatory oversight at some point, which could hurt their ability to offer more attractive rates.3) The Competition Issue - There really isn't one major attribute that differentiates a LendingClub, from a LendingTree or an OnDeck Capital. They'll claim that their 'proprietary database' of info is the best, and they can underwrite better than anyone else, but I tend to doubt that. In the end, it's a commodity. The problem for LendingClub now is that people might not trust them as much. All they have to do is switch over to someone like LendingTree and practically get the same service. There's not much stickiness to the model. LendingClub may start losing some of its business to other competitors unless it's able to gain back peoples' trust.ConclusionI always look to see if a company has control of its destiny before I decide to invest. I'm not sure companies like LendingClub, LendingTree, and OnDeck Capital are truly in the driver's seat. People don't need their services. There's plenty of other outlets for loans and investing. Government regulation is also a massive wildcard. Similar to the healthcare industry, one stringent law can change your business model overnight. Until the dust settles, I'm staying clear of LendingClub."
3974435,70965,2016-05-12T09:16:45-04:00,News of executive misconduct has driven LC shares down to $4.Furious call buying yesterday suggests interest on both sides of the trade.We don't think the risk is worth the reward here.,"By Parke ShallLending Club (NYSE:LC) is the original peer-to-peer lending site. The website tries to hook up individual lenders, who are looking to make a return on their investment, with borrowers who may not be able to access credit through traditional credit lines or borrowers who are looking for a lower rate or different terms than most conventional bank loans.Lenders are allowed to review the FICO scores and income information of potential borrowers and are allowed to pick the loans that they want to fund individually.It was only a matter of time before this concept got started. Everything else, from crowdfunding, to stock market investing is going simpler and cleaner with both peer-to-peer and with mobile applications. The next natural step is for these companies to securitize themselves and go public. Here is how LC has performed since doing so,LC data by YChartsIn the wake of Lending Club, we have seen companies like Upstart and Prosper also start in on the same businesses. Lending Club has been hacked down violently almost 40% in the past few days, over news that it's CEO had acted inappropriately. Reuters reported,This drew comparisons to another recent scandal,The key has been to decide whether not to get in on the investment at these low prices. What attracted us to look at potentially investing in this company was a war that has been going on over the $4 calls over the last two days since the news broke. There is a massive volume in these calls, with yesterday's coming in as mostly buying to open. This means more investors are betting that LC will go up than are betting it will go down.After examining the fundamentals, we can see how there is a bull case. The company has $623M in cash and a book value of $2.74 with no debt. Its only liabilities are the loans that it issues to borrowers who may have lower than perfect credit profiles. In addition, there's risk in how the company has been conducting itself of recent.Its current multiples seem attractive, though, now:However, when one considers cockroach theory and the nature of these loans to begin with, it gives us another second to have some pause with an investment in this company.Cockroach theory in finance usually means where there is misconduct, there is even more misconduct hiding behind the scenes.We went through the due diligence process of becoming both a lender and a borrower with LC. The requirements for both sides of the equation aren't terribly stringent. Seeing as how this is a marketplace for credit for individuals who cannot access credit lines in a conventional fashion, it is obvious that the quality of the company's loans is likely going to be lower than institutional lending.We also must point out that we did see ""A"" grade loans as lenders; these are your better credit scores and high income individuals. They exist, for sure, at Lending Club. The question is how prevalent are they. The house crisis started because too many junk mortgages were being packaged with A and AA mortgages. LC could be doing something similar.This risk, combined with the fact that there are serious questions of conduct being raised in the executive suite, leads us to believe that this company should be avoided no matter what the price. We are not saying the company is going to go under, but at $4 with an EV still around $1 billion, we still think that further bad news could still be on its way. The cockroach theory is that where there is one, there are many. Generally, like in the case of Valeant (VRX) recently, one stroke of misconduct that was uncovered was followed by numerous strokes of misconduct leading to a 90% collapse in the stock's price and the company's ability to regain trust from investors.Noting that China has already seen major fraud with peer-to-peer lending, we don't like the doors that this type of model keeps open for misconduct. FT reported on P2P lending in China recently,While we have seen no instances of straight up fraud yet here at home, the ground is fertile for future misconduct and for poor loan origination from the get-go. While LC may seem cheap here at $4, we do not think the CEO's misconduct, combined with the type of lending that the company is performing, gives us a reason to ever allocate our capital into investing in this company."

The resignation of the former CEO, and several other top executives, was a result of misconduct that came to light from an internal investigation. While the findings of the review are concerning (to put it lightly), the important factor that is getting lost in all of the negative press is the fact that the company reported strong Q1 2016 results. More importantly, the Q1 2016 results show that LendingClub's long-term story is still intact (at least for the time being).I will dive deeper into the operating results later in the article, but I wanted to highlight the fact that the company was able to meet the consensus EPS estimate of $0.05 for the quarter.(Image Source)LendingClub's share price has been punished since Mr. Laplanche's resignation hit the wire, and rightfully so, as the internal review disclosed some troubling findings that create a great deal of uncertainty. Since the announcement, LC shares are down over 40%, which brings the year-to-date stock performance to a negative return of ~60%. For comparison purposes, the S&P 500 is up ~2% over the same period of time.(Source: Nasdaq.com)My background is in accounting/auditing, so I take internal control matters seriously, especially when companies are slapped with a material weakness. However, I believe that the stock price has more than factored in the current situation. As such, I decided to take a flyer on LendingClub in my R.I.P. portfolio.For full disclosure, my thoughts on LendingClub (and its future) may change if additional information is disclosed by the board. Moreover, I still have some concerns related the company's future and how the current situation may negatively impact LendingClub's operating environment, but I believe that the stock is currently attractively valued based on the information that is available to the public.Q1 2016 Results, By The NumbersLending Club reported impressive Q1 2016 results and the company was again able to report a profitable quarter. To start, let's focus on the operating highlights for the quarter.(Source: Q1 2016 8-K)On one hand, LendingClub was able to increase loan originations (68%), operating revenue (87%), and adjusted EBITDA (137%) by significant percentages on a YoY basis. But on the other hand, when compared to Q4 2015 the contribution and adjusted EBITDA margins went in the wrong direction. For Q1 2016, the margins were impacted by a rising expense base, as the company reported a 70% YoY increase in total operating expenses.(Source: Data obtained from Q1 2016 8-K, linked above, and table created by W.G. Investment Research)Lending Club was able to increase its top line by close to 90%, but expenses jumped right along with the revenue. I fully expected for this growth company to invest in its business so the YoY increase in each of the expense categories is not a major concern. Remember, LendingClub IPO'ed not too long along and the company is currently experiencing tremendous revenue growth, so investing in its business should be expected. Additionally, Management mentioned in the conference call that the first quarter of each year is the most challenging from an expense standpoint so the elevated expense base for Q1 2016 should come down over the next few quarters.The earnings results were in line with expectations and the company experienced impressive revenue growth, but there are other concerns that may keep investors up at night.The Real ConcernsBeyond the current internal control issues, I have three major concerns that have the potential to greatly impact LendingClub's future growth prospects.First, one of my major concerns is the Laplanche situation permanently impacting the company's business practices/operations. For example, Goldman (NYSE:GS) and Jefferies announced that both companies would not be buying LendingClub's loans until they had a chance to review the Laplanche situation. If financial institutions permanently stop purchasing LendingClub's loans, the company's business model will have to dramatically change. Personally, I believe that the company will be able to maintain its relationships with these financial institutions if additional misconduct is not found, but it may just take some time.Another risk factor, which is actually something that I considered even before the internal control issues were announced, is larger financial institutions coming into LendingClub's market and making it harder for the company to compete. A few days after the Laplanche news, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) announced that it would become a bigger player in offering online loans to small businesses.Lastly, the Treasury Department is calling for more oversight of the online lending business, which will obviously impact LendingClub. The additional regulation simply adds to the uncertainty, but this may actually turn out to be a positive development for the company and its peers (i.e. improve investor confidence).These factors will without a doubt need to be monitored over the next few quarters due to the potential impact to the company and its operations, but the concerns were not enough to keep me from taking a flyer on LendingClub.Bottom LineLendingClub is a speculative investment that I added to my R.I.P. portfolio. The company has a lot of upside potential over the next few years and I believe that the downside risk is limited, with the company trading not far above its cash and cash equivalents balance of ~$2.20 per share.Investors will likely look back a year from now and think of the current situation as a ""bump in the road,"" if LendingClub is able to strengthen its control environment and effectively communicate this change to investors/customers. Furthermore, the Q1 2016 operating results show that the company's long-term plans are still intact and that the company still has great future growth prospects. Long-term investors may have to wait out the storm in order to see the bright future that LendingClub has in front of it, but in my opinion, the upside potential makes LC shares worth the wait.There are a lot of moving pieces to consider when determining if LendingClub is worth your investment dollars, so I would advise investors to evaluate the current situation in great detail and really consider if LendingClub fits within your risk tolerance.If you found this article to be informative and would like to hear more about this company or any other company that I analyze, please consider hitting the ""Follow"" button above.Disclaimer: This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned.

Many of these companies were priced as tech companies when in reality they're finance companies. It worked out well for a number of IPO sellers but not so well for public investors as valuations moved from high multiple tech to low multiple finance. Lenders have become more cautious, creating liquidity and demand issues alongside future regulatory risk.However, the reality is in-between. Now that these companies are being valued as finance businesses, their valuations make more sense. The leading player LendingClub (NYSE:LC) last night fell 35% to $4.60. At the time of its IPO, shares spiked at $27 (it was marketed as tech). Its board includes Larry Summers, former Treasury secretary, and John Mack, former CEO of Morgan Stanley. Shares fell as the CEO and other executives resigned over faulty loan disclosures.Their business model makes sense - borrowers connect online, they get lower rates and lenders receive higher rates than deposits (see below). The problem with all finance companies is that they need trust to operate properly. Management actions and the fact the industry is lightly regulated likely mean much more scrutiny and problems ahead.High risk, high returns? Maybe for banksWith no branches, approvals in days instead of weeks and the matching of borrowers and lending peer-to-peer should be a much more profitable and less risky business than banking. But with all the economic volatility earlier in the year, demand for loans decreased. Without any deposits, this mismatch is an issue. Regulatory scrutiny will be sure to increase and these companies could end up looking like banks with reserve requirements, leading to a more capital intensive model. At these levels, we think it would make sense for banks to buy into marketplace lending companies, not just their loans. Ownership/support by a bank will give the lenders a backstop.For us LendingClub is tricky - the resignation of the CEO and other executives over faulty loan disclosures creates too much uncertainty. If lenders can't believe/trust what they are investing in, they will take their money elsewhere. History would suggest trust will take time to recover, and unfortunately there is hardly ever only one cockroach.At the time of publishing, Decisive had no position in LendingClub.

This company is a buy at the current price.,"False Alarm: I Thought I Had A Wounded DeerI check the financial news on May 9th. I notice an interesting headline. LendingClub Corporation (NYSE:LC) fell 34% in value in a single trading session. The CEO resigned for doing something naughty.I'm a pretty cynical person. In the previous week I wrote two articles about short selling companies based on insiders taking advantage of public shareholders. I'm fired up and look into LC, hoping to find another short sale candidate.I'm expecting LC to be a wounded deer. Perhaps I'll eat an easy supper if I stalk it a while. An insider/CEO shenanigan combined with a lending broker that packages loans. Share prices are down, not only today, but almost 80% since the high of $25.74. Michael Lewis' novel ""The Big Short"" comes to my mind.Then I check the financials. My prowling instinct shuts off. I haven't found a wounded deer. I've found a raging bull smashing its head into a tree just for fun. Sure, it's going nowhere fast at the moment. But when it decides to move it will run pretty fast. Who's to stop it?LC isn't weak at all. Let's go over the strong points.Cash, Cash, And Lots Of CashThe 2015 10-K shows LC with cash, restricted cash, and securities available for sale totaling $1 billion. The company carries no debt. That puts liquid assets at roughly $2.50 per share while LC shares closed in the market at $4.66. The company is nearly a net-net, one of those famous situations proclaimed by the famous guru of gurus, Benjamin Graham.The Operating Business Is StrongI decide to check some random thread commentaries. Some people think LC is a short candidate. I suppose they read ""The Big Short"" just as I did. Or perhaps they cheated and simply watched the movie.I'll admit that LC was probably a good short sale, at $25. Those early bird shorts made a killing. But at $4.66 per share? It's trading near it's cash. Make no mistake. LC is not a short sale.Even if I wanted to be hyper-conservative, the securities available for sale could be deducted and that still leaves liquid assets of roughly $2 per share.What about revenue growth? It's high. LC has been growing revenue at about 100% each year since 2013. Okay, so LC is still losing money in the annual statement. But it's coming close to growing into it's infrastructure. It was nearly break-even on net income in 2015.Hidden Assets And Overrated ExpensesWe can expect selling and marketing expenses to slow down relative to revenue after product awareness becomes saturated. When companies are young and expansionary their marketing is always a big expense. LC spent about $172 million on this in 2015.Astute investors know that intrinsic value gets created under the radar with marketing expenses. They're never added as assets to the balance sheet. This is usually what sloppy accountants refer to as the hidden value of the brand.Does LC have any brand value? Well, yes. By the company's own admission, they are ""..The world's largest online marketplace connecting borrowers and investors.""The marketing has given them a wonderful head start. If revenue doubles again, and it probably will, selling and marketing expenses will be less relevant. LC could be earning 5% on book value in about a year.Good News Hidden By NoiseThe 8-K announced the resignation of the CEO. The market panics. Why didn't they read the rest of the 8-K?First of all, the issue was minor. The CEO was caught giving one of his friends a good deal on a loan. This amounted to roughly $22 million, a small fraction of LC's roughly $8 billion loan originations in 2015.The company's board handled the situation well. Here was the statement of the new executive chairman:So the board ends the employment of their CEO. They didn't do it because they got caught. They did it and came clean themselves.What's the problem with that? Does anyone realize how many companies have CEOs who are also the president? LC has proper checks and balances in place between directors and officers. This enabled the board to deal with the issue.The company also provided it's first quarter statistics. They were outstanding. Operating revenue and EBITDA were both up year-over-year, 87% and 137% respectively.With $25 million in quarterly EBITDA, I believe LC is well on the way to achieving a return on equity of say, 3-5% in 2016 or 2017. That puts its projected P/E ratio somewhere around 30.Fears Of Sub-Prime Loan Losses MisplacedLC brokers loans. It's not responsible for defaults on the loans it initiates and sells. It holds some loans on the books while awaiting their sales, but this puts LC's equity at risk by about 30% if we assume they'd devalue 100% before LC could offload them. This is hardly what I would call risky.LC also acts as the middleman. It takes payments from the debtors and transfers interest payments to the lenders. If the debtors stop paying, LC will turn the default over to a collection agency. The bill for the collection agency gets paid by the lenders.What about the debtors? Is LC issuing nefarious, sub-prime loans? The answer is that I don't know. I don't know why I should distrust them, either. At least, I don't see how LC loans are any riskier than Bank of America or any other huge institution. My assumption is that we'll need a few decades before lenders start making those mistakes again. 2008 wasn't that long ago.The board was pretty stern to fire their CEO for a minor abuse of issuing a questionable loan. I'll assume the majority of loans are probably creditworthy.Using the PEG RatioOnce upon a time, during the 1980's, Peter Lynch wrote ""One Up On Wall Street."" He instructed us in the art of ""stalking the 10-bagger.""Is LC a 10-bagger from here? I don't know, but I think it could be a four-bagger. Lynch made primary use of the price-to-earnings-to-growth ratio, or PEG. Basically, if a fast grower with a solid business had a PEG of 1 or less, Lynch was all over it.So we have a company growing about 80-100% per year, depending on the metric we use. In about a year, LC should reach a P/E around 30.I think LC would make Lynch's mouth water. If we assumed a 30% growth rate for at least five years, a very conservative estimate, and combined it with an assumed P/E of 30, we arrive at a PEG of 1.Remember, that's CONSERVATIVE. Really, we have a PEG of 1 or LESS.LC is a very good deal right now. Apparently, management thinks it's a good deal as well. They just announced a $150 million share repurchase program. That big cash hoard will start being put to good use.Thanks for reading."

That deserves to survive and flourish.Valuation and growth necessitated by the cost and revenue structure are problematic.By my simple computations, the stock is still over-valued, but i have hopes that, with time, management will be able to justify something close to the current market cap.","Lending Club (NYSE:LC) is a very good company that performs a valuable service in the marketplace. Despite the bad publicity caused by the firing of chief executive Renaud Laplanche for misleading the board of directors and fudging investor requirements, Lending Club is one of the best lenders to come along-ever. Indeed, one can argue that the firing of Laplanche should bring kudos to the company rather than opprobrium. The board of directors took fairly prompt action to rid the company of those responsible for violating its business principles.As I see Lending Club, it is an exemplary lender and investment platform because it offers simple and consistent products, collecting agency fees that are far lower than the costs of brick and mortar banks. Lending Club thereby enables ordinary people to reduce their borrowing costs and maybe even get out of debt. The cost structure also allows individual investors to earn risk-adjusted returns that are greater than the marketplace offers almost anywhere else. Indeed, the cost structure allows small banks to earn a cost-adjusted spread that is greater than they can make on their own. All those things are benefits to the economy as whole.Here is a snapshot of Lending Club loans, taken from the Lending Club website:As an investor in notes, I can readily understand the terms of the notes and the basic facts about the borrowers. Many times I would wish for more detail about the borrowers, but I gather that there are regulatory issues that get in the way.Nevertheless, a number of institutions have suspended buying notes and I would not be surprised if many individual investors will do the same until the hubbub dies down. For those of us who are still in the market to buy notes, I see this as an opportunity because the relative dearth of buyers likely will cause the rates on the notes to go up a bit.In my article on Lending Club published on May 10, I was critical of its fast growth and fast run-up of expenses. The fast growth now is, of course, coming to an end, at least temporarily. Whether new management will seek to adhere to a fast growth policy, I do not know. But I think they are likely to emphasize the company's real strong suits: Simple products, adherence to good business principles, and an efficient idea that permits intermediation between borrowers and lenders that is more cost-effective than traditional banking mechanisms are for the similar borrowers and lenders.Becoming a public company probably was a mistake. Every online company wants to be a unicorn, but not every business idea is unicorn-sized. An idea can be a very good one and a very profitable one but one that is more suited to gradual success. The back end for investors may be farther away, but that is just the nature of some things. The founders get less rich, but consistent profitability can pay regular dividends, if anybody cares about that.At some price, Lending Club stock will be in that category. From what I read among the analysts, the value of Lending Club may be around $1 billion. That used to be money. But I wonder if that is not a high valuation if we look at the current business. (At a market price of about $3.60 today, the market cap is about $1.4 billion.)What income level would justify a billion dollar valuation and how far from that income level is Lending Club?I assume that if you are in slowish growth but reliable business, then you need to make 10% on your market cap at a minimum, which on a billion dollars would be $100 million per year, after tax. Lending Club was not anywhere near that in Q1 2016. It earned $4 million (or $16 million annualized).The business model is heavily dependent on origination fee revenues. With $8 billion of loans outstanding (see chart above), the approximately 1% servicing fees bring in only about $80 million a year ($20 million a quarter-it was $16 million in Q1 2016). Revenue from origination fees in Q1 2016 was $125 million on originations of $2,750 million, per the May 9, 2016 8-K (or about 4.5%), but even so, expenses (about $150 million in Q1, therefore about $600 million annualized) ate up most of the revenue. Data come from the May 9, 2016 8-K, which is excerpted below. Here is an excerpt from the most recent 10-K that describes Lending Club's revenue streams:Given the revenue sources and current expenses, in order to make the hypothetically required 10% (say 13% pre-tax), originations have to increase to about $3,500 million per quarter from the current $2,750 million and be consistent or on an upslope, without incurring additional expenses. Not incurring additional expenses may not be realistic-and it may not be realistic to expect that a 10% after tax return would be acceptable-but this sort of back-of-the-envelope computation suggests that Lending Club may not be very far away from being able to justify a $1 billion valuation-if it can recover its funding customers. But there are a lot of ""ifs"". Therefore I still see the current market valuation as quite a bit higher than I would want in order to invest.For more complete income statement details, see the following excerpt from the Lending Club May 9, 2016 8-K.I really like this company a lot. I hope management can figure out how to reduce expenses so that they do not have to rely so heavily on constantly needing originate such a large volume of loans."
3973562,101721,2016-05-10T11:41:09-04:00,"Marketplace lenders have been left in disarray following news from Lending Club, Prosper and OnDeck.The turmoil following Monday's meltdown will take time to subside.Marketplace lenders are still far from looking good fundamental value.Long term fundamentals remain good but it will be a long road to recovery.Investors should be patient in accumulating positions.","The announcement by Lending Club (NYSE:LC) of irregularities in the sale of a portfolio of loans to an investor and an undeclared interest in a fund into which the company was planning to invest coming on the back of the Prosper layoffs and the OnDeck (NYSE:ONDK) numbers miss has left the marketplace lending sector in complete turmoil.The loudest voices over the next few days will be the prophets of doom for the sector, of which there have been many. For them the past few days have been an absolute gift, and certainly in the short term the news will cause marketplace investors to pull in their horns, but does that mean that in the long term marketplace lending will fade and die and that Lending Club and OnDeck should be avoided by investors? In the short term there is no doubt that both will face headwinds but longer term I believe that there is still reasons to be interested in both.Whenever a stock is in meltdown but with long term growth potential it is always tempting to try to call the bottom fast and buy the stock before a bounce in the share price. However, when it comes to financial companies it pays to remember that there is a direct relationship between their cost of capital and their immediate profitability. Whilst other companies it is true that the cost of capital has an impact in the longer term, for finance businesses the relationship is immediate and direct (as investors learned in the financial crisis) due to the fact that cash is the stock and the work in progress as well as the revenue of the business.There can be no doubt that the cost of capital for marketplace lenders has increased in the past week dramatically, both on the equity side and on the amount that investors will require to provide lending capacity. There are expectations within the sector that a number of marketplace lending platforms will fail as a result. Even before the latest news I was told by a senior executive in the sector that he expected a significant number of failures within the next 60 days. For Lending Club and OnDeck an increasing cost of capital will hit earnings in the near term, and this will have a knock on impact to longer term growth expectations.So far, so dismal. However, close off your ears to the screaming headlines and the long term fundamentals remain interesting. Banks, from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Citi (NYSE:C) to a range of community banks have entered into partnerships with OnDeck and Lending Club because they can bring technology and a different approach to lending that allows a wider range of customers to be served than the banks can manage themselves. These partnerships are small beer thus far, and the profitability of such relationships for the marketplace lenders are unlikely to be significant in the short term, but they do point to a genuine reason for the marketplace lenders to exist. They are a now an established and permanent feature of the financial ecosystem.So should investors start to dip their toe and buy Lending Club and OnDeck? After all, these companies are down around 70% on a year ago. With shares in freefall, catching a falling knife can be a dangerous occupation. The share price needs to offer fundamental value before such a strategy offers an attractive risk/reward. Given that expectations were for 21 cents of earnings for Lending Club for the year to December 2017, I would want to see a market, or even sub-market, multiple on those earnings before buying in. That implies a share price South of $4, still some way from where it is today. OnDeck is less clear, partly because it is still expected to be loss making through next year, and may be pushing out prospective profitability into late 2018 or 2019. However, what OnDeck offers the banking sector is an interesting approach to small business lending and were a bank to acquire OnDeck and apply its cost of capital to the OnDeck model it could be a significantly profitable business.In summary, the past week is a watershed moment for the marketplace lending sector. There is no point in looking back at the past, the prospects for the sector have changed, as their cost of capital has inevitably risen, In the circumstances it is best not to be piling into Lending Club or OnDeck immediately, but beginning to accumulate a position in coming weeks may be an interesting strategy for the longer term."

Believe me, if I thought I knew definitively where say, Apple was headed in three months or if I thought I had some unique edge when it comes to predicting something like Amazon earnings, I'd be more than happy to take a position and then share my thesis. After all, hedge fund managers make a living doing just that at investment conferences.For me though, the macro picture is always more interesting and I find that generally speaking, understanding how all the pieces fit together is where the real money is. Take a George Soros for instance. You have to have a good understanding of the big picture if you're going to break the Bank of England. Or a Kyle Bass, who basically thinks he can win an epic battle against the PBoC because of a well-developed thesis about how an enormous Chinese bank recap will force Beijing into a massive round of money printing far beyond the country's $3 trillion in reserves.But I'm going to make an (admittedly brief) exception and talk about LendingClub (NYSE:LC) and other ""marketplace"" lenders like On Deck (NYSE:ONDK) for a moment.If you haven't followed the story I encourage you to read my full account here as well as the countless other articles that have been written this week on the major wires. I'll quote briefly from my piece linked above:Laplanche made another rather egregious ""error"": he lobbied the board's risk committee on investing in a fund that buys LendingClub loans, but failed to mention that he himself had a 2% stake in said fund.In other words, LendingClub bought a stake in a fund that buys its own loans and the (former) CEO was invested in that same fund.That kind of incestuous relationship is becoming commonplace in the online lending market.As I noted earlier today, SoFi (another marketplace lender) started a hedge fund to buy its own loans. This kind of circular funding scheme is necessary for one simple reason: the companies need to perpetuate the infamous ""originate to sell"" model.It works like this: you make a loan (whether a home loan, a car loan, or in this case, a marketplace loan via an online platform) and then you simply sell it to someone else. In many cases, that ""someone"" is Wall Street, and they're not just buying one loan, they're buying a bunch of loans.They then securitize them and sell them to investors.After having a look at On Deck's disappointing ""marketplace"" numbers last week, one thing became abundantly clear: the ABS market had better not dry up for P2P loans. If it does, it will become more difficult for the companies to extend credit. In other words: the business model may ultimately die.Well don't look now, but late Tuesday afternoon, Dow Jones reported that Goldman and Jefferies ""have stopped buying [LendingClub's] loans as [the banks] review events that led to the ousting of its chief executive.""That. Is. Bad. News. Here's The Journal again:Here's Credit Suisse's take:Somehow, the bank got a ""Neutral"" rating out of that analysis.Anyway, if these companies can't find ways to get credit risk off their balance sheets, this business model will have a tough time surviving over the long haul.Throw in the fact that they are using largely untested algorithms to assess credit risk in uncertain economic conditions (which could lead to mistakes, downgrades like those that are possible on some classes of Prosper paper, and less appetite for marketplace ABS), and the fact that traditional lenders like Wells Fargo are getting into the game, and you have the recipe for a rout.So far, the market for marketplace ABS has held up:(Chart: Peer IQ)But if you own these names, you truly need to consider what happens if the ""originate to sell"" model dies for these companies which, given an already skittish market and the LendingClub controversy, seems like a distinct possibility.Meanwhile, the Treasury released a white paper on marketplace lenders on Tuesday. I'll close with a few excerpts:"

Along with the collapse of OnDeck Capital (NYSE:ONDK), the two primary public fintech stocks are sitting at new lows below $5 each.LendingClub is down 34% on the day despite releasing Q1 results that met analyst estimates of extremely fast growth. At a price of slightly below $5, the stock trades at new all-time lows and an extremely low enterprise value considering the growth rate.Is the founding CEO resignation the end of the world for the stock?Founding CEO ResignationAccording to the press release, CEO Renaud Laplanche was forced out due to several violations of company policy. The main concern relates to the $22 million transaction in near-prime loans sold to a single investor.Considering that Laplanche founded the company in 2006, one has to wonder whether the company will survive and thrive without his leadership. The success of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is generally related to the moves that only a founding CEO like Mark Zuckerberg can make. On the flip side, other companies like Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) and Cheniere Energy (NYSEMKT:LNG) replaced founding CEOs for similar questionable corporate moves that only led to further declines in the stock prices. In fact, both stocks hit new multi-year lows to start this year.The market can debate the impact of losing the founding CEO on the stock prices, but the new CEO for LendingClub lacks the experience of the founding CEO. Scott Sanborn has six years of experience with LendingClub, but his prior experience suggests he won't have the same authority to quickly react to industry change. His prior experiences at eHealth Insurance and RedEnvelope as the CMO suggest the influential BOD members like John Mack and Larry Summers will rein in the quick actions needed to thrive in the rapidly changing industry.The lack of internal controls is a big concern though the financial impact of loan process was immaterial to the company. The bigger issue is whether the investor was lost as a future customer and the impact of any other institutional investor's willingness to invest in loans originated on LendingClub.Institutional Investor ImpactThe lack of guidance due to the CEO shakeup hints at the potential loss of investors that made up 55% of investments on the platform during Q1. The combination of banks and other institutional investors added up over $1.5 billion of the funding sources for the $2.75 billion originated on the platform during the quarter.The retail investor actually took a dip during the quarter as managed accounts actually declined on a sequential basis. The data makes it unclear whether individuals were spooked by the weak economy during the quarter or pushed out by institutions possibly buying up the loan supply at lower interest rates.At the same time that the funding source has shifted to the institutional investors, the revenue yield keeps surging. For Q1, the revenue yield hit 5.5%. The contribution margin didn't hit a new high due to higher seasonal expenses during Q1, but one has to wonder if the shakeup won't pressure yields going forward.TakeawayLendingClub is very appealing from a valuation standpoint at a market value of around $1.8 billion with cash and marketable securities of $868 million. The enterprise value is very compelling, but before making an investment, I want to see how the new CEO handles the situation. Business as usual makes the stock a huge buy. A shifting business plan would make me pause any investment move."
3973472,24966,2016-05-10T08:08:27-04:00,"Renaud Laplanche, founder and CEO of LendingClub, has resigned under a cloud.That will bring a renewed focus on the company's fast-growth business plan.LendingClub is not the only online lender with a fast-growth plan.But fast growth means high expenses and increasing risks.","Online lending, peer to peer, is a viable and useful business. The problem is that after a little success, they all want to be unicorns. And unicorns either are imaginary or extinct. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt - extinct. And the surest way to extinction for a lender is to try to grow too fast. The second surest way is to take credit risk, and the third is to take liquidity risk. Banking is a hard business. I thought the objective of the P2P business was not to be a bank but to be a facilitating agent between borrowers and investors. They may need a bank partner for regulatory reasons, but why would they actually want to be a bank? Banking is a competitive business, and online banking platforms are not so difficult to build.Renaud Laplanche, LendingClub (NYSE:LC) founder, resigned as CEO May 9 after an internal investigation found irregularities in an offering of $22 million of loans to Jefferies & Co. See the FT story here. LendingClub was one of the first online P2P lenders, originally offering pieces of loans to individual investors. I was an early investor in LendingClub loans and made nice returns. Over the last few years, the interest rates the platform offered became lower and the loans quickly were picked over by institutional investors, leaving the rest of us with difficulty finding the risk-reward tradeoff we were looking for. The following graph from the FT shows the trend.Laplanche had said he wanted to go back to his company's P2P roots, but that strategy and fast growth are not compatible. There will be times when loans are snapped up and times when they languish.In an American Banker essay last week, Todd Baker, a consultant, former banker and former prominent lawyer (and a friend of mine), who has followed online lenders closely, wrote, ""Reliance on wholesale funding will be the Achilles heel of online alternative lenders - just as it was for the paper-based finance companies that all failed, were bailed out or became banks in the period leading up to the 2008-2009 financial crisis."" Fast growth, wholesale funding, and growing expenses to support that fast growth will do in whichever online lenders follow that path.Beware the rich and famousSocial Finance (SOFI) is another of the unicorn wannabes. Lending only to college graduates who have good credits was a fine idea. The federal college loan program, which makes no distinction between a graduate of Podunk U and a graduate of Stanford Business School, is ripe for the pickings. It is a no-brainer that you can lend to the Stanford grad at a lower rate and still make money because the default rate will be low.But to take that successful observation and carry it forward to consumer lending and home loans will not work. It will run into two problems: (1) Funding is not as easy as SoFi seems to think, and (2) discrimination against low-income borrowers is not going to fly past the U.S. regulatory system.I give you two exhibits that will tell you I am right about SoFi without even analyzing the laws and data. (1) Anshu Jain, the unsuccessful former briefly co-Chief Executive of Deutsche Bank, has joined as an adviser, and (2) SoFi's CEO and founder is saying he will beat the pants off the stodgy established banks. Those are my gut instincts, but 50 years of studying banks and bank-like enterprises tell me those instincts are right.If that is not enough for your instincts, I offer the fame of members of the LendingClub board of directors. Fame among board members often is a sign of trouble. When Lawrence Summers, Mary Meeker and John Mack join the board of LendingClub, as they did, it became impossible for Laplanche not to try to grow fast. Famous people do not sit quietly while their company makes slow progress - and Laplanche had to know that.So LendingClub's stock is down almost 30% on the day as I write this. But at $5 and change, it is down far more since the IPO at $25 a year and half ago. But there is a real business here and many good people in the company (I know some of them). To their credit, they seem to have taken prompt, forthright action after discovering the irregularities. If the new management will be willing to dial back the growth efforts and get a grip on expenses, the stock might well be worth the current price. But at the moment, expenses appear out of control:I do not think the business model is a good one if it relies on institutional investors for funding. They will buy in bulk, then they will disappear, leaving the expenses behind. I would like to see over the next few weeks what the new management sounds like. If they sound like they are realistic about righting the ship, I might invest. If not, I will stay away."

I estimate LC will return to its IPO price of $15 and above over the course of the next few years as the company continues to prove its potential. (Lending Club)LendingClub DescriptionLendingClub Corporation went public in December of 2014, priced around $15 per share. The company operates as an online marketplace that connects borrowers and investors in the United States. Its marketplace facilitates various types of loan products for consumers and small businesses. It also offers investors an opportunity to invest in a range of loans based on terms and credit characteristics. LendingClub's customers include retail investors, high-net-worth individuals and family offices, banks and finance companies, insurance companies, hedge funds, foundations, pension plans, and university endowments. The company's mission is to transform the banking system and make credit more affordable and investing more rewarding.Peer-To-Peer Lending IndustryThe peer-to-peer lending industry is a newly created market that gives borrowers and lenders another ability to satisfy each others' needs without the use of banks. Banks have previously controlled this market as one of the only providers of such lending and borrowing services. However, banks are now faced with growing competition and a shift in consumer behavior from personal banking to virtual peer-to-peer business. This form of business was made readily available for consumers at the end of 2014 when LendingClub, the first of its kind, was able to perfect an algorithm that managed risk and regulated transactions between parties.Favorably, the peer-to-peer industry is under a lot less government regulation than the banking industry because of the excessive federal policies that were put in place over banks after the 2008-2009 financial crisis. These policies regulate the banking loan system and make it much harder for banks to give consumers their desired loans. These same regulations however do not apply for peer-to-peer lending, and therefore many individuals who were turned down because of increased regulation now have an alternative marketplace to receive their needed funds. As LC was able to prove its capability, banks realized the potential threat of LendingClub taking over their market share, and invested in competing against it by partnering with companies that researched and developed their own peer-to-peer lending place. To be clear, the peer-to-peer lending process consists of matching borrowers of certain risk levels with lenders of certain risk tolerances. LendingClub, or any of its peers, do not actually issue any loans themselves and therefore bear very little responsibility. The key component for this industry is managing default risk by properly evaluating borrowers' capability of taking on debt.Is LendingClub Undervalued?As explained above, the peer-to-peer lending industry is a new form of business that is not heavily regulated by government policies. For this reason, many analysts are skeptical that government intervention will take place and begin regulating the peer-to-peer industry which would dramatically slow the growth potential and reduce revenue estimates for companies such as LendingClub. This assumption is currently priced into the market and is partially responsible for LC's currently discounted stock price.Important to note, this assumption is also only based on speculation, and because of this, it is currently undervaluing LendingClub's potential. LendingClub's management team has done an excellent job working with the government officials through multiple Q&A meetings and ongoing progress updates to build a completely transparent business model that the government can easily understand and therefore trust without intervening. As of April 19, 2016, the government has taken no initiatives to interfere with LC's operations, and the management has openly expressed light concern for the possibility of a government regulation. Despite this, as seen in the chart below, LC managed to beat revenue estimates every single quarter and will continue to outperform analysts' conservative revenue estimates in 2016 as well. (Data from Bloomberg)The key driving factor for LC's success and government cooperation is and will continue to be the accuracy of the underlying algorithm controlling all transactions. This algorithm is responsible for controlling the default rate, which is the most important measure for a lending service marketplace. As a result of growing macroeconomic concerns, analysts question whether the algorithm will be able to manage worse economic conditions or will the default rate grow out of control. LendingClub has addressed this concern and publicly stated that it continues to make small precautionary adjustments so that it can guarantee that its algorithm can sustain an economic downturn without default rates growing out of control.Currently, LC's default rate is in line with management's estimates and below analyst expectations because of their speculative concerns. In addition to the pessimistic ideas around the industry, analysts also over accounted for the growing competition that LendingClub is facing. They projected that LC was going to have to reduce its profit margins in order to better compete with growing competition. LC, however, actually increased its fee structure and overall margins while maintaining over 70% revenue growth year over year. LC was able to do this by building a trustworthy name that lenders feel more comfortable getting loans through than other competitors. The chart below shows LC's earnings estimates compared to those that analysts predicted. The outperforming trend is going to continue until analysts better understand this industry and more importantly LendingClub itself. The misconception that currently exists is resulting in conservative growth estimates that are forcing artificial concern and causing LendingClub's stock price to currently be undervalued.'(Data from Bloomberg)Growth Into 2016LendingClub has outperformed analyst expectations for the past year and will continue to post high revenue growth and higher profit margins in 2016 as well. In 2015, LC accomplished a loan origination growth of 82%, signifying the increasingly growing consumer demand and supply for peer-to-peer borrowing and lending. Operating revenue increased 93% year over year, and this was a direct result of a slightly increased fee structure that LC deemed appropriate. LendingClub evaluated the average return of its platform to be 7.8% for the average consumer, and therefore felt increasing its fee structure was suitable given the high average returns. The high growth in loan originations despite the increased fees is a good sign that consumers had small sensitivity to changes in the fee structure because of the high average returns. By increasing fees, LC was able to improve its revenue yields by over 5% and improve contribution margins to 49% for the year. The chart below portrays the increasing contribution margin that LC has been able to accomplish through its operational improvements:(From Bloomberg)When accounting for sales, marketing, origination, and service expenses, LC accomplished an annual EBITDA margin of 16.3% for the 2015 year. Looking forward to 2016, LendingClub predicts continued success with a 72% revenue growth and an improved EBITDA margin to 19%. Management will continue to run the company as it has, and capitalize on the natural growth of this growing industry. The next product that is currently being perfected and soon to be released on LC's platform in 2016 is mortgages.ManagementLendingClub's founder and CEO is Renaud Laplanche. Renaud was recognized on Bloomberg Markets' 2015 Most Influential List, an annual list that acknowledges 50 of the top leaders across technology, finance and politics around the globe. In 2014, he won the Economist Innovation Award in the consumer products category. He was ranked one of the top SMB CEOs by the Glassdoor Employees' Choice Awards in 2015 and was named the ""best start-up CEO to work for"" by Business Insider in 2014. Renaud has an MBA from London Business School and a JD from Montpellier University.LendingClub's chief financial officer is Carrie Dolan. Prior to Lending Club, Carrie was the treasurer for Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), a leading provider of securities, brokerage, banking, and financial advisory services to individual investors and independent investment advisors. Carrie also served as the chief financial officer for Schwab Bank, a bank she helped launch in 2003. Carrie was named one of the Most Powerful Women in Finance by American Banker in 2015 and named the 2015 Financial Woman of the Year by the Financial Women of San Francisco (FWSF).LendingClub is managed by highly qualified individuals that possess both a high level of technological expertise and financial experience. Thus far, this knowledge has enabled them to stay ahead of their peers by consistently achieving high revenue growth and increased profitability. In addition to simplifying and creating more efficient operations, LC's management has proved that its decisions include the best interest of all shareholders as well as the company.As of the fourth quarter of 2015, LendingClub announced that it plans on initiating a $150 million stock buyback program that will take place over the next 12 months. This is a possible indicator that the management also feels its company is undervalued below $8 a share and wants to capitalize on the short-term undervaluation. Currently, LendingClub has almost no debt, approximately $550 million in cash, and is looking for value-creating decisions such as this program. In addition to the share repurchase, LC's management has also expressed an ongoing interest in possible acquisitions. Though there are no known acquisition targets as of now, LC is financially strong and its management will not under-utilize its strong balance sheet. LC's management has proved and will continue to prove that its knowledge and experience will lead to value-creating decisions.Public OwnershipAn additional fact that leads me to believe LendingClub has great potential is that LC is owned by approximately 76% institutions. This sign of accumulation at low prices is a good indicator of potential long-term growth ahead.ConclusionLendingClub is a great company under extreme speculation and hiked risk premiums that are currently devaluing the true potential of the stock. Investors should note that if these speculative concerns become true, then future expectations will drastically change. This risk, however, if not true, is providing a very successful company at an undervalued price. LC is projecting to continue to post high revenue growth in 2016 and improved overall margins for increased profitability. I recommend going long LendingClub at a current price around $8 per share and estimate an 88% overall return over the course of next two years as LC returns to its IPO price of $15 per share and above."

This is due to a recent decline in the stock price despite exemplary profit and EPS growth, and positive forward guidance. The recent decline, driven by investor sentiment in peer-to-peer lending, fundamentally misunderstands the business model and positive growth picture of LendingClub, focusing more on sentiment rather than fundamentals.LendingClub is poised to release positive EPS numbers in Q1, with a consensus of $0.05 per share. This shift from negative to positive EPS in recent quarters is driven by continually growing profits and growth in loan originations. Compared to its peers, LendingClub also has stellar revenue growth (above 80% TTM) and an EBITDA margin near 60% (TTM). Operating income more than doubled from Q3 to Q4 last year, driven by revenues up by over 16% QoQ and reoccurring operating expenses up only 14% QoQ, with declining % growth from the previous quarter. (Source: Zacks Investment Research)LC data by YChartsLendingClub and the peer-to-peer industry do have some weaknesses that investors should be aware of, but these weaknesses are much more sentiment driven and do not indicate slowing growth. One such weakness is the regulatory hurdle LendingClub has faced, mostly due to lack of clarity rather than concrete rulings by the SEC. Until government regulators decide to treat companies like LendingClub more like banks, this appears to be a waiting game not worth the wait. In mitigating these regulatory issues, LendingClub recently announced they have joined an industry trade group with 2 other companies aimed at better representing market place lending interests in government regulatory discussions.Another weakness is their P/B ratio which some say is much higher than large banks. Although this is true, the assessment misses the fundamental difference between banks and peer-to-peer or market place lenders. Unlike banks, companies like LendingClub do not have capital minimums. They also are not designed to hold full portfolios, instead acting as a mediator for debt-equity exchanges. So not only is a P/B comparison to banks confusing, it is unwarranted.Data as of 05/06/2016This leads to one of the greatest misunderstandings about the LendingClub business model: LendingClub makes a majority of their profits from borrowing fees such as originations. Lately, investors have felt uneasy about the demand for loans outpacing demand for loan purchases. Although this is an issue, it is one which affects the bottom line of LendingClub much less than one would think. The recent decision by LendingClub to sell packaged loan bonds to Goldman Sachs only represents LendingClub's willingness to find investors in an environment where the number of borrowers (and LC profits) continue to grow. As LendingClub continues to grow and establish itself as a reputable market place lending company, finding loan purchasers will become much easier, the current demand is simply a phase in the growth process.Conclusion:With the stock under recent pressure, now close to its support at $6.50 this may be the opportune time to buy. Although 2016 is uncertain due to broad market conditions and global economic uneasiness, LendingClub's consensus forecasted P/E growth in 2017 is 151.43% (Source: Zacks Investment Research). This would indicate that continually optimistic forward guidance and quality earnings in Q1 2016, will yield significant upside.In a market where bulls and bears have plenty of data to support their theses, LendingClub's strengths greatly outweigh their weaknesses and they are poised to outperform.Price target: $12"
3887266,98656,2016-02-11T11:52:07-05:00,"The company may beat on earnings, but future quarters will not be so easy.Peer-to-peer fraud in China, together with warnings from the U.K. could scare lenders away, halting its impressive growth.We feel charge-off rates are improving, but still too high.","In the years that followed the global financial crisis, borrowers and lenders searched for better rates and better returns on their investments. Unable to find them through the traditional banking system, the world of peer-to-peer lending arose. A several thousand years old quote from Plato's Republic appears to be applicable today: ""Necessity is the mother of invention.""The way that peer-to-peer lending works is by quickly and automatically matching borrowers looking for a loan with an investor that is willing to provide the funds at a desired interest rate. A great system in our view, but recent negative press about the industry has us worrying that things could be turning sour, which is the last thing that LendingClub (NYSE:LC) investors will want to hear.LendingClub is a leading player in the peer-to-peer lending industry with over $13.4 billion worth of loans issued through its platform. The growth of its total loan issuance has been very impressive, as demonstrated below.Source: Company dataWith twelve-straight quarters of loan issuance growth it is clear to see how the industry is growing. In fact, an approximate 16.7% of the total loans it has ever issued came in the last quarter.However, we fear this growth could start to slow now the shine is wearing off. The recent $7.6 billion Ezubo scam in China could have hit the industry hard. It has been reported that nearly 95% of all the investment projects that were listed on Ezubo were fakes. This isn't an isolated case in China either, with the government calling over 1,000 peer-to-peer lenders in the country as problematic. It does look set to clean up the local industry, but it could be too late if the damage has already been done.Further to the problems in China, in the United Kingdom, the largest market for peer-to-peer lending on a per capita basis, the former Chairman of the Financial Services Authority Adair Turner, warned that consumers are taking big risks with peer-to-peer lending, believing that losses will appear in the next five or ten years that make the banks ""look like lending geniuses.""Now clearly, LendingClub is a legitimate business, there's no question of that, but in an industry that consumers already have hesitations over, one can imagine that the Ezubo story will keep many of them away, stunting its growth. Equally, the comments coming from Adair Turner paints a bleak picture for lenders in the peer-to-peer industry.The company announced its earnings before the market opened on Thursday. The concerns we have spoken about in this thesis are recent developments which occurred after LendingClub's most recent quarter closed; the next quarter earnings report is where we expect to see some significant impact.The issue we have with peer-to-peer lending is, while not always the case, a lot of the borrowers that end up using these platforms do so because they have been denied credit by the conventional lenders. We feel this adds an extra element of risk to the lender, which could result in a higher level of defaults. Ultimately, a bad experience for a lender will probably lead to their withdrawal from the service, and in time the lending pool could shrink. Below you will see the charge-off rates that LendingClub has reported. A charge-off is roughly defined as a debt that the company feels it has no chance of collecting. Unsurprisingly these rates appear to be much higher than regular U.S. banks.Source: Company report.Although we think the shares are destined to drop lower in the future, prices climbed on the back of Thursday's earnings. For this reason, we would caution against shorting the stock at this point and wait until the market has fully absorbed the results.At present we don't believe the risk/reward for investing in LendingClub is sufficient. The long-term future of the company could be put under substantial stress from the effects of events that occurred in China, as well as the warnings from the United Kingdom. With a debt to equity ratio of 4.03 and total debt of over $4 billion, we will be sitting this one out.Our target price is $5.00 for the stock. As we have said earlier, we think it will go higher before going lower, but this time next year we feel it is reasonable to presume it will be in or around this price."
3960214,100606,2016-03-22T11:55:25-04:00,Weakening margin due to competition and customer acquisition cost.Signs of credit deterioration reignites underwriting capability.LC in transitional stage that needs to translate growth into profitability for shareholders.,"LendingClub (NYSE: LC) is essentially a revival of direct lending between people to people similar to ancient Rome or 16th century England before banks took over. When this was reborn on the web, the business is termed as peer-to-peer (""P2P"") or marketplace lending, effectively challenging the multi-trillion banking system. LendingClub and its peers seem to serve all constituents well: the company should be more profitable for its shareholders since they do not need brick-and-mortar branches and have faster, better credit decisioning, and without any regulatory burdens. Consumers needing financing could be getting more attractive rates at great convenience since all processes are online. Investors also enjoy another alternative asset class in today's low-interest environment.The business model was well received when the company went public in December 2014 at $15 a share; on the first day of trading, it even spiked over 70% at one point. In a little over a year, the novelty of it as a banking or lending disrupter has worn off; as of March 18, 2016, its share price has slid almost 42% since its IPO. In this article, we will examine some key concerns around the stock.Basic market stats below:Share Price: $8.71Market cap: $3.3bnPrice/2016 EPS: 32.3xPrice /2017 EPS: 19.4xPrice/2015YE BV: 3.2xPrice/2015YE TBV: 3.5xNearly No Profitability Thus FarDespite LendingClub's web-based approach and its claim of lower operating expenses, shareholders have not reaped any benefits yet. The company has not churned any profits since its inception in 2007, except 2013, which produced a meager $7mm in GAAP earnings. For reference, since its founding, investors have forked in over $1.2 billion in equity, of which almost $0.9bn of it came from the initial public offering in December 2014. Analysts and company blame scale as the primary excuse. In 2015 alone, LC originated $8.4bn of loans.Apparently, this is not enough volume under their arguments. Appreciating the differences in business model, in comparison, Old National Bancorp (NASDAQ: ONB), a regional bank, with roughly $7bn in loans generated over 14% in ROATCE. If we take at a closer look at LendingClub's past six-year financials below, we observe that the customer acquisition expense being the key to generate profitability. Since 2013, it has been trending up. This tells you how thin the all-in margin is for LendingClub. Expense management would be critical going forward.A notable metric management has been selling to shareholders is ""adjusted EBITDA,"" effectively adding back sizeable stock-based compensation. A couple of observations here: 1) the company has no debt, EBITDA is not that useful anyway, 2) LC has a large management incentive plan in place; using the latest stock price, on the treasury stock method, dilution would be almost 9% of the current outstanding common shares, 3) if management wants to present the free cash flow numbers, then they should have gone all the way, which of course, they would be negative after factoring CAPEX and other adjustments.LendingClub's Independence, or Lack ofJust a couple of years ago, a few made the declaration akin to LendingClub and its peers would replace and reinvest the banking sector, including Charles Moldow, one of LC's earliest investors. But people often neglect a very fundamental piece of LendingClub's operation: LC's so-called innovative platform ultimately has to rely on FDIC-insured banks with traditional banking licenses to issue these loans. This effectively allows the company to avoid regulatory oversight, in other words, layers of compliance costs.Arguments for P2P lenders completely displacing the traditional banking system is utterly nonsense to me. If regulators want to engage, a natural place to exert its influence and pressure would be on WebBank, which is effectively no different to overseeing LC. I believe management understands this specific risk and attempts to mitigate this risk by diversifying its issuing banks to include Cross River Bank and newly added NBT Bank and Comenity Capital Bank.In other words, in order for LendingClub to be successful, the partnering banks would need to be too. This symbiotic relationship may be the new trend going forward, but also calls for questions on how much LC has to pay to maintain that relationship. WebBank has recently negotiated better terms, though not specifically disclosed, for themselves given heightened regulatory pressures.Increasing Regulatory PressureGiven P2P is a relatively new industry within the financial services sector, LendingClub benefits from less regulation. The risk of greater regulation is still unknown. But, as the industry continues to gather coverage, it's foreseeable that regulators would either directly or indirectly impose regulatory oversight going forward, which could materially change the economics of the business model.As a matter of fact, just a few months after LendingClub closed its acquisition of Springstone business, the CFPB opened a civil investigation into some of Springstone's practices in June 2014.In July 2015, the Treasury released a Request for Information (""RFI"") regarding the P2P industry, its products, and its potential to expand credit offerings to underserved borrowers. The RFI is still in information collection stage at this point.On March 7, 2016, the CFPB announced that it is accepting complaints from consumers encountering problems with online marketplace lenders. We see what happened in the mortgage servicing sector in the past couple of years when CFPB cracked down on Ocwen (NYSE:OCN). The implication for LendingClub is probably a more careful collection effort, better disclosures, which probably result in higher expenses.I personally believe the regulation would continue to be benign in today's market, i.e. credit losses are still relatively contained, loan investors continue to generate returns, and borrowers are properly treated. A true test would be another credit cycle, similar to a 2008/2009 event.Deteriorating Credit LossesIn January 2016, LC Advisors, an investment adviser owned by LendingClub, presented that some debt is underperforming against expectations. The chart below (lifted from its presentation) shows that charged-off rates for some five-year LendingClub loans were roughly 7-8%, compared to a forecast range of around 4-6%. We can see a similar trend for the 3-year loans.One of the arguments that LendingClub advocated is its technological advancement in underwriting and credit decisioning. Recent credit performance has spooked quite a bit of investors in fear that another credit cycle like 2008/2009 would destroy LendingClub. This is a legitimate concern. The company stated in its Q4'15 investor presentation, if unemployment jumps to 8% under stress tests, loan investors should still expect roughly 5% in return. But the company didn't disclose what the return would be if unemployment peaks at 10% again, except claiming its 2008 and 2009 investors still earned a positive return.Against this backdrop, the company recently increased rates on loans in response to potential credit weakening and following the Fed's first rate increase. The implication of this is management has to work harder to retain its repeat customers and acquire new ones, in the midst of growing P2P competition.Growing CompetitionWith regards to the competitive landscape, management seems to brush off the newcomers, claiming there is only a handful that is ""mainstream"" like LendingClub, further stating that LC has not felt any negative impact from the increasing competition. LC seems a bit naive to think that newcomers are not going to continue to take up volume for the same business. Let's look at LC's main business segments and some key players that compete in them:- Personal loan: Prosper, Marlette, Payoff, Avant, LendUp, Upstart, earnest, eLoan, wonga, Pave, etc- Education: SoFi, CommonBond, Payoff- Patient Finance: PeerUnited, United Medical Credit- Small Business: OnDeck, FundBox, able, Bond Street, Funding Circle, etcThis increasing competition, coupled with higher rates, directly translated to higher customer acquisition cost, which has been trending higher since 2013.Unrealistic ExpectationsShareholders of LendingClub also have unrealistic expectations for this still-start-up-like company. Despite the company generates notable growth in loan originations, earnings have not caught up. Investors today are paying for an elusive earnings growth that requires substantial execution from management. For reference, when LC went IPO, the consensus EPS estimate for 2016 was $0.50/share. Now, it's at $0.27/share.SummaryAt the end of the day, LendingClub is at an inflection point where the company needs to focus on generating profitability for shareholders, top line growth is just not enough. In the midst of increasing competition, deteriorating credit quality, and regulatory pressures, investors should stay on the sideline until management can deliver profitability for the business."
3816836,22148,2016-01-18T18:57:05-05:00,LendingClub trades at new lows as regulatory fears mount and the stock market throws away previous hot IPO stocks.The stock valuation suggests the price could head even lower in the short-term.The rewards are starting to outweigh the risks on LendingClub at these beaten down prices.,"Financials and recent hot IPOs have absolutely fallen out of favor with the stock market. With LendingClub (NYSE:LC) at the middle of both trends, the stock has collapsed over the last few months. The stock is down nearly 50% from its highs of only one month ago.The best part of the upheaval in the sector, as highlighted in my last article, is that the collapsing valuations of public fintechs like LendingClub, OnDeck (NYSE:ONDK) and Square (NYSE:SQ) will help curtail competition. Without money funding new startups or competitive platforms, LendingClub will further establish itself as the dominant network for peer-to-peer loans.With the stock at $8, the question is whether LendingClub is finally at the bottom. A couple of lingering questions could impact a rebound.Regulatory Fears Add UpThe recent weakness that extends beyond the market is due in part to regulatory concerns. A BTIG analyst thinks the stock weakness is related to fears that the U.S. Supreme Court may review a lower court decision Madden v. Midland Funding case as broad implication for the business.Part of the issue is the rules related to these new platforms. With a large amount of market participants located in the New York area, the battle against daily-fantasy sports probably doesn't help investors psyche. Both Draft Kings and FanDuel spent millions of dollars building and promoting their respective sites to only have the attorney general in New York and other districts attempt to shut down the platforms.While the latter involves questions of gambling, the former involves similar concerns of whether small consumers or investors are sophisticated enough and properly informed of the risks of investing in loans on the platform. In addition, LendingClub uses a quirk in the regulatory system to rely on an unknown bank to issue their loans.Another issue involves the California Department of Business Oversight that reportedly wants more information from companies in the online lending sector. The probe is even further concerning after finding out that the San Bernardino terrorists obtained a loan from the Prosper Marketplace, a prime competing online lender of LendingClub.While no evidence exists that Prosper broke any laws, such an unfortunate event can lead to unexpected regulatory moves.Though positive on the position of LendingClub, even the statement by the CEO on the Q3 earnings call hints at the unpredictability of regulators in areas of innovation:Valuation Turns CompellingThe number one problem with investing in LendingClub after the IPO was the very stretched valuation. Most investors argued the online lending platform was worth upwards of $10 billion due to the size of the addressable market.Typically though, the stock market eventually adjusts the valuation to a multiple of the addressable market of the next few years. In those regards, the stock has gone from $28 to below $8 in roughly one year. The valuation is now down to $3.1 billion.The problem all along though is that increased revenue guidance only tops out at $422 million for the year. Even assuming LendingClub hits the forecasted 70% revenue growth rate for this year, revenues only reach $715 million in 2016.At that rate, the online lending platform still trades at slightly over 4x forecasted revenues that require exceptional growth to achieve. When considering the company more of a platform than a financial institution, one can compare it to other platforms that have sank to even lower P/S multiples. Both Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Yelp (NYSE:YELP) face competitive threats and issues with user growth, but neither company has the same degree of regulatory risk from financial regulators.Sure the above chart isn't a perfect comparison of stocks in the same business, but at the least even bulls can use those valuation metrics as examples of what happens when stocks of platforms go out of favor while revenue growth remains solid.TakeawayWhile agreeing with BTIG that the regulatory risk seems low considering the platform helps consumers lower credit costs, the regulatory and court systems aren't always logical from an investor standpoint. No doubt, the stock is at the point where further declines make it too cheap to ignore. LendingClub is quickly developing an irreplaceable network for peer-to-peer lending. If the company can avoid any regulatory setbacks, the stock will offer solid value to investors buying at the current level."
3813346,99186,2016-01-15T12:26:13-05:00,Compliance risk looming.Undifferentiated business strategy.Monoline product.,"Let's face it, we love LendingClub (NYSE:LC) but hate their stock. LendingClub has funded billions upon billions of loans quarter after quarter. Their origination technology and underwriting experience is market leading. Looking at LendingClub's Q3 2015 financial results, they have finally managed to break-even.By all measures, LendingClub should not have lost 67% of its IPO value, hitting a 52-week low. What's wrong with this picture?I'm going to focus on some macro level issues facing LendingClub.Compliance risk loomingLendingClub operates under a model where the loans are not issued by LendingClub. All loans LendingClub originates are from WebBank, a Utah state chartered industrial bank. Although the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has not securitized the ""rent-a-bank"" model, it would be a devastating blow to the entire LendingClub model if the CFPB starts to snoop around.The ""rent-a-charter"" model has been around for a while now. Most of the co-branded credit cards or retail credit cards use this model. Payday lending has used this model for more than a decade. But it does represent a huge binary risk for LendingClub. This is one of the reasons why investors are divesting from LendingClub.Undifferentiated business strategyA long time ago, someone I know that watches the tech sector said this to me: Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) needs to realize that they are just a factory. It is their manufacturing process that is superior than all else.I think it's the same with LendingClub. The sooner they realize that they are just a LendingTree (NASDAQ:TREE) copycat, the better off they would be. But there's a huge problem. LendingTree, CreditKarma supplies leads to LendingClub. LendingClub is spending massive amounts of cash to compete with their originators. That's a losing proposition by definition.What if we think of LendingClub as an online lender? Their credit models are just a conglomerate of credit reports that they do not own. They are leveraging data from traditional credit bureaus such as TransUnion (NYSE:TRU), Experian (OTCQX:EXPGY) and Equifax (NYSE:EFX). On top of it all, they must report the bank's loan performance to the credit bureaus. It feels like there is not much secret sauce left.What if we judge LendingClub as an excellent asset management firm? Well, LendingClub doesn't have any loans on their books and thus they don't get to keep any of the yield. The bank partners sell off these loans to hedge funds just a few days after. Because of that, there's not much in it for LendingClub to service these loans.Monoline productLendingClub has one product, an installment loan. Their business loan product is in a competitive environment with OnDeck (NYSE:ONDK). Their Patient Solutions financing is sensitive to economic cycles.In some ways, LendingClub is stuck. There's no money in credit cards. The cost of origination and retention is unsustainable. Processing credit cards require massive technology investments to process transactions and prevent fraud.Auto lending is tough and needs a tremendous amount of staff to handle titles and collaterals. Student loans face stiff regulation and most banks have exited that business. And this is the worst credit cycle to be in mortgages.After all, we love fintech, we love disruptive technology. We love what Uber (NYSE:UBER) did to the taxi industry and what Airbnb (AIRB) did to the hotel industry.What LendingClub's struggling with is not unique. Most fintech companies are contemplating these three strategic issues daily. But from an investor's perspective, it is a tough call to join the club."
3892606,22148,2016-02-12T14:08:10-05:00,"LendingClub reported solid Q4 earnings and guided up for 2016.Fears over the impact to the online lending marketplace in the next recession appear misplaced.The stock is cheap, but likely gets cheaper.","The interesting news of the week is that a beaten down online lending marketplace plans a $150 million share buyback. Due to a large level of pessimism, LendingClub (NYSE:LC) falls into my general theme of stocks beaten down to extreme lows despite obvious growth potential.Even after the rally following earnings, the stock trades close to the lows and down some 75% from the post-IPO highs. Despite some logical fears and my previous warnings on valuation questions at higher prices, one has to wonder if the market has assumed no future growth with the stock below $7.Unlike other hot IPO stocks from the last couple of years, LendingClub hasn't actually ran into any issues with slowing user growth or missed estimates. In fact, the company guided 2016 estimates higher with the Q4 earnings report. At the same time, the online lending marketplace wants to use the equivalent of the EBITDA guidance for the year on stock buybacks. The $150 million approved buyback amounts to 5% of the outstanding shares.From a valuation standpoint, LendingClub is finally compelling with an enterprise valuation now around $1.8 billion due to roughly $920 million in cash on the balance sheet. With revenues targeted at $740 million for this year, the stock trades at an EV multiple of revenue of only 2.5. In normal markets, this multiple is very meager for a stock forecasting 72% revenue growth. Unfortunately, this isn't a normal market.The market is naturally worried about a recession along with rate hikes and the impact such a scenario would have on the LendingClub marketplace. The company provided some compelling stats regarding the last recession.According to LendingClub data, the returns in the Great Recession period were actually positive. The low point was a 2.4% return in 2009.Though one might question the accuracy of the return calculation directly from the company, one probably can't question the fact that investors kept investing on the platform. LendingClub backs up this claim with data highlighting that fixed income obtain massive inflows during recessions and weak periods in the equity markets.Naturally, the situation is massively different this time around. The marketplace is significantly larger making for a more difficult time to increase inflows. At the same time though, any recession in 2016 will likely be milder than back in the 2008 and 2009 timeframe. Also, LendingClub learned a lot from that crisis and has improved the platform over that time period.The key takeaway is that the market won't have complete confidence that LendingClub can thrive in the next recession until it happens. Even the large banks that have lower leverage levels this time around are taking big hits in the stock market.The valuation is now appealing and the data is compelling that LendingClub can actually thrive in a recessionary environment. The recommendation is to invest no more than a half position at this level leaving dry powder for the possibility of a further drop to $5 or lower.Right now, the stock doesn't show any signs that the downtrend is actually broken. At $5 and assuming the stock buyback purchases 20 million shares, LendingClub would trade for a market value of $1.9 billion. With $770 million in remaining cash, the enterprise value would drop to only $1.1 billion or roughly equal to the expectations for 2017 revenues. Such a valuation isn't justified, but a lot of platform and marketplace stocks have dropped to similar levels."

The three issues are: I was hoping that, in LendingClub's Q4 2015 earnings announcement, CEO Renaud Laplanche would address these critical issues head on in 2016, but I was disappointed. However, both Laplanche and CFO Carrie Dolan gave us a far more darker picture of what is to come for LendingClub.In this essay, I put together evidence that will help you understand potentially the deepest and the darkest fear looming over LendingClub laid out clearly by Renaud and Carrie right in front of our eyes.FiascoBefore we dive into the hidden meanings behind what was said in LendingClub's Q4 2015 earnings announcement, let's take a look at an article first published by Bloomberg Business, LendingClub Models Misfire as Loan Write-Offs Top Forecasts, on February 5, 2016.That article prompted LendingClub to respond with a blog post, Credit Performance Update, two days later.Then came another editorial, LendingClub did not 'misfire' in their underwriting, by the CEO of a widely-respected marketplace lending portfolio analytics firm Monja.com. James Wu, the CEO of Monja.com offered a concise explanation in defense of LendingClub. But the media is still confused and looking for blood. I personally got a few calls from reporters trying to figure out what in the world is really going on?Without getting into the subtle nuances of statistical modeling and various techniques to measure and correct model prediction decay, I will leave the debate of whether LendingClub's credit risk model has truly failed for another time.If LendingClub's credit risk model is truly failing to predict the underlying credit risk of borrowers, then is it perhaps related to the recent news that Santander USA (NYSE:SAN) had stopped buying unsecured personal loans from LendingClub and offloaded over a billion dollar worth of personal loans to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM)?In Bloomberg's, Santander Said Close to Selling $1 Billion of LendingClub Loans, Santander report a 4th quarter 2015 loss of $232 million on its unsecured personal loan portfolio, $123 million of which came from borrower defaults. Chris Donat, analyst at Sandler O'Neill & Partners stated: ""In light of the damage that the personal loan portfolio inflicted on Santander's income statement in 4Q15, we will be relieved when Santander is out of this business.""On February 2, 2016 crowdfundinsider.com published a report, JPMorgan Chase Agrees to Aquire Nearly $1B Personal Loans Arranged by LendingClub. If LendingClub's portfolio is truly turning south, then why would JPM volunteer to take this hot potato off of Santander's hands? Is it also interesting that none of this was mentioned by the CEO and CFO of LendingClub in their Q4 2015 earnings announcement. The plot thickens …Well, there in lies the genius of JPM. Folks at Chase understand that default curves flattens after 20+ months of portfolio aging or vintage. The remaining borrowers that JPMorgan Chase purchased are borrowers that have been paying and will keep on paying their debt with little to no defaults. Genius!MisstepsOkay, let's get back to the Q4 2015 LendingClub's earnings announcement. We will start by looking at LendingClub's new found love with supply of capital. For the first time, LendingClub is openly addressing the diversity of their capital. It's interesting that LendingClub made it a priority to talk about their source of capital after a major debt buyer such as Santander decided to pulled out of the program.As published by LendingClub, out of $8.4 billion loans funded in Q4 2015, 54% came from 115,000 retail investors. That's close to $40,000 per person!Renaud stated:Why is LendingClub so focused on retail investors in this earnings announcement? Because a recession is coming and institutional debt buyers are in the process of pulling out of the program just like as happened in 2007 and 2008.To maintain LendingClub's growth, LendingClub must seek capital from retail investors. However, the cost to acquire retail investors is expensive, assuming retail investor appetite for debt is still there during a recession. That's a big if.But fear not, even in the worst of the times, Renaud still believes investors will swarm the platform and give him billions to fund unsecured personal loans … here is their math.LendingClub used Moody's S3 scenario and Fed CCAR 2016 (used by banks to stress test their lending portfolio) to model a worst case economic downturn scenario in Q1 2017 with 8% unemployment.Surprisingly, LendingClub's portfolio still yielded a 4.9% return. This simulation is confusing because LendingClub's loans duration are typically averaging 49 months. So it begs the question as to what would be the loss adjusted yield after 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and beyond?They further compared this ""worst case"" scenario against their actual worst case scenario back in 2008, which yielded a 2.4% return (they also sneaked in a 1.0% price increase to get to a 2.4% return). In reality, you are better off buying a 10-year treasury bond.However, Renaud failed to mentioned that LendingClub only issued 3,000 loans in 2008 in his study. Hardly a fair comparison to provide any level of comfort for their existing or future retail investors during a recession.He further stated, ""In an economic slowdown investors tend to [feed] the stock market and invest in fixed income."" Last time I checked fixed income is bonds issued by federal and local municipalities, not unsecured personal loans.All of this leads me to believe that LendingClub has seriously underestimated the amount of retail capital it thinks it can extract from the crowd during a recessionary scenario. Even if it manages to acquire additional retail investors, it will come at a much greater marketing cost. And they didn't go into any detail on this when asked by analysts after the earnings announcement.Bad OmensIf the dreams of fueling demand from retail investors aren't bad enough, CFO Carrie Dolan continues to make comments that are full of doom and gloom scenarios:LendingClub is prepared to shift its capital source from institutional asset managers to individual retail investors to reduce binary risk. LendingClub is also prepared to slash staff and stop technology investment to maintain margin expansion and growth.In addition, LendingClub has already raised price last quarter by 57 basis points and has a planned price increase of another 100 basis points in 2016 and 2017. Higher price usually attracts even worse borrowers. It's the definition of adverse selection.Clearly LendingClub is preparing for a recession in early 2017 with some bad assumptions around retail investor appetite and utilizing price adjustments to cover credit risk. I would steer clear from making investment on this platform.With the launch of Quicken Loans' Personal Loans program (RocketLoans.com) this month, LendingClub will be heading into significant competitive, legal and capital markets headwind in 2016."
3750286,24276,2015-12-11T11:52:10-05:00,A peer to peer lending rival lent to one of the San Bernardino shooters.Congress is now considering new regulations on the sector.The stock is down 40% from its IPO. More trouble ahead?,"These should be better days for Lending Club (NYSE:LC).The stock doesn't show it (down almost 40% from the IPO) but the numbers for the peer-to-peer lender look pretty good. Year-over-year revenue growth for September came in at 72%, and the company turned in its first profit, $2.18 million. Cash from financing has tripled during the calendar year, and came in at nearly $1.6 billion for the third quarter. Assets have nearly doubled to almost $5.4 billion, in just one year.But one loan, that Lending Club wasn't even involved with, could scuttle its growth plans. It was made by Prosper Marketplace, a peer to peer lender based in San Francisco, last month, for $28,500. To Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the San Bernardino terrorists.As a result, ""everything's on the table"" regarding changes to rules governing such marketplaces, according to the Republican chair of a task force on terrorist financing, Jeb Hensarling. This is not the kind of ""regulatory over-reach"" that can get nailed back by a few calls to friendly Congress-critters, because the effort is being led by friendly ones, and they have the ""terrorism"" bit between their teeth.The industry insists its hands are clean. The borrower had no previous criminal record. Farook was a native-born citizen. But it is very likely the loan could result in regulations that force borrowers' names through a federal law enforcement database, at some cost, and with some delay in disbursements. There is also the reverse ""halo effect"" of a peer to peer lender having been used in this way, which in a fraught political environment could result in new state regulations, and costs for the industry in fighting them.Lending Club launched in 2007, got its SEC license in 2008, and had its first billion-dollar quarter (in terms of loan volume) last year, just before its IPO. Lending Club and other peer to peer lenders are billed as a system where individuals lend to individuals, but in practice most of the money comes from banking pools seeking yield.Despite the steady fall of the stock most analysts give it a buy rating and I mentioned it as a possible speculation in a story that focused on banks a few months ago. The stock began turning around early this month, having bottomed at about $12/share. The selling pressure has been increased due to steady sales by insiders, but most were ""instant sells"" of options obtained as part of compensation packages.My own guess is that this hiccup will delay, but not stymie, Lending Club's future ambitions. But, like the Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) food poisonings, it is a reminder of how unusual risks are inherent in new business models."
3693916,22148,2015-11-17T20:37:35-05:00,LendingClub is positioned to benefit from the leading consumer loan marketplace at a time when competition will increasingly find funding difficult.The stock is still expensive with the valuation in excess of $5 billion.Investors should look at slowly building a position in the loan marketplace as the company quickly grows into the current valuation.,"The biggest fears about investing in LendingClub (NYSE:LC) are the ballooning level of fintech players looking to offer consumer and small business loans. As the leading marketplace for consumer loans, the company has the advantage of a building network, but it doesn't prevent new competitive threats.After huge Q3 results, that included 104% revenue growth, the stock trades near the lows due to valuation and competitive concerns. The question is whether the stock is now worthy of an investment with 100% revenue growth and a low stock price at $12.95, down from a high of $29.29 following the IPO last December.Reduced CompetitionThe best part of the ongoing headwinds in private equity investing and the price weakness of successful IPOs, including LendingClub, is a reduction in funds available for competitors. A couple of recent signs in the general fintech area are general signs that new competitors wouldn't see tons of funding going forward.The Square (NYSE:SQ) IPO has seen a roughly 25% cut in pricing from the last private equity financing, and the loanDepot (NYSE:LDI) IPO scheduled for last Friday was delayed. Square provides payment services and financing for small businesses, and loanDepot is a non-bank mortgage lender. While neither is a direct competitor to LendingClub, both are indications of the market pulling back financing for companies in the fintech sector.Another sign of how new lending marketplaces will increasingly find it difficult to compete with LendingClub was the discussion on the earnings call surrounding the fraud attacks on new marketplaces. Apparently, several new marketplaces are seeing borrowers that are able to borrow money and fail to even make the first payment.Increasing issues of fraud will encourage investors to stick with the top platform in the business that is already established as LendingClub, and Prosper as a distant second alternative. The stronger credit quality and proven low fraud history also provides borrowers with lower interest rates on loans.Valuation ComponentThe biggest issue with the stock all along was a rather healthy valuation given to the stock at the IPO. With 402 million shares outstanding with the Q3 report, LC is now worth slightly over $5 billion. The company though only surpassed the quarterly revenue total of $100 million during Q3. The guidance for Q4 revenue in excess of $125 million places revenues on an annualized rate of $500 million.The valuation places the stock trading at roughly 10x the annualized revenue run rate. With forecasted 2016 revenue growth of 70%, LendingClub is targeting over $715 million in revenues. The stock still trades at roughly 7x those forward revenue targets.Outside of the valuation, everything else about the business is impressive. For Q3, revenues grew 104% due to a 92% increase in originations and a 40 basis point increase in the revenue yield to 5.15%. At the same time, the company held expenses in check, allowing the adjusted EBITDA margin to surge to 18.4%, up from 13.3% last year.TakeawayLendingClub is increasingly building a platform respected and trusted by both investors and borrowers. The ability to compete with the large marketplace will increasingly become difficult with lower funding for competitors and ongoing fraud issues at others. The stock is still difficult to own at the current valuations, but the recent news sets LC up for long-term success. Investors can start building positions with the intent of loading up on the stock on any future dips versus chasing the stock higher."
3961478,22148,2016-03-28T16:33:29-04:00,"After the market closed for the three-day weekend, financial outlets reported that Prosper had a bad bond offering with low investor appetite.The news will add to the negativity on LendingClub as the company was increasingly reliant on institutions to fund growth on the platform.The recommendation is to use any dips to load up on LendingClub.","After 15 months of nothing but negative returns for equity holders, the sentiment in the fintech sector and the general leader in the sector LendingClub (NYSE:LC) has turned incredibly negative. What little coverage the companies get on Seeking Alpha are all rather negative considering both LendingClub and OnDeck Capital (NYSE:ONDK) continue turning out exceptional growth.The latest news is that private Prosper Marketplace (Private:PRMA) had a bad bond offering. The news came out on Friday with the market closed so the hit to LendingClub occurred on Monday. With the stock trading at $7.70, one might expect a retest of the lows around $7 this week. If this occurs, the stock is worth a purchase for the following reasons.Prosper ImpactAccording to the WSJ, Prosper Marketplace had to price a bond offering at 5 percentage points above a similar offering from last year. Interestingly, Citigroup (NYSE:C) buys these loans from the marketplace at Prosper and resells them in a package to investors. The deal completed last year had a top yield of 7.3% with the yield last week reaching 12.5%.The report, though, doesn't specifically discuss credit metrics other than suggesting the higher yields were for the riskiest loans in the pool. One though has to question why anybody accepted a deal for a 7.3% yield last year on the riskiest loans at Prosper. In the latest press release from LendingClub, the company claims the average interest rate is 12.6% on its loans.The scenario laid out by this report definitely questions the viability of the funding sources for marketplaces like LendingClub and Prosper. In the case of LendingClub, institutions purchased 33% of the loans in 2015.Source: LendingClub Q4'15 presentationA pullback in this funding source naturally would hurt the growth metrics of the marketplace. Institutions played a big part in the funding source growth over the last two years. Retail investors, though, are responsible for investing $709 million back in 2012 to over $4 billion last year. The platform is no slouch with the growth from retail alone.The company reported earnings roughly a month ago so one needs more details from the Prosper securitization pricing before making too many negative conclusions.As highlighted in my previous research, LendingClub survived the Great Recession with flying colors and had no problem increasing funding sources. Of course, the fintech originated $2.6 billion in loans during Q4 while the company didn't cross the $50 million quarterly threshold until 2011.Negative SentimentThe negative sentiment is no clearer then reviewing the articles on Seeking Alpha. Though the stock has actually bounced from the lows hit in January and February, not one positive article has been written about the stock.Here is a list of the articles written about LendingClub since the start of December:All of these articles have great information on LendingClub and marketplace lending, but the general thesis is that the concept has peaked and is headed for an ultimate demise. Either the investor returns are misleading, competition will ultimately impact the sector, or the next economic downturn will kill the concept.The ironic part though is that LendingClub and even OnDeck Capital continue generating exceptional results. In the case of LendingClub, the last quarter saw revenues grow over 90%. The company forecast revenues growing over 70% this year with no signs of problems with funding sources.TakeawayEven at higher interest rates, online lending marketplaces offer more attractive interest rates to consumers than credit cards. The negativity on a stock like LendingClub is too high in relation to the opportunity. When all of the opinions line up in one direction, the prudent move is to make a contrarian play.Use any dip caused by the negative news flow on the Prosper bond offering as a chance to finally own the premier online lending platform."

        Lending club’s roll out of new product line more beneficial to new business owner’s.
        Valuations undemanding to the sector, I upgrade from Hold to Buy on the end of post-IPO lockup overhang.","Introduction:Lending Club (NYSE:LC) reported third quarter results on the 29th of October beating consensus results and my own results (which were already higher than that of the street). The strong set of results affirms my bullish sentiment on the counter but I have previously stayed on the sidelines due to post-IPO lock up overhang. With that now out of the way, and based on the strong set of results announced, I upgrade LC from Hold to Buy.Results blow past consensus estimatesLC reported third quarter results on Thursday after hours beating top- and bottom-line estimates by $7.15 million and $0.02. For more on my third quarter numbers, see third quarter outlook.Source: Company data, Enceladus ResearchThe stronger than expected results that beat both the street estimates and mine (which were already higher than the street) was driven by higher loans origination (up 92%). Overall, as management noted, revenue growth grew an even faster 98% to 104% and EBITDA margin also improved on a year-on-year basis.LC's share price rallied more than 9% after hours which is even higher than the average implied one day move of 7.2% that my model derived (for more information, see LC third quarter outlook).Roll out of new features on product line a plus for LCLC announced on the 16th of this month that they have launched the multi draw line of credit for small businesses. The new line of credit will give small businesses better access to capital in a low cost manner as the line of credit is available on demand (if they qualify) for small businesses and cost nothing to maintain. Businesses will only incur a 1-2% fee should they decide to tap on the line.The rolling out of additional features by LC coincide with OnDeck Capital's (NYSE:ONDK) revamping of their product line which increases their appeal to small businesses. Overall, I think the recent moves are a positive to small businesses as it allows small businesses more options and reduces their overall cost of financing which helps in increasing stickiness. This is especially important given the increasing threat of competition in this space.ValuationsI have adopted the EV/EBITDA and EV/Sales (trailing) valuation methodology to value LC. For an in-depth explanation on the choice of these methods, see link above.Source: BloombergBased on their last closing price on the 29th of October at $13.62, LC is trading at a slight premium of 20.1x and 11.7x to the industry's 15.9x and 8.6x. The strong set of reported results and execution however prompts an upgrade post-IPO lockup overhang. I upgrade LC accordingly from Hold to Buy."
3568536,91185,2015-10-13T11:08:37-04:00,"Now that the hype is gone, Lending Club in poised for growth.$11 billion in loan origination and growing fast.Marketing for borrowers could use some improvement but will not hinder profitability.","Now that the hype of the IPO is over and the stock has dropped by 50%, is it time to look at Lending Club (NYSE:LC) as a growth investment?Lending Club went public on the premise of being a peer-to-peer lender but that's not what it really is. Lending Club is a securitization platform for loans made through a bank.The loans are made by the bank and then put into the platform for funding by small investors who usually take small pieces of each loan in order to spread the risk. There are two levels of middlemen between the peers. The bank and the platform. Lending Club and its competitor Prosper, which both use the same bank, are the pretty wrappers.In theory, everybody is a winner. Borrowers get lower interest rates, investors get bigger returns, the bank gets an initiation fee, and Lending Club gets some initial fee and on-going servicing fees. Reports are that everyone is doing well with the exception of IPO investors.Would we want to invest in this stock today is a trickier consideration. Lending Club is not currently a profitable company though they are on the cusp of profitability. The have only initiated $11 billion in loans to date. Against a $3.5 trillion consumer loan market this is barely a snowflake on top of the iceberg. There's plenty of room for Lending Club to grow their market share without having much effect on the competition.There is no shortage of investors for the loans. Lending Club's biggest problem getting individual investors is the need to deal with restrictions on a state-by-state basis. They just recently added the states of Indiana, Nebraska and Kansas. There are now a total of 36 states that allow retail investors to participate in the program that gives them fairly consistent returns of 5% to 8%. Those 36 states represent 75%-plus of the US population.Lending Club does not have to rely on individual investors. As providers of the technology platform, there is nothing that prevents them from investing money for institutions. Small and large pension funds alike would find returns of 5% to 8%, attractive given the current outlook for the stock and bond markets. The giant fund Calpers only managed a 2.4% return in the last fiscal year. The return is even more attractive because the commitment is only for three to five years.The biggest downside to Lending Club could be the ability to attract borrowers. Lending Club competitor Prosper has an affiliate program that pays more for bringing in new borrowers than new investors. $100-$150 vs. $50. This shows how dear borrowers are to Prosper and the same is probably true for Lending Club.Additional evidence of the work to attract borrowers is the picture below:These are all solicitations from Lending Club offering me loans ""up to $30,000."" I could only fit 13 into the photo and threw out another 9. An additional two dozen had already found their way to the circular file.Now, in reality, the actual loan amount could be much less. I'm sure that people with low income and weak credit are approved for much smaller loans.There are two problems with these mailing pieces.I'm sure that somebody in the marketing department is tracking to make sure there is a positive return but there has to be something better that gets the story of peer-to-peer lending across to potential borrowers. The company needs to get a better marketing team together that works on improved targeting and some form of originality that differentiates their mailers from all the rest.The only way the story is being spread now is through the affiliates. Affiliates do not face the same constraints as the company does with regard to talking about low interest rates for borrowers and higher returns for borrowers.Affiliate marketers make their money by having people click through an ad on the marketer's website and sign up to be a borrower or investor on Lending Club's website. The smart marketers do this through content marketing rather than relying on mere ads. Content marketing allows for the marketers to be a little sly. The link is contained in a blog post, usually masked as some kind of review or journalistic report.A post targeted to borrowers will ignore the possibility of rates over 20%. Instead they will focus on the experience of borrowers who paid around 10% give or take a few points.Investors are targeted with reports that include quotes from people who claim to receive a steady 14% to 18% return instead of the official company line of 5% to 8%. The issue of deadbeat borrowers will mostly be avoided or hidden behind the concept of spreading the risk around.Worded properly none of these claims are that far out of bounds. I have personally talked to people who borrowed at under 8% and people who claim 12% steady returns. Neither the affiliate marketer nor the company will get in any trouble with regulators as long as no concept of guarantee is mentioned.A disruptive company needs a marketing team that can come up with something novel - something that puts the Lending Club name in front of high credit score borrowers in an edgy and memorable fashion.I have faith they can figure something out.Despite this marketing plan weakness, Lending Club is expected to increase loan originations by over 80% this year and hit profitability in 2017. There's a lot of upside potential mixed with the risk of increased competition. However, it's already a huge market with tons of competition and Lending Club has higher name recognition than many competitors and people tend to look at them positively because of the peer-to-peer friendliness as opposed to the big evil banks.Lending Club is on the verge of profitability. A steady expansion in loans should put them in the black. They only need a slightly larger piece of an enormous pie to be highly profitable. The platform is already built and functional so increased revenues should strongly out pace increased costs.So, Lending Club looks like a good bet for the high-risk investor with a disruptive technology portfolio. Risk adverse investors would be better off investing through the platform itself. 5% to 8% is a decent yield in a tax sheltered account and might just consistently beat the market as a whole."

He’s a philanthropist. He’s a wickedly competitive bridge player. He’s also a quote machine about business and investing. I mean, what’s not to love about this one:Or this one (which also seems to have served his portfolio well over time):But here’s one that might foreshadow what’s soon to come in the world of FinTech investing: We’ve seen and read enough to know that the unicorns are starting to lose their mythical stature as the not so mythical market valuation chickens are starting to come home to roost. It turns out that you really do have to make money in order to sustain a business over the long term. But there’s a FinTech segment, in particular, that may soon be dotting the landscape with a lot of naked investors as the tide goes out on what is touted as one of the greatest transformations ever to have hit financial services: Marketplace lending. Are Marketplace Lenders Swimming Naked?Over the last seven or so years, marketplace lending is to VC money what high-end retail is to me – simply irresistible. <wink> Hundreds of millions of dollars have been poured into a variety of these tech-enabled, data-driven lending platforms. Some have even IPO’d. Funding Circle (FCLE), Prosper (PRMA) and Lending Club (NYSE:LC), among the largest and most notable veterans in the marketplace lending space. Marketplace lenders were, in many ways, in the right place at exactly the right time. During the financial crisis, these new players innovated lending in a way that highly regulated, traditional financial services players simply couldn’t. Using data, technology and sophisticated credit scoring and risk management algorithms, these new technology platforms created a business that matched borrowers with a lack of capital with investors with money to lend. Their business was extending unsecured loans ranging in size from $1,000 to $35,000 to borrowers at attractive interest rates. And the appeal to investors was that their data-driven risk models were every bit as good or better as those of their traditional bank lender counterparts. Since marketplace lenders do all of their business online, they didn’t have to worry about absorbing the onerous operating costs of maintaining physical bank branches or the personnel to staff them. That, analysts and investors say, shaved roughly 400 basis points off the cost of operating these new lending platforms – making them a highly efficient and cost-effective, new lending model.At least in theory. But the really clever part of these lending platforms is how they make money. The clever angle that marketplace lenders have parlayed into hundreds of millions of dollars in venture-backed investments is that they really aren’t on the hook for any of the credit risk associated with making their loans since, oh, they don’t actually make the loans. Rather, marketplace lenders are a conduit to investors who actually put up the money that’s given to borrowers. Marketplace lenders are a platform in the truest sense of the word. They acquire customers online and assess their creditworthiness. They then match that borrower with an investor willing to buy the loan. They then service it, once the loan is made. Investors come in all shapes and sizes: hedge funds, pension funds, PE firms, private investors and banks. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) just bought a portfolio of loans that were dragging down the performance of Santander’s consumer loan portfolio that included loans originating from Lending Club. A bank in the background does the regulatory dirty work of actually making and booking the loan that a marketplace lender has matched up with an investor. That bank carries that loan on their books just long enough for it to be packaged as a securitized asset and sold to those investors. Often in a matter of days, a borrower has his money, and an investor has a securitized asset that is now part of their investment portfolio. Investors make their money on the spread between the cost of capital and the rate of interest charged to the borrower. Thanks to the insanely low cost of capital over the last several years and the interest rates charged to the borrower, investors have made a pretty handsome return on their investment. (But hold that thought.) So, it’s the investor, not the marketplace lender, that assumes the credit risk for the loan and, therefore, must hope and pray that the risk models underpinning those loans are as bulletproof as advertised. The marketplace lender, on the other hand, makes most of its money on the originating fees that borrowers pay them to get access to funds. That makes job No. 1 for a marketplace lender acquiring customers who want a loan and may otherwise have few options to get one. Naturally, marketplace lenders also need borrowers to be creditworthy enough to repay the loan, but their incentives are first and foremost aligned around getting as many customers as they can onto their platform so that they can book revenue from originating fees. So, without the same capital requirements as banks, without the brick-and-mortar operations to support like banks, without the onerous regulatory and compliance boxes to check like banks and without the credit risk to get in the way of financial performance like the banks, it’s not surprising that VCs were attracted like bees to honey to this innovative lending model. But the same business model that gave marketplace lenders life, could ultimately deliver its death knell. In the form of the platform death spiral driven, ironically, by the credit risk that these platforms thought would be someone else’s problem to deal with.  Follow The Bouncing Marketplace Lending Platform Death Spiral The marketplace lending model is designed to offload the most pernicious risk in the lending business – credit risk – to the investors who buy the loans from them. And, when all works well – e.g. the credit underwriting is spot on, borrowers repay their loans as promised and capital is plentiful – everyone makes money and the happy and virtuous circle of platforms works well. Booya!But, something funny can happen on the way to platform business success in this business. And it all comes down to the risk that marketplace lenders thought that they cleverly got rid of when they designed their businesses. Not all borrowers pay their debts. And when times get tough and consumers feel pinched, more of them may decide not to or may not be able to. Topping the list of bills not to pay first – or at all – are unsecured loans – and for one simple reason: There aren’t dire consequences when consumers stiff those lenders. If it’s a choice between an apartment eviction, car repo, mortgage foreclosure, or cellphone or cable interruption, unsecured credit gets shoved to the bottom of the pile. And when borrowers stop paying, investors start losing money. When that happens a lot, investors get sad. Some may even get mad — and mad enough to decide to take their money elsewhere. For a marketplace lender, that’s bad news. No investor money means no ability for marketplace lenders to acquire new customers since they have no other access to capital to extend credit to borrowers. Unlike banks, marketplace lenders don’t have deposits on hand that can be turned into loans. And since they don’t have the loans on their books and the repayments from those loans to turn into capital to lend either, without investor capital, there’s simply no capital. So, no new customers for marketplace lenders means no origination fees to book as revenue, which, as I mentioned, is how marketplace lenders make the majority of their money. And no revenue means no business. And that could spell Platform. Death. Spiral. All because of the credit risk that they never thought they’d have to worry much about. There's No Risk Like Credit Risk (If You're A Lender)Credit risk not only establishes the profile of the borrower and his creditworthiness, but ultimately, the rate of return on the investor’s portfolio – which is their incentive for playing along with marketplace lenders in the first place. That’s where, at least according to some reports, the tide might be starting to go out and we might start to see some naked investors. Moody’s said last week that it was reviewing for a “possible downgrade” of a particular class of assets originated by Prosper and issued by Citi Held for Issuance (CHAI). The review was triggered by what Moody’s describes as evidence of many more delinquencies and charge-offs than originally anticipated. The brief that accompanied this announcement pegged losses of up to 12 percent of that asset class, up from 8 percent when the transaction closed. That, they believe, will translate into losses that could go as high as 13.6 percent, reducing the overall return on the investment that, in this case, CHAI anticipated. The same has been written about the experience of Lending Club’s investors. Lending Club’s CEO reported last week that it returned 7.8 percent to its investors in 2015 (he described it as “nearly 8 percent”). But that’s a good 2 percentage points below what it was two years ago. Lending Memo did an analysis in March of Lending Club’s interest rates, which is a leading indicator of investor rate of return. What they disclosed is that in just about every asset class, interest rates have declined – which corresponds to a declining rate of return to investors.But perhaps the most cautionary dimension to this story is that these declines seem to be independent of the borrower’s FICO score. Remember how marketplace lenders make their money? Origination fees. In an effort to attract more borrowers – and more origination fees — Lending Club appears to have lowered interest rates, and the profile of their borrower at the same time. In other words, interest rates are lower at the same time the risk profile is higher In the best case scenario, which is that these borrowers repay the loan in accordance with the terms, investors will see a lower return on their investments. If these borrowers don’t repay, well, then a lower rate of return might become the least of anyone’s problems.  Lending Club is, of course, the poster child for the marketplace lending sector since as a publicly traded company it’s had the unfortunate consequence of having its every move scrutinized by the public markets. It’s also watched its market cap shrivel to $2 billion from its high point of $8 billion a little more than a year ago. Prosper, which was reported to have had its own plans for IPO in 2015, put them on hold, and is said to be eyeing a 2016 event. But what’s clear is that once-bullish investors seem to have cooled on the space as these platforms work their way through the natural cycle of business and they wait to see how good the new science of credit risk and underwriting really are. It’s really too early to tell. At the same time, regulators are circling the space, uncertain about how to classify — and therefore regulate — them. Marketplace lending proponents say that, unlike the financial crisis in 2008 that had the real possibility to bring down the financial system and do real harm to the economy, that the only people who could be hurt by a marketplace lending meltdown are the fat cat hedge funds and PE firms who have a lot of money to burn. Maybe. And maybe there won’t be any contagion like there was in 2001. But we’ve never been through a cycle like this with lending platforms like this, so we’ll all be watching this play out in real-time. Warren Buffett also said “only buy something that you’d be perfectly happy to hold if the market shut down for 10 years.” Prosper and Lending Club were both established in 2006. It’s probably fair to say that most investors, making their decisions then to invest, and waking up 10 years later, would probably still be pretty happy. It’s just the next 10 years that they — and marketplace lenders — need to worry about."

        The reduced interest rate spreads are beneficial to borrowers, but it could eventually drive off investors.
        The stock offers better value today based on forward revenue estimates, but the current market makes it difficult to pay up for Lending Club.","Even after another quarter of strong sequential growth, Lending Club (NYSE:LC) still remains difficult to own. The previous prediction that the stock becomes a buy when it drifts below 10x forward revenues is hard to follow through on considering the recent market revolt against high-valued stocks.The stock is showing signs of stabilizing around $15 though it clearly remains in the downtrend channel.Is the stock worth a shot with the valuation still over $5 billion and a revenue target of only $400 million for the year?Improving Stock ValueThe good news for Lending Club is that the fintech isn't seeing the competition that impacted OnDeck Capital (NYSE:ONDK). The platform effects are propelling both borrowers and investors towards the service. Unlike other hot growth stocks, Lending Club is seeing an acceleration in loan originations.For Q2, loan originations surged 19% QoQ following a solid 17% growth rate in Q1. The fast growth is improving the revenue yield and leading to surging EBITDA.The best thing the company could say is that supply and demand aren't constrained. Lending Club has a peculiar marketplace in that it requires a substantial amount of new borrowers and investors to keep the machine well oiled. Naturally, a large institution could quickly supply investor capital without needing more investors, but the platform still requires more consumers signing up to keep borrowing growth going. It very much differs from a social network where one person leads to another and so on. In this case, Lending Club needs to grow both sides of the equation proportionally to make it work.While the financial metrics improve and the stock trades at lows, Lending Club is hardly cheap. The stock offers a better value than it did a few months back, but 9x forward revenues is difficult to sustain. Any hint at competitive issues will send the stock lower.LC PS Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsThe Valuation EquationThe value to using Lending Club is that it drives down the interest rate for borrowers and increases the return for investors. Traditional financial institutions have no incentive to provide better rates or returns, especially when they take on the risk. The passing of the risk to the individual investor is what allows for higher rates and the efficiency of the system strips out a lot of the costs of a traditional loan.The equation provides value to all participants, but the question is whether it will last.The biggest long-term fear with the marketplace developed by Lending Club is that the rates aren't sustainable. Eventually a platform will offer borrowers lower rates and investors higher returns.The network effect is currently a benefit in that it reduces borrowing costs. The lower interest rates attract more borrowers looking for the best rates in the industry. At the same, the investor is getting squeezed with lower interest rates. At some point, these investors might look elsewhere for higher interest rates.Considering the above factors, the improved efficiency continues to push down the interest rate spread between 36-month loans and 3-year treasuries. Since 2012, the spread is down 270 basis point to 10.1%.The company isn't seeing competition now, but any new marketplace could quickly throw off the delicate balance.TakeawayAt a stretched PS multiple, Lending Club remains a difficult to buy in the current market. The fintech has huge network effects that block competitive threats, but ultimately the market participants could shift to another platform that offers better rates. A strong brand and market size helps, but the stock isn't a buy until the downtrend is broken."
3502506,71335,2015-09-10T13:48:52-04:00,"LendingClub is attempting to disrupt the entire consumer credit market worth $3.42 Trillion.It attracts borrowers with easy access to credit at cheaper rates compared to traditional providers.Returns on LendingClub loans are at 6-7% after defaults, a good return but not enough to take over the entire market.","Despite the recent market sell-off, FANG (Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)) is still positive YTD. FB is up 16%, AMZN 67%, NFLX 103% and GOOG at 16%. They are currently evaluated using DCF models, which do not take into account the ability of technology companies to enjoy explosive growth through the introduction of new products.These companies are platforms, and when they introduce a new product, it is immediately adopted by most users who are already embedded into their ecosystem. This allows FB to push video ads, AMZN to easily grow and bundle more services into AWS, NFLX to add original programming and GOOG to introduce deep linking to Android. FANG should not be evaluated based off their current products but their value as platforms that can easily create new products.Platforms are the inevitable end product of the scalability of technology and a winner takes all market. The company which solves user problems the fastest, attracts users, which attracts more users and results in a platform. The platform then has a captive audience, which can be channeled into new products. So when evaluating a tech company, instead of doing a DCF model, investors should be asking ""Is this company going to become a platform that will take over the entire marketplace?""To reach an answer to the question, we have to first answer three questions:If the company makes its own product and is the seller, it needs to allow people to build on top of their product so that it can be customized to fit any purpose without the use of additional resources from the manufacturer.Now let's attempt to examine if LendingClub (NYSE:LC) is a company that can take over the entire marketplace. From a fundamental perspective, it's a great product because it merely connects borrowers with investors; it bears no credit risk. From the 10-K:How large is LC's total addressable market (TAM)?LendingClub's TAM is the $3.42 Trillion of outstanding consumer debt.Until 2014, LendingClub only handled P2P loans up to $35,000 for the purpose of consolidating debt, paying off credit cards and home improvement. In 2014, it acquired Springstone Financial LLC for $140 million and entered the market for financing private education and elective medical procedures. In the same year, it started offering small business loans up to $300,000 for expanding businesses, buying inventory, working capital, purchasing equipment and refinancing debt. In a 2015 interview with Forbes, LendingClub's CEO mentioned that there are plans to expand into car loans and mortgages, exposing LC to the entire consumer credit market in the US.How does LendingClub help borrowers?LendingClub can attract borrowers by providing:Accessing CreditTraditional access to credit through a bank loan:Traditional access to credit through a credit card:Accessing credit through LendingClub:Of the 3 options, LendingClub is easily the most convenient choice.Price of creditAs of 6/30/15, 70.45% of LendingClub borrowers report using their loans to refinance existing loans or pay off their credit cards. Based off this information, we can easily infer that customers have already attempted borrowing from traditional lenders and are not attracted to LendingClub for its convenience, but for its cost of credit. If LendingClub were not a cheaper alternative, borrowers would never refinance debt at a higher rate.So how is LendingClub providing cheaper access to credit? Are they merely mispricing it because they are a startup with no experience at credit analysis? The most apparent answer to the question is that LendingClub has fewer costs than the traditional bank or credit card company.The established players have to manage a large retail footprint, creating rent and employee costs which creates more opportunities for cross selling but also is a consistent cost base which cannot be scaled easily. The incumbents are also running their operations on outdated technology infrastructure, which they don't attempt to improve unless it breaks.In contrast, LendingClub has no physical locations, has a technology platform, which can easily accommodate more users with the addition of some client support staff. LC also does not have to deal with sending statements or processing transactions made at the borrower's direction; all communications occur over email and LC is automatically paid out of the client's bank account.Despite the lack of much human contact in the LendingClub process, the company is still able to build relationships with borrowers with roughly 27% of borrowers coming back to LendingClub and obtaining a second loan within four years of obtaining their first loan.For a borrower, there are few reasons to not be on LendingClub. It provides convenient and cheap access to credit, especially for borrowers with high credit ratings who can borrow for as low as 5% on LC.How does LendingClub help investors?Investors in P2P loans are only concerned about the returns they receive on their investment. Despite the interest LC has received from institutional investors, retail investors accounted for 70% of loans in Q2 2015. Institutional investors only accounted for 9% of loans last quarter. Retail investors are attracted to LendingClub because it offers 11% interest annually compared to the 1% they currently receive on CDs. There are more than 100,000 active retail accounts with an average account size of well over $15,000.Investors will continue to fund loans on the platform as long as they are sufficiently rewarded for their risk. It is difficult to determine what an acceptable rate of return would be for investors in the nascent P2P market but we can absolutely determine that investors are receiving less than double-digit returns on their LC investments. For data on actual investor returns, LendingClub is very helpful with this nifty chart:As you can see, the median return on a 2-year LendingClub portfolio is 7.3%, which is close to the 8% rate advertised in this video. The returns start as high as 13% when the portfolio is 3-6 months old. Then, the defaults start kicking in and drag down the overall ROI for the portfolio.The default rates are absurdly high at 6.5% annualized per portfolio which suggests the low cost of credit is being provided by the retail investor who is uneducated about default risk and its implications on his/her portfolio.NSR Invest has collected data on over $9 billion of LendingClub loans out of the $11 billion issued to date.The data they have collected points to an alarming trend. Even though consumer balance sheets started improving in 2010, LC default rates climbed from 5.85% in 2010 to 7.46% in 2012. While recorded default rates are lower in 2013 and 2014, it takes 9 months for 89% of a loan in default to be written off so investors can expect the default rate to rise substantially before all the loans come due. APR paid on loans has also declined from 14.8% in 2013 to 13.1% in 2015 even though the creditworthiness of borrowers has remained constant.The returns on P2P loans are dependent on the credit cycle. Returns will be higher in good times when people are employed and can easily pay off debt or refinance it. Returns will be poor when borrowers lose their jobs and lose access to credit. LendingClub technically has performance data on a period where credit dries up as it issued loans back in 2008 and 2009. However, the data is not very helpful because it only covers loans totaling $70 million, which were probably all issued to early adopters in Silicon Valley, a population not representative of the entire US.Overall, LendingClub is marginally better for loan investors, but is not the best choice for investors looking to invest in consumer credit. The APR and default rates will change as LC adds new type of loans, but LendingClub's default rate remains too high. If they can bring down defaults from 6.5% to 5% and provide 7.5% return on a pool of 12.5% loans, it will have addressed investor demands for high returns. As of now, LendingClub provides enough returns to keep investors interested - not enough to lock them into the platform forever.Will LendingClub become THE online lending platform for consumer credit?It is possible but I cannot crown them the winner yet. LendingClub is tackling a massive market with a large opportunity for disruption and it provides easy and cheap access to credit for borrowers. However, it does not offer returns high enough to keep investors from looking elsewhere. Until LendingClub resolves this problem, any of the other startups in the lending space could leapfrog them by evaluating credit from a different perspective, which leads to lower defaults and higher returns.I recommend Holding LC due to its growth potential but would not consider buying the stock unless it lowered the default rates on loans."
3520256,83756,2015-09-18T11:21:56-04:00,"Peer to peer lenders are anything but ""peer to peer"".It is a popular misconception that banks use deposits to fund loans.It is a myth that Lending Club will disrupt by dis-intermediating banks.","There is a popular narrative around ""P2P lenders"" such as Lending Club (NYSE:LC) that the business will disrupt and democratize lending by eliminating bank middlemen.At first glance this appears eminently reasonable. After all, Lending Club's business seems to be along the lines of creating a platform that matches up borrowers (demand for credit) with investors/entities with excess cash in deposits willing to supply the credit (for an appropriate price), with banks nowhere in sight.Pushing this one step further, individuals looking to invest in Lending Club (i.e., in the company's stock) often look at the approximately $3.5 trillion in outstanding consumer credit, equate this with Lending Club's total addressable market, and conclude that even if the company is able to capture a low double digit percentage of this market, then it will be hugely profitable and spell the end of conventional banking.Unfortunately (or fortunately from my perspective) this is total rubbish. The reason this narrative is complete nonsense boils down to two facts:The observant reader will notice that I subtly switched from referring to Lending Club as a ""P2P lender"" to calling it a ""platform"". The reasons for this will become clear as we proceed, but for now let me point out that although Lending Club in the title of its website calls itself the ""The Leader in Peer to Peer Lending"", the phrase ""Peer to Peer"" does not appear (not once) in the company's 10-K.The myth that banks use deposits to make loansIt is a complete misconception, which unfortunately is taught in schools, that a bank functions as a middleman who takes in deposits from savers and then allocates these appropriately to borrowers.Let me summarize how a bank really functions. This is a fascinating subject worthy of long dissertations (which have been written). But I am not going to try the reader's patience and am instead going to gloss over many of the details and present a very simplified model. The reader interested in details should see this article from the Federal Reserve and this one from the Bank of England. The latter article is extremely readable (and much recommended by the current author).In a nutshell, banks don't take in deposits and then turn around and lend them, instead they create deposits and loans simultaneously (essentially out of thin air). Or more provocatively, loans create deposits not vice versa.To avoid any misconception, it bears repeating: banks DO NOT take in deposits and then turn around and lend them. In fact, the causal relationship is the reverse of this. Banks make loans simultaneously creating new deposits in the process.Repeat after me, banks DO NOT ""collect deposits"" and then ""lend them out"". What a bank does is engage in credit money creation - emphasis on the word ""creation"". Banks are NOT intermediaries. In fact, in any closed economy (or the world as a whole) banks (and the government via deficits) essentially have a complete monopoly on deposit creation.A more accurate way to state what banks do is that they engage in deposit creation and maintain a deposit shuffling (i.e., payments) network.If this sounds counter-intuitive, I encourage you to think about the following simplified model. Treat the whole banking system in the U.S. as one bank and consider what happens on the asset and liability sides of this bank's balance sheet when it makes a loan for say $100,000 (whoosh, out of thin air a $100,000 loan appears on the asset side, offset by a $100,000 deposit on the liabilities side).Now modify the mental model and treat the banking system as consisting of two banks (A and B). Further, for simplicity assume that all money is held in the form of deposits (technical aside: deposits are the largest constituent of M2 by far, so this is not an oversimplification). Consider what happens to the bank balance sheets when say your employer pays wages and transfers money to you from their Bank A to your Bank B. On the liability side, deposits at Bank A disappear and show up in deposits at Bank B. On the assets side, deposits at the Federal Reserve are reduced for Bank A and increased for Bank B. For simplicity, this assumes that Bank A had sufficient reserves to do this (if it didn't, this would not be a problem, since they could just be borrowed from Bank B or the Federal Reserve). As an aside, notice that deposits at the Federal Reserve cannot be lent out in the form of home loans and the like.For our purposes this is far from being just an academic discussion. This all means that banks, instead of being middlemen, are actually essential in the current system.The point is that the outstanding $3.5 trillion in consumer debt is very far from being the addressable market that Lending Club could dis-intermediate banks from, since the supposed $3.5 trillion in offsetting deposits that a ""P2P"" lender like Lending Club would supposedly use to fund this demand for credit, and cut banks out of, would not exist if not for banks creating most of the deposits in the first place.Certainly, a company like Lending Club could fund future or additional credit demand by exchanging existing deposits in the system for the loans that are sold as investments on its website. This is essentially what it does (more on this later), taking an ""origination/selling"" commission in the process. However, banks can never be completely eliminated from the picture, at least not under the current monetary system.That is, banks are not middlemen. Hence, they cannot be dis-intermediated. Rather as will become clear in a moment, Lending Club plays the role of a middleman.So what exactly is Lending Club's business model?We need to understand what Lending Club actually does. Here it is from the horse's mouth (quoting from the company's 10-K; emphasis mine)Let me summarize in a nutshell. Lending Club is in effect a fancy website/vehicle for WebBank (the aforementioned issuing bank) to originate loans and quickly turn around and effectively securitize/sell them.Let me also point out that a more descriptive term for these loans that are sold to ""investors"" on Lending Club's website should perhaps be ""junk rated nothing backed securities (JRNBS)"". But that would probably not make for good marketing.Of course, Lending Club is an entity independent from WebBank and could use any issuing bank or banks (that chose to participate), but the salient fact is that Lending Club cannot perform its business without a bank.As soon as you consider the fact that Lending Club essentially charges a commission on the loans on its platform, you also realize that far from eliminating middlemen, Lending Club (and other marketplace ""lenders"") are actually intermediaries themselves. It is not an anti-bank but rather a vehicle for its issuing bank (WebBank in this case) to effectively originate and sell loans.Some parting thoughtsI want to emphasize that I am not asserting that Lending Club cannot be a profitable company and/or investment. Frictional cost/middlemen based businesses like Lending Club can be incredibly profitable. However, an investor in the company should carefully give some thought as to what the company's actual business model is and whether reality matches up with the popular narrative.Added later: The first version of this article played a bit fast and loose with the terms ""credit"" and ""money"". Appropriate edits have now been made to maintain the distinction between the two. Most of these edits can bee seen via the struck through words."
3320805,87586,2015-07-13T10:43:18-04:00,"This disruptive business model poses a threat to the traditional banking industry.The Sharing Economy: An asset-light, low-risk business model.Strong partnerships that include BancAlliance, CitiGroup, Alibaba and Google.One near term catalyst is the growth expansion in different geographies.","Introduction:Lending Club (NYSE:LC) is the world's largest online marketplace connecting borrowers and investors. They have set out to transform the banking system to make credit more affordable. Their main distinct advantage is their ability to operate at a lower cost than traditional bank lending and pass the savings on to borrowers in the form of lower rates and to investors in the form of returns. According to LC, the traditional lender [Citibank (NYSE: C), Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE: WFC)] incurs about 5-7% of operating expense as a percentage of outstanding loans vs. LC's 2%.LC has developed a disruptive business model that poses a threat to the traditional banking industry; particularly in today's low interest rate environment where savers are squeezed and the tough regulatory environment that has put pressure on the costs of the traditional banks that have had to deal with rising cost to income ratios.Business ModelLC generates revenue from transaction fees from matching borrowers with investors to enable loan originations, revenues from servicing loans and management fees for investment funds and other managed accounts. LC does not assume credit risk or use its own capital to invest in loans. For convenience sake, I have taken to using the image by LC for an easier pictorial description.Source: Lending ClubThe figure below shows the marketplace loan originations of Lending Club since the first quarter of 2011, representing a 144% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR).Source: Lending ClubAs mentioned above, LC's primary sources of revenue are fees charged for transactions on their platform, and they are split into three main categories; Transaction fees, Servicing Fees and Management Fees.Lending Club has an asset-light, low-risk business model that is typical of the companies in the new sharing economy. This allows LC to make credit available at a more competitive rate and investing more fulfilling for investors. LC has committed to staying disciplined about growth with an emphasis on high levels of risk management, which is critical in my view. I think what investors should look out for is greater clarity from management on how they intend to continue to do this.Lending Club has established strong partnerships that include BancAlliance and CitiGroup. BancAlliance is a national consortium of 200 community banks. This has allowed LC and Prosper to be the two largest P2P players in the market, accounting for over 98% of the market share, with LC accounting for 75% alone.CatalystLC's main market is their domestic market which should see future growth opportunities when they expand overseas.RisksValuations:Regular readers of my articles will know my preference for the EV/EBITDA (trailing) measure to value companies in this sector. A more detailed explanation of the valuation methodology is available in my initiation report on JD.com.Source: BloombergBased on their EV/EBITDA (TTM), LC is trading at 20.1x vs. that of the industry's 15.9x, based on the closing price on 8th July 2015. I think the premium is justified based on their first mover's advantage in the marketplace.Source: BloombergAt a Bloomberg forecasted FY15 PE of 210.9x, and FY16 PE of 76.8x based on the closing price on 8th July 2015, LC does not come cheap. But EPS growth is expected to grow by 67.5% this year, far outpacing that of the industry, at 7.3% which lends further weight to their current valuation.Conclusion:Since hitting a high of $29 during listing, LC has fallen more than 50% to $14.13 as of last market close on the 8th of July 2015. Below their IPO price of $15. I think the current price reflects investors sentiment on the risks I discussed above. In my view, the long term growth remains intact. The near term headwind however is the lock-up expiration in August. I recommend accumulating after the lock-up expiration hangover."
3529646,87586,2015-09-23T16:10:07-04:00,"LendingClub announced this month that it is now available in three more states; Indiana, Kansas, and Nebraska.I expect the company to beat its top- and bottom-line earnings estimates driven primarily by increased loan origination on its platform.Some of the underlying risks facing the industry are not represented accurately.I think valuations at 18x EV/EBITDA (trailing) - $12.25 - represent a good entry point. I maintain a ""Hold"" on post lock-up overhang.","IntroductionLendingClub (NYSE:LC) announced this month that it is now available in three more states; Indiana, Kansas, and Nebraska. I will address the third-quarter outlook for LC and also some of the challenges the company is currently facing. In my initiation report on LC about three months ago, I cautioned that the upcoming lock-up expiry in August warranted a ""Hold.""Third-Quarter Earnings OutlookLC last reported its second-quarter results on the 4th of August 2015, which saw an EPS beat of $0.01 and a revenue beat of $4.33 million, up 97.7% on a year-on-year basis. I expect the company to report third-quarter results on the 4th of November this year, with an EPS beat of $0.005 at $0.035 and top-line growth of 94.5% on a yoy basis. I maintain a ""Hold"" based on last month's lock-up expiry overhang.Regional Expansion On TrackIn my initiation report on LC, I highlighted that one catalyst for the shares will come from regional and geographical expansion moving forward. I view the company's recent expansion into the three states for its future prospects positively; that brings the total number of states LC is in to 36.One commonly cited risk for the company is the systemic risks it faces in the marketplace. This has raised fears among investors about its expansion plans moving forward. I will elaborate in detail below why such a risk is over-exaggerated.In my model for the third-quarter earnings, I expect LC to beat on earnings by $0.005 and for the top line to grow at 94.5%. The Street's consensus is for the top line to grow by 92%. In my model, I expect the growth to be driven primarily by the increased number of lenders on the company's platform. Despite earlier fears of widespread default on LC's platform, that has not happened, and more than 99% have seen positive returns.I tabulated the average implied one-day move, which is the average of the absolute percentage change in price one day after earnings for the last eight quarters, to be 7.2%. I expect an earnings beat to see prices match this range on the results announcement day.Underlying Risks Facing The Alternative Lending IndustryLC listed on the 11th of December 2014 at an IPO price of $15 before hitting a high of $29 and crashing down, and now it trades below its IPO price. This in my view is attributed to three main factors; 1) unrealistic expectations during the IPO, 2) steep valuations, and 3) concerns over systemic risks.The company listed on the 11th of December with much fanfare, jumping over 50% on its debut. Early investors of the stock were excited about the rise of the new ""sharing economy"" model of LC and its phenomenal growth in the years pre-listing. In my view, this created extremely high and unrealistic expectations for LC to meet. Investors did not account for the challenges the counter will face being in the nascent stage of its growth, and when expectations were not met, LC crashed down quite expectedly.Source: BloombergBased on its last closing price for the last three days, LC is currently trading at around 20.1x EV/EBITDA (trailing) vs. the industry's 15.3x and EV/Sales (trailing) of 11.7x vs. the industry's 8.8x, which is a much fairer valuation range now in my view. The extreme valuations that investors were paying for the counter about five months ago, at about 40x EV/EBITDA or about 230x P/E FY15, were extremely steep and hardly realistic.Last but not least, concerns over the systemic risks of LC. Certain section of commentators and analysts commenting on the alternative lending industry has drawn comparison of the alternative lending industry to the 2008 global financial crisis. In my view, this comparison is plain wrong.The global financial crisis was ignited due to investors investing in derivatives of derivatives by unknown financial institutions that were passing on their risks to other investors through such instruments. The asymmetric information in the marketplace was part of the reason for the collapse.The same cannot be said for LC. The company is in the business of facilitating lending transactions to generate revenue. The credit worthiness of the borrower is well known to lenders. Such asymmetric information cannot be said to be present in this case.The Case For LCAs I have argued above, LC is in the business of facilitating lending transactions to generate revenue. Even though it does not take on the risk of the loan repayment, it has an interest in making sure the marketplace is pushing out quality loans that have no or minimal risks of default.Ultimately, the LC platform is built based on its credibility and reliability. There is a case here for ensuring that the borrowers coming onto the platform are screened thoroughly to build trust and keep the lenders coming back. This will also help mitigate the risks of competition from alternative platforms. More on that later.ValuationsIn my initiation report on LC, I elaborated on the use of EV/EBITDA (trailing) and EV/Sales (trailing) as the best indicators to value the company. Based on its last closing price on the 22nd of September, LC is trading at 20.11x EV/EBITDA (trailing) vs. the industry's 15.3x whereas its EV/Sales (trailing) of 11.69x is also at a slight premium to the industry's 8.84x. I have also included the PEG ratio below, but I think that long-term investors may want to put a lower weight on PEG given the relatively nascent stage of LC's growth.Source: BloombergDespite a 52.8% correction of LC so far, I think the lock-up expiry overhang will continue to linger for a while. This is also an opportune time for investors to accumulate on any dips at cheaper valuations. I think an EV/EBITDA (trailing) of 18x (which is about $12.25) is a good entry point. I think the company deserves to trade at a slight premium to the industry given its strong branding in the marketplace.RisksFears that the increased competition in the industry from other players will force LC to lower its borrowing costs and returns to lenders are not completely unjustified in my view. Nonetheless, investors will have to take into account the company's strong brand name. In my view, lenders are likely to continue to seek out platforms that have a high level of credibility and reliability, and LC in my view, offers both. In my view, a new platform's ability to offer a better rate is not the sole criterion for lenders to switch.ConclusionWith much of the sell-down taking place over the last few months due to mismatched expectations, I think LC deserves another look. I think investors will need to take a long-term view of LC as the market will take time to properly understand the full potential of the innovation and disruption to the industry. With the lock-up expiration taking place just last month, I think investors can bide their time to accumulate on dips. I maintain a ""Hold"" at this point.

3249135,22148,2015-06-11T09:19:50-04:00,The initial lockup expiration of 150 million shares occurred on June 9.A larger lockup expirations occurs in August.Lending Club doesn't offer the valuation metrics needed for a stock facing the potential unloading of shares by venture funds.,"One of the most annoying events in the stock market is the lockup expiration that occurs usually six months after an IPO. This is the point at which most insiders, including large venture capital investors, are able to dump shares acquired before the company went public. The annoying part of the event is that it usually pressures the stock down despite full knowledge of all market participants of the event occurring months in advance.In the case of Lending Club (NYSE:LC), the event was as predictable as ever. In previous research (see: Lending Club: Stretched Value Mutes Strong Q1 Results, investors were warned that the stock was too expensive and that a more attractive entry point would emerge. With an expensive stock, it doesn't take much of an external event such as a lockup expiration to knock down the stock. Sure enough, Lending Club plunged only on the day to only $0.26 from the previous low of $16.17.The bounce during the day back to nearly $17 leaves some hope for a bottom, but is it enough to signal the bottom is set?Lockup DetailsThe good news is that the original lockup expiration of 150 million shares is now over. The bad news is that another 182 million shares are available from lockup in August and the venture capital firms haven't actually sold shares yet.The original lockup amount is far in excess of the 66 million shares sold in the IPO. If the venture capital and private equity firms wish to unload shares, the public markets will have to absorb a significant amount of new shares. This exact scenario is a prime reason that a lot of hot IPOs such as Lending Club tend to cool off by the time of the 180 day lockup.Typically venture funds are looking to cash out by the time companies reach the public markets. In fact, entities that sold roughly 7.7 million shares at the time of the IPO still control nearly 70 million shares. These firms are likely looking to unload more shares. Of course, the next question is what Norwest Venture Partners and Foundation Capital plan to do with the 51 million and 39 million shares they each own, respectively.These companies like Lending Club that scale to billions in value before going public are starting to realize the flip side and down side of having so many venture capital investors. Essentially, the stock gets propped up in the private markets and heading up to the IPO pricing to only spend months if not years struggling to increase the stock price with so many shares being unloaded.Valuation Still The IssueIn reality, the issue with the stock is the valuation and not the lockup expiration. If the stock wasn't trading at a lofty PS multiple, investors probably need not fear insiders dumping shares. If they did, the stock would just be cheaper for new investors.Even with Lending Club approaching the all-time lows, it still trades at roughly 11x 2016 sales. The stock still isn't cheap by any stretch of the imagination of even aggressive investors.TakeawayFor aggressive technical investors, the price action on Tuesday following the first lockup expiration hints at a double bottom. For fundamental investors, the stock still doesn't offer much of a value, especially considering the likely future dumping of a large amount of shares by venture capital funds.The market is created by investors that get to decide which side to chose. In this case, Lending Club isn't getting my investment until it gets cheaper or clarification exists on the potential unloading of shares by venture funds."

(NYSE: LC)Sell or Short Recommendation - Price Target $17.50June 9, 2015, concludes the 180-day lockup period on Lending Club. With the conclusion of the lockup period, the company's pre-IPO shareholders will have an opportunity to sell their own shares, totaling over 150 million units (a second portion of 182 million will be available following Q2 earnings in August). This potential for a sharp rise in the shares available in the secondary market could result in a dramatic decrease in the stock price.Business SummaryOnline Lending Platform that Connects Lenders and Borrowers in the Digital Peer-to-Peer Loan IndustryLaunched in 2006, Lending Club functions as an electronic intermediary that matches outside investors to individual borrowers, now known as peer-to-peer lending. Last year, the company added small business loans to its services portfolio. Non-conventional, Internet based lenders have gained in popularity for small business and personal loans, both as participants become more accustomed to the method and as traditional banks have decreased lending as a result of stricter regulations. Lending Club has also become a viable outlet for individuals unable to tap into the conventional market. Originally, the funding came primarily from individual investors who purchased the debt in $25 increments. As of 2014, 28 percent of investments came from financial institutions including banks and money managers.Recently, Lending Club announced partnerships with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). LC will provide a platform by which Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) can offer up to $600,000 in loans to smaller firms that sell Google applications that are tailored for business such as Docs and Gmail. LC also struck an exclusive arrangement with Alibaba that allows U.S. businesses to borrow up to $300,000 for bulk purchases of clothing, electronics and other items from China. Under this deal, the most credit stable borrowers will have access to funding at 0.5 percent per month. This makes the rate very competitive.According to Lending Club, it has facilitated over $9 billion in loans and paid out more than $595 in interest to lenders since 2007. More than $1 billion in loans took place in the second quarter of 2014. However, Lending Club had a net loss of $16.5 million in the first half of 2014 in sharp contrast to a profit of $1.7 million the same period for the prior year.For the entire fiscal year of 2014, loan originations were $4.375 billion versus $2.065 billion in 2013, an increase of 112%. Operating revenue reached $2.134 billion versus $98 billion in 2013, an increase of $118%, and adjusted EBITDA was $21.3 billion versus $15.2 billion in 2013, an increase of 40%.First Quarter 2015 Financial HighlightsFull release here.ManagementFacing Competition From OnDeck Capital, Kabbage, Conventional Banks, and Savings & LoansU.S. based peer-to-peer lending platforms issued loans for $889 million in 2012 and $6.6 billion in 2014. According to some estimates, the market may reach $32.8 billion by 2016. While still a small percentage of the total consumer lending industry that exceeds $3 trillion, Lending Club remains at the top of the online P2P lenders. However as the online marketplace grows, LC will continue to face competition from established companies such as OnDeck Capital and Kabbage, as well as newcomers and traditional financial institutions such as credit card issuers, banks, savings and loans, credit unions, and other consumer finance providers.LC's managers will be a strong match for increasing competition. Founder, Chairman and CEO Renaud Laplanche leads the overall strategic direction and operation of Lending Club. Prior to launching Lending Club, Mr. Laplanche founded TripleHop Technologies, which was subsequently acquired by Oracle in 2005. Prior to TripleHop Technologies, he served as a senior associate at the law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. Mr. Laplanche has an MBA from HEC and London Business School and a JD from Montpellier University.Chief Marketing and Operating Officer Scott Sanborn is responsible for advertising, the website, PR, customer support, direct marketing and managing customer-facing operations.

Since that time, the stock dropped to $18.77 on January 30, climbed to $23.76 on February 23, than dropped to a low of $16.23. Currently, Lending Club trades at $18.38 (5.26.2015).Source: Nasdaq.com.With the first chance to sell approaching for LC's major pre-IPO shareholders (including six VC and PE backers and thirteen individuals), further declines could be on the horizon.While LC's long-term prospects still show promise, the vast amount of restricted shares (~150 million), set to unlock on June 9th, could have outsized impact on LC's current share price. If even a few of these insiders choose to take some profits, LC stock could be significantly depressed.Our research shows declines of over 5% for IPO lockup expiration events in the period of days (-11, 9) days surrounding the event day (0). We suggest selling LC ahead of the event to take full advantage of potential declines."
3179656,88096,2015-05-13T13:37:55-04:00,"Lending Club is an early-stage company with an leading online loan marketplace.
        Its large addressable market and potentially high-margin business model make it unique.
        The current stock price correction is affording a trading opportunity.","Back in 2004, after the dotcom collapse had run its course, William O'Neil, the founder of Investors Business Daily (NYSEARCA:IBD), published a book entitled The Successful Investor. He covered a lot of ground in this book, and based his observations on the ability of investors to spot stock winners using his CANSLIM approach. Repeatedly, he coached readers of the necessity of stop losses to protect your portfolio, something too many investors forgot after the bubble burst. Many of you may have read this book. If not, we recommend it.In one key insight, O'Neil shared this little nugget:""Our studies of all the best stocks of the last 50 years show that the period of greatest market performance lasts on average only about a year and a half to two years. Some last up to three years. Only a tiny number last for 5 or 10 years.""We are all aware of these types of fast-performing stocks. Netflix, Green Mountain Coffee, Chipotle Mexican, Tesla Motors and Palo Alto Networks come to mind in today's market. These stocks are in the midst (or at the tail ends) of their periods of maximum return. If you traded early into these stocks, your portfolio has done very well.But how do you find these types of stocks in today's market before they make their big moves? To us, the best way to do this is to cull the list of stocks that have IPO'd in the last 12 months. This may sound like a monumental task, but in reality, your screen is usually no more than 200 names in any one year. In active markets like today's, IPO issuance can reach 30-40 stocks per month. Additionally, companies which display truly strong growth potential are actually very scarce.Why screen for post-IPO stocks? The simple answer is supply and demand. There are thousands and thousands of funds in the markets. They invest in accordance of all sorts of strategies and focuses. But in the end, they are all in the hunt for the fastest growing companies, the ones that are innovating the most, and the ones with the most scalable business models.Sometimes these types of companies trade like rockets right after the IPO. Sometimes they don't (i.e. Facebook). But if growth is real, and profits are present or imminent, the demand for the stock will appear. Institutional buying will accelerate, and you'll see this best reflected in the rise of average daily trading volumes.In reviewing our list of IPOs over the last six months, one company that displays one of the highest potential growth profiles is Lending Club (NYSE:LC).Lending Club IPO'd on Dec 10, 2014 at $15 per share. Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs were among its offering managers. After spiking to a peak of $29.29 intraday on Dec 18, 2014, the stock entered a big correction, in which it is still trading as of this writing. In the parlance of Investors Business Daily readers, the stock has corrected its initial post-IPO surge with a double-bottom base. This base formation is not yet complete.Admittedly, on a traditional valuation basis the stock is over-priced. Consensus EPS estimates for calendar year 2015 are at a mere $0.06. 2015 revenues are expected to reach $390 million. At $16.75, the stock PE on 2015 estimates is 260x. With an enterprise value of $8.5 billion, the stock is priced at 22x sales. Not a value investor's idea of a bargain.However, given the company's business model, and its huge addressable market, there exists enormous upside to this stock.For one, Lending Club is operating in a loan market estimated to be $240 billion in size (per Heath Terry, the company's analyst at Goldman Sachs). This is the credit card consolidation market, where borrowers seek to convert their revolving consumer debt into term loans. With $6 billion in total loans originated to date, Lending Club has achieved a 1.6% share in this market (again, per Goldman Sachs estimates).When a borrower applies for a loan via the Lending Club platform, he/she agrees to pay an upfront transaction fee of 4.5%, on average. Interest rates offered through the Lending Club site average around 14.8%, appreciably lower than the 21.6% APR offered by most credit cards. These interest savings have driven the company's loan growth.What's more, investors who supply the capital for Lending Club's loans are able to capture interest rates of 8.6% on average, appreciably higher than Treasury or Corporate or Municipal rates in today's Fed-suppressed environment.The combination of these two offerings, lower interest rates for borrowers and higher interest rates for investors, gives Lending Club a unique position in today's financial world. Couple this with its marketplace model, whereby the company takes no credit risk itself while enjoying the network effects inherent in all online businesses, and you have the ingredients for fast growth at high margins.A few years ago, when Lending Club was still private, 100% of the investors who used the marketplace were self-directed individuals. Today, the majority of investors are institutional funds and small banks. In a yield hungry world, institutions are more than eager to find 8.6% interest rates available to them through Lending Club, especially if they are able to tap into a large number of high FICO borrowers (Lending Club's borrowers to date average FICO scores above 700) in order to diversify credit risk. Lending Club does the heavy lifting for them. The company declines 90% of all online loan applications. For those who are approved, the borrower is able to access his/her funds in less than a week.As Lending Club's marketplace grows in traffic and begins to scale, its share within the credit card consolidation market will expand, from 1.6% today to near 5.0%. If it does, it will be able to triple its loan originations, tripling its topline and growing operating income by some factor in excess of 3 times.If we use a Discounted Cash Flow model to this estimation, we can use topline growth estimates of 87% year over year for 2015, and gradually decrease this growth to 60% YOY in 2016 and 50% YOY in 2017. This would put the company's revenues at $938 million in 2017, which are not far from average Street estimates per Bloomberg. See the figure below:As you can see, we are modeling SG&A expenses as percent of revenues to decline from 100% in 2015 to 75% in 2016 and then 50% in 2017. Other expenses, which include engineering and support, are projected to be 50% of revenues in 2015, and then declining to 48% in 2016 and 46% in 2017.This model results in positive operating income in 2017, at $38 million, a 4% operating margin.Past 2017, the company's business model scales quickly, and operating margins expand as the topline grows, reaching 32% in 2010 (per our model) and 48% in 2024 (10 years out). In the tenth year of our model, we are projecting revenues at $4.2 billion and free cash flow at $1.3 billion.Discounting our model's free cash flows at a WACC of 7.4% (per Bloomberg's current calculation using a stock Beta of 1.00) and a terminal growth rate of 3.0%, we arrive at an Intrinsic Value per share of $44.50. This implies 117% upside potential from the current quote.Downside risks to our model include:· the threat of increased competition (Goldman Sachs announced the launch of its own loan marketplace this week)· the threat of increased regulation· the lack of investor capital· the lack of borrower demand· the threat to the security of its online platform· the threat of compressed interest rate spreadsUpside risks to our model include:· the launch by the company of offerings for the student loan market (estimated to be $280 billion)· the launch by the company of offerings for the small business loan market (the company has just entered this market through new partnerships with Google and Alibaba. Addressable market estimated to be $290 billion)· the launch by the company of offerings in the home equity loan market (estimated to be $521 billion)The attractiveness of the Lending Club business model, which offers the combination of a huge addressable market and high operating margins has not gone unnoticed.Since the IPO, the number of institutional holders in Lending Club stock has increased from 8 on December 31, 2014 (just weeks after the IPO) to 202 as of May 8, 2015, per Bloomberg.On the other hand, short interest has risen from less than 10 million shares on Dec 31, 2014 to 29 million shares on April 30, 2015, equating to 13.8% of the float.Clearly, the company's sky-high valuation levels (when compared to current year estimates) have attracted selling pressure among existing stockholders and long-short hedge funds. But the business model's high growth rate and prospective margins puts short sellers at great risk. Discounting this company's potential growth out to 2024 indicates a much higher Intrinsic Value than Street estimates.Consider the company's Board of Directors. Among its members include John Mack (former CEO of Morgan Stanley) Larry Summers (former US Secretary of the Treasury) and Mary Meeker (currently of Kleiner Perkins and a widely regarded Internet analyst-thinker). This is a blue-chip board, with a wealth of experience in finance, government and technology.To conclude, if you were to screen the market for the most promising stocks which have IPO'd in the last twelve months, you would have to put Lending Club on your top watchlist. While its recent trading performance is disappointing, it is giving investors the time to digest its prospects and plan for an appropriate entry price. The odds of a big 1.5-to-3-year run in Lending Club stock is very high, putting it in the company of other high growth stocks in market history, per O'Neil's great insight.An IBD trader would be a buyer of Lending Club if it rebounded and eclipsed $24.50 on strong trading volumes (the double-bottom base buy point). A more speculative trader would look for an upside reversal day on heavy volume.Keep this one on your watchlist. If our DCF model is remotely accurate, the upside leverage in Lending Club's business will begin to bear fruit in 2017. Sometime between now and early 2016, the market will begin to anticipate this inflection point, and the stock is likely to embark on the sort of run that Tesla experienced between 2Q13 and 3Q14 when its stock returned a whopping 660% as its business began to scale. And Lending Club's model features the promise of much higher margins than Tesla.Lending Club is a potential Growth Stock Leader."
2949686,22148,2015-02-26T13:15:37-05:00,Lending Club reported Q414 earnings that beat analyst estimates.The stock is trading down due to inline guidance for 2015 and limited discussion on growth from partnerships with Google and Alibaba.The stock turns attractive if it drops to approximately $15.,"After the close yesterday, Lending Club (NYSE:LC) reported strong quarterly numbers with key figures growing over 100%. The FinTech company that only went public back in December trades at a lofty valuation, hence the stock slumped despite the good quarter. Is this really just the case of investors expecting too much out of a company?Inline 2015 GuidanceBased on the numbers highlighted here, Lending Club is down due to guidance that was only inline with expectations. Sure the 108% revenue growth for Q4 was solid, but the online lending platform didn't guide above analyst estimates for revenue of $375 million for 2015.Even if Lending Club is low-balling 2015 guidance, one can easily argue that actually hitting $400 million in revenue will hardly justify a market valuation of $8.5 billion. As the previous research showcased (see Lending Club: Unattractive Valuation Persists Despite New Partnerships), even the hottest social media stocks in the market trade at multiples of around 10x revenue. It's rare to trade at around 20x revenue and even more difficult to make an investment work at those levels.Partnerships Disappoint For NowA lot of the selloff is related to the announced partnerships with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) possibly not paying off to the extent expected by investors that snapped the stock up below $20. Clearly the expectation was that those recently announced partnerships would juice revenue this year.On the earnings call, the CEO said these partnerships help grow the small business online marketplace. As previous research indicated, Google and Alibaba would need to finance a substantial amount of loans on the Lending Club platform to justify the current price. With the platform originating $1.4 billion in loans for the quarter, Google needs to hit $140 million in quarterly loans to push revenue up 10%. The good news from the call is that the contribution margin for these loans will approximate other loans. A lower referral fee is offset by lower acquisition costs to equal a normal margin.Another unknown is how much analysts had already factored in small business partnerships to the forecasts for Lending Club to grow revenue nearly 80% in 2015.Since the revenue contributions from these partnerships is largely unknown, it is probably wise for management to guide to the known and not the expectations. It suggests some upside to the $375 million revenue guidance for the year.TakeawayUltimately one has to wonder what investors expected buying the stock at a ridiculously high PS multiple prior to the earnings release. Even a guide up to $400 million in revenue for 2015 doesn't justify a valuation over $8.5 billion or even the current valuation around $7.2 billion. On top of that, investors need to consider what it takes to justify the valuation hitting $10.0 billion to make the risk worth investing. Even if the partnerships work out in a material way, it takes time to implement something big.Now isn't the time to abandon following Lending Club. Rather investors should patiently wait for a better entry point. The company originated $4.4 billion in loans during 2014 and now projects a market opportunity approaching $1 trillion. The platform and company remain very compelling even if the stock doesn't at the current levels. A dip to $15 would get us interested in buying Lending Club for the long-term growth potential."
2883546,22148,2015-02-05T12:35:39-05:00,Signing up a couple of big tech partners is exciting on the surface.The partnerships with Google and Alibaba have questionable value until more details are released on the expected loan facilitations and related fees.The valuation multiple for Lending Club remains too stretched to generate a decent return for investors.,"The recent partnerships with tech giants Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) add to the value proposition for Lending Club (NYSE:LC), but the online marketplace that connects borrowers with lenders still appears grossly overvalued. Until some numbers are released, it isn't clear how many businesses will utilize this service. Not to mention that a huge red flag exists considering these partnership deals don't provide the same network effects of the typical loan on the Lending Club platform.The valuation of the platform remains a major deal breaker for most investors with Lending Club still worth more than $7 billion even after the post IPO selloff. The stock trades at roughly 20x the expected 2015 revenues of $375 million. Can these two partnerships produce enough revenue to justify reaching a 10x revenue multiple? Is the stock even a buy if these partnerships lead to a doubling of revenue?Valuable Partnerships?The partnerships with Google and Alibaba appear extremely beneficial to Lending Club on the surface, but the key is always in the proof via the results. Unfortunately, both deals were announced in early 2015 making any results likely not visible until Q2 at the earliest.The main excitement over the deals are the loan values that exceed the current $35,000 maximum loans for an individual and $100,000 for a small business on the Lending Club platform. Larger loans in theory equals more fees. The details for the two partnerships are summarized below:Google - The program allows Google to purchase low-interest loans for eligible partners using the highly automated platform and loan servicing of Lending Club. The Google for Work network has 10,000 partners and the pilot program is available to U.S. partners to obtain a two-year loan of up to $600,000.Alibaba - The program makes Lending Club the exclusive solution provider for the point of sale business financing platform for U.S. business buyers to finance up to $300,000. The deal allows the U.S. companies to obtain the working capital they need when purchasing goods from China-based suppliers on the Alibaba website. Reportedly, the small business only requires five minutes to apply for the working capital loan and it offers monthly fixed interest rates starting at 0.5%.Both partnerships heavily mention low-interest rates and no fees questioning the value to Lending Club. Not to mention both rely on the partner to fund the loans reducing the network effect and turning the reliance of the program strictly to the partner agreeing to remain active. What keeps either Google or Alibaba from setting up an internal platform in a couple of years?The partnerships have to meaningfully add to the nearly $1.2 billion in loans facilitated by Lending Club during Q3 to make the deals material. If one assumes $120 million in loans for each partner on a quarterly basis, total loan facilitations increase by 20%. Of course, one has to assume that both Google and Alibaba are now on the hook for nearly $500 million in annual loans via the Lending Club platform. For Google to reach that level, it will require 2,000 partners to average facilitated loans of $250,000 on an annualized basis. At the same time, while it's a 20% increase in loans, the amount of revenue earned by Lending Club is likely substantially below that of the other loans on the platform.Comparable ValuationsInvestors are rightfully excited about the online marketplace and the potential disruptive value of the platform that Lending Club has created. It doesn't though change the basic economic equation of an ideal valuation to pay for a stock. Considering Lending Club trades at roughly double the valuations of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) one has to question whether capital will be treated well in this stock.LC PS Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsThe online platform probably compares most closely to Zillow that offers a place for buyers and sellers to connect over real estate services. While Zillow relies on ad revenue from real estate agents, Lending Club collects fees for actually facilitating loans. It is difficult to suggest that each dollar of revenue generated by Lending Club is worth double that of Zillow.TakeawayNo matter how disruptive the Lending Club platform becomes, investors don't typically see decent investment returns on stocks trading at over 20x revenue estimates. In order to invest in Lending Club at the current valuation one has to assume the multiple jumps to 25x revenue in order to generate a 25% gain. At the same time, the stock would drop 50% in order to reach a more normal valuation of 10x revenue.The risk/reward situation doesn't favor investing in Lending Club at the current valuation no matter how great the Google and Alibaba partnerships turn out in the long run."
3149796,22148,2015-05-07T18:06:04-04:00,"Lending Club has reported strong Q1'15 earnings.Despite raised guidance, the stock trades at valuations that are still stretched.Investors should continue looking for a better entry point.","As expected, Lending Club (NYSE:LC) produced enormous growth in Q1 that exceeded analyst expectations. Even after this growth, the issue still remains that the stock is restricted from heading higher due to the rich valuation that now sits close to $7 billion.As predicted in previous research (see: Lending Club: What Did Investors Expect?) after the last earnings report, Lending Club faces an uphill battle to push the stock higher. The recent problems with Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) highlight the issue of paying up for a fast-growing stock. Similar to Lending Club now, Twitter was once growing revenue at over 100% and trading at multiples of revenue in excess of 10x. The latter now trades at stock prices similar to the initial IPO trading range over 15 months ago.Is Lending Club headed for the same fate 15 months after the IPO?Solid Q1 ResultsLending Club continues to improve revenue yields, leading to part of the big revenue beat in Q1. It is seeing those yields continuously increase, and reached 4.96% during the quarter. The number was the highest in history, and is a slight bump from the 4.89% in the prior-year Q1.For the quarter, Lending Club easily beat revenue estimates and slid past the EPS forecasts by a penny. Even despite the 109.3% revenue growth, the company only forecasts revenue of up to $392 million for the year. As the previous research suggested, even if Lending Club increases revenue estimates to $400 million for 2015, the stock is still expensive at a valuation approaching $7 billion. At a revenue estimate of $600 million in 2016, the stock trades at over 11x those forward numbers. Lending Club actually makes Twitter appear rather cheap.LC PS Ratio (Forward 1-year) data by YChartsAt the end of the day, price matters - and the above chart sill places Lending Club at a stretched valuation.Long-Term MarginsWhile investors focus on the potential size of the marketplace for online loans, the real benefit is the ability to originate and service loans at a low cost. Lending Club is currently spending roughly 2.6% of originations on these costs over the last year.Source: Lending Club Q1 presentationThe company forecasts these costs eventually dropping down to 2%, providing a significant advantage over traditional lenders.Naturally, the flip side of the equation is that Lending Club is currently spending over $12 million per quarter on engineering and product development. At 15% of revenue, the platform will need to reach a higher level of scale, in order to produce the big profits on the bottom line.TakeawayThe market liked the Q1 results, sending Lending Club up roughly 5% in mid-morning trading. The stock, though, isn't getting a bigger lift on revenue - smashing estimates by over $5 million is a sure sign of the stretched valuation. Investors are most likely leery of paying up for the stock after predicament of Twitter - that only last year was generating 100% revenue growth, and now sees the stock trading at its lows.Investors should keep an eye on Lending Club for a more attractive entry point."
2878596,61281,2015-02-03T12:00:33-05:00,"Lending Club, a peer-to-peer lending platform, is trading almost 20% below its day-1 close price.Many reasons are given for the stock's weakness, but most of them ignore the huge potential of Lending Club’s business.Two new strategic alliances with Google and Alibaba are a step towards unlocking Lending Club’s great potential.","Only two months after the successful debut of this peer-to-peer lending marketplace, Lending Club (NYSE:LC) shares are trading at 20% below the closing price of its first day of trading, December 11, 2014. Many explanations were offered as possible drivers of the crash: a lack of business horizon and strategic objectives, excessive risk, and even concerns that traditional investment banks would never support Lending Club's disruptive business. Investors who bought the company's shares on the first day of trading were quick to sell as skepticism mounted over the company's ability to keep growing and fears of overvaluation increased. However, many investors just fail to see the huge potential of the peer-to-peer lending market and the many business applications it may have.Here is a quick recap on Lending Club for those who are not familiar with the company. Lending Club operates a marketplace where individuals and small businesses can borrow or loan money directly to each other. Lending Club connects the two ends of a loan (borrower and lender) and cuts an intermediate fee from the monthly returns. Individuals can borrow between $1K and $35K on Lending Club, and small businesses can borrow between $15K and $100K. The purpose of most loans on Lending Club is refinancing or paying off credit card debt.The simplicity behind Lending Club is also its biggest strength that the company uses in order to penetrate new markets and develop new revenue streams. In mid-January, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Lending Club announced a new pilot program that will allow Google for Work partners to have an easy access to credit. The financing terms in this new program allow borrowers to receive a two-year loan for up to $600K with a one-year grace period on interest payments. Google, which acquired a stake in Lending Club in May 2013, will use the new program to boost its Google for Work initiative by offering low interest loans to its eligible partners in order to use the cash to further invest in developing, distrusting, and selling Google's enterprise software suite. On the other side of the program, Lending Club will enjoy an inflow of larger loans than the average loans it used to deal with accompanied by larger returns and larger fees. As Google has around 10,000 partners in its Google for Work initiative, this will be a substantial growth opportunity for Lending Club. If the pilot with Google succeeds, this may open the door for additional technology companies to copy the model as a way to boost their resellers and partners' business success and benefit from it.Yesterday, Lending Club announced another strategic alliance that will drive a large number of higher loans to the platform. Lending Club and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) launched a venture where Alibaba will offer U.S. small businesses quick and easy low-interest credit by Lending Club to be used to purchase wholesale goods from the Chinese eCommerce giant. With this move, Alibaba tries to lure U.S. importers to use their platforms to order wholesale inventory from mainland China and offers loans of up to $300K using Lending Club. With this partnership, Alibaba will appear as an attractive alternative to import goods from China, and the Chinese giant will be able to penetrate the U.S. market. Lending Club will benefit from an additional revenue stream of larger loans similar to the Google initiative mentioned above. However, in Google's case, the number of potential customers is 10,000 maximum, while in Alibaba's case, it's millions of U.S. small businesses that may use the attractive credit line to finance their imports.SummaryThese two examples of partnerships with Google and Alibaba are the kind of strategic alliances that could drive higher revenues for Lending Club and may signal the new path Lending Club is taking. If these two programs are successful, they may drive additional partnerships that will enable Lending Club to unlock the great potential of its easy and quick peer-to-peer lending business model. In the long term, similar partnerships will generate substantial additional revenues and will drive stock price appreciation."
2913556,61281,2015-02-12T18:15:38-05:00,"Lending Club increases the number of loans issued each quarter and the amount lent through its platform.The company's revenues have grown more than 100% each year and 24% each quarter.Lending Club is expected to continue its growth in the following years, presenting an impressive upside for investors.","Lending Club (NYSE:LC) is a FinTech business based on small personal and business loans at relatively low interest rates in a peer-to-peer (P2P) model. Since its inception, Lending Club has issued more than 470,000 loans worth more than $6.2B that are used primarily to refinance existing loans or pay off credit card loans. As shown in Chart 1 below, the number of loans issued by the company has increased at a quarterly rate of 55%, and the amount lent has increased at a 64% quarterly rate.The rapid increase in loans issued is translated directly to a rise in revenues. As Lending Club is not a lender, but a platform to connect borrowers and lenders in a peer-to-peer lending mechanism, it does not benefit from high interest rates on its loans. The company prefers lower interest rates that will attract more borrowers to its platform and generate more loans that are relatively easier to return. Lower interest rates also attract lenders who prefer to lend money in loans that have a good chance to be paid in full.Lending Club generates revenues from fees charged to the borrowers and lenders. Borrowers are charged a 1.11% to 5% origination fee that is subtracted from the loan proceeds. If a payment is rejected by the borrower's bank or late beyond 15 days, additional fees apply. Lenders are charged a servicing fee of 1% for every payment made in every loan. In the case of delinquent loans, LC seeks standard legal practices to retrieve the funds and charge some of the recovered amounts as a collection fee. This fee ranges between 18% and 30% and is deducted from any amount recovered. Accredited investors and qualified purchasers can invest in limited partner interests in investment funds. For these management services, Lending Club charges these investors with a management fee ranging between 0.7% and 1.2%.Origination Fee As A Growth EngineOrigination fees are the vast majority of Lending Club's revenues, and in Q3'14, accounted for more than 90% of the company's revenues. Servicing fees generate around 5% of the revenues, with the rest split between management fees and other revenues generated from sales of whole loans. As most of the revenues are driven by origination fees, there is a direct positive correlation between the total amount of new loans issued and Lending Club's revenues. Hence, as the company issues more loans in bigger amounts, origination fee revenues will grow, driving total revenue up. However, Lending Club could increase its revenue beyond the growth rate of the total number issued through issuing more lower-grade loans that could increase the average origination fee. As shown in Chart 2 below, the origination fee for loans graded C to G is 5% for both the 36-month loans and the 60-month loans. In 2014, these classes accounted for 60% of loans issued through Lending Club, which brought the average origination fee to 4.61%, growing three years in a row.The origination fee for loans graded between C and G is 5% (for both 36- and 60-month loans), which accounted for 60% of the loans issued in 2014. This is a five percentage point increase from 2013 and a ten percentage point increase from 2012. The company is increasing origination fees, not only by simply increasing the total amount issued, but also through increasing the average origination fee driven by the loans' grade mix.Even though increased average origination fees can grow revenues beyond the growth rate of the total amount issued, the company should balance the risk associated with lower-graded loans with the need to increase loans in these grades. To drive more lower-grade loans while balancing the risk associated with these loans, Lending Club presents in its website the ""benefits of diversification,"" suggesting investors to invest in a significant number of loans from different borrowers and loan grades. This suggestion and explanation associated with it is targeted to help lenders reduce their risk and shift funds to lower grades in an attempt to diversify their investment and secure their monthly returns.Strategic Alliances To Expand GrowthIn an earlier article about Lending Club, I presented the company's strategic alliances with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) as a step in the right direction toward unlocking its high potential. Currently, the company can present an impressive 24% quarterly top line growth based mainly on individuals and small businesses lending and borrowing relatively small amounts. Partnerships with these two tech giants allow Lending Club to expand its loans beyond the amounts it currently offers and enable a large, new audience to use the service. In Google's case, there are 10,000 potential new clients for using Lending Club to borrow larger-than-usual amounts, and in Alibaba's case, there are millions of small businesses in the US that could potentially use Lending Club as a line of credit to import goods from China. This move opens Lending Club to larger loans that can potentially generate a new revenue stream that can support the company's growth in the following years.Price And ValuationLending Club is currently traded below its first-day close price and has received several negative coverage reports by leading research firms. In my humble opinion, that may not be purely related to the company's business, but to the bigger FinTech industry that intimidates traditional investment firms.Lending Club's revenues increase at a quarterly growth rate of 24% and at an annual rate of more than 100%. As every growth company, the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year growth rates are getting smaller as the company evolves and becomes more mature. In the company's case, analysts' consensus estimates that the company will report $209M revenues in 2014 and $375M in 2015. These figures reflected a 114% year-over-year growth in 2014, with 2014 to end with $209M revenues that reflect an incredible 114% year-over-year growth in 2014 and 78% in 2015. These incredible growth rates are not to be ignored.In my calculations that are based on historical growth trends and conservative loan growth pace, I estimate 2014 to end with $211M +/- 5% and 2015 to end with $400M +/- 5%. These figures reflect a stock price of $27 in 2015, that will grow up to $50 in 2016, based on a P/S ratio of 40. Taking into account that revenue figures for 2015 are highly inaccurate right now, using the lower number from the analysts' estimates for 2015 reflects a share price of $48 at the end of the year.These figures might seem irrational or unrealistic at this point, but a cold look at Lending Club's growth story shows a very optimistic upside for the lending marketplace.ConclusionLending Club presents an impressive growth in the number of loans issued and the amount of loans issued throughout the years, with a quarterly growth rate of 55% and 64% (respectively). These growth rates have a direct positive impact on revenues through the origination fee that drives the company's revenues up at a quarterly rate of 24% and at an annual rate higher than 100%. A continuing increase in average origination fees will drive revenues higher, beyond the increase it could only achieve by increasing the number and amount of loans. A partnership with techs Google and Alibaba could turn the number of new loans and amounts issued much higher, generating an additional revenue stream for the company and supporting its growth in 2015. The possible upside in stock prices, together with the company's substantial growth, makes Lending Club a buy."
3383385,91855,2015-07-31T14:31:28-04:00,"Lending Club publicly exposes around one-third of business revenue.Analysis of publicly exposed origination data indicates solid quarterly revenues.Best estimate: $91.3m to $95.4m in revenue, in-line to above management guidance ($90m - $92m).","Lending Club (LC) publicly reports data that can be used to track one-third of its revenue on a weekly basis. Lending Club, like many publicly traded Internet companies, exposes a material amount of its business activity via its website. For those who possess tech/coding skills (or have a ton of free time), this data can be gathered, quantified and analyzed to enable one to effectively track a portion of Lending Club's business activity (i.e. loan originations and the resultant revenue) in near real time. Said another way, Lending Club provides data that can enable an investor to know how their business performed during a quarter before they report their quarterly earnings.Relative to most publicly traded Internet companies however, Lending Club is a bit unique in that it's legally required to report their business data publicly (although the vast majority of investors in Lending Club's stock, including many professionals on Wall Street, aren't aware that it happens). For a bit of background info, let's quickly review the three types of loans that Lending Club originates:Fractional loan volumes are publicly reported. When Lending Club allocates a loan to its fractional marketplace, investors participate by buying a security. Each security potentially for sale must be registered with the SEC, meaning every loan that's allocated to the fractional marketplace is publicly on file. That alone provides a solid amount of insight into Lending Club's business (if you have the tech skills to code a program that analyzes/quantifies the data), but a material portion of the loans originally listed don't transact. Fortunately, Lending Club takes their fractional loan reporting a step further by publicly listing, each week, every fractional loan that fully transacted in a sales report. You can find/access any historical sales report here.Analyzing 2Q15 fractional loan data. From April 1 through June 30, the data indicates that Lending Club originated 42,543 loans for a total of $620.8 million in principal, generating $29.4 million in origination fees. Relative to prior quarters, the average loan size ($14,592) and the average origination fee (4.74%) are largely in-line with past data. An interesting data point is that fractional loan originated principal of $620.8 million is down from 1Q15 of $634.7 million, the first time it has ever declined quarter-over-quarter. More details and thoughts on that below.(Source: TradeTheQuarter)How this data informs a 2Q revenue estimate. Between 89% and 91% of Lending Club's total revenue is derived from origination fees. Of origination fees, custom loans tend to provide around 21.5% to 23.0% of total fees. The remaining origination fees (77% to 78.5%) come from fractional and whole standard loans - there has been some volatility here historically:With these parameters, the math one should use to attempt to ""back into"" 2Q15 revenues based on the calculated fractional loan data is detailed in the table below.(Source: TradeTheQuarter)Final thoughts. Custom loans as a percent of total loans are likely to be relatively flat in my opinion (estimated around 21% - 21.5% of loan originations). Non-origination fee revenues have gradually been growing as a percent of the revenue mix over time (as they should) - they will probably be 11.0% - 11.5% of total revenue.The key variable here, in my opinion, is the mix of standard loans between fractional and whole. I'm working on a new data tool that may be able to gather whole loan sales data (check in with me next quarter), but until then, it needs to be estimated. In my view, fractional origination dollars declining quarter-on-quarter makes a bit of sense because fractional was 49% of all standard loans in Q1, way above the prior three quarters average of around 42%.My personal estimate (but please use your own) is 44% - 46%, which would generate 2Q15 revenue (""operating revenue"" in Lending Club reports) of $91.3 million to $95.4 million, in-line and above management guidance of $90 million to $92 million.Note: I have exceedingly high confidence in the fractional origination revenue estimate being right. These other three-point estimates solving into a total revenue estimate are the typical ""analysts best guess based on knowing the stock/company well"" (i.e. have a bit more variability)."
2826106,80015,2015-01-17T09:08:27-05:00,"P2P Marketplace is still in the infant stage, and the total addressable market size is ~$500B for consume loans, plus $200B for small business loans.Proprietary Risk Algorithms /Big Data are LendingClub Core Asset. They are a technology company instead of a financial institution.The target price for LendingClub is $41, offering almost 100% upside.","LendingClub (NYSE:LC) is the world's largest online marketplace connecting borrowers and investors. LC's marketplace has facilitated over $6 billion in loan originations since it first launched in 2007. LendingClub's online marketplace is designed to provide a more efficient mechanism to allocate capital between borrowers and investors than the traditional banking system. Consumers and small business owners borrow through LendingClub to lower the cost of their credit and enjoy a better experience than traditional bank lending. The marriage of technology and financing is transforming the banking system to make credit more affordable and investing more rewarding.According to LendingClub's recent statistics, on average, the borrowing rate is 14.8%, charged off rate: 4.1%, LC service fee: 1% and investors net annualized return is 9.12%. LC has been doing a great job to cut the middleman/banks and delivering values for both borrowers and investors.Part 1: Addressable Market AnalysisIn the U.S., the total credit card loan balance was $680B as of the end of Q3 2014 according to Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Ironically, credit cards are charging 17-20% interest rate, while the saving account only earns less than 1%. This gap makes the P2P lending more appealing. P2P lending can cut the middleman by matching borrowers and lenders directly. A bank can be summarized as a combination of operations and capital. Operations are performed through thousands of branches staffed by tens of thousands of employees, while capital comes from deposits and borrowed money. When a bank takes deposits and then later extends a loan using those deposits, it acts as an intermediary. An online marketplace directly and simultaneously accessible to both borrowers and investors essentially cuts out the middleman and lowers intermediation costs. Based on LendingClub's statistics, 83.17% of their borrowers report using their loans to refinance existing loans or pay off their credit cards as of September 30 2014.Consumer Loan Market and DelinquencyAt the end of Q3 2014, there were $11.71 trillion consumer loans in the U.S., including ~$3.5 trillion non-housing debt balance. Among all non-housing debt, auto loans, student loans and credit card loans are the major components.According to Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as of September 30 2014, 6.3 percent of outstanding consumer debt was in some stage of delinquency, compared with 6.2 percent in 2014 Q2. About $732 billion of debt is delinquent, with $507 billion seriously delinquent (90+days behind payment). LendingClub's addressable market size for consumer loans is ~half trillion!The chart below shows the percentage of balance 90+ days delinquent breakdown by consumer loan type. Particularly, student loan and credit card loan have been consistently high in the past decade.Part 2: LendingClub's Business ModelBefore diving into my investment thesis, it is important to understand LendingClub's business model and how they match borrowers and investors.LendingClub Loan Issuance MechanismSource: the graph was built based on LC IPO ProspectusStep 1: Borrower Loan ApplicationStep 2: Investor Commitment for the LoanStep 3: Issuing Bank FundingStep 4: Loan PurchaseBenefits to Related PartiesBenefits to Borrowers: LC is offering borrowers interest rates that are generally lower on average than the rates charged by traditional banks on credit cards or installment loans. According to LC's survey, the interest rate on the loan borrowers received through LC marketplace was on average 680 basis points lower than the rate on their outstanding debt or credit card balances, representing a 32% savings.On top of the cost savings, all of the installment loans offered through LC's marketplace feature a fixed rate that is clearly disclosed to the borrower during the application process, with fixed monthly payments, no hidden fees and the ability to prepay the balance at any time without penalty. In addition, LC's online application can make the whole process very fast and evaluate loan options without impacting borrower's credit score.According to LC's recent statistics, as of Q3 2014, the average 36-month and 60-month loan I/R were 12.07% and 16.92%, respectively. The overall term interest rate was 14.09% that was much lower than the credit card interest charge.Benefits to Individual Investors: Traditionally, investors can only invest fixed income, equities and bank saving products. With LC marketplace, investors can invest in personal loans originated through LC standard program. Additionally, qualified investors can invest in loans originated through LC custom program, including small business loans, in private transactions. These asset classes have historically been entirely funded and held by financial institutions or large institutional investors on a limited basis.Furthermore, investors can earn attractive risk-adjusted returns, and the investment is very transparent, meaning investors can choose the loans by themselves based on their risk appetites. Also the website is easy-to-use and if investor don't want to choose individual loans, they can enroll in automated investing, a free service that automatically invests any available cash in loans according to investor-specified criteria and allocation targets.The chart below indicates that investors can earn 4.68%-8.32% net annualized interest rate on average which is much higher than the current deposit rate.Benefits to Issuing Banks: Currently, LC is using WebBank as their issuing bank. Under the terms of the loan account program agreement, LC pay WebBank a monthly service fee based on the amount of loans issued by WebBank and purchased by LC or partners in each month, subject to a minimum monthly fee. WebBank also retains ownership of all loans for two business days and earns any interest received on the loans during that time. WebBank pays LC a transaction fee for LC marketplace's role in processing loan applications on WebBank's behalf. LC also have a non-exclusive arrangement with Cross River Bank, another issuing bank, to date Cross River Bank has not originated any loans through LC's platform.Benefits to Institutional Investors (Banks, Trusts or Hedge Funds): Certain institutional investors, such as banks, seek to hold the actual loan on their balance sheet. To meet this need, LC sells entire standard or custom program loans to these investors. In connection with these sales, the investor owns all right, title and interest in each loan. As disclosed in the IPO prospectus, the investor also has access to the underlying borrower information, but is prohibited from contacting or marketing to the borrower in any manner and agrees to hold such borrower information in compliance with all applicable privacy laws. LC continues to service these loans after they are sold.For these institutional investors, LC is acting as an additional distribution channel for the consumer loan products with a much lower operating expense. In the future, I expect more community/regional banks will use LC platform and technology to acquire consumer loans. For instance, in June 2013, two of the nation's community banks, Titan Bank and Congressional Bank, are starting to buy loans through the Lending Club platform. Titan Bank will also offer personal loans to their banking customers through the Lending Club platform. In May 2014, LC and Union Bank entered into a strategic alliance. Union Bank will purchase personal loans through the Lending Club platform, and the two companies will work together to create new credit products to be made available to both companies' customer base.LC's Current Product OfferingLendingClub is offering four different loan products now and it can be anticipated that LC will broaden their loan product offerings either through acquisitions or in-house development. Other than consumer loans, business loans, student loans and patient loans, don't be surprised that one day in the future, LC become a marketplace for insurance, credit cards, or mortgages.Vehicles for LC InvestorsThere are three major vehicles for retail/institutional investors: Notes, Certificates / Funds as well as Whole Loan Purchases.Notes (25% of total loan balance). Pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement, certain qualified individual investors can purchase unsecured, borrower payment dependent notes that correspond to payments received on an underlying standard program loan selected by the investor.Certificates and Funds (40% of total loan balance). According to the IPO prospectus, accredited investors and qualified purchasers may establish a relationship with LC Advisors, LLC (NASDAQ:LCA), a registered investment advisor and LC wholly owned subsidiary, or another third-party advisor in order to indirectly invest in certificates, or they may directly purchase a certificate from the Trust or interests in separate limited partnership entities that purchase certificates from the Trust. The certificates are settled with cash flows from underlying standard or custom program loans selected by the investor. Neither certificates nor limited partnership interests can be purchased through LC website.Whole Loan Purchases (35% of total loan balance). Institutional investors, such as banks, seek to hold the actual loan on their balance sheet. To meet this need, LC can sell the whole loan pool to these investors. In connection with these sales, the investor owns all right, title and interest in each loan. According to the IPO prospectus,, the investor also has access to the underlying borrower information, but is prohibited from contacting or marketing to the borrower in any manner and agrees to hold such borrower information in compliance with all applicable privacy laws. LC continues to service these loans after they are sold and can only be removed as the servicer in limited circumstances.LC Revenue ModelLendingClub generates revenue through Transaction fees, Servicing fees and Management fees.1:) Transaction Fees: As disclosed in the prospectus, the transaction fees LC receive from issuing banks in connection with their marketplace's role in enabling loan originations range from 1% to 6% of the initial principal amount of the loan as of September 30, 2014. In addition, for education and patient finance loans, transaction fees may exceed 6% as they include fees earned from issuing banks and service providers.2:) Servicing Fees: Servicing fees paid to LC vary based on investment channel. investors pay LC a servicing fee equal to 1% of each payment amount received from the borrower; whole loan purchasers pay a monthly servicing fee up to 1.3% per annum on the month-end principal balance of loans serviced;3:) Management Fees: Certificate holders generally pay a monthly management fee typically ranging from 0.7% to 1.2% per annum of the month-end balance of assets under management.LendingClub Loans Grade Mix and PerformanceOverall, LC's loan balance is well mixed and can meet different investors' demands. As of Q3 2014, 14.42% of loan balance is at Grade A, 24.19% Grade B, 27.13% Grade C, 20.14% Grade D, 10% Grade E, 2.99% Grade F and 1.08% Grade G. (note: Grade A means the highest credit quality, Grade G is the lowest).Source: LC's recent statisticsIn terms of loan performance, the average gross interest rate was $14.8% and investors could earn 9.12% net return in 2013. The charged off was 4.1% of the total loan balance, which was reasonable at that point.Source: LC's recent statisticsCompetitionsCurrent Competitors: LC is competing with other online credit marketplaces, such as Prosper Marketplace, Inc. and Funding Circle Limited.Prosper Marketplace: headquartered in San Francisco, the second largest P2P marketplace after LendingClub. On October 27 2014, Prosper announced more than $2 billion in personal loans have been originated through its platform, just six months after reaching the $1 billion milestone in April 2014. Same as LC, Prosper is using WebBank as their issuing bank. On Prosper, borrowers list loan requests between $2,000 and $35,000 and individual lenders invest as little as $25 in each loan listing they select.Funding Circle is another P2P marketplace based in UK. Funding Circle is the world's leading marketplace exclusively focused on small businesses - more than $500m (£300m) has been lent to 5,000 businesses. Businesses can borrow directly from a wide range of investors, including more than 30,000 people, the UK Government, local councils, a university and a number of financial organisations. Since launching, Funding Circle has raised $123m in equity capital from the same investors that backed Facebook, Twitter, Skype and Betfair. Currently £487,281,500 of loans has been funded so far.Potential Competitors: Big banks and other financial institutions can become potential competitors again LC and other P2P lending companies. I believe LC's technology and first move advantage can provide them with significant competitive edge over current and future competitors.Part 3: Investment Thesis1:) Half Trillion Addressable Markets: As mentioned before, there were $11.71 trillion consumer loans in total, including ~$3.5 trillion non-housing debt balance. 4.33% of total consumer loans, or $500 billion are more than 90 days behind payments. Traditional banks are using credit card/line of credits to serve these late payments, and charging customers ~20% of interest rate. The $500B of addressable market provides LendingClub huge space for future growth. Currently, LC is only serving ~$4B consumer loans and the whole P2P marketplace is still in the infant stage and will become one of the fastest growing industries in the next 10 years. I estimate LendingClub can achieve $40B of annual loan originations by FY17, vs. $4B estimate in FY14. The detailed analysis will be presented in the valuation part.2:) Proprietary Risk Algorithms /Big Data are LC's Core Asset: LC developed an extensible, automated platform that allows them to work with issuing banks to originate and issue a variety of loan products to an array of applicants. Their proprietary risk algorithms can analyze an applicant's risk profile based upon the issuing bank's underwriting guidelines which will process over 50 data points, including FICO score, credit requirement, debt-to-income ratio, credit history, number of credit inquires in the last 6 month, as well as some social networking data. That is the reason why I categorize LC as a technology company instead of a financial institution. In addition, their risk model can be enhanced gradually along with increasing number of borrowers. These proprietary risk algorithms can offer more appropriate interest rate for borrowers and more predictable income for investors, which will make the marketplace more transparent.3:) Growing Their Ecosystem: LC's proprietary risk algorithms can be used by regional banks, community banks, asset managers and insurance companies. For example, LC intends to enter into strategic relationships with community banks and other financial partners to facilitate co-branded loan offerings to their borrower customers through LC marketplace. There are over 6,000 banks in the U.S. and I have no doubt that many of them will join LendingClub ecosystem and transform the banking system in the future.As illustrated in the chart below, the large banks with assets above $10B have been gathering more market share for the retail loan market in the past. The Community & Regional Banks are suffering from retail loan growth and they cannot compete against those big banks that have tens of thousands of branches and loan officers. It's the time for change. The disruptive P2P lending technology enables these small banks to open their door for consumer loans which was uneconomical before. These small banks can team up with P2P lending companies and use their technology to acquire new retail borrowers at a much lower operating expenses.Source: LendingClub Presentation, FDIC, Quarterly Banking Profile4:) New Product Development has Unlimited Potential: In the past 4 years, LC has broadened their consumer loan offerings. I anticipate LC to continue to strengthen their current consumer loan products. In 2014, LC introduced small business loans and began offering education and patient finance loans as a result of the acquisition of Springstone. According to FDIC, as of June 30, 2014, there were $298B commercial and industrial loans outstanding under $1 million. If adding up to $500B consumer loan market, the total addressable market size is $700B for LC. Today LC announced a new pilot program in partnership with Google to facilitate low-interest financing to Google reseller partners/small businesses. This program can help LC to grow their small-business loan business.In addition, LendingClub can also expand their addressable market size by entering into new spaces such as auto loans, insurance, mortgage and credit card business in the future, subject to regulatory approval.5:) Entering New Geographies: Since launching their marketplace in 2007, LC has focused in the U.S. markets only. Based on LendingClub's website, they cannot facilitate loans to residents of 5 states: Iowa, Idaho, Maine, North Dakota, and Nebraska as each state has individual laws about investments in securities, as well as lending rules and regulations. For their notes, investors must reside in one of the following 28 states and meet that state's financial suitability conditions: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky (Accredited Investors only), Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, Nevada, New York, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, West Virginia, and Wyoming. As such, it is still a long way for LendingClub to work along with state regulators in order to expand their distribution network in the states. Furthermore, once the U.S. market has been established, LendingClub has the potential to expand globally.6:) Superb Board of Directors: LendingClub existing Board is including Kleiner Perkins' Mary Meeker, ex-chairman and CEO of Morgan Stanley John Mack and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. In 2013, Google and existing investor Foundation Capital had put $125 million in LendingClub. Google takes an observer seat on the Board.Renaud Laplanche, CEO is the Chairman of the Board. From June 2005 to October 2006, Mr. Laplanche served as Head of Product Management, Search Technologies, for Oracle Corporation, a computer technology corporation. From September 1999 to June 2005, Mr. Laplanche served as the founder and Chief Executive Officer of TripleHop Technologies, an enterprise software company, the assets of which were acquired by Oracle Corporation in June 2005. Mr. Laplanche holds a post-graduate DESS-DJCE degree (tax and corporate law) from the Université de Montpellier, Montpellier, France and an M.B.A. from HEC Business School, Paris, France.Key Risks1:) Fluctuations in interest rates could negatively affect transaction volume: Currently, most of the loans facilitated through LendingClub are issued with fixed interest rate. If the interest rate goes up, which is most likely in 2015, investors can earn a higher interest bank through saving accounts. However, according to LendingClub's statistics, investors can earn 9.12% of net return on average. The bank saving account interest rate will never go up to this level. Additionally, when the interest rate goes up, the lending rate will increase accordingly, meaning investors can earn a higher gross return.2:) Big Banks/Financial Institutions may enter this space: It is fair to state that big banks/financial institutions have the capability and resources to enter P2P lending. If that happens, LendingClub and all other independent P2P companies will face intense competition. However, I believe it is unlikely. Key reasons are: a) credit card and line of credit businesses contribute substantial profits for these big banks. If they offered similar service for consumers, their profitability will be negatively impacted; and b) these big banks have tens of thousands of branches, risk management employees, client service officers and loan officers. If these banks transform the traditional banking services, they have to restructure their business, lay off many employees and close many physical branches. I don't think the management team of these big banks will be fond of this restructure.3:) Regulation Risk: LendingClub and issuing bank partners are subject to borrower protection laws and federal and state consumer protection laws. The CFPB, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, is a new agency, and there is no visibility for any future consumer loan regulations that could impact LC business or issuing banks, especially when LC want to broaden their product offering.ValuationSmall banks with an asset between $100M-$10B are holding ~35% of total consumer loan balance in the U.S. , I assume LendingClub can penetrate 20% of these banks by building LC ecosystem, providing technology to them, and helping these small banks to reduce operating costs for the consumer loans. In addition, I assume LC can take 1% of market away for the top big banks. Adding together, we can get 8% of market share for LC, given $500B addressable market size, LC annual loan origination can achieve $40B in FY17. Another important assumption for this valuation is the economics of scale can help LC to improve their EBITDA margin to 41% by FY17. The margin estimate is not aggressive given that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s EBITDA margin is 54%, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is 49% and Visa (NYSE:V) is 69%.Based on the assumptions above, the adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $764 million in FY17. I will assign 20x EV/EBITDA multiple for LendingClub. Currently Facebook is trading at 32x EV/EBITDA and VISA is at 18x.The target price for LendingClub is $41, representing 95% upside.Key Assumptions:a) 30% of loan origination will be channelled through Certificates/Trustsb) Average Transaction fee margin = 4%c) Service fee =1% of interest/principle payment, adjusted by prepayment and charged offd) Average Loan Maturity = 3.5 yearse) For new originated loans, 50% of balance will stay current, net of late payment, charged off, principle payment and prepaymentf) Operating Expense adjusted by stock option expensesg) Banks (assets between $100M-10B) consumer loans market share: 35%. LC penetration rate = 20%h) LC can take 1% of market share away from the big banks (assets >10B)Why LendingClub is trading at a huge discount now?On December 10 2014, shares of LC surged 56% to $23.43 from their IPO price of $15, a strong debut for the first publicly traded P2P lending company. Currently the stock price hasn't changed too much, trading at $21.1. In my view, LendingClub is trading at a huge discount now. Why? Here are the key reasons:1:) The IPO 25-day quite period will come to end on January 20 2014. There is no high quality research report for this company. Most investors know the fact that LC is the biggest marketplace for the P2P Lending; however most of them have no clue regarding their business model, especially the revenue model. In addition, LendingClub is hated by all the big banks in the U.S. as their traditional credit card and retail loan business will be challenged in the future. Don't forget that most of big equity research companies are owned by these big banks/financial institutions.2:) Most investors haven't realized that LC's core asset is not their marketplace, not the loans they issued, but their proprietary risk algorithms. If I have to use an IT word, big data analytics are their core assets. They are using 50 data sets for the model inputs and the model can be enhanced when more borrowers apply for loans. According to LC's 2013 loan data, there were 759,646 loan applications rejected at a total amount of ~$10B, compared to 134,814 loans issued with $2.1B new loan origination during that period. More than 80% of loan applications cannot pass LC's proprietary credit decisioning and scoring models. The self-improving technology will create entry barriers for future competitors. We can anticipate more and more community/regional banks using LC's technology to reduce the operating expenses and to expand their retail loan business.3:) There has been a misconception that LC is competing with all the traditional banks and big banks are too big for LC to fight. The short answer is yes and no. They do compete against traditional banks in the space of retail loans and small business loans. However, I do see more and more banks team up with LC, using their technology to acquire new borrowers. As of the end of Q3 FY14, LC sold 35% of whole loan to financial institutions that can keep loans on the balance sheet. In that case, LC is becoming an effective and low-cost distribution channel for these financial institutions. To certain extent, they are not competitors but partners.4:) Many people believe individual investors in their marketplace are critical for LC's success. However, only 25% of the consumer loans were funded with notes owned by individual investors in Q3 2014. There are many different types of investors who are keen on this type of alternative investment that can help them diversify their assets and gain reasonable risk-adjusted returns. 40% of loans were funded with certificates managed by LC Advisors. These certificates can create additional revenues for LC as Certificate holders generally pay a monthly management fee typically ranging from 0.7% to 1.2% per annum of the month-end balance of AUM."

The firm recently added small business loans to its service lineup. Non-traditional, Internet-based lenders have seen an increase in market share for personal and small business loans as conventional, brick and mortar banks have reduced lending as a result of regulatory pressure. In addition, some borrowers have had difficulty obtaining traditional bank loans and have turned to online peer-to-peer lenders.The company reports that it has facilitated over $6.2 billion in loans, and paid over $595 million in interest to investors since its launch in 2007. Over $1 billion, or 20%, were executed in the second quarter of 2014. The company realized a net loss of $16.5 million in the first half of 2014, a sharp change from the $1.7 million profit for the same period a year earlier. Total net revenue for the first half of 2014 was nearly $87 million, an increase of 134% from the same period in 2013.For additional information on LC, see our prior article here.Solid Management Team To Combat Upstart and Traditional CompetitorsFounder and CEO Renaud Laplanche oversees the overall strategic direction and operation of the company.

3243986,89466,2015-06-08T15:37:18-04:00,"Lending Club (NYSE: LC) leads a fast growing p2p lending industry, and it has a priced-to-perfection stock price.
        However, its business model lacks a natural moat, which allows its increased competition to benefit from 2nd mover’s advantage.
        The company is also at risk due to the industry’s inherent cyclicality and its regulation overhang.
        Given the risks, the current price is expensive.","Lending Club (NYSE: LC) is the leader in a young but fast growing US p2p lending sector. Given the huge market potential and its leadership position, it should be a great stock to own. Except it isn't. Not at the current valuation. I have been a long time p2p lender investing directly thru platforms such as LC and Prosper and indirectly as a limited partner thru funds that invest in loans from various p2p platforms. I have followed this space closely as part of my investment due diligence. While I have enjoyed my loan returns during the FED-induced ZIRP, I have not found religion in p2p nor blindly exhort LC as the next greatest financial company. But before I discuss the risks of owning LC at the current high valuation, I will clear up some misconceptions often associated with LC.Lending Club is not a ""marketplace"" and its model does not have a strong network effect - A marketplace offers price discovery. Such is the case with eBay - as more buyers/sellers use the service, there is more incentive for additional buyers/sellers to join as increasing counter parties benefits all. This incentive creates the network effect and a natural moat. However, LC sets the interest rate on its platform, not the borrowers and lenders. Because of this, having additional users on p2p platforms does not offer better rates for either the borrowers or the lenders. This reduces the network effect as both lenders and borrowers will buy from the platform that offers the best rate. Ironically, in the early days of p2p lending, Prosper offered price discovery on its platform, but soon learned that it was not such a good idea for returns.Now, one may argue that LC's brand and leadership status attracts borrowers and lenders, thus a pseudo network effect. However, if it does it will be minimal at best. Borrowers don't care about brand - they will go with the lowest loan APR. Getting a loan does not have the same post transaction concerns as buying a product or a service. Lenders, on the other hand, would care about the brand unless they have the sophistication to perform their own platform due diligence. Coincidentally, most of p2p lenders are institutional investors capable of such, which leads us to the next misconception.Lending Club is not part of the shared economy and primarily serves fast money institutional lenders - Though marketed as serving the masses, LC is not part of the shared economy. Not since it started to cater to large institutional lenders that can fund its ambitious growth. According to its last earnings call, 76% of its lending came from funds, managed accounts and institutions. These are professional funding sources that will move fast in case of market changes, and they are not as sticky as retail accounts.Lending Club's underwriting will not sustain the current return if the US has a recession - Most new lenders on LC will experience 10% to 12% initial returns in their LC accounts. LC uses Net Adjusted Return(NAR) in the reporting. Because NAR does not have loan loss provisions, the returns will decrease as the portfolio age. If the lender stops buying new loans, the true return will show as the notes mature; and the median for the recent vintage is around 7%. Still not bad if it can be sustained. But it cannot. The economy has been beneficial to p2p lending in the past 5 years. However, every cycle has its down leg. When the next recession hits, the defaults will increase and the returns will go down, perhaps by a lot and even into negative territory. LC's underwriting algorithm, or anyone else' underwriting, will not prevent loan performance deterioration when the economy goes into a recession.Lending Club has a disruptive business model but employs very similar means as the banks - P2P lending is disruptive by connecting lenders and borrowers. However, many of the ways by which LC achieves its model is very similar to the banks. For example, its most effective channel for loan acquisition is direct mail marketing. This is the same method that banks use to acquire credit card customers. Another example is the underwriting. Despite the perception of advanced big data machine learning algorithms, its underwriting approach is quite similar to those used by the banks with heavy reliance on FICO scores. Unsurprisingly, FICO is quite good in evaluating credit worthiness of prime consumer borrowers. Machine learning, on the other hand, is more useful for subprime, thin file, or small business borrowers, all of which are either immaterial or a very small % of LC's business. The skill sets and domain knowledge to accomplish what LC has done, while not trivial, is also not rare and can be hired by its competitors in the rank and file of financial institutions, as LC itself has done.Why LC is over-valuedWith 410m shares fully diluted, LC has a market cap north of $7.5B. Regardless of your preferred financial ratio, whether P/S(19), P/B(7.5) or others, most will agree that, at $7.5B, LC is priced for perfection and unfettered 100% annual growth that will give rise to the eventual Apple of the financial industry. But does it have a clear path towards that goal? Evidences would suggest LC does not because of 1) ample competition with low barriers of entry, 2) lending's cyclical nature guarantees disruption to its business, and 3) regulation risks.CompetitionIt seems that every week one reads about a large financial player, such as Goldman Sachs, entering the p2p lending space, or a large lender moving laterally to compete directly against LC, or another startup getting $150m VC money for its p2p lending platform. Most investors will agree that the competitor list is long and growing. The question is can they challenge LC for the leadership position. I think some will be formidable competitors because LC does not have a moat.First of all, as mentioned above, LC's model has a very weak network effect due to its lack of price discovery. So there is no natural moat embedded in the business model.Second of all, LC's accomplishments in areas such as underwriting/IT, regulatory/legal, borrower acquisition, investor sourcing present low barriers of entry due to the initial challenges of creating the p2p lending industry. In fact, I would argue that LC suffers from FIRST MOVER'S DISADVANTAGE. Take for example its underwriting model. When LC started, it had to target retail investors as institutional investors did not trust p2p lending yet. As a result, LC had to register with the SEC and disclosed, publicly, many of the loan attributes in order to provide transparency to investors. From this wealth of public data, any reasonably trained risk underwriter can triangulate, through regression analysis, an underwriting model similar to what LC has. This is what some of the new entrants are doing to compete against LC. In fact, for this reason, LC has stopped disclosing many of its loan attributes. The only reason they cut back attribute disclosure is because of the realization that it is relatively easy for their competitors to reverse engineer their hard work and to replicate the underwriting model in weeks vs what took LC several years to create and fine-tune.The same first mover's disadvantage also applies to other areas that LC pioneered. For investor sourcing, LC has demonstrated to the institutional investor base, after several years of education and evangelizing, that p2p lending works. Now investors cannot pump money fast enough into lending platforms, and LC's competitors enjoy the fruit of LC's labor. In borrower acquisition, it took a while for LC to learn that direct mail marketing is the best loan acquisition channel, which has become common industry knowledge. On the regulatory front, because new platforms do not need to appeal to retail investor, they can save tremendous amount of legal costs and time by avoiding SEC registration, something that both LC and Prosper had to do as early movers.In fact, the second mover's advantage has already given rise to some overnight success stories amongst new platforms as startups replicate in months what it took LC years to accomplish . The impact to LC will first materialize at the industry bottleneck. Currently it is borrower acquisition as the industry is constrained by lack of loans to meet investors' appetite. This will cause marketing costs to tick upwards for everyone, which will in turn eat into LC's margin. If you listen to the recent earnings call, LC's CFO said:""Relative to the fourth quarter, sales and marketing expenses as a percent of origination increased 24 basis points. Excluding the reclassification, expenses increased 19 basis points. On an adjusted basis, roughly half of the sequential quarter-over- quarter increase was driven by normal seasonal trends, while the other half was from the expansion of acquisition channels for small business and education and patient finance.""This was in reference to the first quarter performance, right after the company's high profile IPO where it was in the news constantly. It is highly likely that without the $millions of free PR and media coverage, LC's Q1 marketing cost after excluding for seasonality would have increased sequentially rather than flat lined.It is worth mentioning LC's partnership with Goog, BABA, Citi and others. This will help contain the marketing cost escalation. However, it is not unique to LC as others have done similar deals, and there is nothing that prevents the partners from switching platforms. But more importantly, these deals are tiny compared to the 100% annual origination growth that LC investors seek.Lending's cyclicalityAs mentioned before, loan performance is at the whims of economic cycles. There is nothing that underwriting policies or algorithms can do to prevent the eventual cyclical results. The p2p industry as a whole has been very fortunate to grow up during an economic upturn. However, there is 100% certainty that a recession will happen at some point, and will reappear on a periodic basis. Given LC's and the industry's heavy reliance on fast money institutional investors, increasing defaults will very quickly swing the pendulum from the current condition of too few loans to too little capital. The impact to LC's growth and revenue will be jarring when this eventuality happens. And this macro cyclicality will throw periodic wrenches to LC's growth ambition. Moreover, each successive recession can rearrange the industry's leadership ranks, and this puts at risk LC ability to maintain its dominant status.Regulation risksIn addition to a growing economy, p2p lending also benefited from regulations, such as Basel III, FAS 167/177 and others, that curtailed banks' lending appetite. These regulations do not apply to p2p platforms. However, as the industry grows, it is hard to imagine that the government will not impose some form of regulation on the sector. For example, one of the primary culprits of the financial crisis of 2007/08 was the mortgage industry's originate-to-distribute model. The same model used by LC and other platforms. This is just one obvious area where uncertainties remain in the regulatory arena. It is reasonable to expect increased regulations for the platforms as the origination increases. Regardless of the form that it will take, it will definitely increase expenses, or perhaps force changes in the business model, or maybe even tip the competitive balance back to the banks.SummaryLC is a leader and a pioneer that blazed a trail in a very fast growing industry. Unfortunately, due to the lack of a natural moat in its business model, the trail that it blazed created a smooth groove that allowed 2nd movers to catch up quickly. In addition, the industry's inherent cyclicality and the p2p regulation overhang only compounds the risks that LC may lose its leadership status. These concerns give rise to my view that, while LC is a good company, it is not worthy of the priced-to-perfection valuation that it currently commands.Disclosure: The author has a short position in LC.

2759955,24597,2014-12-16T14:16:32-05:00,"While investors should have a mix of stocks and fixed income in their portfolio, Lending Club's stock is relatively expensive after the IPO.Direct investment in peer loans can provide returns of 5% and higher depending on the risk category of the loans.The long-term potential for Lending Club shares remains intact, but investors may want to wait for the IPO enthusiasm to wane.","Lending Club (NYSE: LC) issued stock on the New York Stock Exchange last Thursday and raised $865 million on its offer of 57.7 million shares. The stock surged 56% in the first day of trading and closed Friday at $24.69 per share. At that price, the company is valued at $9.7 billion and an enterprise value of 60 times expected sales of $165 million this year.Even with the potential for growth to continue well into the future, investors need to ask if the shares are too expensive and if they would be better off investing directly in peer loans.Risk and Return on Peer LoansThe table below presents Lending Club's statistics for loans issued from 2007 through the first quarter of 2013. It is important to look at loans that are more than a year old because the default rate stabilizes after about a year and returns are more certain.The table shows the average interest rate for peer loans, the annualized return realized by investors, and an implied loss rate for the portfolio of peer loans within each risk category.Lending Club Peer LoansRisk in peer lending is very low for the safest categories of peer loans and still manageable even in the riskier categories. As with any investment, you need to understand your own tolerance for risk. If a few defaults are going to make you skittish, then stick with the top-rated categories. If you can ride out a few defaults, understanding that the total default rate will average out over a large portfolio of 200 loans, then you can realize higher returns in the riskier categories.Defaults on general consumer credit have come down a lot since the end of the recession. The S&P Experian Consumer Credit Default Index reports a default rate of just 1.06% across auto, mortgages and bank card loans it tracks. That is well under the 4.75% default rate it reported in 2010.By comparison, the S&P 500 index of stocks has seen volatility of 11% over the last two years and 20% over the last ten years. That means that the stock market is likely to swing up to 20% higher or lower in a given year.Of course, as the disclaimer goes, past results are not a guarantee of future returns. We don't yet know how rising rates in 2015 will affect direct investment in peer loans. Generally, lower-quality bonds are more correlated with the economy than they are with interest rates. This is intuitive because companies or people are better able to pay their debts in a strengthening economy. Most peer loans are held to maturity so you don't see as much interest rate risk as you see in the fixed-income market. While the average returns on peer loans are very good on a risk-adjusted basis, you can realize even better returns by picking loans on important loan criteria, featured in a recent interview with a Prosper peer lending investor.Rising rates could be a good thing for peer lending investors. Higher interest rates should also increase the rates on peer loans and defaults may decrease if the economy stays on track. This would increase the net return for investors.Risk and Return on Lending Club StockAnyone with money in the stock market since 2000 can tell you that investing can be a roller coaster ride, and I doubt it will be any different for shares of Lending Club. As a partial owner in the company, shares entitle you to a piece of the massive growth in the industry.Lending Club's platform originated $3.2 billion in loans over the seven years through 2013 and almost doubled that amount in the first three quarters of this year. The company is just starting to tip its toes into small business loans and a new two-year super-prime loan. Revenue grew by 190% to $98 million in 2013, and I estimated sales could reach $1.1 billion by 2017 in a stock valuation infographic I posted before the IPO.The peer lending market at about $7.5 billion is still just a fraction of the $3.3 trillion consumer credit market and there are likely years of double- or triple-digit growth ahead for Lending Club. The company has nearly a billion dollars after the IPO to pay for growth projects, and profitability should improve as the business matures.Still, the huge increase in the stock price over the first two days of trading may be a bit much. For the risk inherent in stocks over that seen in fixed-income investments like peer loans, investors should require a higher return.If we assume a required annual return of 9% for shares of Lending Club, the price would need to rise to $32 per share by the end of 2017. This increase of about 30% doesn't seem too far fetched considering the shares' meteoric first day, but would still lead to a relatively expensive enterprise value of about 11 times expected sales in 2017.Which is the Better Investment?Asking which is the better investment between Lending Club stock and direct investment in loans is something of a trick question. They are two different asset classes and you should probably have a little of both in your diversified investment portfolio. Stocks generally offer higher returns if you can ride out higher risk over the short term, while fixed-income investments like peer loans are more stable and offer near-term cash returns.Using the S&P Experian Consumer Credit Default Index as a proxy for peer loans, we find almost no correlation (0.014) with stocks over the last five years and a very low (0.28) correlation with bonds. This means that not only can you realize high returns on peer loans, but, combined with a portfolio of stocks and bonds, you will reduce your risk significantly.The better question is should you invest in Lending Club stock following the IPO? While a decent return over the next three years is well within reason, history shows that investing immediately following an IPO is not always the best idea. In a study of IPOs from 1980 through 2009, companies saw their stock higher by 18% on the first day, but then produced a total return of only 21% over the next three years. Note that the 21% return is including the 18% from the first day and not an additional return.Initial offerings of stock tend to get bid up in investor exuberance, especially when the industry is seeing as much growth as that of peer lending. It looks like this is what happened in the case of Lending Club and I would hesitate to buy shares at this price.While the long-term potential for the company is still higher, I think you could wait for a couple of months and watch for a better price on the shares. Enter separate buy orders at $22 and $20 per share for your total investment. In the meantime, look to direct investment in peer loans to diversify your portfolio and provide a strong risk-adjusted return."
2770375,78705,2014-12-20T20:58:57-05:00,"Investors in LendingClub’s products and stock face huge risks.Despite the hype, LendingClub’s business model is not disruptive or unique.LendingClub cannot produce the origination volumes to deserve their $9 billion dollar valuation.","Introduction: The ProductLendingClub (NYSE:LC) has successfully built a strong narrative as a ""Fintech"" company that matches everyday borrowers to investors, peer-to-peer, circumventing the traditional credit institutions and offering a cheaper product through the magic of technology. Lending Club's core product, the investment notes they sell to investors on behalf of borrows, has a few key flaws. The first issue worth mentioning is that all of the loans facilitated by LendingClub are unsecured loans, not backed by any collateral. This is traditionally the type of loan with the highest default rate and lowest recovery rate. Because these notes are backed by no collateral, the borrower is not as incentivized to pay and the lender's losses are not mitigated in the event of default. To believe that LendingClub has cracked the code with their algorithm making these types of loans less risky is extremely naive.Another disadvantage is that LendingClub's notes are almost entirely illiquid:These three main risks (high risk of default, low recovery rate, and illiquidity), are all masked by the current low interest rate environment. Not only do sub 3% ten-year Treasury yields give these type of loans historically low charge-off rates, they also boost demand for risky products, like LendingClub's Notes, which offer far higher yields and income than a retail investor can get investing in a bond fund or CD. As the economy fluctuates over time it will expose the risks of LendingClub's product and weaken their proposition relative to other investment options.Low Interest Rates Drive down Credit Card DefaultsPart 2: The Business ModelThe investment thesis surrounding LendingClub is that it is an innovative new business model, which has a cost advantage and is the logical alternative to traditional credit and bank loans. Peer-to-peer sounds new age, however, the business model is not drastically different than what many companies in the financial services industry are already doing. For example, many payday lenders use the exact same ""peer-to-peer"" system. They supply unsecured loans and match them up with third party investors taking a fee for being an intermediary (they also lend online). Here is how EzPawn, one of the biggest payday lenders in the US, describes their business in Texas:This is LendingClub's business model in a nutshell -- an intermediary for high rate unsecured loans. The major difference being they seek out borrowers in a range of credit classes and allow a larger pool of lenders to be their ""third-party."" These similarities show Lending Club is not the transformative and disruptive business to the banking industry as some paint it to be.In other ways, LendingClub resembles a securitization operation run by shadow banking intermediaries and could potentially move even further in this direction as they grow. LendingClub's premium ""portfolio tool"" is securitization on a small scale. The portfolio tool takes a number of different loans (""notes"" as LendingClub calls them) with similar characteristics and yields and groups them together to hedge against defaults and pre-payment risk. This sounds a lot like CDOs and MBSs: chopping a number of loans into a portfolio and selling it as a singular product. If we can accept that LendingClub's model is not disruptive and more like that of a market maker (selling loans or packages of loans to small dollar investors), than the business can be more reasonably valued. As an intermediary, fee-based, market maker LendingClub's key to success will be in scaling the business significantly and levering up the low marginal cost of providing an online market place for investors and originating loans.Part 3: The FutureUsing the financial intermediary industry as our compass, let's take a look at the numbers and what LendingClub has to achieve in order to deserve their $9+ billion valuation. LendingClub has increased their loan origination volume from a mere $51 million in 2009 to $2 billion in 2013, a nearly 40 fold increase. Lending Club converted this $2 billion in transactions into $97.98 million in revenues, a 4.75% ""revenue yield."" Valuing LendingClub like a trading operation and assuming they can scale quickly and effortlessly (which is a big assumption), their net margin on these revenues should be around 10-15% (their current net margin is 7.45%).Reverse engineering LendingClub's $9 billion dollar (and climbing), valuation we can see just how far they have to go. Some simple calculations show that LendingClub needs to facilitate $88 billion in loan originations to become a $4.2 billion revenue company and earn $630 million in profit. Not coincidentally, CIT Group, the largest US bank with a market cap lower than LendingClub, (22nd most valuable bank), earned $676 million last fiscal year. Investors in LendingClub, at the $9 billion dollar valuation, are essentially saying LendingClub, with under $100 million in revenue and $2 billion in loan volume can become as big and as profitable as the twenty most valuable banks in the US who command hundreds of billions in revenue and hold trillions in tangible assets.Reverse Engineering $9 Billion ValuationThere are a number of problems with LendingClub making it to $88 billion in origination volume. Although LendingClub originates loans for all types of purposes, mortgage originations give some context to how large a figure $88 billion in originations is. $88 billion in originations would be more volume than what all but the two largest US Banks originate in mortgages over a calendar year. Two of the largest credit card companies, American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Discover (NYSE:DFS), whose loans hold similar characteristics to the kind Lending Club, had $66 billion and $64 billion in credit loans outstanding last year, respectively.Part 4: Concluding ThoughtsLendingClub's products are niche from a demand perspective. The products LendingClub competes with, especially on an institutional level, such as credit securitizations, asset backed securities, or other fixed income products are far more liquid, can be obtained in bulk, and are easier to compare against each other. The battle to scale for LendingClub will be uphill without the institutional market and their current product is just not built to appease this type of customer. While Lending Club lacks any competitors in their direct space, this can largely be attributed to, again, the relative niche nature of their product. There are really no significant barriers to entry to market in peer-to-peer online lending. Their low cost alternative to traditional credit is also easier and cheaper to replicate than traditional credit institutions.Low barriers to entry mean LendingClub can be a victim of their own success in two ways. If they are successful as investors hope, than the incentive of huge profits while taking virtually no balance sheet risk will bring many competitors into the market, eroding the profitability of LendingClub by raising customer acquisition costs. This happens in similar industries to peer-to-peer lending, such as online gambling, payday lenders, and brokerages. In these industries competition raises the selling and advertising cost to win customers even though providing the actual service remains cheap and often gets driven down (i.e. the platform and processing). This is the likely outcome if LendingClub's model is a success.The second way in which their success could hurt them is in the area of regulation. Currently LendingClub is lightly regulated (another way in which there are low barriers to entry in their current form). If LendingClub or the peer-to-peer lending industry grows, than regulation will follow without a doubt. Regulation could cap interest rates they could offer or fees they could charge, as has happened with other unsecured loan industries, or at the very least raise regulatory compliance costs. Lack of regulation has added to LendingClub's cost advantage over other credit institutions and eventual regulation would lessen the relative attractiveness of their services. LendingClub is a highly speculative investment with business fundamentals and industry structure that do not support the common narrative that has driven the stock to insane heights. For both users of LendingClub products and investors in the company, there appear to be many more risks than potential upside."
2794015,25275,2015-01-03T14:33:09-05:00,"LendingClub's prospectus tells investors why investing in its stock might not be such a good idea.LC stock is grossly overvalued, even given rosy growth assumptions that may not materialize.No matter how promising future prospects are, they are no substitution for tangible value at hand.Investors should be content to take profits by cashing out of LC stock now.","Like most investors who bought unsecured loans on LendingClub (NYSE:LC)'s website, I enrolled in LC's Direct Share Purchase program to indicate interest in 350 shares from the company's recent IPO. I received an allocation of 250 shares at the IPO offer price of $15 per share on December 10, 2014. I expected a nice pop when the stock began trading the next day, given the hype surrounding this IPO. I was not disappointed, as the stock opened at $24.75 when it began trading, and closed at $23.43, for a 56% return on the first trading day. The question then was: Should I cash out for a quick profit, hold in hopes of further gains or possibly buy more?I did not wish to sell immediately, or at least delay until 2015, as a sale would incur short-term capital gains taxes. But the risk in not selling is that the stock would go down, perhaps even below the IPO offer price. IPOs have a notorious tendency to pop on the first day and go on to underperform the market. One thing that is worse than having to pay taxes is not having to pay them. To avoid falling into the trap of Endowment effect, I asked myself: ""Would I buy this stock now if I did not already own it?"" The answer is a resounding no.First of all, LC has only had seven years of operating history, and it has consistently lost money in six out of these seven years. It is difficult to tell if the business model is sustainable or not. That makes an ""investment"" in LC speculative at best.LendingClub's prospectus lists many good reasons why investing in LC might not be such a good idea. Here are some highlights:In the nine months ended September 30, 2014, LC lost $23.9 MM on $143 MM in revenue. From 2011 to 2013, LC lost $11.8 MM on $144.6 MM revenue. Investors are keeping high hopes for growth, but LC is telling investors to anticipate even more losses as the company continues to grow. What good is growth, if growth means shareholders will be losing more money in the process? Losing money is probably not the perfect recipe for a successful investment.What might hinder LC's continued growth?Competition is one. The more successful LC becomes, the more competition it attracts. It takes minimal capital to set up a web-based lending platform. Established banks with greater economies of scale can easily enter this market and squeeze LC out. The intense competition makes it difficult to establish a moat.LendingClub has never operated in an environment of high interest rates. Its growth has benefited from multi-decade low interest rates, which make the unsecured person-to-person loans superficially attractive compared to more traditional, low-yielding, debt investments like government bonds and high-grade corporate bonds.Once interest rates start going up again, investors will lose appetite for these p2p loans and go back to traditional government and corporate bonds for yields. At the same time, potential borrowers will be less willing to apply for loans, and loan volume will decrease.The biggest risk, however, is that default rates will go up when the next recession hits. Default rates are abnormally low right now due to a combination of low interest rates and favorable economic conditions. An inevitable change in these two factors will cause default rates to go up. From LC's prospectus:A major source of revenue for LC is a 1% servicing fee for monthly payments, which will be lost when loans default. Moreover, defaults will incur collection fees, which are passed on to investors only when collection efforts are successful.The table below summarizes return on LendingClub loans since launch of the website:Return on investment for loans issued before the 2008-2009 recession was dismal. Once the economy began its recovery, LendingClub benefited from a virtuous cycle of increased demand for loans from borrowers, lower default rates as borrowers regain earning power with the improved economy, higher returns attracting investors to the lending platform, which in turn attracts more borrowers.When the next recession hits, and it will come sooner or later, borrowers who took loans during prosperous times will default en masse as they lose earning power and cannot repay the loans, leading to poor returns on the loans. Investors and borrowers will leave as their loans cannot be funded, or their loans cannot be approved because they are no longer creditworthy.Moving onto valuation, here are some key financial figures for LendingClub:*Note that the approximate tangible book value includes the full value of 59 million shares sold by LC at $15 offer price, and does not subtract underwriter fees and commissions, which are not yet disclosed. The actual book value is even less.The current valuation is lofty indeed, with the stock selling at 1,400% tangible book value and 1,602 times 2013 earnings (the only year with positive earnings in all of LC's history). Such heady valuations are reminiscent of the late 1990s tech bubble. Don't get suckered in again.Obviously, the current price assumes significant growth for the company, but is it realistic? And is the price justified?LendingClub is maturing as its growth has slowed down from 190% in 2013 to 122% in the first three quarters of 2014. The bigger a company gets, the more difficult it is to grow, and nothing attracts competition like growth. Even if we generously assume LC is able to maintain 122% per year growth for the next five years, then reach a mature terminal growth rate of 4% a year, while maintaining the same 7% net margin as in 2013 (the highest LC has ever earned in its history), we get a discount cash flow intrinsic value of $7 for the stock.Clearly, LendingClub is overvalued, even given these rosy assumptions.LC is currently more valuable than all but 20 US banks, based on market capitalization. KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY), the 20th largest bank by market capitalization, is valued at $12 billion, which is about the same as LC. But KeyCorp is profitable, with earnings of $910 million on revenue of $4.1 billion in 2013, tangible net asset value of $9.1 billion, and has been paying uninterrupted dividends for 27 years straight. LC is losing money, has only 2% of KeyCorp's revenue, only 9% of KeyCorp's net tangible assets, but it is selling at the same price! How euphoric can one get?I ended up selling 240 of my 250 allotted shares at a price of $26.50 on December 30. I kept 10 shares as play money to see if I am eventually proven wrong in my analysis.In conclusion, investors should not gamble on high flying speculative growth stocks like LC. They should instead bear in mind Ben Graham's admonition that no matter how promising future prospects are, they are no substitution for tangible value at hand, which LC definitely lacks. To buy LC at the current price is to throw caution to the wind and court disaster. As Graham said,That sums up concisely why I had to cash out most of my LC shares."
2752395,25258,2014-12-13T15:21:58-05:00,"LendingClub offers a fundamental win-win-win situation for investors, borrowers and the company.The company expects significant growth opportunities in its core markets.A proven history of scaling growth and a first-to-market advantage works in LendingClub's favor.","On December 11, LendingClub (NYSE:LC) launched a successful public offering that raised $870 million. According to the company's Form S-1, LendingClub originally approached the market to raise a proposed $500 million. Yet, as shares rocketed on December 11 to end 56% higher in its debut, the end of the first trading day suggested the peer-to-peer finance company had left nearly $480 million on the table due to intense market demand.LendingClub is the world's largest online marketplace for connecting borrowers and investors. The company seeks to transform the manner in which the banking system is conducted. Through its innovative online platform, LendingClub is able to pass on a portion of its savings to investors and borrowers because of its substantially reduced need for physical infrastructure, which is typical to most financial institutions.The following are five reasons why investors should consider buying LendingClub:Growing Dissatisfaction In The Current SystemBesides these points, LendingClub can also benefit from a growing dissatisfaction with the traditional banking system. Consider the words of PayPal co-founder and Affirm founder and CEO, Max Levchin (via USA Today):Satisfaction ratings for banks continue to fall, thanks, in part, to their need to increase fees. The American Consumer Satisfaction Index keeps heading lower for banks as these fees reach new heights. This decline marked a reversal after nearly two years of index improvement for retail banks. Small banks account for much of this decline, further dispersing the demand between those turning to big financial institutions and those looking for banking alternatives.A Look At LendingClub NowBased on the approximately 361.41 million shares outstanding, LendingClub now trades with a market capitalization of approximately $8.85 billion based on the midday trading price of $24.50, as of December 12. Much of the company's current valuation remains based on the forward-looking expectations of future positive performance.On its balance sheet, LendingClub maintained $2.58 billion in total assets, as of June 2014. Of this amount, $2.44 billion is reflected in the company's total liabilities leaving a mere $137.14 million for shareholder equity. It is important to remember that this is not inclusive of the company's proceeds from the most recent public offering.Historically, total revenue continues to gain momentum. For the years ending in 2011, 2012 and 2013, total revenue consecutively grew from $12.75 million to $33.81 million and to $98.00 million. It is worth pointing out that total revenue for the first six months of 2014 has already topped $86.94 million. For the years ending in 2011 and 2013, the company's bottom line shifted from a net loss of $12.27 million to positive net income of $7.31 million. As LendingClub significantly bolstered its marketing expenditures in 2014, it remains to be seen how this will affect the bottom line by year's end.Final ThoughtsLendingClub remains a rapidly growing technology company that has found its niche as a leader in the growing peer-to-peer lending industry. Having been a long-time and active investor on LendingClub myself since 2008, I can personally attest to the company's strong reputation and the platform's ability to produce a significant return on investment. As the company continues to grow, I find little doubt that it has the potential to make a meaningful impact on the current financial system as a whole.Nevertheless, LendingClub now trades at a significant premium. Investors looking to take on equity in this company should consider that such a premium has yet to be represented in the current financial performance of the company. Barring the impressive growth in revenue to date, the company remains a pioneer in an industry that has yet to become mainstream. This remains an important factor to consider in any investment decision.As a whole, the most positive aspect of LendingClub is its ability to appeal to the masses. By connecting individuals together, the company essentially allows them to become the bank. As such, LendingClub's model strikes deep at the heart of the current financial system. It also does so by undercutting the traditional competition found in brick-and-mortar institutions with respect to costs and market reach. By bypassing the need for costly overhead, LendingClub passes along a part of such savings to the public in a representative model of a Robin Hood archetype. Such a positive aura surrounding the profitable democratization of banking remains a likely attribute that will continue to help support the company's stock by itself."
2758165,75385,2014-12-16T02:56:22-05:00,"Lending Club's IPO was highly anticipated, what is its future outlook?Should investors buy this stock or the loans on Lending Club's platform?Is Lending Club really worth all the hype?","Since 2010, I've been using LendingClub (NYSE:LC) as a platform to increase my passive income. My wife and I were fortunate enough to participate in the directed share program LC set up for retail investors. With the IPO success on December 11th, everyone is wondering what the future of the company is, as well as the future of the banking industry. With a 56% increase from its IPO pricing, investors might be salivating at the chance to own the leader in Peer-to-Peer lending. LC is up about 70% from its IPO price of $15.Obviously, I'm optimistic about the future of LC, but there are some serious concerns that investors, in both the DSP and potential investors, should be aware of. Before I get into the cons of LC, I'll explain some of the benefits of the IPO, for LC and its investors.First, LC has been expanding its loan offerings, which is its revenue stream. In 2007, LC opened its platform on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) only offered unsecured personal loans to those with a credit score of 640 and above, with a maximum of $25,000. Now, LC offers personal loans of up to $35,000 to borrowers with a credit score of 660 or more, business loans of up to $300,000, and after acquiring Springstone Financial LLC. they now offer healthcare and education loans of up to $40,000. Higher loan amounts allow LC to collect more in origination fees, currently 1-5% of loan amounts and is based on the borrower's credit risk. Varied loan products also attracts new borrowers, as LC has the potential to become the ""go-to"" platform for those looking to borrow money.LC has also been diversifying its revenue. In addition to charging loan origination fees, LC has now started charging investors a 1% fee for collecting payments from borrowers. This allows LC to create a monthly cash flow from notes on its platform, and shows investors that they are committed to ensuring that borrowers pay on time. LendingClub has also offered to manage accounts of $2,500 or more, and charge investors for the convenience of a completely passive portfolio. As LC's platform and loan products grow, there will be more opportunities to diversify their income stream.LendingClub had been banned to investors in 24 states (20 of those states allow investors to use LC's trading platform), and to borrowers in 5 states. However, as a public company, it will now be governed by federal regulations under the SEC, and will be able to operate everywhere. If LC is able to operate in every state, this not only allows them access to more investors/borrowers, LC could significantly change online financial products. Let's consider a home mortgage, the holy grail of the banking industry.There is one online lending platform that offers accredited investors the opportunity to invest in home mortgages, and that's Social Finance (sofi.com). Sofi also offers student loans and refinancing, MBA loans, mortgage refinancing and of course personal loans. Mortgages are only offered in California, Washington, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, New Jersey and Washington, D.C. LC has already stated that the proceeds from its IPO will be used to pay down debt, increase their financial stability, and acquire other financial companies. If LC were to acquire SoFi, they would not only become the largest peer-to-peer lender, but also the largest online home mortgage platform. The ability to offer home mortgages, along with the validation (and media coverage) of their IPO, could significantly change the banking industry as we know it.Now, the pitfalls. To be blunt to investors, LC is really a facilitator/matchmaker of borrowers and lenders. Increasing demand of investors, while a shrinking supply of borrowers could cause LC to issue larger, risker loans in order increase revenue. This would be the worst-case scenario for borrowers and lenders. Institutions have flooded the platform, which does validate their services, but also makes it a little more difficult for retail investors. LendingClub also had to partner with Web Bank in Utah in order to grow their platform. It appears as if those pesky banks are here to stay.First nine months of 2014, LC had an EPS of -$0.41. Investors who didn't participate in the IPO of $15 have to seriously ask if they want to own a company with negative earnings, a P/S of 62.03. The real money is in using the LC platform and investing in loans. 84% of investors with less than 100 notes have seen positive returns, while 99.9% of investors with more than 100 notes have had positive returns. Accounts that have been opened for a year to a year and a half have average returns of 8.5%. This type of monthly cash flow is almost unmatched for income investors. Accounts are FDIC insured with Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). WFC also profited in the IPO, with 50 million shares now worth over $1.2 billion.LC data by YChartsCompetition to LC has increased, especially since the SEC has been slow to release the rules on crowd funding in Title III of the JOBS Act. Companies have been positioning themselves in order to take advantage of the SEC's ruling. This would flood the market with new investment options, as well as new opportunities for those seeking funds. LendingClub's major competition, besides every bank in the world, is Prosper, a peer-to-peer lending platform that has supported over $2 billion in loan offerings. As investors, both retail and institutional, are given more options for creating ROI, and as borrowers are given more options for financing, LC could see a decline in platform participants. There isn't anything proprietary about offering a platform for loans, so LC must establish itself as ""THE"" platform for loans and income investment.Investors should focus on using the platform for positive returns. An $8.9 billion valuation is pretty steep for a company with negative EPS. Although this my position in LC is very different from my value investment strategy in dividend producing companies, I'm focusing more on continuing to reinvest my monthly cash-flow on their platform. To those who profited on the IPO, kudos to us. To investors looking to invest in LC, you should focus on the 8.5% returns on the platform."

To put it succinctly, LendingClub is like a broker of consumer loans and also an originator. Through its website, individual investors purchase loans originated through LendingClub. At the same time, small business owners and individuals go directly to the website to borrow money from individual investors.This limits risk for LendingClub because client deposits are tied up for a couple of years inside debt securities that LendingClub does not directly invest into. This means charge-offs won't damage the financial statement in the foreseeable future because LendingClub doesn't actually own the debt it services and originates. This makes LendingClub less exposed to the ""bust"" part of the business cycle. As an added bonus, the revenue LendingClub generates isn't constrained by the amount of available capital on its balance sheet, as it relies on growth in client deposits to scale its business.At the same time, the business has a well-defined moat, thanks to the network effect unfolding. Favorable interest rates in a low-interest rate environment give investors returns on debt securities they cannot find in more traditional investment securities such as government/corporate bonds, CDs and preferred stocks issuances. With interest rates - factoring in net charge-offs - in the 4.74% to 7.56% range, the investment class of securitized consumer debt has shown promise when compared to other types of investment securities. On the downside, there's less liquidity when compared to bonds and stocks.Investors are heavily dependent on LC's rating system of debt securities to determine ways to maximize the risk-adjusted return on capital. Even so, a broad base of investors has emerged, inclusive of hedge funds, high net worth investors, retail investors, pension funds and university endowments.Source: LendingClub ProspectusBecause LendingClub has yet to provide financial guidance, as it has yet to report a fiscal quarter as a public company, we're left with the company's S1 and other pre-IPO/IPO-related public filings.Source: LendingClubThat being the case, we have to work with the information we have. In FY 2013, the company generated $98 million in revenue. At a $9 billion market cap (approximate), the stock is trading at 91.8 times sales. That's pretty expensive... wait excuse me... the word I'd use is just wow. Assuming revenue grows at 123% year-over-year (based on the trailing 9-month growth rate), revenue for FY 2014 will be $218.54 million. So, on a forward P/S basis, the stock is trading at 41.18x. That's a little more reasonable, but understanding whether growth has already been priced in or if there's more upside is subjective at the present moment.According to the LendingClub prospectus:Currently, LendingClub has a $6 billion loan portfolio when compared to the $390 billion in outstanding consumer credit that would meet LendingClub's criteria. However, the growth story doesn't end there - the company can expand into mortgages or auto loans, based on its discussion of longer-maturity credit, which is typically associated with collateralized loans. In this hypothetical scenario, perhaps anyone can own a small chunk of a mortgage security or car loan.The argument for owning LendingClub comes down to many factors. One being the premium that would need to be paid over the current market cap assuming a larger company with some strategic value showed interest. Companies that come to mind: PayPal (NASDAQ:EBAY), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Visa (NYSE:V), and MasterCard (NYSE:MA).However, LendingClub could grow into its valuation. For example, let's say that over the next five years, LendingClub has $50 billion in debt in originations and earns a 1% to 5% fee on that amount. The revenue generated would be $500 million to $2.5 billion. Let's go with the midpoint at $1.25 billion, use an applied sales multiple of 15x and perhaps the valuation reaches $18 billion.Admittedly, I'm presenting a hypothetical for the sake of illustration. It's not an actual prediction. However, over the next five years the stock may support a higher market cap, even at a significantly lower sales multiple. This indicates that there may be enough upside to merit a long-term investment consideration.Therefore, LendingClub is a buy because it has much less exposure to the business cycle when compared to banks and has significant growth prospects due to its marketplace business model. However, LendingClub's high valuation and limited trading history adds some uncertainty to the stock. So this investment may not necessarily be suitable for all types of investors."

This is $50 million more than during the same period in 2013.According to analysts at Sterne Agee, Lending Club boasts even steeper growth than Alibaba and there is ""very little"" that will slow down the growth of Lending Club's multi-year prime-based installment loans.In the field of non-traditional lending, Lending Club far outstrips its closest competitors. Prosper, the second largest P2P lender in the country, has only funded $2 billion in loans since it was incorporated, at the same time as Lending Club.In April, Lending Club sold shares privately to T. Rowe Price Group Inc., Blackrock Inc., Sands Capital and Wellington Management Company to fund a $140 million purchase of Springstone Financial LLC. Springstone Financial loans money for private school tuition and elective medical procedures.The increased use of P2P lenders surged after the 2010 financial crisis as traditional banks have scaled back personal and business lending due, in part, to heavier regulations. These regulations have sent many borrowers to P2P lenders, an industry seeing similar growth to e-cigarettes: an industry also helped by regulation as attested by ecigsopedia.The success of the P2P model, pioneered and used successfully by Lending Club has caused concern over lost revenues with traditional banks. Profits on lending have decreased as regulations have increased. Small businesses are turning to non-traditional lending at a faster rate than expected.Lending Club executives have been busy promoting the upcoming IPO over the last month. That is one of the major reasons the price range has increased.Getting in on the ground floor of this IPO will see investors making money, either through short sales or over the long term. Bank regulations are not decreasing and more people will turn to P2P lending to finance personal needs. More and more businesses have begun turning to P2P lending to raise capital for improvements and expansion."

LC believes that its diverse and customizable investment options give it the flexibility to offer attractive risk-adjusted returns that are uncorrelated with other asset classes.LC competes with other online credit marketplaces, such as Prosper Marketplace, Inc. and Funding Circle Limited. LC is the world's largest online marketplace connecting borrowers to investors, which it believes provides LC with a major competitive advantage. LC believes that its network effects and marketplace dynamics at play make it more attractive and efficient to both borrowers and investors.LC anticipates that more established internet, technology and financial services companies that possess large, existing customer bases, substantial financial resources and established distribution channels may enter the market in the future.LC believes that its brand, scale, network effect, historical data and performance record provides it with significant competitive advantages over current and future competitors.5% shareholders pre-IPOJeffrey Crowe 16.3%Rebecca Lynn 9.2%DividendsNo dividends are planned.Use of proceedsLC expects to receive $512 million from its IPO and use it for the following:to use the net proceeds to it from this offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and capital expenditures.LC also expects to use a portion of the net proceeds to it to repay in full the indebtedness outstanding under its term loan with several lenders led by Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., which LC entered into to fund a portion of the cash purchase price of Springstone.Disclaimer: This LC IPO report is based on a reading and analysis of LC's S-1 filing, which can be found here, and a separate, independent analysis by IPOdesktop.com.

2743415,24597,2014-12-09T16:02:40-05:00,"Unique business model makes estimation difficult but investors can look to other finance companies for guidance.On strong sales growth, the challenge will be controlling costs and improving margins.Sales could reach $1.1 billion by 2017 with EPS of $0.92 per share and a target of $28.","Lending Club (NYSE:LC), the largest peer lending platform in America, will likely start trading Thursday and the range of analyst valuations is bound to be widely dispersed on uncertainties in the industry. While comparing growth potential against other industries like those in traditional banking and consumer lending can help guide expectations, there are enough differences to make sales and profitability estimates difficult. I have included my own analysis along with an infographic for Lending Club stock below.On my analysis, shares could trade around $15 a share this year with a target of $28 per share by 2017.The peer lending giant announced earlier this month in its S-1 Registration with the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) that it would raise up to $796 million for Lending Club stock at a price between $10 and $12 per share. At the high end of the range, the company would be worth $5.6 billion on a fully diluted basis. The company announced earlier this week that it had raised the target price to between $12 and $14 per share which would raise nearly $1 billion from the sale.While Lending Club is the first true peer lending company to issue shares, we can use other financial companies to value Lending Club stock. The table below shows data for stocks of companies in three comparable financial industries.From a comparison of other financial companies, we can begin to draw a picture of what sales growth and profitability might look like for Lending Club stock a few years down the road. One note on the table: I have chosen to show the comparables' margin on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) which is more commonly used for valuation but very similar to operating margin for finance companies.Mid-size banks would seem a good comparison for Lending Club. Both make loans to retail consumers and small businesses but that is really where the similarity ends. Banks take deposits, invest those deposits in loans and make money off the spread in interest rates. Lending Club does not actually originate its own loans and does not take deposits. Its revenue comes from transaction and servicing fees as well as management fees for fund accounts. Lending Club does not invest its own money in loans and takes no credit risk.I've also included Business Development Corporations (BDCs) as a comparison with Lending Club stock. These companies collect investor funds to make investments in small and mid-sized companies, much like a private equity firm. They take business and credit risk when they invest or loan to these companies and generally pay out high dividend yields to their investors.Although business models differ, I like BDCs as a comparison for Lending Club stock for their similar roles in picking up the slack of slower bank lending over the last several years. Increasing regulatory burden has limited traditional bank lending to consumers and businesses since the end of the financial recession. As regulatory oversight continues to change lending in the country, the distinction between BDCs and peer lending platforms may begin to blur.Comparing Lending Club stock against other consumer loan companies would seem the natural choice but the publicly-traded companies are a mix of payday loan stores, auto financing and other specialty companies.Encore Capital Group (NASDAQ:ECPG) is a pretty close comparable for Lending Club stock, especially in its earlier days as a buyer of charged-off loans. The company went public in 1999 with total revenue of $28.1 million and a compound growth rate in sales of 101% over the previous three years. The company had an operating margin of just 6.6% and was still unprofitable. By the third year after the IPO, the company had maintained a 47% compound growth rate in sales, increased its operating margin to 29% and was profitable. Even more than a decade after the company's public offering, sales are still growing at a compound rate of 30% a year though the company's operating margin has not changed much.Revenue could continue to grow on market potentialLending Club grew sales by 190% in 2013 and is on track to do it again this year. Loan originations jumped 192% to $2.1 billion in 2013 and the company originated more than a billion in loans over the three months to September 2014.Even on that explosive growth, the peer lending space is just a fraction of the $3.3 trillion consumer loans market and has plenty of room to grow. The company has just started dipping its toes into the small business market and there is no reason to believe that peer lending cannot grow into other loan types as well, i.e. secured auto and home loans. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), there are more than $292 billion in commercial and industrial loans outstanding with balances under $1 million. The money raised in the IPO could go a long way to paying for growth projects as well.The Lending Club stock registration does not specify what the company might do with the money raised from the public offer, potentially upwards of $1 billion. The company only has $1.8 billion in debt, about a third of its capitalization, so I wouldn't expect it to rush to pay down leverage.The company calls out expansion into other loan types and geographies within its growth strategy. With the boom in student loan debt past $1 trillion, refinancing loans would seem a clear choice for the company's expansion. Lending Club acquired Springstone Financial in April which opens up the market for medical expense and private education lending. While international growth may be further off, the peer lending movement has done very well in the United Kingdom which could be a first stop in the company's geographic expansion.I would expect the company to continue to spend money on lobbying state governments to lift prohibitions on borrowing and investing. Five states do not allow borrowing on Lending Club and 12 states prohibit investing on the platform, though all but five allow indirect investing through a Foliofn account.I am estimating growth to increase through 2015 on penetration into new markets and loan types before slowing slightly. Still, a compound rate of 180% over the four years to 2017 yields $1.12 billion in sales with plenty of growth potential further down the road.Operating ProfitCurrently, Lending Club makes just $0.075 for every dollar in sales. That's well below the $0.30 in operating income that other consumer loan companies make but mostly due to heavy spending on product development and other expenses. Management should be able to get a handle on these as the company matures.Stock-based compensation jumped to $15.3 million in the first six months of 2014, leading to an operating loss. Almost half of the increase ($6.5 million) was due to the Springstone acquisition so not recurring. The remaining increase still represents an increase of more than 35% on the amount spent in all of 2013.Heavy marketing this year has accounted for about a third of the increase in operating expenses. Sales and marketing expenses jumped 147% to $23.7 million in the first six months compared to the same period last year. Marketing expenses will likely be a significant expense over the next several years as the company grows.I am estimating the company's operating margin increases each year to about 30% in 2017, comparable with other consumer loan companies but well below the margin at Business Development Companies. Since Lending Club does not originate loans itself and may not need as much staffing as a traditional finance company, it may be able to reach much higher margins than traditional consumer loan companies.Share Count and DilutionsLending Club reports in its most recent S-1 registration that there will be 154.19 million shares outstanding after the IPO but excludes approximately 31.56 million shares related to stock options, warrants and other compensation. I have included these shares and increased the shares outstanding each year to account for future stock compensation and capital raising.Just over 1.8 million shares were exercised by four executives in 2013 for a value of $5.3 million. The company allows employees to participate in its stock purchase plan at a discount of 15% to the fair market value.Earnings per ShareLending Club made a profit in 2013 though higher operating costs resulted in a loss for the first six months of 2014. For comparison, shares of Encore Capital Group were priced at 24.1 times trailing earnings in 2004 for a premium of 27% on the valuation of the S&P 500. That was when the company was only growing sales at approximately 30% a year versus the high growth expected for Lending Club stock over the next several years.My assumption for earnings per share is built on an estimate for 12.5% net margin in 2014 increasing to 19.5% by 2017. This may prove low if management can grow sales while controlling costs but I like to be conservative in my estimates. My estimate for the stock price from $15 per share on the IPO to $25 per share in 2017 is based on higher earnings but a progressively lower price-to-earnings multiple. A price-to-earnings multiple of 28 times in 2017 is still relatively high but not out of the question considering the high sales growth the company could still be experiencing.Risks to Lending Club StockA ton of estimates go into stock valuation, especially for a company as new as Lending Club in an industry as new as peer lending. I have based my own estimates for growth off of the company's prior growth and the potential in the market. Estimates for profitability have been based off of margins achieved at other consumer loan companies and Business Development Corporations.Lending Club does not originate its own loans, instead relying on its agreement with WebBank. This puts it at risk of relying on one single originator or that it will need to seek other partnerships.While the market for pure peer lending is dominated by Prosper and Lending Club, the company still has to compete with other firms providing loans from their own capital and with traditional banks. With the cost advantages to peer lending and its small share of the lending market, competition should not be a significant risk for the next couple of years.Peer lending has largely escaped regulatory costs so far but there will likely come a time when agencies take a closer look at the industry. When this happens, Lending Club may either choose to accept higher regulatory costs or may restructure its business to further avoid them. Either option would likely change estimates for sales or profitability.There's bound to be more analysis on Lending Club stock after the IPO and high uncertainty in key factors likely means that price targets will range by quite a bit. While I am positive on the long-term outlook for Lending Club stock, investors may want to be cautious about jumping in on the first day of trading. To avoid getting caught in the market's enthusiasm for new shares, set a maximum price at which you want to buy the shares. The price range set by Lending Club for shares is only slightly above a valuation the company received earlier this year and the stock is likely to jump on the first day.If the price of Lending Club stock jumps past your maximum buy price on the first day, be patient and consider setting a buy order for shares if the stock price comes down. We'll follow the stock along with the industry on this blog."
2742985,20324,2014-12-09T14:03:56-05:00,"The purpose of this article is to pinpoint LendingClub's core value-creating FinTech, which is at the intersection of scoring and loan funding.We rate LC a buy generally on the basis of its FinTech to drive future deal flow, rather than current financial metrics, such as unit margins.The article also highlights other areas of value-creating FinTech that LC has left untouched.","LendingClub (NYSE:LC) is a San Francisco-based online peer-to-peer lender. On Wednesday, December 10th, 2014, it is scheduled to price 57.7 million shares for between $12 and $14 a share and will begin trading on the NYSE the next day.This IPO will raise $900 million for the company, be the second largest IPO of the year behind Alibaba's (NYSE:BABA) whopping $21 billion offering and be one of the top 10 technology IPOs of all time.Based on the upper range price of $14/share and about 370 million shares outstanding after the IPO, which includes an 8.7 million share option likely to be picked up by underwriters, LC will have a market value of $5.18 billion. Yet, the company currently is GAAP and EBITDA unprofitable and will remain so for the next year or two.Despite its short-term profitability prospects, what makes LC so valuable today is its proprietary, innovative and, last but not least, value-creating ""FinTech"" - applications of computer and software technology to financial services that, for whatever reason, traditional financial institutions have failed to adopt.We rate LC a buy generally on the basis of its FinTech to drive future deal flow, rather than any current financial metrics. We also rate it a buy based on the size of its target market - $882 billion (with a 'B') in outstanding revolving consumer credit, which many consumers seek to refinance.The purpose of this paper is to pinpoint where and how LC's FinTech creates value.If this IPO is successful, and all indications are that it will be, it will open up a floodgate of other IPOs from companies touting their FinTech and claiming enormous valuations despite no profits. For stock market investors, it is important early on to distinguish between proprietary, value-creating FinTech and easy-to-replicate and/or whiz-bang, fluff FinTech.In its Amendment 3 to Form S-1, LendingClub lists six different areas that it applies FinTech: (numbers added are mine)The purpose of this article is to present the case that LC's most value-creating application of FinTech is at the intersection of scoring and loan funding.The second is the speed at which the whole intermediation process takes place. Beginning-to-end speed enables LC to avoid balance sheet risk, so deadly in the past to traditional financial institutions, who were slow to tranch, securitize and sell bought mortgages in the prior decade. Indeed, isolating the value of beginning-to-end speed may be impossible as there would be no viable business here in the first place without it.Specifically, the core of LC's value-creation is a more granular scoring than banks (""Base Risk Grade"" A to G) of credit card and other debt refinancing applications based on a proprietary algorithm, and a more granular array of refinancing rates based on these scores.LC bundles these loans into tranches based on scores and offer lenders, via securitized notes or directly, more granular investing options than previously.Based on S-1 data, the following table represents the core of LC's FinTech innovation:LendingClub - Interest Rates on Standard Loans as a Function of Base Risk Grade, October 2014Basically, LC is doing a better job than banks at matching credit card rates to consumer risk profiles and cherry-picking the A-to-D consumers by offering, according to its S-1, an average of 680 basis points (6.8 percentage points) below existing rates. E-to-G consumers, if they qualify at all, are offered refinancing rates above their current rates and are likely to decline LC's loan offer.At the same time, investors, lately financial institutions more than individuals, eagerly buy A-to-D tranches even though the loans are 680 basis lower than what consumers previously paid. This is because the risk profile has been granularized by LC to such an extent that the risk-adjusted rate of return for these A-to-D tranches has proven to be favorable relative to other offerings in the marketplace.The following table is derived from a LendingClub information sheet for prospective investors found on their website:LendingClub - Investor Nominal and Net Adjusted Rate of Return as a Function of Base Risk Grade, October 2014 for loans made in the last 18 monthsWe complete the article with our case against other areas identified by LC as sources of FinTech innovation and value creation. These areas are loan origination, data gathering, scoring and loan servicing.LC's online loan application process significantly reduces origination costs and is quantifiable. According to its S-1, its ""adjusted contribution margin"" was a very healthy 44% of trailing 9-month revenue. Adjusted contribution margin is revenue less origination and sales and marketing costs. It excludes engineering and G&A and stock-based compensation, which is substantial especially in the quarter before this IPO.Origination and sales and marketing costs, net of stock-based compensation, as a percent of total loan flow was a mere 2.14% for 9 months trailing. This compares with a reportedly 5%-7% for traditional brick-and-mortar loan origination operations.While impressive, the real source of LC's current valuation is the expectation for rapid scaling of deal flow, not unit margins. Deal flow is a function of LC's ability to offer consumers significantly lower loan rates.LC's customers are, by and large, refinancing credit card debt. Origination fees are a one-time negative and a minor portion of the total financing costs. Cutting origination costs in half through FinTech is not the source of LC's current and future deal flow.Nominally, there is nothing very innovative about FinTech or LC's data gathering. They start with FICO scores purchased from traditional agencies. According to their S-1, they supplement FICO scores with ""behavioral data, transactional data and employment information."" But LC is vague (intentionally?) about what this data is, how it obtained it, and how it enhances credit decisions.Does LC data mine customer Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), LinkedIn (LNKD), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) accounts? Can they get at customer cookies? Do they feed this data into a proprietary ""spendthrift"" algorithm? If so, we would be impressed. But, we just don't know the extent of LC's use of FinTech data gathering.In addition, according to their S-1, LC does little to no independent verification of data supplied on applications.LC definitely has a proprietary FinTech algorithm that spits out loan scores. But it is not the scoring algorithm per se that is innovative. It is the granularity of scores and related interest offerings that sets it apart from traditional banks issuing credit cards and making unsecured, small denomination consumer loans.And it is the more granular tranching of consumer loans by score that is the innovative and value creator on the investor side.Finally, there is nothing very innovative about FinTech or LC's loan servicing, other than insisting that all loan repayments be remitted via ACH to avoid the more costly paper check in the mail approach that banks lazily accept.LC has its own in-house collection teams that work delinquent loans for the first 30 days, but according to its S-1, it outsources subsequent servicing efforts to traditional collection agencies.There is no mention of any FinTech way of dealing with delinquent accounts, such as automated text messages or use of social networks to shame them. (How about @bobsmith is #LCdelinquent tweets?) Or offering 100 basis point credits on loans in return for being able to post on your Facebook page that you are delinquent?Seriously though, LC has left many opportunities out there for start-ups to apply value-creating FinTech in the area of data mining and verification relevant to credit scoring and decisioning and use of texting and social media to improve collections."

        New Finance, peer-to-peer lending and payment options are changing banking.
        Now, wealth management is starting to change with several new startups.","Well, the payoff is near! Lending Club is hitting the market. And, the payoffs are huge.I have been writing for several years now about the changing technological landscape related to banking…and other financial institutions. The world of financial services is going to be different…and there is much money that is going to be made in the process.Look at what Tracy Alloway and Arash Massoudi writes about in the Financial Times: Lending Club, a peer-to-peer lender is coming to markets with an offering price of $10 to $12 per share.Larry Summers, former Secretary of the US Treasury has almost one million shares in the company. Ching…ching…ching…. About $10 million in value!John Mack, former head of Morgan Stanley, has 2.4 million shares. Ching…ching…ching…. At least $24 million in value!Mary Meeker, formerly an internet analyst at Morgan Stanley and along with her current employer, the venture firm of Kleiner Perkins, has, along with Kleiner Perkins, 14.3 million shares. Ching…ching…ching…. At least $143 million in value!And, as I have written before…follow where the ""stars"" are going….Vkikram Pandit, former CEO of Citigroup, who is an investor in Orchard, and has brought along Mr. Mack and Hans Morris, who worked at Citi and was the former president of Visa. Orchard is building a platform where investors can trade p2p loans.And, then there is Mohamed El-Erian, former chief executive officer at Pimco is a lead investor and board member of the p2p platform Payoff.In other areas, there is the ""hot"" payments area with the split-off of PayPal and start up of ApplePay.But, now look at the area of wealth management. Take a look at this article on Nutmeg, a tech startup that is aiming at becoming ""a product leader"" in the area of wealth management. Nutmeg has been created by Nick Hungerford, a graduate of the Stanford Graduate School of Business and a wealth manager for Barclays Wealth in the UK.""Like Amazon.com, Nutmeg offers an online, low-cost service; and like a traditional wealth management firm, the start-up has professionals who invest money on customers' behalf. However, they do not provide advice, which would be more expensive and involve an extra regulatory burden.""""Nutmeg potentially opens up money management to the masses because it is affordable.""Part of the secret to the low cost operation is that Nutmeg uses Exchange Traded Funds.""The rise of ETFs is an ""inevitable wave"" because fund managers have performed too poorly for too high a price.""And, the stars…A prominent Silicon Valley investor, Tim Draper, who has invested in Hotmail and Skype, joined the team. Following Mr. Draper, venture fund Pentech signed up and this was followed by Nigel Wray coming on board. They John Kay, an economist and Financial Times columnist joined. Then Europe's second largest asset manager, Schroders, got involved…and then, Balderton Capital.These may not represent the star power of Larry Summers, John Mack, and Mohamed El-Erian, but, it goes a long way.Although Nutmeg is located in England, there are American organizations attempting to enter the on-line wealth management area. For example, the article mentions the fact that SCM Private has ""launched online portals tailored to different demographics seeking money management expertise."" Wealth Horizon is another group that ""aims to provide basic financial advice for consumers at a low cost.""This whole area is growing daily…and more and more of the bigger players are finding a place for themselves in the effort.

The company expects to put slightly less than 1/6th of its shares on the market to raise between $550 and $800 million, giving the company a market cap somewhere between $3.5 billion and $5 billion. The company is a leader in the new peer-to-peer lending industry, a revolutionary industry that has the potential to challenge the traditional financial system. The company works as a marketplace more so than a loan originator - it matches borrowers with an investor or a pool of investors who have agreed to loan their own money to the borrower.Typical investors in the marketplace include individual investors, institutional investors, accredited investors, hedge funds, pension trusts- essentially anyone who manages money. Among other requirements, Borrowers must have a minimum score of 660, and a debt-to-income ratio below 40% (excluding mortgages). Loans are either 36 months or 60 months long, and are approved on a scale ranging from A1 to G5. Interest rates correspond to the loan scale ranging from 6.03% for an A1 loan all the way to 26.06% for a G5 loan.The company's main source of revenue is through origination fees, noted as transaction fees in the prospectus. This percentage ranges from 1% to 5% based on the loan and is included in the APR for the borrower. The other major source of revenue for the company is servicing fees, a 1% fee paid by investors every time a payment on a loan is made on time. Lending Club acts like a bank in some respects- they approve the loans that are placed on their marketplace, and they are responsible for collecting loans that are in default- although investors pay an extra collection fee on any late payments that are collected based on the past due length of the loan.IntroductionI first heard of Lending Club when NPR ran a story on the phenomenon back in May 2013. As a millennial, I came of age during the financial crisis and share my generation's general mistrust of the traditional banking system. At the time, I was also looking to add some diversity to my investment portfolio, and so I immediately recognized the opportunity that peer-to-peer lending and Lending Club offered as a new asset class. After some research, I decided to open an investment account with Lending Club and haven't looked back.Every month, I put a little money in and buy a few more loans. With a minimum of only 25 dollars a note, it is easy to get started and easy to diversify. Through owning a diverse and large set of notes, I have managed to stabilize my rate of return around 8%. As an investor in the Lending Club marketplace, I have been very pleased with the company, the rate of return, and the relatively small transaction fees. So, when I received an email offering to take part of the IPO as part of the Directed Share Program (DSP), I was extremely excited to review the prospectus and declare my interest in participating in the IPO. After reviewing the prospectus, I still feel strongly that Lending Club, and peer-to-peer lending in general, has the potential to disrupt the financial system and steal a considerable amount of market share from the big banks.A Disruptive BusinessThe main reason that I am drawn to this IPO is due to the potential that peer-to-peer lending has. Since the financial crisis, the general population has increasingly developed an irrevocable mistrust of the current financial system. Unfortunately, there has never really been another place for the average borrower to go to finance their debts. With the advent of the peer-to-peer lending market, this has slowly begun to change. Companies like Lending Club and Prosper now offer the average American another avenue to take when raising capital.In its current state, the peer-to-peer market has thrived because it can offer consumers smaller loans that banks are less inclined to offer, loans that come with less collateral. As such, most loans offered on the peer to peer market today are debt refinancing, home improvement, small business loans, and similar. Borrowers cannot take out a loan larger than $35,000. This approach has allowed Lending Club to beat the interest rates on similar loans from banks, which are considerably higher due to the lack of collateral banks look for.With this strategy, Lending Club has established themselves as the leader in the industry, and position themselves to expand with more loan offerings in the future. They have proven that the concept of peer-to-peer lending can work, have consistently provided above average returns to investors, and are developing brand awareness with their consumers. With its current loan offerings, Lending Club has a significantly large market opportunity.Long term, the prospectus states that the company intends to increase its loan offerings in the future. If Lending Club can execute on its business plan and increase its loan offerings, it has the long term potential to penetrate a massive market opportunity and compete directly with the big banks.Growth on the Balance SheetLending Club is growing at an astonishing rate. According to the prospectus, the company only originated $51,815,000 in loans in the full year 2009. In the 9 months ended September 2014, the company originated $2,962,520,000 in loans. Year over year the growth of loans originated is still impressive, sitting at approximately 120%. Due to the business model, revenue grows very similarly to loans originated. Revenue over the first 9 months of 2014 has yielded $143,861,000, approximately 130% year over year.This outstanding growth shows that consumers and investors both believe in the potential of the peer-to-peer marketplace. However, despite the growth in revenue and originating loans, the company has become unprofitable again after a profitable 2013. While concerning, it is not uncommon for a new, high growth company to take a while to stabilize earnings growth, and in my opinion the return to unprofitability is mainly due to a large increase in marketing.If marketing is successful, it should only allow the company to continue growing and establishing itself as a market leader. Indeed, marketing is singled out in the prospectus as one of the areas that is critical to the success of the company.Conclusions and RisksQuite a few risks are singled out in the prospectus, including marketing failure, net losses, failure to successfully introduce new loan products, margin pressure, and limited operating history, among others. Many of these risks are consistent with new companies on the market, and many of these risks are consistent with high growth stocks.The prospectus goes into further detail on these specific risks. It is also worth noting that many have speculated that the peer-to-peer lending system will lead to a higher rate of default. While it may be too early to tell for sure, this article has collected data on both Lending Club and Prosper, and has shown that the average default rate has been around 5% for the past three years.These risks are very real and investors should not take them lightly. While the company will come to the market with a decent market cap, I believe the long-term market opportunity is significantly larger. Considering the risk and the future market opportunity, I believe that investors can be patient with Lending Club. Unless you have the ability to participate in the directed share program and get into the company at the IPO price, I suggest that investors wait a few quarters to learn more about Lending Club's management and business plan.Personally, as a member of Lending Club I am allowed to participate in the direct share program and plan on initiating a small stake in the company. For those that do not have this opportunity, the patient approach will allow for much of the excitement that has accompanied recent IPOs to leave the stock and lead to a better entry point down the road. In the meantime, I recommend investors follow this story and track Lending Club's progress.I also recommend that investors look into using the Lending Club platform itself, especially if they are considering buying the stock down the road, as it will allow them to get a first hand look at the business and see why the peer-to-peer lending industry could be so revolutionary. It will also allow them to add a new fixed income asset class to their portfolio that can generate strong returns."

I had projected that they would rather wait to hit the $100 million revenue mark before listing. And looks like, they did just that.Lending Club’s OfferingsSan Francisco-based Lending Club claims to be the largest online marketplace in the world that connects borrowers and investors. Their platform has helped provide more than $5 billion loans since inception in 2007.Lending Club’s platform has simplified both the borrowing and lending process for the industry. The platform automates the process of application, data gathering, credit rating and scoring, loan funding, investing and servicing, regulatory compliance, and fraud detection. Additionally, investors can purchase incremental shares in loans in multiples as small as $25.They have also opened their platform to bigger financial institutions like banks, asset managers, insurance companies, and technology companies who can use this to transact on the marketplace and meet investment needs of their end-clients. While Lending Club does not disclose details, analysts believe that the company, as well as the industry, is seeing a lot more lending by institutional investors compared with the original peer-to-peer model that it was set up for. The trend is attributed to the wealth and analytical skills of these cash-rich investors who are able to judge and pick up the higher rated loans faster than the smaller, peer investors that the industry was designed for.Lending Club has managed to do so well because of the higher returns they offer their investors. Investors investing in notes with the highest three ratings have seen historical returns of 5%-8.7% compared with fixed income options which have been operating at rates less than 3%. An investor investing through Lending Club can thus have access to the higher return notesEarlier this year, Lending Club announced the acquisition of Springstone Financial for $140 million. Springstone focuses on providing affordable financing options for people looking to finance private education and elective medical procedures. They have a network of more than 14,000 schools and healthcare providers and have facilitated more than $340 million in loans. The acquisition will help them expand their footprint to more individuals.Lending Club’s FinancialsLending Club earns revenues by charging their customers a servicing fee for the transactions conducted on their platform. They have seen significant growth over the last few years. Loans originated from their platform have grown from $717.9 million in 2012 to $2.1 billion in 2013. For the six months ended June this year, that number increased 125% over the year to $1.8 billion. The increased loans have resulted in revenues growing 190% over the year to $98 million in 2013. For the six months ended June 2014, revenues increased 134% over the year to $86.9 million. Their adjusted EBITDA has also improved from a loss of $4.9 million in 2012 to $15.2 million in 2013. For the six months ended June 2014, adjusted EBITDA improved from $3.8 million to $5.9 million.Lending Club is venture funded with $392.2 million from investors including Black Rock, T. Rowe Price, Sands Capital Ventures, Coatue Management, SDT Global, FinSight Ventures, Google Capital, Foundation Capital, Amidzad Partners, Canaan Partners, Norwest Venture Partners, Morgenthaler Ventures, SVB Financial Group, Gold Hill Capital, Union Square Ventures, Thomvest Ventures, and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Their last round of funding was held in April this year when they raised $65 million at a valuation of $3.8 billion. That is a significant increase over the $1.5 billion valuation they were at in May 2013.They are now looking at going public and have filed to raise another $500 million. They are expected to list before the end of the year on the NYSE under the ticker LC."

Over 46 million shares changed hands in the first day of trading with the stock closing up 56.2% at $23.43.Let's look at the background behind this company and why you may want to consider purchasing shares at the beginning of its growth story.What LendingClub does, and why it mattersLendingClub, founded in 2006, helps expedite what is known as peer-to-peer (P2P) lending through an online lending platform. P2P lending circumvents traditional banking and allows individuals or groups that may not qualify for a traditional loan to obtain a loan from others.P2P lending is quite appealing to those who wish to bypass the heavy regulations of banks and higher interest rates. LendingClub does not actually make loans themselves, like a traditional bank, but rather collects small fees for the use of its service. This removes much of the risks associated with lending practices for LendingClub.According to the Economist, LendingClub is currently the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform. Usage of the service is growing, with $5 billion in loans made through the service since 2007. Revenues are also headed in the right direction, as LendingClub generated $87 million in net revenue in the first half of 2014 - $50 million more than during the same period in 2013.LendingClub's operating performance pre-IPOSource: LendAcademy.comWith this in mind, why should individual investors consider investing in LendingClub? By buying LendingClub shares, you are getting in on the action of a large, multi-billion dollar network of individual P2P loans that will be sure to grow in the future, as more small businesses turn to P2P loans. In the non-traditional lending sector, LendingClub is, by far, the powerhouse of the pack. Prosper Marketplace, the second largest P2P lender in the country, has only funded $2 billion in loans since its founding in 2005.An investment in LendingClub is comparable to an investment in Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) before the Internet became widespread. Amazon used to be purely an online bookseller in the infantile stages of the Internet's development. But then, things changed. Amazon and other middleman companies like it created a new marketplace that has immeasurably helped buyers and sellers and proven lucrative for the middlemen. LendingClub is the best positioned firm in the budding field of peer-to-peer lending and is set for much success in the future.The bear case…and why it's wrongHowever, there are two sides to every story. The bears have laid out a seemingly convincing case for why LendingClub's risks outweigh any potential benefits. So let's look at the key points raised against LendingClub's business.TheStreet.com's Eric Jackson, a bull on LendingClub, presents perhaps the most common complaint lodged against the company:John Carney of the Wall Street Journal actually believes these bearish sentiments.However, there are two ideas that contradict the notion that LendingClub will play hard and fast with the rules.LendingClub doesn't have financial liabilities at stake if a loan fails.One of the causes for the government-created financial crisis of 2007-2009 was that banks took too many risks loaning their own money. LendingClub, on the other hand, does not loan its own money; it is simply a platform for individuals to make loans to each other. Carney admits as much in his article:Somehow, Carney thinks this is a negative, when it is actually a huge positive, as the next point proves ...LendingClub needs to protect its good name.LendingClub now has thousands of shareholders to consistently please as well as the numerous consumers reliant on their program. After all, the foundation for the company's business is the people using the service to loan money through its platform. So, while LendingClub doesn't have any ""skin in the game,"" it does need to keep customers walking through the metaphorical doors.LendingClub doesn't make interest rates higher, but lower, thus significantly decreasing the likelihood of individuals defaulting on their loans. As Jackson states:Through higher efficiency, LendingClub helps decrease costs for everyone involved.The other main reason why bears encourage investors to defer buying shares of LendingClub is because of valuation metrics. Critics have questioned the sustainability of the company's estimated valuation of $5.0 billion. The short answer to these concerns is that LendingClub's valuation is reasonable in comparison to its peers, its earnings growth and earnings potential.The long answer can be seen in a very well-researched analysis by Ho Wan Lee, CFA, CAIA, and a senior associate in Arcstone Partners LLC. In this piece, Lee goes step-by-step through four different valuation scenarios, and concludes:Moving forward, it's more likely than not that LendingClub can continue to outpace analyst expectations, as the company has high leverage in the relatively new peer-to-peer lending industry.ConclusionLendingClub currently stands as the global leader in the infantile peer-to-peer lending industry. More and more consumers are bypassing the highly-regulated banking industry in favor of P2P loans to finance their personal needs. Despite concerns about the nature of personal loans and LendingClub's valuation, I believe the company is poised for considerable future growth and will steadily increase shareholder value over the long term."
2267253,24579,2014-06-13T07:40:37-04:00,Impact of an IPO on Lending Club.Impact of Lending Club IPO on direct lending in general.Performance of recent IPOs.,"Initial Public Offering: Three words that represent both the ultimate fantasy for entrepreneurs and one of the riskiest bets for investors. With sustained rumors of Lending Club becoming public before the end of 2014, let us reflect about what it will mean for the company, for investors and for direct lending in general.Wait, Lending Who?With a valuation at $3.8B at its last round, Lending Club is one of the most valuable private companies in the U.S., and one of the largest direct lending (also called 'peer lending') marketplaces in the world. Direct lending is the practice of lending money to unrelated individuals through an online marketplace. Such a system benefits from low operating expenses, which translates into both lower interest rates for borrowers and higher returns for lenders.In a way, direct lending is not lending without banks; it's simply a new kind of bank. Fundamentally, a bank is a financial intermediary whose business is to monetize transfers between a surplus and a scarcity of money. On one side are people with money, but no immediate need for it. On the other are people who need (or want) money now but don't have it. The bank gets deposits from lenders, transfers them to borrowers, then at payback, keep a big cut and return the rest. Although the oldest modern bank, located in Sienna, is 'only' 600 years old, the principle of banking as we know it today appeared more than 4,000 years ago in Mesopotamia. What has changed in the last 10 years is using Internet instead of brick-and-mortar buildings (or stone-and-mortar, since we're talking about fancy financial institutions). In a way, Lending Club is a modern bank, the same way Expedia is a modern travel agency.Saying that Lending Club is on a roll is an understatement. The amount of loans they're issuing is doubling every 9 months. So far they've issued more than $4B. It may be the most spectacular IPO of 2014.When it will happenThere are rumors of an impending Lending Club IPO since more than a year already. Considering nothing is official yet, it cannot happen in less than 4 months (3 months from S-4 to end of road show, plus 40 days of quiet period). IPO activity is also quite seasonal, so an IPO before mid-September is also very unlikely. Google search data shows a peak in IPO-related queries 3 weeks before the IPO becomes official. Since the term 'Lending Club IPO' is currently trend down, it probably won't happen before Q4, which is also, as shown by historical data, the busiest quarter of the year.What's Next for Lending ClubWhen the company becomes public, a lot of things will change for Lending Club:First, as of today, residents of only 26 out of the 50 U.S. states can invest in Lending Club. The registration of securities offerings by Lending Club (the loans that lenders invest in) is done on a state-by-state level. Some states deny such registration, which means their residents cannot access Lending Club, at least its primary market. However, once Lending Club is publicly traded, it will benefit from a so-called 'blue sky exemption' that means state-level registration won't be required anymore; all 50 states will become instantly eligible. That means increased competition for the best possible loans.Second, Lending Club will have to align with public companies' reporting requirements, and that may collide with the spirit of total transparency they've demonstrated so far. We can see that in effect even before the IPO: up until April 2014, Lending Club was updating its publicly available statistics on a daily basis. Now they update such data on a quarterly basis only.Third, with the money raised, Lending Club will be able to accelerate its growth alongside 2 axes. They will be able to acquire specialized lenders or even small banks. The growth-limiting factor today is money demand, not money supply. In April 2014, Lending Club took over a 'traditional' lender specializing in medical and tuition financing, Springstone Financial, and it wouldn't be surprising for them to consolidate their leadership with similar acquisitions after the IPO.They will also have the muscle to expand to other kind of loans. Besides consumer credit, Lending Club also started offering small business loans in March 2014. Once public, they can get more than enough resources to expand to education, real estate, or purchase lending.That being said, the one unlikely expansion is geographic. Not only is the U.S. market gigantic by itself, but between different regulations and the lack of easily accessible credit scores, foreign countries are hard to penetrate. Besides, Lending Club's CEO Renaud Laplanche told international wasn't a priority.What's Next for Direct LendingIf the Lending Club IPO is as formidable as it should be, it may act as a catalyst for the direct lending industry and pave the way for more action to follow. After all, Renaud Laplanche said, ""The main reason we are considering an IPO is to use it as an opportunity to raise awareness for the company and better establish the brand.""Prosper, the second U.S. marketplace, could maybe do an IPO of its own in 2016. Awareness of direct lending will grow considerably. There are over 50 direct lending marketplaces already, but with a successful IPO even more will sprout. Besides, the cost advantage of direct lending is here to stay: first, traditional banks make little progress in term of efficiency (according to a McKinsey study, 70% of the top 500 banks did not make any progress in term of efficiency between 2009 and 2012). Second, regulations such as Basel III put lots of limitations on lending from balance sheet. These limitations are avoided in direct lending, since the money lent by marketplaces isn't even theirs.What's Next for traditional lendersToday, direct lending represents less than 0.2% of U.S. consumer credit, so even if Lending Club's IPO has a tremendous impact for its industry, the short-term effect on public lenders will be limited. That being said, since it will bring the spotlight on the disruption of traditional credit, investors will become increasingly bearish towards traditional lenders.To Buy or Not to BuyHistorically, IPOs are not good for retail investors. See these amazing interactive graphs on betterment. An anecdotal example is the well-publicized Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) IPO: one year after becoming public in May 2012, the stock was down 32.6% while the S&P500 increased by 22.6% over the same period.On the first day(s), without the ability to get stocks at the introductory price, individuals usually buy them too high and just before institutional investors flip theirs.That being said, as shown by this graph from Tableau, profitable companies tend to fare much better, especially in the last decade. In one year, Tableau (NYSE:DATA) itself went from $50.75 to $57.66, a 13.6% increase, even when the first-day quotation was way above the introduction price of $31.00.Lending Club could represent an excellent investment as a stock as well.

They are all information based businesses that have been displaced by the internet. Looking back at the story of the US economy during the turn of the century and most people will agree that the dominant trend will be the internet disrupting large, information based products like these.As Lending Club's CEO, Renaud Leplanche, states in a Lending Memo interview:The financial industry could very well be the next one up for a ride. Every interaction of the financial industry is currently being re-evaluated, from transactions with Paypal, to fundraising using Kickstarter and even currency itself using Bit-coin. The site you are on Seeking Alpha is itself is a perfect example of a crowd-sourcing financial advice, which simply couldn't have happened a decade ago. While I'm not totally convinced that all these 'innovations' will turn out to be genuine improvements, there is one that merits your attention. Partly because of its upcoming IPO, you should be thinking about Lending Club.Lending Club is the current leader in the emerging industry of Peer to Peer Lending. This phenomena first emerged in the UK as a way to facilitate loans being made from one person to their peer, using the internet.Peer to peer lending is the natural development of applying the internet to finance. This is the emergence of an industry not limited to one or two companies which suggests to me that this is more than just a short term fad. Along with peer to peer lending, micro-finance organizations for charity like Zidisha have popped up using the internet to give individuals access to funding otherwise un-available in developing world. Out of this developing field two major players in the U.S. that have shown staying power are Prosper and Lending Club. In 2008 during the financial crisis, the SEC required these companies to register their loans as traded securities, and offer re-sale on a secondary market which ended up suspending new loans from being issued and forced the UK based company Zopa out of the US market.After adjusting to the new regulations, both companies were able to resume issuing loans near the end of the financial crisis of 2008-2009 with Lending Club taking the lead as the largest, best run Peer to Peer Lender in the US. Lending Club had originally been formed by Renaud Laplanche in 2007 partly ""after he became irked by the massive disparity between the 18% interest rate on his credit card bill, and the 1% savings rate at his bank."" Leplanche then collaborated with Oracle co-worker Soulaiman Htite in 2006 and initially tried to issue loans through Facebook but later realized they would have to build their own platform.Potential- Since then Lending Club has continued to issue more loans, gain financial strength as well as recruit prominent financial industry leaders to their Board. John Mack former CEO of Morgan Stanley and Lawrence Summers former chief economist at the World Bank, Simon Williams former Citigroup head of Global Consumer Risk are the more notable recruits.Probably strongest indicator of their success in the continued increase in number of loans facilitated which more than doubled from $600 million in 2013 to $2 billion in 2014 and they very well may keep on growing. CEO LePlanche says:Risk: Part of Lending Club's strength has been their conservative approach to the loans they issue by requiring a high FICO and other other metrics that make returns consistent and reliable. There will be a challenge to continue to maintain this high quality without increasing fees as they expand into other states and into larger business loans. The increasing volume of loans will likely add traffic to their website which will need to improve and adapt to remain easy to use yet able to handle new loan types and increased traffic. As the company gains greater visibility they will have to manage security and legal risks similar to large online banks.As an investment, Lending Club has enormous promise and is growing at an surprisingly consistent pace, but it should also be remembered that it qualifies as a high risk start-up that has only 1 year of producing more money than it is taking in. This is an industry that 10 years ago wasn't even an idea and it has never paid a dividend and is untried in its long term performance. With revenue of about $100 million and net income for the first time becoming positive around $7 million in 2013 this company has a long way to go before living up to the $1.55 billion dollar valuation heaped on it via the $125 million investment by Google, $15 million from Kleiner Perkins and others. For the long term investor it will likely take years and overcoming large setbacks for Lending Club to be profitable for its investors. It is by no means a sure bet during a bull market in an economy artificially propped up by a massive federal stimulus.Initial Public Offering's in general are not usually a great way to find profit, as Seth Klarman explains in ""Margin of Safety"":Or as Warren Buffett has stated in different ways on multiple occasions:His own history speaks even louder as he grew his wealth without having to purchase an IPO. I also I remember a quote from his mentor Ben Graham (I think) where he quips that what IPO really stands for is ""Insiders Play Only.""Despite the typical IPO drawbacks, I think that for every 100 or so overvalued new issues there may a few good ones hidden in the mix if you have the if you have the time, acumen and patience to identify them. I think Lending Club is one of them if we can take LePlanche at his word, Lending Club isn't actually going public because they need the cash but only ""to use it as an opportunity to raise awareness for the company.""Re-cap: Because Lending Club is run using the internet, it will continue to take market share away from banks, credit card companies and other traditional lenders by offering better rates to individual borrowers and lenders. Although Lending Club is a company organized around the internet and has a culture that will give them this competitive advantage, it is still an untried business model in an emerging industry. This company is not purely about making more money so much as participating in the greater cause of reducing people's personal debt and losing less money in unnecessary administrative and bureaucratic costs that have built up in older financial systems. I have used Lending Club's service as an investor for about 6 months and I think it holds real potential for making the world a better place because it will enable borrowers to get better interest rates and lenders to get above a 1% return on their savings.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

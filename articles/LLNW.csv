In a world where almost every tech company is beating earnings, some by a vast margin, and then getting sold off, we can't help but think this is more ""the market"" than it is directed at LLNW.However, this argument doesn't hold water when you look at the drop overall, 50% from recent highs, and that likely CAN'T be based solely on the market. We believe the market downturn only exacerbated this drop. Did fellow peers drop? Yes, they did actually. Fastly (NYSE:FSLY) has also dropped over 50% from its recent highs, and oddly enough, it is following LLNW almost identically when looking at technical charts and order flow to the downside. One can argue that the eerie similarities here might be just a sector coincidence, others feel something larger might be at play, but that is all speculation. Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) has dropped mildly and so has Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) from recent highs, so the sector IS in fact seeing some pressure.Regardless of the overall factors at work here, the valuation of Limelight is SO INCREDIBLY CHEAP and ABSURD today, it's a likely target for acquisition, and though of course this is all speculative, we will explain our logic.Building out a CDN network to deliver one's content is an ideal approach for a content provider looking to cut long-term costs. One can look at Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and see that it built out its own CDN years ago when it saw the macro trends heading in this direction. The company used to use third-party CDNs, Limelight and Akamai included, but decided to build its own for longevity and cost cutting.How much does it take to build a CDN? Per some digging I did and speaking to experts in the field, to acquire the ISP contracts all over the geographical locations one wants and to build out POPs or contract data center usage, the process is rather expensive. The estimate is that it takes roughly $500 million to $750 million to build a ""no frills"" standard CDN. That structure would get your media from point A to point B, while having minor buffering issues, some latency issues, but overall be ""acceptable"" for most consumer usages.The owner would still have to pay for bandwidth, but they would get much better deals of course and more control over pricing if they took out the ""middleman"" of a third-party CDN. Most third-party CDNs, in fact the majority of them, use public networks and strong relationships to do the cost cutting for content providers and make it easy on them to not have to worry about all the supply chain issues. While doing that, they stand to make some decent margins as ""middlemen"" in this process.How LONG does it take to build out a CDN? Experts in the field say it takes on average between three and five years to build out the ""no frills"" CDN. This includes negotiating contracts, acquiring some equipment and setting up POP locations, as well as partnering with data centers globally for delivery. Then, you have to add in the long process of creating software that drives the whole network and has enough features to ensure seamless delivery not to mention security protocols for safeguarding of data and content across public access lines.Those processes take a very long time and so does applying for and acquiring the global license agreements for governments and municipalities worldwide to approve operations in their respective jurisdictions. This is how long it took NFLX to do it itself. Lucky for the company, it started back 10 years ago working on all this, so of course it stayed ahead of trends. But what about companies that are just accepting the vast changes TODAY?Today, you have around 47 CDN networks in operation around the world. Of these 47 CDNs, only two have built out their own ""private"" network. Limelight Networks is one, and a private company is the other to which there is very limited information. What are the benefits of running your own private backbone operations with your CDN?So why don't private networks get built out if they are superior? COST and TIME. You can see above how long it takes to build out a public, ""no frills"" CDN, but a private one takes MUCH longer and is MUCH more costly which is why it was seldom done. It was cost prohibitive to build it out this way when time is of the essence.Being one of the oldest CDNs in the space, Limelight Networks is very well known in the industry. It works with many OTT providers, has ad-supported options, live TV streaming platform, edge computing, edge functionality for optimization and customization as well as a myriad of IP and patents. Again, it is one of the ONLY CDNs with its own private network operating today.Given today's macro trends, as mentioned earlier, big content providers like Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are at war and pushing ""all in"" on streaming. Both of these giants are currently in a content war with each other buying movie rights and launching ""streaming only"" blockbusters. Think ""Mulan"" on the Disney side and Amazon acquiring the rights to ""Borat 2"" and ""Coming to America 2"". This war is only heating up, but the funny thing is, while Amazon has its own CDN via AWS, it also uses Limelight HEAVILY and make up for over 30% of Limelight Networks' revenue.Given its massive use of Limelight Networks platform, it could easily acquire LLNW and use it to enhance the AWS CDN by a multi-use HYBRID CDN with a private network backbone. You can read about the benefits of a private CDN with mixed use public/multi CDN strategy here.Obviously this approach could save Amazon tens of millions on its CDN costs and create several cost synergies along with strengthening its AWS and CDN offerings for the coming decades. Amazon would also greatly increase its latency and double up on a feature-rich offering of superior quality. But what about Disney?Disney is not new to the streaming space, but it has come on VERY strong in the last six months. Just a few weeks ago, Disney announced officially it was going ""ALL IN"" on streaming and completely changing how it will deliver its content in the future with theaters on the outs. Disney is at a disadvantage here forced to use third-party CDNs to deliver its new trajectory business decision, but wait, why not just purchase Limelight Networks, have your very own private CDN with sub-second latency, and grab a huge advantage over any of your competitors by saving four years and a billion dollars of costs by just getting all that done in one swoop of Limelight Networks at an obscene valuation?Well, the content providers are definitely eyeing up the CDNs to maximize profits, control over their content, and hurt the competition a little, but what about other CDNs? The CDN space is RIPE for consolidation. In the age of streaming, the biggest players are now fighting for accounts, and when they fight each other for accounts, it brings pressure on margins. Dropping prices and pressure from large clients and small clients alike is becoming commonplace in the CDN industry.When looking at the CDNs in the space, we know that AKAM already tried to buy LLNW years ago, and when that transaction fell through, they sued them instead. Kinda spiteful, but it is what it is. That all got worked out in a settlement that is finally put behind LLNW, but would it be an ideal suitor now? I don't think so. AKAM has done amazing for itself and is chugging right along and is really the one to beat in the space. NET has a very solid offering and is also doing very well for itself. I don't think it would benefit most from an acquisition of LLNW.That leaves FSLY. I've been eyeing the movement in FSLY as mentioned at the beginning of the article and FSLY has been tracking LLNW almost identically. Very odd. But that made me think of what a transaction might look like. You can look at FSLY's offerings and LLNW's product offerings and make a very distinct observation that they would complement each other VERY well. They seem to have only a few clients that overlap, so no cannibalism of business really. FSLY targets smaller companies and smaller videos and files more than larger streaming like LLNW. Plus, FSLY's network is public and more geared towards higher margins and efficiency than sub-second latency and quality as LLNW's.Being a public network, FSLY had to pay big for Signal Sciences because on a public network, it needs top-notch security. LLNW doesn't have this problem, and instead focused on helping content providers stop piracy with watermarking and other digital ""tricks"" for illegal viewing and downloading. Why did it focus on that? Because it is running on a private network not having to worry as much about network hacking and infiltration.Forming an all-stock transaction where FSLY issues one share for four LLNW shares would lead to something like 25% dilution, but in this type of transaction, FSLY would be buying an 80% revenue boost, a private network with a myriad of powerful tech additions, the ability to run a hybrid private/public network, gain access to LLNW's Chinese delivery licenses, and so many different ways to cut costs and give synergies to improve margins. Not to mention, the profitability of LLNW would pull up FSLY's bottom line while FSLY's raging top-line growth pulls up LLNW's already fantastic growth even higher.COULD FSLY DO IT? Absolutely it could, and it SHOULD. FSLY has gotten a hold of a very large investment base that it could and should easily tap for rapid growth. Purchasing LLNW at current valuations is 100% an extremely wise investment at this point in time given all the money the market has given FSLY access to and its thirst for wanting to buy cheap revenue and massive growth prospects.That type of transaction makes so much sense that we feel it would almost be foolish for FSLY NOT to do it. Then, it would give birth to a ""major player"" in the CDN space with roughly 520 million a year run rate, steady growth, higher margins, and an unbeatable network under FSLY's aggressive management assisted by Limelight's amazing tech focused staff and contact list. We could easily see a union of this nature trading in the $150+ share range within a matter of months given how powerful they would be in unison.Let's continue to assume the transaction between FSLY and LLNW is a marriage made in heaven and they get off their chairs and do it, does it solve some major issues? Yes, it does. Not only does it solve the issues mentioned above about technology synergies, a hybrid CDN formation, and being able to go toe-to-toe with NET and AKAM, but it also basically solves one of the biggest problems facing BOTH LLNW and FSLY, concentration risk.Let's take a look at why FSLY dropped when it put out a lowered guidance for Q3. It was specifically aimed at lost revenues from TikTok, its largest customer. Conversely, Amazon is Limelight's largest customer with about 30% of its revenues. In fact, 77% of LLNW's revenues come from 20 clients, and some of this is also seen on the FSLY side of the equation as well.A merger of these two companies cuts their concentration risk IN HALF and immediately. TikTok would no longer be 18% of FSLY revenues, if these two companies combine, it would drop significantly down to only 9% of revenues. For Limelight, if the merger took hold, Amazon would drop from 30% of revenues down to 15% or just under that number. This gives the combined entity so much more stability and so many more moves for pricing power and competition without the major risks associated with client concentration. It would also bring them power in the CDN space which attracts even more big clients as they become more competitive and stable with a superior combined product offering made much more robust.Potential risk factors must always be considered. In this case, the obvious risk factor would be LLNW continuing to go about its business on its own. It is growing revenues, but having pressure on margins in a highly competitive market. A second risk factor to consider, as mentioned above that a merger would clear up for both parties, is concentration risk. That would remain a high risk given current portion of revenues coming from large clients if there was any deterioration with those partnerships. We don't anticipate any deterioration, but it must always be considered.Looking at Limelight Networks with a market cap of $440 million as of writing and the costs and time associated with building out a similar network, it's easy to see how saving the time and money would be ideal for multiple content providers or other players in the space.While Limelight Networks stays at these crazy low valuation numbers, it is likely a target unless it pulls itself up on its own before a strategic transaction can occur and gets back towards $6 to $8 where we see it less likely to get acquired. Given a possible valuation of $1 billion to $1.25 billion, a steal for both buyer and target, a buyout in this modest range would be Limelight Networks' valuation between $8.20 and $10.25 pps. It also has no debt and $125 million in cash, or roughly $1 per share in cash as of the end of Q3."
4377751,22786,2020-10-05T22:56:02-04:00,"Limelight rose, then fell sharply, after its second-quarter earnings report.Opportunity for growth in the CDN market.Price target of $8.00 explained.","When Limelight Networks (LLNW) reported strong quarterly earnings in July, the stock topped over $7.60 a share. That euphoria ended when the company, whose market capitalization is $683 million, issued a convertible senior note offering worth $100 million two days after the stock’s jump.Now that LLNW stock is in a firm downtrend, what will it take for investors to get bullish on the company’s prospects again?Limelight could have let its stock trade higher for a few weeks following the earnings report. At $7.75-8.00, shareholders would get slightly less diluted and the company would get more from the convertible.Chart from Seeking AlphaPlus, current shareholders had to suffer from the selling pressure that followed. Limelight stock continued to fall through to early September, finding support at $5.00. Although it rallied again later that month, investors who sold to breakeven pressured shares again.Limelight demonstrated strong performance in the second quarter when it reported revenue growing 28% year over year. The company's GAAP net loss improved by 76% Y/Y. Its adjusted EBITDA was over six times higher than last year. On the conference call, CEO Robert Lento said that its balance sheet remained strong. This contradicts the capital raise that immediately followed. In the near term, shareholders will have less trust for the CEO and management.The CEO said that COVID-19 spurred higher demand for the Internet and content delivery. Investors of CDNs, or Content Delivery Networks, are already getting rewarded for their investment. Fastly (FSLY) and Cloudflare (NET) are two stocks up 377% and 151% year to date, respectively. Both firms are valued at over $10 billion by market capitalization. Limelight is a very small fish in a big pond.Limelight trailed its peers in the YTD periodData by YChartsIn Q2, traffic rose when Comcast’s (CMCSA) launched NBCUniversal’s Peacock in April. AT&T’s (T) WarnerMedia launched HBO Max in May. As the online streaming war intensifies and cable firms try to take Netflix’s (NFLX) market share, Limelight will benefit. Since it reported Q2 results on July 20, Q3 results should come at around October 20 or later. Ongoing physical distancing restrictions and work from home will drive CDN demand. LLNW is poised to beat consensus estimates again and attract buyers after the report.Limelight launched the second major release of Limelight Realtime Streaming in the second quarter. By the end of this year, it will have Realtime Streaming v.2.0. The company said that customers need to deploy the solution at scale “to deliver sub-second latency online video to audiences on any device they are using.” With lower latency, live sports events will have no delivery delays to the viewer. Online gaming and live auctions also need the lowest latency. In the latter case, a firm like DraftKings (DKNG) will need something like what Limelight offers.Limelight posted the highest Q2 revenue in its history at $58.5 million. Executive Sajid Malhotra said, “as a result of the global pandemic, the video-on-demand business is growing at an above-average rate and live events related traffic is well below normal levels.”LLNW said the CDN market is worth $6.9 billion. Its primary focus in OTT video and online gaming is a $5 billion market opportunity. If the company can sustain market share growth, its long-term annual growth should be no less than 15%. If investors assume a spurt in revenue growth this year and 15% annually thereafter, the stock is worth around $8.00 a share:Model courtesy of FinboxBy clicking this Finbox link, investors may change their assumptions and overwrite the figures above.Limelight raised the low end of its adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $28-35 million. This, plus the convertible notes sale, will give the company plenty of resources it needs to invest in its growth.As a practical example, features such as EdgeFunctions will enable customers to include watermarks or insert ads as needed. Increasing demand for video delivery will lead to a higher need for A/B testing of such complex ads. Customers will need Limelight’s solution.Limelight is still a company that must prove itself. Its margins of 40% last year did little to move shares, which traded in the $3 range for the first nine months of last year. Margins should improve to the 50% range and higher as management focuses on the edge services and CDN business.LLNW stock is off the $6.33 rebound price but is still in an uptrend. Shares may rally ahead of the earnings report, rewarding investors who held the stock through the recent correction."
4373807,104418,2020-09-11T15:43:11-04:00,"Some competitors are growing revenues very quickly and gaining more investor attention because of it, but the cost of revenue growth shouldn't be profitability.There are multiple approaches to how companies choose to grow, and while one way draws much more market love, the other is much more stable and secure.We are digging into the numbers and interviewing management to dispel some of the myths in the CDN industry and clear the air.","As a supplement to this article, our team did an interview with Limelight's CSO and CFO. Link posted below for listening. We wanted to thank them both for their time and assistance.The CDN industry has been under the spotlight the last few months as a strong shift in the digital world gains traction. More and more content providers are turning to streaming solutions to stay ahead of the trend, which is very smart. Linear TV, as in the normal cable and satellite type of content delivery we have come accustomed to, are on a death spiral and the direction for survival is clearly streaming and digital delivery.We suggest opening positions in the future of digital infrastructure. Specifically in the CDN space and even more specifically in ticker LLNW or possibly AKAM. While both are excellent picks, we think LLNW is the ""Goldilocks"" of all the CDN competitors in the space and will attempt to show you why.Source: Image SourceIn reality, we've seen this show before. You can easily see the iterations of this evolution from previous moves. Let's bring up VHS to DVD (hopefully we didn't lose anybody on that one that doesn't know what VHS is). For argument's sake, I will completely gloss over Beta Max to VHS.This should take your mind back to the days of early 2000's when VHS tapes became phased out as DVD's took hold. DVD's were smaller, didn't have to be rewound constantly, held up better in regards to durability, and the video quality was far better. As DVD's got integrated into video store shelving, the VHS section kept getting smaller and smaller. Eventually in 2005, VHS was all but gone from any video store ever. That was a quick turnaround.Then, we moved to phase 2. When DVD's moved to BluRay discs and streaming at about the same time. BluRay posed a much higher quality content viewing, but kept the same portability and durability as a DVD. Sony's Blue Ray beat out the competitor's HD DVD in the high def disc market. There was a time when you could get either format on the shelves for a short while.But streaming took it to a whole new level. On Demand wasn't a new concept, but the level of On Demand that took hold was really a stark change. Netflix had done DVD disc delivery via the USPS for a few years. That's when they really started eating Blockbuster's lunch, but it didn't stop there. Blockbuster was actually given a chance to buy into a streaming package with Netflix before it officially launched as a partner before streaming gained steam, and they passed at the chance. We actually used Blockbuster and Netflix as a case study in business school. It truly is one of the stories of stubbornness to adapt to change that will go down as a major example in history of refusing to grasp new trends and move forward to stay relevant as times change.HBO and Pay Per View had done big events on an On-Demand platform for years, but having a subscription service with essentially unlimited On-Demand options is a true ""game changer"". That game is still in its evolution today with so many services going to streaming. The premiere of ""Mulan"" on Disney+ which partnered with several streaming services to help facilitate delivery was a first of its kind. Charging a subscription fee and then an extra $29.99 on top of that to get a first peek at a blockbuster ""Mulan"" remake before it's released anywhere else. This completely bypassed theaters which that in itself is a huge move to digest. Pre COVID-19, something like that would likely have never been thought of, but times, they are a changin'.Well, you can either invest in the content creation companies themselves, like Disney, Sony, the major networks, or even Netflix which is creating content now. Or.... you can invest in infrastructure. Think of this in parallel with not investing in Walmart or Amazon when they went heavy into online orders, but instead investing in Fed Ex and UPS.See, if you invest in a CDN, you are essentially investing in the content delivery networks, which is exactly what CDN stands for. It doesn't matter what your clients charge or how they choose to expand their offering to stay competitive, they simply pay you for bandwidth like a toll booth via contracts or even like midstream energy companies. For instance, Amazon has contracts with UPS. UPS doesn't care what Amazon charges for products or how they expand, UPS gets to move those packages around the world regardless. The CDN's do exactly the same thing. They move content around the world through POP servers, Point of Presence, and increase their technology offering to make delivery of content as seamless as possible.We introduced CDN's in our first article about LLNW. It can be read here .LLNW has chosen the road of profitability with modest growth versus the other road being aggressive growth while sacrificing profitability. Investors today often want to see revenue growth, revenue growth, and even more revenue growth, but don't seem to care about how that growth is achieved. This is a HUGE mistake which I am hoping to help correct now. Revenue growth is in fact great and highly sought after, but that growth has to be HEALTHY growth.Healthy growth should be described as helping clients expand, and spending some money to expand one's network if the bandwidth loads are reaching critical mass in certain emerging markets. LLNW has done exactly this by expanding POPS heavily into Latin America and India recently. But companies like FSLY are acquiring their growth through acquisitions and fierce sales and marketing efforts. You can't really blame them I suppose, the market has given them an insanely high valuation and thus, capital funding is right at their fingertips as the market gave it to them, they have only to tap it via offerings.But this type of money isn't actually free. Investors are willing to put their money up if the company keeps putting up huge revenue numbers. But those revenues come at a hefty price and may not be HEALTHY. Let's take a deeper dive. Recently FSLY acquired Signal Sciences for beefing up its security offering on its CDN network. Let's look at the numbers a bit, but it looks like a very expensive acquisition across all metrics and perhaps they bit off more than they could chew here.Fastly agreed to pay $775 million for the acquisition - a significant amount relative to its scale. Let us also point out, that FSLY paid this amount, which is currently higher than the total market capitalization of LLNW which makes as much as FSLY currently does at time of writing this article. Let that sink in a second.In addition, it offered $50 million in restricted stock to retain Signal Sciences employees. By comparison, Fastly generated $75 million of revenue during the second quarter, up 62% year over year, and it has yet to become profitable. Also, cash and equivalents amounted to only $384 million at the end of the last quarter.Including the $50 million retention pool for Signal Sciences employees, the price of the transaction corresponds to nearly 30 times Signal Sciences' $28 million annual recurring revenue at the end of June. That represents a steep price, even in the context of the company's strong growth. Management said Signal Sciences posted a ""faster annual revenue growth rate"" than Fastly during the second quarter. But in this space, buying a company for 30X run rate seems absurd. Then you look at Limelight Networks trading at 2.4X revenue run rate with solid growth and you have to ask yourself what sounds like the better deal here?However, Fastly will use its expensive stock to finance a sizable part of the transaction, which is a smart decision that will help offset the deal's high price tag. Consideration will include $200 million of cash and $575 million of Fastly, but that's a hell of a lot of money for a 30X multiple on the backs of investors. FSLY is already trading at its own crazy high valuation of 28.86X revenue run rate at time of writing.So I have to ask again... a bargain in buying a company trading at 28.86X revenue already that just paid for another company trading at over 30X revenue run rate spending a ton of investor money... for what? Surely they are very profitable right? Wrong again.We took the below chart from macrotrends showing trailing EPS growth.Source: Macrotrends.net EPS ComparisonYou can see from the above chart, the while revenue growth for FSLY is very rapid, their earnings per share are highly negative. They are trending up, but at these profitability levels, there is no way a near 30X revenue run rate is justified here. AKAM's current revenue run rate to market cap puts a valuation of 5.7X revenue run rate at time of writing. AKAM is a beast of a company too, and happens to be the MOST profitable of the 3. It is honestly a very good investment at current prices and given profitability and growth.But this argument isn't necessarily for AKAM, though it's a very good deal at 5.7X we focus on LLNW. Currently, LLNW has MORE profitability than FSLY but slower growth. Though it has faster growth than AKAM, it has lower profitability. What do I call this? Baby bear. It's not too hard, or too soft, but Baby Bear's bed is JUUUUST right! Being right in the perfect place where profitability and growth intersect is right where one want's to be positioned in this environment in our honest opinion.Let's put profitability into perspective another way. Company A makes 250 mil a year and so does Company B. Company A banks 20 Mil a year off that 250 and company B loses 20 mil a year off the 250. Does it really matter if company B grows a little faster than company A if they can't keep any of that money as profit? I seem to get this problem... too many others don't. This is so much a disparity in the market place, that Company B IS STILL valued at 15 times MORE than Company A in my scenario. But, I don't think the valuation gap between Company A and Company B lasts too much longer.So I bring it back to reality. How undervalued is LLNW? Well, it currently trades as of today at a measly 2.57X revenue run rate. Less than HALF of AKAM and less than 9% of the valuation given to FSLY. That valuation is ludicrous. Let's go back to Baby Bear this thing. Let's say given its profitability compared to AKAM and FSLY and its growth compared to those two as well, it truly deserves to be somewhere in the middle. If AKAM is 5.8X and FSLY is 29X, it is reasonable to say that LLNW should be trading somewhere around 17.4X revenues, right smack in the middle. But let's be even more conservative and shave off 30% of that just to be on the safe side, that gives you 12.18X revenues. This puts a fair value on LLNW at $2.9 billion or a $24.36 pps stock price.Let's take a quick look at the enterprise values of Limelight Networks with growth numbers plugged in per management's discussion of conservative growth metrics.Source for the above image: https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/50093457-best-on-the-street/5495669-limelight-networks-tortoise-and-hareWe were very very conservative and called for $15 to $20 in our last article in the next 12 months. We truly feel the upcoming catalysts will drive shareholder value and the stock price far higher and in short order.Included in these catalysts are:We feel that hands down, LLNW provides the absolute best value in the CDN sector today and rate it a STRONG BUY, SCREAMING BUY, or TABLE POUNDER. Pick your poison. We also rate AKAM a MODERATE BUY. While we aren't bullish at all on NET or FSLY, we give them a NEUTRAL rating as we have no idea how long the market will be irrational and inflate their stock prices, but given what we've seen lately in stocks like TSLA, for all we know they could move even higher too."
4342760,24594,2020-05-04T13:48:55-04:00,"LLNW has faded into and out of first quarter earnings.
        Investors no doubt expected more from guidance, given tailwinds from higher Internet and streaming video usage.
        The longer-term story isn't broken, but as has been the case for years now, Limelight needs to deliver on margins and manage competition.","I got Limelight Networks (LLNW) wrong. I turned bullish (and went long) the stock at the beginning of last year, in large part due to the secular growth potential for the CDN (content delivery network) provider. But after a 2019 guidance cut in July — an echo of the issue that tanked the stock seven months earlier — I exited, due to worries about both management and the broader story.LLNW would take off not long afterwards as results improved. Though shares fell with broad markets in March, a sharp rally ensued as investors identified the stock as a derivative play on the streaming video/Internet traffic growth being priced into the likes of Netflix (NFLX) and Zoom Video Communications (ZM). The stock very nearly doubled in a month.But LLNW once again has reversed, with last month's Q1 release extending what is now a 27% pullback from the highs. And what's interesting is that the story in May 2020 isn't all that different from what it was in January 2019 — even though LLNW has more than doubled.That story is simple. On paper, Limelight has a large opportunity to be a ""picks and shovels"" kind of play on streaming video and Internet traffic. But in practice, management concerns and a long-running inability to drive consistent profitability cast some doubt on that opportunity.The Q1 release at least highlighted those worries, a likely reason why LLNW has slid 12% since. And it leaves LLNW as, once again, a 'show me' story — even if it's a better 'show me' story than it was 16 months ago.The fundamental culprit driving the post-earnings sell-off appears to be full-year guidance. Despite significant increases in traffic since the last update, with the Q4 release in late January, Limelight's outlook barely budged:source: Limelight Q1 releaseOn an absolute basis, neither profitability nor normalized free cash flow (which is maxing out around $10 million) look particularly impressive. And this is guidance for a year in which Limelight is receiving likely the largest tailwind in its history. The combination of both shut-in consumers and streaming launches from Disney (DIS), AT&T (T), and Comcast (CMCSA) should be driving enormous demand. And, again, COVID-19 hasn't led to any change in guidance, save for a $2 million bump to the low end of the range. That bump probably is attributable at least in part to Q1, given that revenue increased 32% year-over-year.To be fair, the story is not quite that simple. CFO Sajid Malhotra addressed the outlook in his prepared remarks on the Q1 conference call:That move isn't out of character for Limelight. CEO Bob Lento admitted on the Q3 2018 conference call that the company had guided conservatively for some time (it evidently stopped just ahead of a Q4 outlook that disappointed investors and led the stock to the late 2018/early 2019 lows). Meanwhile, Malhotra's decision makes some sense in an environment where companies are pulling guidance left and right. In fact, rival Akamai (AKAM) withdrew its outlook after last week's Q1 release. And Lento noted in his prepared remarks that Limelight too faces a headwind from the lack of live sports content. There are some crosswinds at play at the moment. Still, it seems likely that investors were expecting, or at least hoping for, something more in terms of a short-term bump. And that may have been enough to offset the fact that Limelight did give solid mid-term guidance. Indeed, Malhotra calling out Wall Street for modeling in somewhat subdued multi-year growth. The CFO said he believed Limelight could get to $300 million by 2023, a year before consensus estimates suggest.But there, too, some investors no doubt were looking for more. $300 million-plus in 2023 suggests a four-year CAGR in the low double-digits from 2019's $200.6 million. That's doesn't seem to be quite enough to make LLNW a true 'pandemic play', or even necessarily to support a 50x multiple to the high end of 2020 EPS guidance. That's particularly true given that near-term growth is coming off a depressed base, with full-year revenue in 2019 up a disappointing 3% year-over-year. That said, it's possible investor expectations were too high and/or that the focus on a single quarter is a bit overblown. As far as Q1 goes, the boost to revenue only arrived in the last two weeks of the quarter. And the spike actually hit gross margins, as ISPs charge Limelight based on peak usage. Given those factors, Q1 seems like a strong quarter, and one that continues a steadily improving trend. As noted, 2019 was disappointing, but revenue growth was 37% y/y in the fourth quarter. Top-line increases will slow the rest of the year, in large part due to increasingly difficult compares, but at the high end of the revenue guidance range the Q2-Q4 growth rate still sits at 13%.The story isn't broken yet. Traffic demands are going to rise no matter how this pandemic plays out, thanks to streaming tailwinds. Limelight has invested heavily in capacity, but capex is coming down y/y in 2020 and will be lighter in the second half than the first. And though performance has been inconsistent, the decade-long trend is heading in the right direction:source: author from LLNW filings and press releases. 2020 figures at high end of updated guidance rangesThe broader opportunity is intact. The snapback in revenue and profits over the past two quarters makes 2019 look like an outlier (which was not guaranteed to be the case several months ago). Particularly after the pullback of the last few weeks, valuation is reasonable (more on this in a moment). To be sure, LLNW has more than doubled since early 2019 (and since late August). But the numbers have improved notably as well, and the story seems somewhat de-risked as a result. With the stock trading where it did before COVID-19 so dramatically altered consumer behavior, there's still a solid bull case here.But what's interesting is that peers, with one exception, haven't received much of a bump, either:chart since Jan. 31To be fair, Cloudflare (NET) has rallied, though obviously there's a significant cybersecurity aspect to that story. (Limelight's security offerings are delivered via partners.) The stories at Akamai and Fastly (FSLY) are a bit different from that of LLNW. Akamai's business is more diversified — it's not as much of a traffic pure-play as Limelight — and Fastly's valuation is much more onerous at a time when risk appetite presumably has decreased.Still, the simple bull case for CDNs — more streaming equals more traffic equals more profits — hasn't really attracted investors outside of NET. And that might make some sense. One difficult aspect of the CDN business is that pricing tends to decline over time. At least one analyst has projected that Disney alone will add to that pressure.Meanwhile, CDNs have had to spend up to build out the capacity required to manage the higher traffic, which pressured Limelight's cost of revenue even before Q1. Gross margin on a GAAP basis compressed 720 bps in 2019. And Limelight's capex will average almost $25 million over four years (including 2020, at the midpoint of guidance), a significant chunk of ~$29 million in Adjusted EBITDA (at the high end of the outlook).This case, then, is relatively similar to that which held at the beginning and middle of last year, when LLNW traded at about half the current price. The opportunity is there. Valuation isn't terrible, at ~17x EBITDA and 2.6x revenue (both using the high end of this year's guidance). If Limelight can drive revenue growth and associated margin expansion, there's upside ahead. $305 million in 2023 revenue at 17% margin (up from a guided 14.9% this year) suggests something in the range of 10% annual returns, assuming out-year multiples of ~15x EV/EBITDA and ~30x P/FCF. And we've seen (even now) enough small-cap tech growth plays run much higher than simple models might suggest.But at some point Limelight has to deliver real profitability. That in turn means it must actually deliver on its potential — which it hasn't always done. Guidance suggests 30 bps of EBITDA margin expansion, total, over a decade. The significant expansion from 2013-2014 lows came mostly from cost of revenue — where the improvement, as noted, has reversed. Competition is steep, and may add to the existing price pressure in the model. And I'm still not 100% convinced on the management front. Malhotra's criticism of Street estimates for 2023 seems a bit odd given that the CFO himself said there was enough uncertainty in 2020 to hold off a guidance hike. Nor am I exactly sure why analysts are supposed to be updating their models based on management projections when Limelight has consistently fallen short of its own long-term targets.As detailed in a January presentation (and not for the first time), Limelight aims for 15% year-over-year revenue growth and 25%-plus EBITDA margins. Yet margins are guided under 15%, and 180 bps below a 2017 peak. Meanwhile, top-line growth excluding Amazon (AMZN), which drove 30% of revenue in each of the last two years, was negative between 2016 and 2019. Guidance does suggest the 15% long-term bogey will be hit this year — but, again, off a soft compare.There's still a lot of work left to do, and a lot for Limelight to prove in order for the stock to rise. And one of its opportunities truly highlights the bull/bear case. The company is moving into so-called ""edge"" computing, and Malhotra talked up the opportunity on the Q1 call. In response to an analyst question, the CFO argued that the addressable market in edge was greater than that of CDN (though he rightly noted there are more competitors in the market). And he argued that ""if this is not a $100 million business three, four, five years from now then I think we would have missed something.""If edge is a $100 million business within even five years, Limelight is going to blow by Street estimates — and LLNW is going to rise nicely from here. But it's worth going back a year, to the Q1 2019 conference call. Management then, too, was talking up edge, thanks to a partnership with Ericsson (ERIC). Malhotra reiterated the aforementioned long-term targets, and emphasized full-year guidance that analysts at the time didn't quite trust. That guidance was missed and the Ericsson partnership is essentially dead. Despite that fact, the stock has more than doubled. It's safe to say, in a very different market, LLNW won't get the same benefit of the doubt if history repeats."

Instead of beating expectations like it did last quarter, Limelight’s CEO alerted analysts to severely disruptive headwinds ahead. It cited everything from Covid-19 risks to large customer order slowdowns. Limelight lost one-third of its value last week. The pre-earnings buy may have earned over 10% in gains but the investor lost the war as a buyer. What should investors do next?Limelight posted a non-GAAP EPS loss of a penny despite revenue growing 15.4%. The unexpected loss implies increasing competition and cost growth. The company did not manage the capex spend in the quarter, as sales declined. In the period, it raised $125 million through a convertible debt offering. The increased liquidity will offset the tightening credit conditions ahead. And while the pandemic is worsening, hurting credit markets, the Fed may jump in to ease investor fears.Below, LLNW stock cratered after the quarterly report:Limelight won several edge deals and continued to progress its strategic plan. For example, it expanded its developer community. This will improve customer uptake over the next few quarters.Some of its product enhancements, like Live Push, and the launch of its edge functions, will differentiate its offerings against the competition. Still, after Fastly’s (FSLY) drop in mid-Oct., investors do not want to pay a premium for LLNW stock. As shown below, the stock has several low scores in the Value category. Its overall value grade is a “C.” Data from SA PremiumCFO Daniel Boncel said it had one competitor lowering its guidance for the quarter. So, management “felt comfortable throughout the whole year with where we were moving as a company in the and the volumes we were seeing in the business and where the edge business was going.”The company expects a strong volume in the seasonally improved Q4 period. At a stock price of below $4.00, investors may wait until next quarter’s report before deciding whether to hold or sell.Limelight warned that it will accept lower margins in the near term. Adding capacity in new geographies and expanding capacity will increase its addressable market. But the company runs the risk of over-expanding and introducing geographic risks in less stable locations.Limelight forecast revenue of up to $240 million for this year. Its adjusted EPS is a 2-cent loss to an 8-cent gain. Despite the small market capitalization of ~$750 million, the stock’s valuations are high relative to its business risks. By comparison, Fastly has an $8 billion market cap, a better debt-to-equity profile of 0.06 compared to Limelight’s 0.56, and customers like TikTok.To keep its customers satisfied, Limelight is willing to operate at lower margins to sustain top network performance. This will pressure profits in the near term.CEO Robert Lento cited the new PlayStation, which starts shipping next month, as a potential contributor to its business. Investors will see this revenue in January 2021. Also, new streaming content this quarter rolls out for the fall season.Lento said, “we were hopeful that we were on the one yard line of closing actually hasn't closed and may not close till middle of next year due to some geopolitical things that have gone on with this company.” So, if the delayed deals close, Limelight has a good chance of posting better revenue figures.Investors may build a 5-year discounted cash flow growth exit model by opening this link.

4297586,24594,2019-10-21T10:00:13-04:00,"LLNW has bounced sharply from lows reached after a disappointing Q2 report in July.Q3 numbers were better, and there was some positive commentary looking forward - but the 15% post-earnings gains look like too much.There is a bull case here — but management concerns persist, and valuation suggests at least that the easy money has been made.","This article was selected to be shared with PRO+ Short Ideas subscribers - find out more here.I exited my position in content delivery network Limelight Networks (LLNW) after the company's second quarter report in July — and in somewhat of a huff. I'd argued ahead of both 2018 and the Q2 release, in particular, that LLNW increasingly looked like a binary play. That was true fundamentally, given the wide range of initial profit guidance for full year 2019. It was true qualitatively as well, given that a disastrous miss relative to fourth quarter expectations created questions about management's handle on the business.Q2 earnings seemed to cement the bearish scenario. They included a guidance cut which surprised absolutely no one: indeed, ahead of the release, the highest of six analyst estimates for full-year revenue was $5 million below the bottom end of guidance. Management commentary in the release and on the Q2 call seemed at best tone-deaf, as I wrote at the time. And even the lowered guidance seemed hugely aggressive — and even untrustworthy.Coming out of that quarter, LLNW looked every bit as binary, but with fewer reasons for confidence. And yet there still was an intriguing bull case. The growth of OTT video traffic, thanks to launches from Disney (DIS), AT&T (T), and Comcast (CMCSA) seemed to set to rise. Guidance theoretically was reachable, and easier year-over-year comparisons were on the way.Judging from the chart, that bull case has played out:source: finviz.comLLNW has bounced 73% since mid-August, including a 15% gain on Thursday after Wednesday's after-hours Q3 release. And yet I'm somewhat unconvinced the story is all that different than it was three months ago. Q3 earnings were better, but hardly spectacular. The bull case based on OTT growth isn't quite as simple as it seems. Full-year guidance still looks aggressive. Obviously, I'm disappointed I missed the rally - but had I stuck with LLNW for another quarter, I'd have exited after this quarter.My simple take on Q3 would be this: a 15% post-earnings gain would have made some sense had the stock still traded in the mid-$2 range it did in August. With the stock already up 40%+ heading into the release, however, and trading above $3, it seems like an overreaction.To be sure, there's some good news here. Revenue increased 4% year-over-year, returning Limelight to growth after three straight quarters of declines. A 12% sequential increase is perhaps more impressive, given that comparisons were a factor in the improving year-over-year trend. (Limelight walked away from some business last year, but lapped that impact in Q2.) Adjusted EBITDA strengthened notably, coming in at $5.8 million against under $1 million for the first half. Traffic was up almost 20% year-over-year, and per the Q3 call customer churn was down.The fundamental improvements seem to support an attractive qualitative case. At its Analyst Day in September, Limelight called out the explosive growth in Internet traffic worldwide. The company projected live video traffic would rise 15-fold between 2017 and 2022. Gaming and AR/VR (augmented reality/virtual reality) demand will rise nearly as fast. And as CEO Bob Lento noted on the Q3 call, the new U.S. streaming launches are particularly beneficial. Limelight has Disney and Apple (AAPL) as customers; Netflix (NFLX) runs its own network. So the coming launches should expand the market, and also provide some benefit to Limelight's share of video traffic. Limelight began emphasizing high-quality video last year (which, as noted, impacted revenue starting in Q2 2018), and thus seems well-positioned for that growth.That qualitative case was part of why I stepped into a steep decline in shares last year. Q3 results seem to show Limelight is at least headed in the right direction. Looking forward, the case looks set to potentially play out. Q4 results, at least based on guidance, will be even better, and potentially stunning: the reiterated full-year outlook implies a 35-59% increase in fourth quarter revenue, and well over 100% growth in Adjusted EBITDA.Even commentary on 2020 seems reasonably bullish. Thanks to software enhancements, Lento said capacity was set to increase at an even faster pace in 2020 than this year — when it more than doubled. An edge computing partnership with Ericsson (ERIC) has disappointed this year, and led to the post-Q2 guidance cut. But management seemed optimistic toward next year's results from those efforts, while demurring on reinstating original 2019 guidance for a revenue contribution of $7-9 million.CFO Sajid Malhotra said on the Q3 call that ""we believe the third quarter represents a turning point for the business"". It seems like investors agree - and I'll grant that there's some evidence for that interpretation.That said, some of the concerns I held in July hardly seem assuaged. Revenue growth is fine as far it goes, but this is a company that was targeting 30%-plus year-over-year growth in the second half, not just Q4. A 4% increase on the top line doesn't exactly mean the long-term plan is playing out. In fact, Limelight at its Analyst Day reiterated a long-term target of 15% revenue growth, including 8-9% from the base business. And the nearly 20% increase in traffic quarter-over-quarter led to just a 12% rise in revenue, which highlights one long-term issue here: pricing steadily decreases over time.Margins still are worrisome. Adjusted EBITDA did improve from the first half - but still declined 24% year-over-year. Gross margins were the key culprit, as they compressed 830 bps against Q3 2018. Malhotra said on the call that ""the worst [is] behind us"", noting improvements from first-half levels. But margins should improve as revenue grows, while the 10-Q doesn't seem to call out any one-time factors in the y/y compression. In fact, the filing notes higher co-location costs, which represents a reversal of savings on that front which had been a source of steady margin expansion earlier this decade. Here, too, long-term targets look enormously aggressive, with the company looking for 55% gross margins against a YTD 39% (down over 10 full points against the same period in 2018).In fact, the two core concerns heading into the quarter still seem to hold coming out of it. I'm not back to trusting management after the quarter, and the decision to reiterate guidance seems questionable. Historical seasonality in the fourth quarter and a very easy comparison (again, LLNW first plunged last year thanks to disappointing Q4 2018 guidance) both help. Still, the high end of the outlook suggests 59% top-line growth year-over-year, which appears exceedingly unlikely. The outlook in terms of Adjusted EBITDA (implied based on guidance for non-GAAP net income near breakeven) seems even more aggressive.Meanwhile, at the Analyst Day, Limelight again focused on analyst estimates instead of its own guidance, another example (as seen in the Q2 release) of Lento seeming to believe that Street projections are more important and more accurate than those of his own CFO. And after Q3, Capex guidance was raised for the second time this year, to $30 million. Lento in the Q&A attributed some of the increase to pulled forward spending, but highlighted other reasons which — as has been the case with so many proclamations over the past year — should have been known ahead of time, including higher spend per terabit relative to 2020. Malholtra followed up by noting that capex should return to the ""10-12% range"" as a percentage of revenue — which is not the 10% Limelight has set as a target repeatedly (including in September).The other issue is margins. Lento did lead an impressive turnaround here, with Adjusted EBITDA margins expanding from 1.3% in 2013 to 16.7% four years later. The issue, however, is that the expansion almost all came from cost of revenue - thanks to efforts surrounding co-location and bandwidth costs. The worry since has been that the turnaround left margins near a ceiling. Limelight is targeting 25%+, but guidance this year suggests something in the 12% range. If the margin ceiling really is even in the high teens (with 200 bps-plus in help from stock-based compensation), while capex is 10-12% of revenue, free cash flow margins look, and stay, relatively thin. They're almost certainly not enough to support an enterprise value that sits at about $450 million at the moment.Net/net, I do see the Q3 report, and Analyst Day, as positive. I get the attraction of the long-term story here (again, I bought the stock based in part on that story less than a year ago). Q3 is a step in the right direction. LLNW trades at a notable discount to the likes of recent IPOs Cloudflare (NET) and Fastly (FSLY).But even with that discount, LLNW is hardly cheap. EV/revenue is over 2x, which admittedly is notably below those faster-growing peers. But 2019 guidance suggests an EV/EBITDA multiple above 18x. The company will post an adjusted loss this year, based on guidance, and free cash flow YTD is negative $31 million.If Limelight can post 10%-plus revenue growth in 2020, which should get Adjusted EBITDA back above $30 million and adjusted net income into the black, there might be some upside ahead. But even in that scenario, LLNW still trades at ~14x EBITDA and ~2x sales. Neither seems notably cheap on either an absolute basis or relative to the stock's historical range.On the other hand, if CFO Malhotra is right, and Q3 is a ""turning point"", then the gains can continue. The company should have a multi-year traffic tailwind ahead of it. It's positioned itself for live streaming with an intriguing ancillary opportunity through its real-time offering, with obvious potential use cases with sports betting). Edge computing is another driver, though I'm confused (and concerned) by the fact that the company cited just 19 locations on the Q3 call - after it said on the Q1 call that it had already converted 14 locations since the beginning of the year.Still, an awful lot of good news looks priced in, while the risks are not. Limelight historically has given guidance in December, and expectations for 2020 are going to be quite high. Not only is there no room for error in the fourth quarter, in which anything less than 35% y/y growth likely drives a sell-off, but Limelight's outlook needs to be on point as well. Q3 provides some evidence that it will be — but I wouldn't ignore the previous developments that suggest it won't."
4369102,104418,2020-08-17T05:20:23-04:00,The wave of OTT and streaming content is crashing over the tech world in a big way and shows no signs of slowing.Content Delivery Providers or CDNs have been forced to innovate and expand to meet growing demand and competition seems fierce.Time for Limelight Networks to step up to the plate in a big way to play a bit of catch-up in terms of valuation to peers.Limelight can certainly leverage its current client relationships and their breadth of innovation to expand their product offering.The recent cash infusion of $100 million into an already healthy balance sheet will most certainly be accompanied by major contract expansions from massive clients.,"Let’s set the stage a little. You are one of the oldest companies in a relatively new space. Your sector is booming and growth is expected to be exponential in the coming years. A world pandemic has actually thrown a massive amount of fuel on the fire of an already booming sector as the push to digital gains steam. You look around and find that some of the new guys in your arena are cashing in much faster on the hype than you are in terms of valuation.What do you do?This is the exact situation that Limelight Networks (LLNW) finds itself in today. Peers such as Cloudflare (NYSE:NET), Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM), and Fastly (NYSE:FSLY) all have superior valuations compared to LLNW and it’s hard to understand why. This disparity often leaves many investors scratching their heads. Let's dig into the reasons why one of two things have played out in the sector and figure out which scenario is most likely. Are my peers overvalued or am I undervalued? The truth lies somewhere in the middle.Simply put, Limelight Networks is a CDN (content delivery network). When you want to stream just about anything these days, be it videos on demand, live TV, or even a plethora of gaming options, you will almost certainly be receiving this data via a CDN. Content providers can beam out content fairly easily these days, but how do you get it from point A to point B with the best connection for quality and the most efficient way possible? Using the software of a CDN, the traffic is managed, sorted, and routed to “Point of Presence” data centers, or POP servers, for effective pushing of the content in a more localized fashion.Think logistics here much like the USPS. Data moves through channels of regional distribution and gets pushed to the POP closest to the user wanting to access that data, like a local post office, and it’s pushed to them using local infrastructure for delivery. As streaming services grow like weeds, these CDN services will gain more and more traffic at a very high rate of adoption.How many people are moving from linear TV to streaming? Let’s take a quick look just to give an idea of TAM (total addressable market).Source: Big Ideas 2020 - ARK InvestThink back to VHS going to DVD and how quickly that change took hold. The same thing is happening before our eyes when it comes to linear TV customers converting to streaming and OTT. The snowball started rolling down the hill some time ago and is getting bigger and bigger every single day.LLNW was founded in 2001 in Tempe, AZ. They are one of the oldest companies in the CDN sector except for AKAM, which was founded in 1998, though AKAM started as a technology security pure-play before it moved into streaming networks. NET was founded in 2009, and FSLY founded in 2011.Limelight has become somewhat of the dinosaur that has steady contracts, steady income, and great technology with a wide reach, but they aren’t growing fast enough for some investors to take notice, at least on the balance sheet side. While the numbers hold constant, the seeming lack of revenue growth can be a turn off of sorts. Yet the relationships that LLNW has are becoming superior, and their physical network and customer-facing features are experiencing massive growth in their own right.What slowed LLNW's growth trajectory? A long-lasting legal matter with AKAM that didn’t go Limelight’s way seems to have caused some lack of focus for a while. Combined with stagnant growth before the streaming sector really got traction, the split focus with this legal matter made Limelight stumble and drag their feet.So now what? What’s Limelight’s deal now?When tech growth stocks are being bought up like crazy, we need to dig down a little deeper to determine why Limelight has been unjustly left behind. This article is geared towards why Limelight is a differentiator in the space, and a subsequent article focusing more on the numbers as they relate to direct financial comparisons, including balance sheets, market valuations, and earning power of their offering as compared to peers will be released in the coming weeks.Limelight Networks has an expansive network of 123 POP servers (POPS) globally and has more than 1,000 connections to internet service providers (ISPs) as well as leading cloud providers. This allows Limelight to provide low-latency edge computing all over the world. Limelight’s edge computing platform, called EdgeFunctions, optimizes video streaming and content delivery use through a seamless and streamlined process. This serverless platform automatically allows ISPs and cloud providers to have their code available to edge locations globally and work together in a technological symphony to push data and entertainment right to where it is needed.For the less tech-savvy, a simple comparison might be water heater technology. Stay with me. Previously CDNs delivered content in a much less efficient way having to call data from widely spread out locales. Ever try to call the hot water to your shower from the water heater in the garage and you have to wait a while to get it going? In data delivery, that would be called buffering and latency. It used to be a pain - remember dial-up? The level of efficiency with which data is routed through POPS now provides low buffering, shorter wait times and better latency.Fast forward to Limelight’s current network which is like having a tankless hot water heater. Endless hot water now on-demand! Once 5G gets fully integrated, that water is going to be instant on, as hot as you could ever want it, and delivered at the highest water pressure you could possibly handle or need... only with data, not water. Limelight’s management in recent interviews have stated that their network would very soon be limited only by the capability of the end user's device.Source: Global Private NetworkHaving this type of global presence along with a deep and rich product offering is key to not only a high-quality product but also provides the ability to leverage relationships. If any of Limelight’s customers were to have issues in one of its global POPS, it has the ability to reach out to local ISPs and address the problem locally. This also provides the opportunity to expand with very little effort. As 5G grows out globally, this advantage will be key.For 5G to fulfill its requirements in bandwidth and latency, edge computing is a much-needed resource. It will allow developers to scale the 5G experience as well as provide the most enhanced experience for users of apps requiring high amounts of data. We know that 5G will increase the global network’s capability; however, as stated earlier, Limelight’s POPs and EdgeFunctions platform will allow applications to be accommodated physically closer to the end-user. This means less distance traveled for data packets (no longer strictly utilizing the centralized cloud) and a higher quality experience on platforms where low latency and high bandwidth are required, such as cloud gaming, loT (internet of things, more on that below), and augmented reality.As 5G becomes a global reality in the next 2-5 years, Limelight’s EdgeFunctions will be instrumental in its effectiveness and performance. This will be one of Limelight’s many tailwinds for growth. Imagine the value of Limelight when places everywhere are using its technology for the following IoT devices, just to name a few:The global growth in use of edge computing, such as Limelight’s EdgeFunctions will allow applications to deliver 5G improvements at scale even sooner when used with 4G, as seen in the image below.Source: 5G Needs Edge Computing to Deliver on Its PromisesMany applications in the long-term future will also require 5G and edge computing to work together. Ultra-low-latency requirements, like those found in robotic motion control, will not function effectively with 5G alone. Edge computing resources, like Limelight’s EdgeFunctions will be instrumental in achieving these requirements. This is where the ability of EdgeFunctions to cut down on the distance traveled by the data will continue to increase the demand for Limelight’s products. The image below demonstrates this edge computing ability.Source: 5G Needs Edge Computing to Deliver on Its PromisesMany investors often compare companies by who they are doing business with. The thought process here is the more powerful the customer base, the more powerful the connections. This is absolutely true and one of the main reasons we are beating the drum on Limelight networks to really leverage these connections.The following is a link to the client list from Limelight’s website:Customer Base | Limelight NetworksIt’s a pretty extensive list considering it is opt-in, meaning customers can choose whether or not to be added to the public list. However, there are some extremely meaningful clients that are NOT listed in this customer base which we will now discuss. The main one to keep an eye? Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).Amazon Prime Video Might Go LIVE? Yes Please!Amazon Prime Video made up 30% of LLNW’s revenue recently, and the word from reputable sources is that Amazon is on the prowl to expand their video offerings in an effort to stay competitive. Amazon Prime Video has been cruising for years, but with the explosion of Disney+ and Peacock among many others eating away some of their market share, Amazon is making strides to take some of that back.Amazon has been in active discussions with several partners on possibly offering live TV streaming to compete with Sling, Hulu, and other providers. Amazon has some proprietary streaming material in its own right, but several services are taking a hybrid approach of offering not only their own content, but connecting to live TV streaming for those that want to cut the cord but not stray too far from what they are used to seeing on the cable box.It's easy to see Amazon would have a huge advantage. Not only does it have Amazon Prime Video that is tried and true, but it can leverage all of its equipment like Fire TV, Amazon Recast, and Alexa integration to deliver a powerful punch if they do in fact introduce live TV streaming as well. They can easily work an interface across all of the Amazon family of products to deliver a product offering to all Prime members for a very comparable fee.To turn this back around on Limelight, because LLNW is one of the largest CDNs that Amazon Prime Video uses, they would naturally be the go-to partner for a live TV streaming relationship. The CEO of Limelight, Mr. Lento, has alluded to a very large customer signing a contract very soon after months of beta testing. While we cannot be sure this refers to Amazon, connecting the dots makes it seem quite plausible.We urge interested readers to listen to the Second Qtr 2020 Limelight conference call. During the question and answer session, an analyst directly asks Limelight management about Amazon as the potential LIVE TV partner. It was interesting to hear the clever deflection and quick footwork from management to give some detail about their partnership with Amazon but not disclose anything that would go against FD Regulatory rules.If this partnership comes to fruition, we feel very confident that investors will start to take notice and give LLNW credit where credit is due.While we understand why investors are getting excited about other CDN offerings in the marketplace over and above Limelight, we feel the valuation gaps have gotten overly obscure. Limelight has a proven reliable network with many options for clients to utilize and scale-up. They are dropping costs while continuing to tailor their offering for efficiency, speed, and usability, yet their stock price remains unreasonably low in valuation metrics today, especially when compared to peers.An upcoming article really dives into the numbers and compares them, but touching on it quickly, we think LLNW is easily worth a conservative $12 to $15 per share when compared to their competitors in the space. Limelight also just completed a $100 million convertible senior note offering where conversion price is much higher than current stock price. While conversion price doesn’t necessarily translate to stock price increases, what should be noted is that Limelight now has the funds to expand to meet massive demand, whether the large streaming contract the CEO anticipates is with Amazon or another company. Furthermore, it already had a strong balance sheet with a decent cash position before, so it’s hard to fathom why they needed this money so quickly if no deal was imminent.Chances are they do in fact have a big deal in the works, and they knew they needed the money to meet the coming demand influx and build the network out further. It’s also interesting that the institutional investors that participated in the offering would even entertain such a deal unless they suspected very big moves coming very soon for LLNW stock."
4258439,24594,2019-05-01T08:44:25-04:00,"Several consecutive disappointing quarters seem to put the Limelight story at risk.Management insists that 2019 guidance is achievable - but it requires exceptional, and maybe unprecedented, growth in the second half of this year.Fundamental and qualitatively, the accuracy of that guidance suggests a massive shift in LLNW's valuation.The long-term opportunity and a reasonable price make the bet worth taking for now - but the bull case could look very foolish by the end of the year.","Limelight Networks (LLNW) is heading into three important quarters. At the moment, with LLNW just below $3, two different qualitative and quantitative scenarios loom - even within the range of existing guidance. And both the bull case and the bear case seem easy to make - and perhaps compelling.The bull case is that Limelight has executed an impressive turnaround in recent years, expanding EBITDA margins from 1.3% in 2013 to 16%+ in each of the last two years. Margins are seeing some pressure this year - but that's coming in part because of decisions made to better position the CDN (content delivery network) provider in streaming video. Growth in that category should be significant going forward as Disney (DIS), Comcast (CMCSA), and others try and challenge the dominance of Netflix (NFLX). As a result, and thanks to two new opportunities, management is expecting revenue growth as high as 30% in the second half of this year - performance that simply isn't priced in at the moment, with LLNW still down 40%+ from mid-October levels.The bear case is that management is overpromising - as too often has been the case over Limelight's nearly twelve mostly unsuccessful years on the public markets. The turnaround has been impressive - but it's essentially over. Pricing pressure - a feature of the industry, even for better-scaled rival Akamai (AKAM) - should continue. And a new competitor, Fastly (FSLY), itself is going public shortly while posting growth that appears a real threat to Limelight.The next three quarters should show which side of the argument is correct. Guidance looks exceedingly aggressive at this point - but even results within the range make LLNW look very different. At the high end, LLNW trades at 8x EBITDA after explosive second-half growth; at the low end, an 11x multiple and a year-over-year profit decline for the full year looks notably less attractive.Ahead of Q4, when LLNW tanked along with small-cap tech, I argued the stock was too cheap. After the quarter - and with a solid rally - I said LLNW was all about trust. With Q1 looking modestly disappointing, and implied expectations for the rest of the year so high, the trust issue is even more important: this now looks like a potentially binary case. I'm still long, and still think there's enough potential reward long-term - but 2019 is likely to be a very interesting, and potentially volatile, year for Limelight.At this point, it seems almost guaranteed that if Limelight hits its guidance, LLNW stock is going to trade higher than the current $2.94 a year from now - and likely materially so. Here are the year-over-year growth rates for the next three quarters implied by maintained guidance and Q1 results:source: author using calculations from figures in Q1 releaseAt the midpoint of the range, Adjusted EBITDA margins will hit 20% over the three quarters - well above 2017's peak of 16.7%. Even accounting for seasonal weakness on that front in the first quarter, that performance suggests run-rate margins have reached new levels.Meanwhile, even at the low end of the range, LLNW will look reasonably cheap, at something like 10x EBITDA. (That assumes that the company generates free cash flow for the full year after an $11 million burn in Q1, which was driven in part by working capital effects.) And so there's an obvious fundamental case if Limelight's full-year results come in even at or near the low end of guidance.Limelight can be pitched as a play on streaming demand - coming as Netflix (presumably) still receives its dear valuation and Disney Plus launches in the second half. Revenue growth exiting the year should be 25%+: CFO Sajid Malhotra said on the Q1 conference call that 2H sales ""could be 30% higher"" both year-over-year and sequentially, so even the low end suggests growth near that figure. Fastly reportedly could see a $1 billion-plus valuation, which given its growth ($144.6 million in revenue in 2018 against $104.9M the year before, per its S-1) suggests a 5x+ price to revenue multiple based on 2019 expectations. LLNW right now trades at just ~1.5x the low end of 2019 sales guidance. A possible IPO of Cloudflare later this year or in 2020 could add another high-multiple peer.Anything in the current guidance range of $215-225 million in revenue and $30-40 million in EBITDA - again, even at the low end - seems to set up a path back to $4 at least, and potentially closer to or past $5. The CDN space, amid the growth in streaming, should look hugely attractive. A newly public peer (or two) will set up multiple expansion possibilities: if Fastly is growing 40% and is at 5x revenue, shouldn't LLNW with, say, 28% growth get 2.5x - or 3x?Those multiples, assuming Limelight hits the midpoint of guidance, suggest a valuation of $4.50-5.40 - 55-84% above current levels. Even 15x $32 million in Adjusted EBITDA (toward the low end), plus a likely ~$50 million in net cash at year-end, gets LLNW to $4.25 - 45% upside from here. Just 2x the low end of sales guidance gets the stock to about $4.Whatever the exact numbers are, the numbers will work - and work well - if Limelight hits its targets, even if barely so. But there's more than just the fundamental case at play here. LLNW traded at $5 in October, before disappointing guidance for Q4 sent the stock tumbling. (Again, pressure on the broad market, and small-cap tech in particular, certainly didn't help.) It will be easy to argue that if 2019 guidance is met that Limelight 'should' be back at those levels - given that Q4 and the disappointing Q1 by analyst standards then look mostly like a blip.Indeed, the qualitative case might even be strengthened in this scenario. In Q2, per that quarter's call, Limelight renegotiated contracts for six of its ten biggest customers essentially at the same time - an unusual occurrence which appears driving by happenstance rather than strategy. (In other words, the contracts simply expired around the same time; Limelight wasn't trying to renegotiate, nor were the customers, at least according to Limelight management.)Renegotiations almost always lead to lower pricing, which is an industry issue, not a Limelight problem; as I've noted before, larger Akamai detailed the same issue in the Q&A of its Q4 2017 conference call. As traffic builds (as it almost always does), overall revenue from that customer then returns to past levels - and grows beyond those levels. But it takes time: even for Akamai, it takes on average 6-9 months, as its then-CFO James Benson noted on that call.Then, on the Q3 call, Limelight said that two other top 10 customers were ""no longer on our network"", which appears to have resulted from a decision by Limelight to focus on better-priced video content. Both the renegotiations in Q2 and the lost business in Q3 can explain at least some of the weakness seen in Q4, when revenue dropped 9%, and into Q1 when the figure declined 17%.If, as guided, growth returns in Q2 and strengthens in Q3 and Q4, that helps the qualitative story in two ways. First, management gains (or regains, depending on an investor's perspective) investor trust - something Limelight hasn't always had. More importantly, the decisions by management - particularly in terms of focusing on better customers and content in Q3 - are validated, which drives more confidence in the story going forward. It lightens competitive fears - after all, Limelight walked away from business and threatened companies don't do that - and emphasizes the overall health of the streaming video part of the business.All told, if Limelight meets its guidance, it's truly not unreasonable to expect something close to a double in 12-18 months. A new partnership with Ericsson (ERIC) is expected to generate $7-9 million in revenue in the second half; a similar run rate for the full year adds 3-4 points in growth to 2020 revenue. Lapping upfront costs related to that participation - and the weak Q1 results in general - adds another profit driver next year. Peers can help multiples (and it's worth noting that AKAM, too, is trading at a 17-year high).$35 million in Adjusted EBITDA - the midpoint of guidance - can get to $40 million-plus in 2020 in this model. A mid-teen EBITDA multiple, 20x+ earnings plus cash and/or 2x+ revenue all get LLNW over $6. To be sure, this is not the base case at the moment - but it's truthfully not far off if management is being realistic.There are two major risks involved in betting on Limelight hitting its guidance. The first is that the guidance looks exceedingly aggressive. Revenue growth decelerated from 11% in Q2 to 7% in Q3, then reverted to -9% in Q4 and -17% in Q1. Limelight management now seems to be modeling in double-digit growth in Q2 followed by mid-20s or better in the second half. That's not just a reversal in trend, but a mammoth, quick acceleration. The contribution from Ericsson does help 2H results - but even at the $7-9 million expected level only is adding 6.5-8.5 points' worth of growth (assuming that revenue all hits in Q3 and Q4 only).It's difficult to trust that guidance at this point. For what it's worth, Wall Street doesn't: six analysts have an average target of $209.3 million, with the highest figure still near the low end of the $215-225 million guidance. And it's not as if management has been on point lately: Q4 guidance initially disappointed, and then Limelight had to pull down that figure too. Limelight management largely attributed the reduced guidance to the aforementioned strategic moves - but that didn't explain why the company overshot in terms of expectations. Limelight then modestly lowered 2019 guidance (basically expanding the range at the low end) after Q4.Q1 seems a potential disappointment too: both CEO Robert Lento in the Q1 release (""largely in line with our expectations"") and CFO Malhotra on the Q1 call (""roughly in line with our expectations"") qualified their assessments of the results, while noting that the company did expect year-over-year revenue declines and pressure on margins. Even in that context, a 17% top-line drop and negative Adjusted EBITDA appear worse than investors projected.So while the low end of the updated guidance probably is enough to suggest upside, the odds of Limelight even clipping that low end don't seem particularly high at the moment. Recent results are going in the wrong direction. Recent management projections have been overly optimistic. Both have to change immediately for Limelight to maintain guidance after the coming quarter, let alone actually hit its targets.The second risk is that the story looks notably different if Limelight's 2019 results do come in below management expectations. Adjusted EBITDA below $30 million at the current price suggests either an 11x+ EV/EBITDA multiple - or a lower LLNW stock price. The latter seems more likely, given how the fundamentals would look.Full-year revenue growth at the low end of the top-line range would be 4.7% - basically, all of that coming from Ericsson. Adjusted EBITDA would be below 2017 levels. Margins likely compress 300 bps-plus in two years. And it would certainly appear that the turnaround here is out of steam:Source: author from LLNW filings and press releases. 2019 figures at low end of company guidance for revenue and EBITDAThe qualitative case here looks much worse as well. Fastly's focus on 'edge' computing - where Limelight is claiming some success, and which is the focus of the Ericsson partnership - combined with its much stronger growth suggest that it might be outperforming Limelight. Assuming its revenue growth modestly decelerates from last year's 38%, Fastly likely remains on pace to surpass Limelight in revenue in 2020. (Fastly should remain unprofitable, but in this market that seems to matter little.) Cloudflare creates another rival that, along with Fastly and in-house efforts, can soak up the growing streaming demand Limelight expects to drive growth. Instead of a valuable part of a growing industry, Limelight well might look like it's getting passed by.Management concerns become a big part of the story, with a guidance reduction ahead of Q4, after Q4, and presumably following Q2 or Q3. And so in this scenario, the bear case is the more obvious thesis. Limelight appears a subscale provider in an industry with consistent price compression facing fast-rising competitors and an entrenched giant in Akamai, all of whom offer broader services including security options. And there are really no catalysts left for Limelight. It may well be behind in edge. Cost savings from optimizing delivery expense largely have been realized (though the company claims new software efforts should boost capacity ~20%). Organic growth opportunities seem limited if the Ericsson deal disappoints.It's not difficult to see LLNW falling to $2 in that scenario: something like 1x sales and 8x 2019 EBITDA of $25 million. Even at that cheap price, with growth coming to a halt, LLNW still might look like dead money.From here, there's just enough to stay long LLNW while acknowledging the risks. A straddle actually might be an intriguing play in a stock with a surprisingly reasonable amount of liquidity - but with the January 2020 priced at ~$1.05, even options markets appear to understand the potentially binary nature of the next three quarters.I see two reasons enough to stay long just below $3. The first is that real success creates the potential for enormous returns. If management is right, or close, and Limelight has positioned itself well in edge and video, there is a multi-year opportunity for growth and associated margin and multiple expansion. This can be a 'hot' play on Netflix, Disney Plus, and the like. That success isn't guaranteed by any measure - but even a narrow chance of that growth impacts current fair value materially.That's particularly true because the downside likely has some limit. Even a 'dead money' scenario still leaves the stock around $2, down 30%+ from here. A struggling Limelight could look to sell itself; the company generated almost $60 million in revenue last year just from Amazon.com (AMZN), which has some value. There's no debt on the balance sheet, and cross-payments with Akamai over two different litigation settlements will end this year.And there is a somewhat middle-ground scenario where Limelight misses guidance but still generates impressive second-half results. 2020 should be better given the easy Q1 compare and (hopefully) benefits from edge and Ericsson, which could boost LLNW stock at some point - even if a guidance cut after Q2 or Q3 sends shares back to December levels.Again, the risks here shouldn't be ignored, and this is a huge stretch for Limelight. I don't know that I necessarily expect good news, or even for LLNW to hit guidance. But if it does, the rewards will be material. If it doesn't, there's still hope. That's enough to stay long - and hold on tight."
4276092,24594,2019-07-19T14:20:29-04:00,"Limelight's full-year guidance looked laughable heading into the quarter; the guidance cut unfortunately is not a surprise.
        But it also highlights increasing management risk here - and even the lowered outlook looks far too aggressive.
        Margins, competition, and pricing add to the risk profile.
        LLNW still has a path to upside - but it's nearly impossible to trust the company after the second quarter report.","Limelight Networks (LLNW) had a hugely important second quarter report on Wednesday evening. As I wrote at the beginning of May, LLNW looked like a binary story heading into earnings. Fundamentally and qualitatively, a strong Q2 - which had to include reaffirmed full-year guidance - suggested big potential upside for LLNW shares. A miss, on the other hand, would bring valuation into question - and amplify existing concerns about Limelight management.Essentially, the worst-case scenario played out. Limelight's numbers missed Street expectations - which had already discounted the company's guidance. Management's response can be categorized as alternately disappointing, infuriating and flat-out tone-deaf. Guidance, as both investors and analysts predicted ahead of the quarter, was lowered - and yet still looks overly optimistic. It's a quarter that breaks the bull case I made at the beginning of the year. Management simply can't be trusted at this point. As such, despite protestations to the contrary, it's a stretch to believe that competition from newly public Fastly (FSLY), industry leader Akamai (AKAM), and other firms isn't a factor in recent underperformance. Even with a 10% post-earnings drop, LLNW isn't cheap on an earnings basis.Valuation on an EV/revenue basis admittedly remains reasonable, and the balance sheet is still healthy. It's possible that Limelight, as it promises, can find a way to drive growth in the second half. But it's not possible, after this quarter, to have enough confidence on that front to put money behind LLNW stock.Limelight was headed in the wrong direction heading into the Q2 report. Revenue growth had decelerated steadily: +11% in Q2 2018, +7% in Q3, and then -9% in Q4 and -17% in Q1 2019. The company cut guidance ahead of Q4 - after its initial projection disappointed - and then with the Q4 report widened its initial 2019 revenue guidance at the low end.After Q1's top-line decline, it was clear that investors and analysts didn't trust even the updated outlook: heading into Wednesday's release, the highest of six Street estimates was $210 million, below Limelight's low end of $215 million. And LLNW's valuation - off some 50% from October highs - suggested that the market as a whole simply didn't believe Limelight was going to come anywhere near its targets.That lack of trust was just one reason why the Q2 report was so important. Implied guidance at even the low end of full-year projections suggested that for the last three quarters of the year, revenue would grow 20% - and Adjusted EBITDA would increase 42%. LLNW, at the price near $3 it received in early May, would trade at just 10x EBITDA and ~1.7x EV/revenue despite that growth.With FSLY at 8x revenue and unprofitable on an EBITDA basis, there was clear room for significant multiple expansion. The Q4/Q1 worries - including the Q4 guidance cut - would become a quickly-forgotten blip. A decision last year to walk away from less-profitable business would look like a smart pivot by Limelight to focus on video customers - particularly with new streaming platforms from the likes of Disney (DIS), AT&T (T), and Apple (AAPL). Obviously, that's not what happened. Revenue declined 9% year-over-year, though it rose 6% sequentially. Full-year guidance was cut by $15 million - a full 7.7 percentage points of year-over-year growth. Limelight pulled Adjusted EBITDA guidance, but non-GAAP net income guidance was cut to ~breakeven from $0.10-$0.20. Commentary on the Q2 call suggests Adjusted EBITDA is projected to come in around $23 million (adding $5 million in share-based comp to an ~$18.6M D&A run rate, less ~$600K in interest income) - against $32.5 million last year and $30.7 million in 2017.That's disappointing enough - but incredibly, even the cut guidance looks aggressive. The midpoint of Limelight's implied second-half guidance is for 24%+ revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA was just $823,000 in the first half against $20.2 million the year before; Limelight appears to be expecting something like $22 million in 2H against $12.5 million in Q3+Q4 2018. Management was asked multiple times on the Q2 call why it was willing to back that guidance, and insisted that, as CFO Sajid Malhotra put it, that ""we have gone out of our way to de-risk the plan"". The sell-off suggests investors don't believe that's the case - and with good reason.Limelight CEO Bob Lento opened his comments quoted in the Q2 release with a staggering statement, one he basically repeated in his prepared remarks on the Q2 call:To repeat, analysts did not believe Limelight's guidance before the quarter. And it's quite clear that Limelight missed its own expectations. Malhotra had said on the Q1 call that ""second half revenue could be 30% higher"" year-over-year. Even if that were the case, Q2 revenue still needed to be at least positive y/y in order to reach the low end of the full-year guidance reiterated after Q1. Instead, it declined 9%.Lento's statement - again, in prepared remarks - suggests that he believes what is precisely the problem here: Wall Street is better at predicting his business than is his own CFO. (And, for what it's worth, Limelight missed the consensus revenue estimate by $500K - more than one point of growth. For good CEOs, a point of growth isn't something to brush off.) And it implies further that the CEO thinks that meeting lowered expectations is somewhat acceptable - or at the least worth pointing out.One sentence in a press release isn't the entire problem here, even if it does serve as a handy microcosm. Management was asked repeatedly on the Q2 call the most obvious question: at this point, can even the lowered guidance be trusted? The answers don't seem to be great.Of the $15 million full-year cut, about $4-5 million seems to come from the company's much-touted 'edge' computing partnership with Ericsson (ERIC). That partnership was supposed to contribute ~$7-$9 million in second-half revenue, per the Q1 call; Lento said after Q2 that the figure had been halved, while Malhotra said the projection had moved from high-single-digit millions to low-single-digit millions.Both Lento and Malhotra said in the Q&A that Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) additionally was a factor; Limelight had brought that company on as a customer but the deal ""required a lot more development work on our side than we initially thought"". Delayed revenue there seems a factor. So, too were ""a couple of large edge deals,"" as Malhotra put it, that were pushed out. Those answers aren't good enough - and they haven't been for a while. On the Q3 2018 conference call, Lento explained underwhelming Q4 guidance as being due to the fact that ""our business has become better and more predictable as time has gone on."" That in essence meant the company could and would guide less conservatively and thus hadn't given itself the easy ""beat and raise"" path it had in the past. Limelight cut that Q4 guidance less than eight weeks later.It claimed at the time that customer departures last year, along with renegotiated contracts in Q2, were to blame - but neither factor explained why Q4 guidance had been off, given that both factors already were known to management at the time of the Q3 call. On the Q1 call, as Limelight was questioned as to why, exactly, it was promising such torrid second-half growth, both Lento and Malhotra insisted that the goals were achievable. Relative to last quarter's call, the Q2 responses sound like more of the same. Per management, key customers aren't leaving; revenue is just being pushed out a quarter or two; Ericsson is a huge opportunity, but the head of the unit had to be replaced which caused disruption. Growth is coming - just a quarter or two later than planned (or hoped).There was no sign from either Lento or Malhotra that the recent results were considered unacceptable, or that Limelight itself has anything to fix. It's exceedingly difficult to believe that's the case. After three straight quarters of the same story, this firmly is a ""show me"" story in terms of management. The concern about lower-than-expected revenue isn't just a matter of guidance, or EV/revenue multiples, or broader growth. Limelight clearly is acting - and spending - as if big growth is on the way. Lento detailed in his prepared remarks efforts to build capacity, both through software (which aims to improvement server performance) and increased PoPs (points of presence). As a result, capex guidance, which sat at $20-$24 million before the quarter, has been increased to $25 million. (Lento noted that he thought of that increase as ""largely unchanged,"" which hardly seems the case.) Those efforts already are pressuring gross margins substantially: the 40.3% figure was down 910 bps year-over-year. Gross margin did increase sequentially, but there's still a broader margin issue at play here. Adjusted EBITDA declined 84% year-over-year in Q1, owing to higher COGS and higher opex, notably in sales and marketing. As noted above, for the first half, Adjusted EBITDA was just $823,000 against more than $20 million in 1H 2018.Again, Limelight is expecting growth, and first-half results are being hit by those efforts. But even assuming some level of one-time expense - and deleveraging owing to top-line disappointment - that spend highlights a long-running concern here.To his credit, Lento had, through last year, led an impressive turnaround: Limelight's Adjusted EBITDA margins spiked from 1.3% in 2013 to 16%+ in both 2017 and 2018. But nearly all of that improvement came from COGS - due to improved capacity utilization, but also significantly cheaper capacity additions (with software a key factor). One of the risks to LLNW before the recent stumbles was that margins were nearing a ceiling regardless: management had targeted 25% Adjusted EBITDA margins, but that goal seemed to require accelerating revenue that could leverage opex, not necessarily much or anything in the way of further gross margin improvement.Again, Limelight is expecting an improvement in 2H, with implied guidance suggesting that EBITDA margins will race to nearly 20%. But this is an industry where pricing tends to decline over time, as Akamai has detailed in the past. Lento talked up the entrance of Disney (DIS) and Apple (AAPL) - both Limelight customers, though both firms do and will use internal efforts along with other CDNs - into streaming as a boost for revenue in 2H and beyond.But even a bullish AKAM analyst noted that Disney alone could pressure pricing across the space. Newly public Fastly needs to grow revenue; so does Cloudflare ahead of its possible IPO. Akamai remains the biggest player in the space. Fastly is building its business around edge, and could outcompete Limelight on that front. If Limelight's ability to take down capacity costs is over, and pricing pressure accelerates even as demand increases, then margins really are at a ceiling. The fact that, per the 10-Q, 580 bps of the gross margin compression came from bandwidth and co-location costs suggests that might be the case.Meanwhile, Competition could keep a lid on revenue growth: even the lowered guidance, at the midpoint, only suggests less than a 5% year-over-year increase for full-year 2019. That combination still isn't priced in, with adjusted net income ~zero and EV/EBITDA 11x+ based on full-year guidance. There's still growth priced in here - and more than a few roadblocks in terms of driving that growth.And so I sold my LLNW shares on Thursday - almost happily. I'm truthfully surprised the stock only fell 10% (the declines were actually even lighter midday, when I exited). LLNW still sits above where it I bought it at the beginning of the year - and while the tech market is better, the story here is not.In one key way, however, the story actually is the same. LLNW going into Q3 will seem every bit as binary as it did going into Q2. I'd expect that in coming weeks analyst estimates on the top line will drop below the guided $200-$210 million range, given the implied increase of 24% with minimal help (4-5 points) from Ericsson. Management credibility again will be on the line next quarter. With the stock at 11x+ existing EBITDA guidance, another reduction in the full-year outlook likely leads to another decline in fundamental fair value for LLNW - and another post-earnings sell-off. In that scenario, worries only will increase: that the Ericsson deal is a dud, that Fastly and Cloudfare are passing Limelight by, that growth and margins have peaked.And, much like in Q2, if LLNW can this time meet its guidance, the stock likely rises. A strong Q3 and Q4 set the company up well ahead of easy first-half compares. The case that LLNW's EV/revenue should rise toward FSLY's ~7x FY20 multiple - a case Malhotra clumsily tried to make on the Q2 call - improves. In other words, the same binary split I highlighted in April still holds. But while the risk/reward at that point seemed worthwhile, that's simply no longer the case. Management credibility is close to gone at this point, and betting on this time being different looks close to foolish. There are real concerns highlighted in Q2 - enough to move to the sidelines until Limelight can get back on track."
4238699,24594,2019-02-06T14:58:10-05:00,"LLNW fell hard in late 2018 amid small-cap tech weakness and a double guidance cut.The stock has bounced nicely in 2019, however, gaining 32% YTD.Back at $3, the case comes down to trust in management - and perhaps the broader market.2019 looks like a pivotal year: the opportunities still exist, but the key question is whether Limelight can capitalize.","When I recommended (and bought) shares of content delivery provider Limelight Networks (LLNW) in late December, the thesis was that a 50%+ plunge in LLNW shares was unjustified. Some level of selling did seem logical, admittedly. Small-cap tech looked overvalued (at least anecdotally), with LLNW itself trading at a 12x+ EV/EBITDA multiple for much of the year. And a guidance cut in a mid-December update raised questions about both management and the mid-/long-term growth outlook.But down by more than half, LLNW looked too cheap. The cyclical fears driving the broad market lower in Q4 didn't really apply to Limelight's business: a weaker macro environment wasn't going to alter the growth in streaming video. As such, it appeared at least some of the selling pressure on the stock was misplaced. And while the December outlook was disappointing (and followed a Q3 report where the lack of a guidance hike appeared to drive a sell-off), 2019 guidance still suggested growth for a stock that by that point was pricing in basically flat profits.LLNW has bounced nicely, probably with some help on both fronts. Small-cap tech has rallied, at least looking at the Invesco S&P SmallCap Information Technology ETF (PSCT) (which is not a perfect index for stocks like LLNW but echoes reversals of sentiment I've seen in a number of stocks in the category):Data by YChartsMeanwhile, Limelight's Q4 report last week, while imperfect, seemed good enough to restore at least some investor confidence.Back at $3+ - and up 32% YTD - the case for LLNW does get a bit cloudier. Valuation has returned to pricing in at least some growth. Updated 2019 guidance actually is a bit weaker. And the drivers of that guidance - per LLNW management itself - aren't coming until the second half of the year.The long-term case still holds, with some intriguing initiatives on the way. But after the rally, the case for sticking with LLNW comes down to trust: both in the market itself and particularly in Limelight management. For now, I'm willing to have that trust - but the risk/reward edge here admittedly is thinner than it was just six weeks ago, and this is a stock that probably bears close watching particularly over the next couple of quarters.As I detailed in December, the guidance cut was concerning for two reasons. First, the relatively thin commentary suggested strongly that pricing was the major issue. The CDN business sees pricing decline over time - that's the case even for better-scaled rival Akamai (AKAM) - but Limelight had been able to more than offset that pressure through optimizing its delivery. Gross margins, for instance, expanded 1,200 bps+ between 2013 and 2018, driving essentially all of an impressive increase in Adjusted EBITDA margins. If net pricing benefits were over, however, margins were going to plateau - and LLNW's growth was likely to moderate, if not entirely stall out.The second problem was that management simply whiffed. On the Q3 conference call, CEO Robert Lento explained the lack of an apparently expected guidance increase by arguing that the company, after years of transformation, was in a position to better project its business. Less than two months later, projected Q4 EBITDA margins (using the midpoint of implied guidance post-Q3 and the updated figures from December) went from 16%+ to barely 7%. For a stock that has been a long-term disappointment (LLNW closed its first day of trading in 2007 at $22), this looked like another case of overpromising and underdelivering.Fundamentally, Q4 doesn't necessarily answer either concern. Indeed, in a different market (perhaps one more like the one seen in December), it's not hard to imagine LLNW giving up at least some of its bounce after the release. Q4 numbers were better than guided across the board, but 2019 guidance ranges of revenue, non-GAAP net income, and Adjusted EBITDA were widened on the low end:Source: author from LLNW press releasesCFO Sajid Malhotra explained in the Q&A of the Q4 conference call that ""what I've tried to do is just broaden the guidance a little bit,"" noting that investors and analysts had told him to ""give yourself some room"". But the ranges were broadened in the wrong direction. And the lower midpoints do portend some margin pressure, with implied EBITDA margins at the midpoint of 15.9% down about 70 bps from 2018 levels - even with the sharply disappointing Q4.The wider range itself has a significant impact on LLNW's valuation. At the low end, LLNW doesn't look all that cheap. The current price of $3.09 suggests an EV/EBITDA right at 11x, and backing out cash a P/E of 27x. (Cash is about $47.4 million, excluding $3.6 million in settlement payments owed to Akamai in excess of payments Akamai is sending Limelight in a different case.) At the high end, EV/EBITDA is closer to 8x, and P/E ex-cash 13.5x - both much more reasonable multiples.That divergence alone puts quite a bit of pressure on 2019 performance in terms of supporting LLNW shares over the next twelve months. Add to that the fact that Limelight is expecting weaker results upfront, with results improving sequentially in every quarter. That includes, per the call, an estimate of 30% y/y revenue increases in the second half. For a company coming off a guidance error and then another modest cut, it's not hard to see why investors might have some skepticism that top-line growth is going to accelerate two quarters from now.The numbers, then, suggest that investors should at least consider taking profits here. Full-year guidance basically was pulled down again. A company that just disappointed - and has shown signs of pricing pressure - is promising torrid results six months from now and softer growth until then. Even acknowledging that comparisons (particularly in Q4 2019) are partially responsible for the improving sequential trend, some investors may not want to stick around that long - or trust management to deliver this time. And it leaves LLNW at risk of being victim to another market- or sector-wide sell-off before those improved results show up, if they show up at all.That said, qualitatively, the quarter did provide some help to the bull case. Management explained the Q4 miss as due in part to the company not getting new customers onboard quickly enough after walking away from lower-margin business in Q3. (The company disclosed on the Q3 call that two of its top ten customers were no longer on its network.) A new head of sales was brought on in late November, potentially to address that miss, and Malhotra himself admitted erring in the guidance by not realizing that customers were unlikely to switch quickly in the seasonally important Q4.The argument, essentially, is that Limelight stumbled on timing - but Lento insisted that the company wasn't losing deals. And, notably, per the 10-K, pricing rose for the full year, in part due to mix (likely a result of heavier video content, part of the reason Limelight walked away from those two large customers in Q3, and hundreds of others over the past few years).And as far as 2019 goes, the company is making significant investments behind growth. A partnership with Ericsson (ERIC) is going to hit margins in the first half - but should start contributing revenue in the second half. Limelight's Realtime Streaming is getting significant interest, with applications in gaming, online gambling (particularly sports betting, where latency obviously is an issue), auctions, and broadcasting. Revenue guidance suggests 10-15% growth in 2019, with ""high-single-digits"" from the core business and incremental second half revenue from the newer initiatives. Given the easier year-over-year comparisons, the projected cadence of the year is logical. It's not just a case of a management team promising/hoping/guessing that business will get better in a couple of quarters.So, there's still a favorable interpretation to be made of the Q4 release - and even of the results and guidance for 2H 2018 and full-year 2019. Limelight has done an impressive job in its turnaround over the past few years:Source: author from Limelight press releases; 2019 numbers at midpoint of guidanceCertainly, the low-hanging fruit has been harvested in terms of margins, in particular. But this also is a much better (and more competitive) business than it was just a few years ago. The Q3 slip was disappointing - but it was largely a timing issue, and the long-term trend still holds.Revenue and profits still are growing (at least in the top three-quarters of the Adjusted EBITDA range). And that's with investments in 2019 in Ericsson, edge, and real-time streaming that should set the company up for a potentially explosive 2020. And even with the gains, at the midpoint of guidance, LLNW is available for less than 10x EBITDA - in a year where investments are going to be heightened and only ~half of the return on those investments will be harvested. I argued in December that a bullish scenario could lead LLNW to $6+ by 2020 - that's still better than a double, and still an outcome that appears in play if 2019 goes roughly to plan.Betting on that bullish scenario, however, requires quite a bit of trust. It requires trust that management is projecting the Ericsson opportunity correctly; that it didn't give up too much business in Q3 and past years (the customer count went from 963 at the end of 2015 to 649 at the end of 2018, including a nearly 10% reduction last year); and that pricing holds (Malhotra floated a potential 100 bps expansion in gross margin in 2019, offset by expected higher investments in operations, R&D, and sales).It also likely requires that the market doesn't turn sour on small-cap tech again in the next few months. LLNW is going to show declining year-over-year revenue in Q1, based on commentary, and a less charitable market may not have the same patience investors have shown in recent sessions. If Limelight doesn't at least stay in the middle of the guided range this year, an entry point below $3 is going to be an offer assuming that at some point investors aren't willing to pay ~10x 2019 EBITDA or ~20x earnings.Given the balance sheet, this isn't a binary play - but it does feel like 2019 will set the direction for the stock's long-term performance. If Limelight can keep margins reasonably intact despite investments, and core revenue continues to grow, the new initiatives set the table for a big 2020 and continued growth on the back of the streaming market. (Note that there are two secular drivers there: not just more streamed content, but better content, such as 4K versus HD.)If, on the other hand, pricing pressure and/or share losses return, even the growing market looks largely commoditized. Margins are at a ceiling, and LLNW is dead money, or worse.And at the moment, it's admittedly somewhat difficult to ardently argue for either scenario. One of the more interesting disclosures in the 10-K is that Amazon (AMZN) has become an increasingly important contributor. That company went from under 10% of revenue in 2016 to 17% in 2017 and then a whopping 30% in 2018. The figures suggest that Amazon revenue rose 80%+ last year and probably doubled in 2017. Assuming Amazon was responsible for 9.49% of 2016 revenue, the rest of the business was flat in 2017 and declined almost 10% in 2018.Is that a good thing? Perhaps. It gives Limelight exposure to Amazon Prime, whose content needs only are going to grow. Amazon's increasing reliance shows that tech-savvy company, at least, sees Limelight's service as top-tier. And it could make Amazon a potential suitor down the line if it wants to add to its existing CloudFront CDN. On the other hand, that type of revenue concentration on its own is a concern, and Amazon's increasing share could position it to ask for pricing reductions that could have a material impact on margins.Interestingly, even employee reviews seem to see the same company in a very different light. Glassdoor reviews are mixed, which isn't necessarily a surprise. But two recent posts show two potential interpretations of LLNW coming out of Q3 and Q4 results. In October, an employee criticized Limelight management:Management concerns, as noted, have hit the stock, and share-based comp is another worry (nearly $16 million in 2018). But two months earlier, another reviewer saw promise, albeit with some caution:As management tells it, those adjustments are being made. The new initiatives are the bold moves Limelight needs to make to become a legitimate independent player in the CDN space - and the spending in 2019 is what is needed to back those moves. They had better be right, however - and it's impossible at this point to have 100% confidence.For now, I'm willing to back management. The secular tailwinds in the industry are real. The new initiatives can drive growth in Q3 and beyond. And a takeout by Amazon, Akamai, or private equity - a takeover about which speculation has swirled for a decade now - is a logical endgame if growth accelerates, and a potential way to salvage value if it doesn't.But this is a big year - and the story isn't perfect, or close, coming out of Q4. It needs to get better, and investors (myself included) need to be ready to adjust if it looks like Limelight is on track to disappoint once again."
4365301,105503,2020-08-06T13:42:11-04:00,"Limelight is a CDN specialist which has experienced increased internet traffic made possible by COVID-19.Consequently, revenues have increased and this looks to continue throughout this year.This CDN play had a very low debt level till it raised capital through convertible senior notes.The company's CDN performance is being improved but most importantly, it already has an edge services offering while Fastly is still developing one.Valuations are on the low side and Limelight is a buy.","Limelight Networks (LLNW) is benefiting from the work-from-home movement and confinement measures through increased internet traffic including online video.Streaming is more than half of Limelight's revenue.Consequently, the stock price has been on an uptrend since the end of March after successive upgrades by analysts on Wall Street. It is now more than 160% up since August last year, but due to the volatile path, investors are wondering whether there may be more upside.I am bullish on the stock despite a 4.6% downside following a recent offering to sell $110 million of convertible senior notes due August 2025 in a private offering. I believe that valuations are still on the low side.Figure 1: Stock price evolutionData by YChartsI further believe that the company is on its way to be a bigger player not only in the CDN space but also in the newer edge services.I analyze the company's financial capacity to embark on its growth path, being aware that it has deceived investors in the past in terms of revenue objectives.I also compare with peer Fastly (FSLY) and make sure to cover the challenges as well.First, I start with providing a view of the market.Internet traffic is exploding driven mainly by video applications like conferencing and movies.Now CDN providers like Limelight provide higher speed to their customers by copying the content library from the server where it is located to many other dispersed ones closest to the client.Following the advent of COVID-19, the company has seen a surge in traffic, especially video as people turn to online video for communication, news, entertainment and exercising.Also, some live events which boost internet traffic are starting to return, albeit under strict health and safety conditions just like British soccer.Interestingly, traffic levels in the second quarter reached record levels and the executives expect this to continue ""much faster than overall Internet growth rates"".Further research from independent sources also supports the case for internet traffic to be on a steady progression.Figure 2: Global internet speeds on a steady incremental pathSource: Speedtest.netExploring this further, one of Limelight's strategies is to expanding capacity by rapidly expanding existing POPs (points of presence) throughout the world. Consequently, I checked and found that the company effectively had more network points than peer Fastly.Figure 3: Number of network pointsSource: CDN planetNormally, more network points mean more traffic and therefore better revenue growth.However, this is not the case and Fastly has comparable revenues and superior revenue growth despite an inferior number of network points.Figure 4: Comparing Limelight and Fastly in terms of some key metricsSource: Seeking AlphaThis means that Fastly is more efficient at generating revenues.Additional research in Trustradius which is a technology review website reveals that Fastly offers better performance.I also confirmed this observation from CDN planet where Fastly has a better ""Change propagation delay"" specification.Therefore, my next step was to investigate how Limelight is addressing the issue.It is indeed doing so, through an optimization and proactive management of the network which are the normal resolution actions for network saturation issues.More importantly, this is not just a statement by the executives but is backed by a strategic objective of more efficiently managing the increasing traffic loads and thus, delivering higher quality.Interestingly, to the credit of Limelight this time, reviewers on Trustradius also mention that they had trouble implementing Fastly into the PaaS infrastructures of vendors like AWS or Azure.This is a point which I explore further in the wider public cloud context.With the increasing popularity of public clouds like Azure and AWS, the issue of costly infrastructure spends has been solved or rather been extended to a longer period through the OPEX model.However, this has not solved the problem of latency at the edge (customer premises), that is where the source of data is located. Here, CDN providers have an important role to play in making the application faster through the development of edge technology which is different from conventional CDN services.Now, only a handful of CDN companies actually have a functional edge service (also referred to as serverless compute) and Limelight is one of them as I verified from the company's website.Figure 5: Limelight serverless Compute (live product)Source: Limelight.comHowever, upon verification from Fastly's website, I found that the company is still at beta testing phase for its edge services.Figure 6: Fastly serverless Computing environment (still in Test mode)Source: Fastly.comThinking aloud, demand for Edge services should be growing as more and more businesses migrate to public cloud. In fact, Limelight has already closed a deal with a global OTT provider who will be using both its video delivery CDN and newly-developed edge services.As per the executives, another large customer is undergoing a proof of concept and one of the preliminary findings is that they have much better performance to access their cloud computing equipment using Limelight's edge solution.They also expect a contract to be signed soon.Therefore, going forward, especially in context of the coronavirus speeding up migration of compute workloads to the cloud, I see revenues from edge services start to trickle in 2020 and gradually turn into a flow as from 2021.For Limelight, this means more income.First, revenues were up 28% year over year.Second, gross profits excluding network depreciation costs have also increased compared to the last year driven by improving asset utilization and lower costs for raw materials.Going forward, I see the setting up of a self-service portal for developers referred to as the Developer Central as bringing more efficiency in terms of human resources.The reason is that by acting as a one-stop source of documentation and software development kits, the portal will bring more interaction within developers and free up man-hours in the software development department for re-allocation to other tasks.Figure 7: Statement of incomeSource: Seeking AlphaMoreover, international customers accounted for 38% of total revenue in Q2-2020 with approximately 10% of revenues in non-U.S. dollar-denominated currencies, primarily due to the fluctuation in the GBP (British pound).Foreign exchange headwinds in the quarter amounted to approximately $100,000. This amount is meaningfully equivalent to the average revenue for one customer.Now going forward, the pound seems to be on an uptrend and according to Citibank (C), the upside should continue thereby reducing currency headwinds.Figure 8: GBP/USD trendSource: Dailyfx.comOn an even more positive note, the company has raised revenue expectations to $235 million (mid-point). As a matter of fact Limelight has already generated $115.5 million and according to me, this guidance reflects more of a prudent approach.Now, in order to drive a 15% growth, you need capital and therefore capex should be up to account for investments made in infrastructure. However, capex has stayed at the same level indicated for the year 2020 back in December 2019.This can only be explained by a re-allocation of resource in areas of need and therefore higher efficiency.With Limelight looking strong, I now dig deeper into the finances.The debt was on the low side as at the end of June with a debt to equity of 0.09.Figure 9: Some balance sheet metrics.Source: Seeking AlphaNow, the convertible unsecured senior notes offering aimed at raising $106 million in terms of net proceeds must have done more than just raised a few eyebrows. This could explain the reason for the minor sell-off, in addition to some profit-taking.Going deeper, the bulk of the amount raised in the private offering will be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes.Based on details from the transcripts, I anticipate the cash being used for the following purposes:To support my view, I have extracted a statement by the CFO, Daniel Boncel during the latest earnings call:Furthermore, in addition to operational expenses, the company intends to use around $14.4 million to pay the cost of the capped call transactions, which is basically the right to buy the stock of the company at a specific price.As per the SEC filing, concerning the capped call transactions:""The cap price of the capped call transactions will initially be $13.38 per share of Limelight's common stock, which represents a premium of 100% over the last reported sale price of Limelight's common stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market of $6.69 per share on July 22, 2020, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions.""Now, the intrinsic value of this call option as at July 22, 2020 was $6.69 (13.38 - 6.69) meaning a 100% premium when taking into consideration that the company was trading at $6.69.Putting things into perspective for investors focused on liabilities, this is a company which generates $200 million yearly and has availed of a $100 million debt.For that matter, a convertible note is just another debt instrument which pays interests, but also carries the right to exchange interest/principal cash into an equity interest.However, looking at the positive side, the debt to equity ratio despite increasing will still be less than 1.Still, taking into consideration additional debt burden, I look at the risks, bearing in mind that COVID-19 not only comes with opportunities but also with challenges. This is in addition to possible currency headwinds I talked about earlier.First, Limelight has to set up POPs throughout the world. Therefore, travel and operational restrictions resulting from COVID-19 can be challenging in terms of meeting objectives.Also, there have been supply-chain challenges resulting from the fact that Limelight uses hardware components from different manufacturers to install its software. However, these have been resolved during the first quarter as the company has already diversified sourcing.Overall, learning from the first half of the year, when the company managed to add capacity and thus benefit from COVID-19 demand, I am confident that this will be the case for H2-2020 as well.With a trailing price to sales ratio of 3.4 compared to peer Fastly, Limelight is currently undervalued.Figure 10: Comparing the valuationsSource: Seeking AlphaNow, considering that the CDN market will be worth a whopping $50 billion by 2025 and we are still faced with a pandemic which promotes internet usage, not only in the US but throughout the world, revenues should continue to be on an uptrend.Moreover, due to Limelight improving quality of service, I see the company delivering better performance and winning revenues from the competition.More importantly, the pipeline now includes edge services to differentiate its product offerings.Furthermore, the low end of adjusted EBITDA guidance has been revised upwards by the management from $25 million to $28 million.Also, for risk-averse investors, it is worth noting that the CDN company is not contracting this ""debt"" for re-financing purposes but predominantly for operational and growth purposes.At a current price of $6.68, Limelight is a buy. I expect an upside of 100% within the end of this year.For traders, one important date to bear in mind is the 17th of this month when full-contact practice for the NFL starts.In this respect, the NFL has hired BioReference Laboratories to perform the entirety of its COVID-19 testing."
4230833,24594,2019-01-09T05:00:00-05:00,"Disappointing Q4 guidance, followed by another guidance cut, has sent LLNW tumbling.Cyclical fears and micro-/small-cap weakness likely haven't helped.But this isn't a cyclical play: the core secular tailwind from higher video streaming should persist in any macro environment.The market seems to believe that it's the ""same old same old"" LLNW - but even that eventuality looks priced in, while growth is not.","CDN (content delivery network) provider Limelight Networks (LLNW) has executed an impressive turnaround over the past few years:Source: author from LLNW filings. 2018 and 2019 figures at midpoint of guidance updated 12/12/18And the market has responded, re-rating LLNW shares...""Hey, wait a minute"":LLNW data by YChartsLLNW has fallen by over 50% in just two months. The market didn't like Q3 results in mid-October, and it really didn't like updated guidance earlier this month, which suggests an ugly Q4 2018.The decline might come from the fact that LLNW's valuation had become a bit stretched starting in late 2017. I passed on the stock twice last year, most recently arguing in September 2017 that even at $3.50+ the turnaround already looked priced in. Margins looked like they were near a ceiling. The CDN space faces real risk from ""do it yourself"" efforts at major customers (Apple (AAPL), for instance, already has moved in that direction) and competition from Amazon.com (AMZN), Verizon (VZ), and many others. In that context, even assuming solid revenue growth, a low- to mid-teen EBITDA multiple seemed to leave little room for expansion, and with balance sheet leverage negative made it tough to see how LLNW could move much higher.From a short-term standpoint, that case obviously was wrong, as LLNW traded between $4 and $5 for most of 2018. But from a broader standpoint, that skeptical case didn't necessarily play out, either. EBITDA margins were originally guided up 25 bps or so in 2017; they wound up expanding 310 bps, thanks to a 520 bps increase in gross margin. Amazon itself became a 10% customer last year, according to the 10-K and Apple has been at 10%+ in past quarters. The turnaround I expected might have been priced in; the turnaround Limelight delivered was not.Meanwhile, it's five quarters later and LLNW is ~one-third cheaper - and the recent plunge takes any valuation worries away. EV/EBITDA (note that net litigation liabilities owed to Akamai (AKAM) are treated as debt in calculating enterprise value) now is under ~8x based on 2018 guidance, and 6.6x the midpoint of the 2019 range. LLNW, backing out ~$0.33 per share in cash (again, net of the Akamai liability), trades at under 12x 2019 EPS guidance.The multiples now suggest that not only the turnaround is over, but so is any kind of growth. And that seems close to a ridiculous outlook in the context of the story here. Broad market and cyclical concerns likely haven't helped the stock - but this isn't a cyclical story, at all. A U.S. recession in 2019 or 2020 (or both) doesn't mean that streaming video growth slows, that the transition to 4K doesn't happen, that video games aren't bought via digital downloads, or that Pandora (P) and Spotify (SPOT) listenership declines. It certainly doesn't negate the improvements - both financial and qualitative - that Limelight has made over the past few years.This is now a stock whose biggest risk from a valuation perspective is that it goes backwards. That is possible - but how exactly that is supposed to happen seems rather unclear. As such, the 20-month low for LLNW looks like a massive overreaction.LLNW shares didn't really budge in the first half of October, as broad markets (and tech) started tumbling. But implied Q4 guidance given with Q3 results on October 18 were not well-received, sending the stock down 16%. Essentially, the market seemed to be expecting yet another beat-and-raise, and it only got a mixed beat:Source: LLNW Q3 releaseThe sell-off continued from there, and LLNW fell another 19% last week after updating full-year 2018 guidance and giving initial projections for 2019. Fundamentally, the decline seems to make sense. Original Q4 guidance in October looked disappointing; the results for the quarter implied by the update seem to suggest a disaster:LLNW Implied Q4 GuidanceSource: author calculations from LLNW releases* at midpoint of implied guidanceInitial 2019 guidance does look solid against 2018 numbers. Revenue of $220-225 million would rise 12.5-15% year over year. Adjusted EBITDA of $35-40 million suggests margin expansion, with y/y growth of 13-29% against the 2018 midpoint.But because Q4 2018 is expected to be so disappointing, that guidance too is colored. Coming out of Q3, Limelight was expecting $35-37 million in Adjusted EBITDA this year, which in turn should have had investors modeling in $40M at least in 2019. Similarly, the midpoint of the '19 ranges brings concerns about margin expansion back to the fore: they suggest a nice improvement year-over-year, but just a 20 bps increase from the 16.7% print in 2017.So there's fundamental bad news in the guidance cut which suggests some pressure on LLNW. There are qualitative concerns as well. It's worth walking through the commentary in the update release from CEO Bob Lento:Lento goes on to discuss some of the growth initiatives for 2019 and beyond (more on those later). But this commentary, combined with the guided declines in revenue and profits, seems extremely concerning.For instance, Limelight did step away from business: in fact, it said on the Q3 call that two of its top ten customers ""are no longer on our network."" It disclosed on the Q2 call that six of the other top ten customers had all renegotiated their contracts at roughly the same time - an ""unusual"" occurrence, as Lento termed it more than once, that appeared due simply to timing (the CEO said in the Q&A of that call that ""it just so happened that all of these negotiations came together at once."") This appears to be the ""periodic repricing"" to which Lento referred last week.The obvious question is: what changed between October 18, when the Q3 call was held and these issues were known, and December 12, when the updated guidance was released? Limelight's original implied guidance for Q4 suggested on a year-over-year basis revenue growth and a modest EBITDA decline - which actually makes some sense in the context of the Q2 and Q3 disclosures.Because renegotiated contracts pretty much always have a stepdown in pricing; that's the way the industry works. Here's Akamai CFO James Benson discussing exactly that on his company's Q4 2017 conference call:But, again, that issue should have been known in October. And that brings back two long-running concerns when it comes to LLNW.The first is the impact of pricing. This is a business - again, not just a Limelight issue - where pricing is expected to decline steadily. A big part of the earnings improvement for Limelight over the past few years has come from efforts to consolidate servers and cut costs. Limelight's costs have come down much faster than pricing. Gross margin in 2013 was 35.6%; it's likely going to be 49%+ this year. Over that stretch, Adjusted EBITDA margins are going to expand about 1460 basis points - and close to 1400 bps is coming from COGS.One of the worries here - and one of the reasons I was skeptical last year about the pace of margin expansion - is that those benefits are going to moderate. Limelight has used software enhancements to drive much of the improvement: per the Q4 2017 call, capacity doubled last year with 60%+ of the increase coming from software efforts.The obvious risk here is that if those efforts slow, margins hit a ceiling. But if those efforts slow and the general downward pricing trend accelerates, margins very well may start to reverse. It's clear investors are concerned about pricing: both Limelight and Akamai are asked multiple times on every single earnings call about the nature of pricing and the competitive environment. The answer from both companies is usually something along the lines of ~""pricing is going down, it always goes down, but there's nothing really new going on.""That said, Akamai did mention some ""heightened"" pressure in certain verticals on its Q2 call. Akamai CEO Tom Leighton also pointed out that ""major broadcasters and media folks...get the most competitive and lowest pricing per bit because of the volume discounts."" And it just so happens that Limelight is ""engaged with several large U.S. broadcasters,"" per Lento's commentary in last week's update - and seems to have badly misjudged pricing and margins.Bear in mind that Limelight CFO Sajid Malhotra predicted ""improving margins"" on the Q3 call. At the time, 2018 guidance implied EBITDA margins of 17.9% at the midpoint - which in turn suggests that Malhotra was signaling 18%+ in 2019. The initial 2019 guidance (again, at the midpoint) projects margins of just 16.9%.2019 margin expectations were pulled down at least 110 bps in two months - and there's really no other explanation other than pricing. Certainly, none was given last week. Revenue growth still looks decent, even accounting for the easy comparison coming in Q4 2019. The new initiatives remain on the way, and there was no mention of additional one-time investment on that front, as one might expect if that were to be the case.And so investors are going to believe that the guidance cut is coming from pricing - and pricing beyond eight of the top ten customers as of Q2, given that six had contracts renegotiated (and thus known) and two are gone. They're also going to believe that most, if not all, of the low-hanging fruit on the server front has been harvested: Lento himself said as much back on the Q1 2017 call.That essentially is the biggest fundamental risk coming home to roost - and doing so in short order. If gross margins are done expanding, EBITDA margins are probably going down, given that SG&A spend is rising behind new initiatives and new markets (such as overseas expansion). That fear gets some confirmation from the fact that consensus 2019 EPS of $0.14 now is below the company's 2019 guidance of $0.15-0.20, while revenue only is modestly below the range.That skepticism from analysts highlights the second qualitative issue here: a potential distrust of management. There was nothing from management on the Q3 call to suggest that kind of pricing weakness. In fact, Lento repeatedly said on that call - in both his prepared remarks and in the Q&A - that the company's guidance was better given its newfound visibility into its business. That commentary appeared a way to head off the disappointment that guidance hadn't been raised: Lento admitted that past guidance had been conservative, which wasn't the case anymore, which meant that a 2018 meet was just as good as a 2016 beat.And then, two months later, guidance gets slashed. Implied Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 went from $7.1-9.1 million to $2.1-4.1 million. At the midpoint, EBITDA margins went from 16%+ to ~7%.That makes this look like ""same old Limelight."" This is a stock that went public in 2007 at $15 and closed its first day above $22. It hasn't been able to drive consistent growth. The bear case here always has been, at least in part, that the company is a subscale operator in a difficult industry (as witnessed by steady pricing declines). The bull case has had to be a classic ""this time is different"" argument. Looking at Q4, between what looks like significant pricing pressure and a management team caught completely flat-footed, this doesn't look very different at all. Nor does the LLNW share price, which now has returned to where it was before the multi-year turnaround even took place.As always in the dented and damaged small-cap space, the risks need to be fully understood and appreciated. And it is foolish to suggest that LLNW's decline is an overreaction to the guidance, or solely the result of the tech/small-cap/broad market sell-off that's been going for much of the year in one form or another. There are concerns in the Q4 guidance, and those concerns undercut the optimism from management that Limelight will get back to double-digit revenue growth plus margin expansion in 2019.That said, this is a huge decline. LLNW has dropped 50%+ in barely two months. Considering net cash at the end of Q3 of ~$39 million, the drop in terms of enterprise value is even bigger (in the range of 57%). EBITDA multiples have come down from ~13x 2018 figures to ~8x and 7x the low end of 2019 guidance.There's a case that lower multiples across the market should, on their own, drive some compression. Obviously, investors are not valuing future cash flows as dearly in December as they did in September. AKAM shares have pulled back since the October sell-off started, with a big gain following a Q3 beat (driven in part by cloud security growth) wiping out the initial sell-off, only for the stock to fall back near a 52-week low.For Limelight, however, that case falls a bit flat. There's really little reason to expect a notable cyclical headwind even in the event of a recession. If anything, a bull could stretch and see LLNW as modestly countercyclical. Video revenue now is over half of the company's top-line total. Doesn't a recession likely increase the pace of 'cord-cutting' as consumers pinch pennies? If an investor really wants to stretch the logic, wouldn't unemployed Americans watch more video content? That case might be a bit facetious - but there's really little reason to suggest that macro fears change the secular story here and the market growth driven by increasing digital video delivery.If the multiples shouldn't be affected by market-wide/macro fears, then essentially LLNW has been re-rated from pricing in growth (and maybe too much growth, if my past arguments were correct) to pricing in very little growth. Backing out cash, the stock is trading at 19x 2018 EPS and 11.6x 2019 EPS. Normalized free cash flow multiples are a bit higher using 2019 guidance, but capex looks a bit higher than usual owing to growth initiatives and should moderate somewhat going forward.But there are a number of growth drivers still left here. For one, CDN demand is going to continue to expand for years. More video is being streamed - and of better quality, which only adds to data needs: 4K, for instance, requires 4x the bandwidth of HD. Limelight has spent years upgrading its infrastructure to be able to compete on quality in areas like 4K; even assuming some level of distrust to management, the steady improvements in revenue and margin of late show those upgrades are paying off.Market share might be an issue, whether it's Akamai (which appears to be competing more on price), other providers, or DIY. But that market is going to expand - and Limelight's recent numbers, even including the ugly Q4, suggest that it's found a good niche in that market as a higher-quality provider that isn't just getting commodity pricing. The needs for bandwidth, and specifically for quality bandwidth, aren't going away, and that should mean that neither is Limelight's opportunity.That alone, even assuming some potential margin compression in or after 2019, probably is enough to at least keep LLNW stable. But there are new initiatives that should augment the core business. The company has partnered with Ericsson (ERIC) to push ""edge"" cloud computing, which steps away from centralized cloud computing to provide low-latency and close to real-time responsiveness. Limelight and Ericsson aren't alone: Akamai, Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) all are rolling out their own efforts. But for Limelight, Lento has forecast potentially millions of dollars in incremental revenue - and the deal is material enough for Ericsson that it contributed to updated outlooks for Q4 and 2019.There's also the real time streaming effort from Limelight. Using open-source WebRTC, Limelight can cut video streaming latency to under a second from 30 seconds or more. There are a number of obvious applications here, online gambling, sports broadcasting, and gaming included. Limelight appears to be first to market in that space and should have some opportunities to capitalize in 2019.Beyond that, there're international opportunities. 37% of 2017 sales came from overseas, but that figure should rise. The company has signed a deal with Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) Cloud. In recent quarters, the company has expanded in Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America.Limelight is going to face a steadily expanding addressable market for years, between CDN demand, edge computing and extending reach outside the U.S. And even with the recent disappointment from an earnings standpoint, it's facing that market as unquestionably a better operator than it was a few years back (as I pointed out even while questioning valuation last year). The company finally has settled cross-litigation with Akamai; the large stake once owned by Goldman Sachs (GS) has been sold. M&A is on the table, though management insisted it wouldn't try and move into adjacent markets after the company erred on that front earlier this decade (most notably by acquiring EyeWonder for $110 million in 2009 and selling it for $66 million two years later).Pricing is a concern, and management credibility was undercut last week. But this still seems like a company that is going to grow - with a stock priced as if it won't.Trying to peg a fair value target for LLNW is tough. AKAM trades at a high-9 multiple to 2018 EBITDA, by my numbers, and about 3.8x EV/revenue. LLNW is at 8x EBITDA and ~1.3x revenue for 2018, and 7x and 1.1x, respectively, to the low end of 2019 guidance.AKAM is hardly a perfect peer, of course, given that its revenue is about 14x that of Limelight, while margins are higher and the business is more diversified. Competitors like Verizon, Microsoft, and Level 3 (now owned by CenturyLink (CTL)) aren't any more help. Startup Fastly (listed in the LLNW 10-K as a competitor) has reportedly raised $219 million ahead of a potential IPO, with run-rate revenue exceeding $100 million, which at least suggests LLNW's 1x+ EV/S multiple could be conservative.So there's a bit of a 'feel' aspect to pinning down a price target. But there is obvious upside here if Limelight can hit its targets - or even get close. Management on the Q2 call projected that the newer initiatives could accelerate growth and help margins, with targets of 15%+ annual top-line increases and gross margins of 55%. Even assuming some SG&A deleverage along the way, that still suggests five-year targets of $400M+ in revenue and EBITDA well past $80M (at 20%+ margins). That kind of growth likely merits at least a double-digit multiple, and the possibility of a buyout of the long-rumored takeover target suggests a way to catalyze that value. At an EV of $800 million-plus, LLNW shares are worth $6.50+ - a near-triple from current levels.More conservatively (or perhaps more realistically), there's still room for multiple expansion if LLNW can get back on track hitting its near-term targets. 8-10x 2019 EBITDA guidance isn't out of reach in the next 12 months, and at the midpoint that gets LLNW easily back over $3, or 27% upside. It may be that small-cap tech simply isn't going to see 2016-2018 valuations (when admittedly a lot of clunkers saw multiples of 10x+ EBITDA and 25x/35x earnings), but if Limelight can resurrect its story, some multiple expansion isn't off the table.And as far as downside goes, LLNW isn't necessarily at a floor - but there is quite a bit of risk priced in. This still is a business that's easily free cash flow-positive (though note that share-based comp is a concern on that front, as it's about equal to normalized FCF) and has no debt. The Akamai liabilities come off the books after Q2 2019. There's $21 million-plus left on a repurchase authorization (which hopefully will be used in short order). LLNW still has potential downside, particularly in this market (and I'd note I've recommended a few falling knives too early of late), but a sub-1x revenue multiple still keeps the stock above $2 and seems awfully cheap in the context of growth potential.Investors can run the numbers in different ways - but a qualitative focus still seems the easiest way to view the bull case here. The Q4 guidance cut is concerning in terms of pricing and management. But pricing has been falling already as LLNW has taken EBITDA margins from 1% to 16%+ - and under that management team. Market share will be tough to protect - but Limelight clearly has taken share from Akamai the last few years, and end markets should grow for some time to come. There remains a huge mid- to long-term opportunity here - an opportunity for which investors were willing to pay more than twice the current LLNW share price. One bad quarter and potential rising risks don't negate the entire opportunity or justify that kind of haircut."
4204767,104735,2018-09-07T08:45:00-04:00,"LLNW was ignored by the market until late August.
        Company is leveraged to growing demand for streaming video content.
        Analysts are turning bullish, but most big investors are just returning from summer vacation.
        Management has removed two key overhangs in 2018.
        LLNW has four solid quarters under its belt and is expectedto average 46% earnings growth over the next three years.","There’s some irony that a company named Limelight Networks (LLNW) had been ignored by investors for most of 2018. However, the stock has perked up in the past couple of weeks, as Wall Street analysts started to take notice of the company.First, B. Riley added the content delivery network (CDN) manager to its Alpha Generator List on Aug. 23. A few days later, Craig-Hallum started coverage of Limelight with a Buy rating.As a result of the bullish research calls, shares have jumped 13% over the past two weeks and recently changed hands around $4.71. A closer look at the company’s fundamentals suggest that it remains reasonably valued and the stock could press even higher by the end of the year.4 Straight Quarters of Double-Digit GrowthIt’s not as if Limelight had been slouching previously, as the second quarter of 2018 was the fourth straight time that management posted double-digit revenue growth. Excluding one-time items, the company earned $0.04 a share in the June quarter, which was a penny ahead of the consensus analyst estimate. Revenue increased 11% year-over-year to $50.3 million and also topped expectations.Digging a little deeper into the results last quarter yields more positives. Gross margin improved 230 basis points from the previous year and management boosted full-year sales guidance while Limelight is cutting capital spending. The company also reported a record low customer churn rate in the period.Video delivery accounts for half of Limelight’s revenue and is also its fastest growing division. The company is leveraged to the increase of demand for over-the-top video and is launching a new real-time streaming service later this year. Edge computing services is also seen as a blossoming growth area from Limelight, but management does not expect to see meaningful revenue from this area until 2019.The company ended the quarter with $45.6 million ($0.40 a share) of cash and equivalents on the balance sheet. Management noted on the conference call that it is considering potential acquisitions with the excess cash balance.Competitive Market, but Important Overhangs AddressedThe company’s key product in the CDN market is its Orchestrate software suite and Akamai (AKAM) is its chief competitor. Limelight said last quarter that average revenue per user increased 26% year-over-year to $73,000, which management believes may be tops in the industry.Even so, the company’s sales are relatively concentrated, as its top 20 customers account for over 70% of the company’s sales. Management said that it negotiated new contracts with 6 of its top 10 users last quarter, noting that industry pricing is becoming more competitive.Limelight cleared two major hurdles earlier this year and should likely no longer be trading at such a discount to its peers. First, Goldman Sachs, its largest shareholder, sold its remaining 15 million shares in March. The company also settled a long-standing patent dispute with industry giant Akamai in April.Growth at a Reasonable PriceConsensus estimates call for Limelight to generate 46% compound annual earnings growth over the next three years. While that might seem like a lofty expectation, management has exceeded the consensus analyst profit estimate seven straight quarters.The stock is trading at 22x expected 2019 earnings of $0.21 a share, which is a discount to the industry median of 28x. Similarly, the company has an enterprise value of 2.2x expected 2019 revenue of $223 million, compared with the industry median of 3.8x.The last few weeks of August historically see some of the lowest trading volumes of the year, as portfolio managers and traders look to capture a final summer vacation. As investors return en masse from the Labor Day holiday and begin to position portfolios for the stretch run of 2018, I believe there is room for Limelight to trade up toward the same valuations afforded its peers coming months.The next potential catalyst could be a slate of investor meetings on the West Coast the company has listed on its website for the week of Sept. 10."
4058494,24594,2017-03-29T11:52:37-04:00,"LLNW's turnaround has boosted profits and margins of late, which has helped drive a double off early 2016 lows.The road now gets a bit too tougher, with low-hanging margin fruit largely harvested and growth needing to come in a potentially challenged CDN space.LLNW isn't that expensive on an EBITDA basis, and seems well-positioned against industry behemoth Akamai.But it's expensive enough, and industry challenges leave me on the sidelines for now.","The catch with Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW) at the moment is that it's a ""this time is different"" story. A turnaround executed over the past few years has boosted margins (particularly on the gross line) and profitability. Execution looks vastly improved, and the core content delivery network (CDN) product is better than it's been for some time - and possibly ever.Looking forward, however, the immediate benefits of the turnaround seem largely realized. Limelight is reinvesting in sales and marketing in 2017, for instance, and Adjusted EBITDA margins are guided up just 25 bps year over year. Meanwhile, the CDN space still appears challenged at the moment for a number of reasons. That means growth for Limelight is going to come from winning in a tough industry, and, to be blunt, that's something it simply hasn't done much of in its nearly 10 years as a public company.LLNW data by YChartsThere is a bull case here. On its own, Limelight can take share from Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM), grow its newer security and storage products, and drive some level of operating leverage going forward. Meanwhile, LLNW seems like a reasonably logical acquisition target given that giants like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) have targeted the CDN space in the past few years.I'm simply not sure that bull case is quite strong enough, or the price quite cheap enough - yet. It is possible that this time is different for Limelight, and it's also possible that the difference won't be enough to drive much, if any, upside from current levels.How We Got HereLimelight managed some revenue growth in its first few years after going public in 2007, but it did little for LLNW stock. The company has tried to diversify its business away from CDN as well, acquiring ad platform EyeWonder for $110 million in 2009 (along with another smaller acquisition of Kiptronic that same year), video platform provider Delve Networks in 2010, and content management vendor Clickability in 2011.None of the efforts lasted very long: EyeWonder was sold for just $66 million in 2011, and Clickability divested at a modest profit in 2013. Over the past five years, Limelight has been reliant on its CDN business - and revenue growth has been minimal.In fact, 2017 revenue guidance of $175-180 million compares unfavorably to 2012 sales of just over $180 million, with about $166 million of the 2012 figure coming from content delivery. The lack of top-line growth has come despite steadily increasing traffic demand, given more (and higher-quality) IP video viewing, heavier software downloads, and busier web pages.In response, Limelight has focused on margins over the past two years by cutting headcount and consolidating headcount. That focus has had some success: Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded from 3.0% in 2014 to 13.6% in 2016, with improvements both in cost of sales and normalized SG&A. The company posted a non-GAAP net profit in 2016, albeit with EPS of just $0.01. It was the first full-year profit in the company's history.It does seem like the easy money has been made, however, from a margin standpoint. Adjusted EBITDA margins are guided up just ~25 bps at the midpoint of 2017 guidance, with a projected 150 bps+ increase in gross margin being offset primarily by investments in sales and marketing. Meanwhile, 2017 guidance still suggests only modestly positive free cash flow - at a rate lower than share-based compensation - and a forward EV/EBITDA multiple of 11.5x seems to suggest more earnings improvement is needed post-2017. The question then is whether Limelight can drive that improvement without the benefit of simply cleaning up past errors.Limelight Networks On Its OwnThere are simple, quick and dirty, bull and bear cases for Limelight Networks going forward, both with enough truth to consider. The bull case is that content demands are only going to increase going forward. OTT services (Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Hulu, Sling TV, etc., along with individual network options) are only going to grow demand for IP-based video. The migration to 4K from HD will further strain existing architecture (4K delivery requires 4x the bandwidth of HD, according to Limelight's 10-K, and Netflix is moving in that direction). Increasing digital downloads of games (the same downloads killing GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock), IoT (Internet of Things), and busier webpages will contribute as well. All of these trends are only going to increase the demand for Limelight's core services going forward. That will increase revenue, drive operating leverage, and improve margins. In turn, LLNW's stock will rise.The bear retort is: what have those drivers done for the industry so far? It's not as if OTT is brand new, and online video consumption has been rising for years. And yet:LLNW data by YChartsLimelight revenue really hasn't moved much, and declined 1.6% in 2016. Akamai stock has been pressured by concerns about its CDN business. Its Media Delivery revenue was down 9% in 2016, according to the AKAM 10-K. On Akamai's Q4 conference call, management said the company was losing share to so-called ""DIY"" systems - like the type Netflix built in exiting its agreement with Limelight. And AKAM is guiding for lower margins in 2017, in part due to pricing considerations.So, yes, CDN demand is going to increase, but that doesn't mean it will go to third-party providers like Akamai, Limelight, or Level 3 Communications (NASDAQ:LVLT). Rather, larger companies are going to go the ""DIY"" route, as have Netflix, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), among many others. The third-party CDN providers will simply fight over share by lowering pricing, a continuing issue for the industry as a whole and one apparently accelerated by recent price cuts by Akamai.An LLNW bull looks at the company and sees a more nimble player with a solid niche and room for growth with the industry. An LLNW bear sees a company (and even an industry) that's going to get shoved around by the industry's giants - per the 10-K, pricing has declined over the past two years, as Limelight has shrunk its customer base and given volume discounts to its larger clients. If Akamai can't hold the line on pricing, and is seeing its best customers develop in-house solutions, what chance does Limelight really have?There's a real risk that the bears are right. The bull case of ""more Internet = more profit for Limelight"" is too simplistic. But Limelight isn't doomed, either. For one, the company has gotten noticeably better. Management has talked up lower service tickets and higher net promoter scores (see this 2016 presentation) and third-party metrics seem to verify its improvement.Nearly a year ago, CDN analyst Dan Rayburn highlighted Akamai's poor performance in video, but Limelight was worse:Source: Cedexis via Dan Rayburn (highlighting by author)Here's how that same chart looks exactly 11 months later:Source: Cedexis, March 27, 2017 (highlighting by author)Limelight is number one in median throughput (the Cedexis offering load-balances different CDNs) and competitive in terms of availability. And the edge in throughput is not small: the difference between #1 Limelight and #2 Fastly is bigger than the gap between Fastly and #9 Akamai.Limelight simply put looks like a much better company than it did a year ago, let alone 3-4 years ago. As far as Akamai's problems go, LLNW's management said repeatedly in 2016 that it wasn't chasing volume over margins, and didn't see the same erosion in DIY efforts by top customers. Internalized CDNs don't mean revenue goes to zero for Limelight, either, as those larger customers will continue to have some external usage.Still, the problem for Limelight seems to be that the company is improving just as its industry is getting worse. Amazon offers a CloudFront CDN through Amazon Web Services. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) entered the space through its acquisition of EdgeCast in late 2013. Comcast has an open-source offering. And the DIY offerings are better and more prevalent.There's a path for Limelight to carve out a niche and establish consistent earnings and cash flow growth going forward. As LLNW's management has pointed out, Limelight clearly outperformed Akamai in 2016, and posted a record traffic day just two weeks ago. Limelight says it can add capacity at a much lower rate than Akamai as well. And it's probably too early to assume that Limelight's turnaround simply is over; investments in sales and marketing this year may be helped by the fact that LLNW can point to its network performance in a way that it couldn't (or wouldn't) over the past few years.But it's a tough path, and I just don't see a compelling reason to jump in yet. Beating Akamai is one thing, but there are myriad other competitors with broader platforms and greater scale. Pricing pressure is always going to be an issue. The decade-long history of struggles can't be ignored. And a 11x+ EV/EBITDA multiple represents a 1 turn-plus premium to AKAM while 2017 guidance isn't particularly impressive. 5% revenue growth and a 7% Adjusted EBITDA increase with non-GAAP EPS of $0.02-0.06 is progress. But to drive real upside from a current $2.46, LLNW probably needs Adjusted EBITDA closer to $40 million. That would get non-GAAP EPS to ~$0.20 (untaxed due to NOLs), and 15x+ P/E multiple and an EV/EBITDA multiple in the 8x range almost certainly get the stock above $3.That's not an easy get in this environment - $40 million is probably a 2019 goal, not an expectation. But it still implies maybe 10% upside at the moment, discounted back. The recent gains in the stock - 60% just since late September - make some sense. But they also leave the stock priced at a level where further near-term appreciation seems much more difficult.External CatalystsThere is potential value for LLNW beyond standalone earnings. The company has substantial deferred tax assets: per the 10-K, $152 million in federal NOL carryforwards, and $98 million in state NOLs (the latter begins to expire this year). Against a $281 million enterprise value (net of a licensing settlement with Akamai), those DTAs aren't immaterial.There's also the M&A case, which has long been a feature of the LLNW bull case. Speculation on Limelight as a takeover target has swirled since at least 2009. Potential acquirers have included Akamai - which reportedly tried to buy Limelight twice during an early phase of the two companies' long-running patent war - Microsoft, Verizon, and others.I'm skeptical on the M&A front. Verizon chose EdgeCast already. Microsoft has DIY efforts. Akamai isn't going to get rewarded for making another CDN acquisition when that business already is a clear concern for investors. AWS most likely doesn't need Limelight. There isn't enough cash flow yet for private equity. That's not to say M&A is impossible - particularly in this environment - but it seems highly unlikely in the near future (I fully expect all Limelight shareholders to send me a tip when the company gets bought out for $5 per share in August).The third catalyst is the continuing litigation with Akamai. Limelight settled one suit last year by agreeing to a $54 million licensing payment over three years. But another trial will begin May 1st, with Limelight saying it is a ""net plaintiff."" Success there could offset some of the $45 million (at the end of Q4) owed to Akamai over the next 10 quarters.The combination of the three probably helps the LLNW bull case. The DTAs could make Limelight more attractive as a target even if Section 382 rules would limit the utilization of the NOLs (Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest a high-single-digit percentage of, say, a $400 million offer could be offset on a net present value basis). Limelight could get a win versus Akamai; assuming even half of the existing licensing agreement is offset, LLNW's stock would be ~8% more valuable.But they're not quite enough, on their own, to be catalysts for significant upside. The case for LLNW still comes back to the ability to compete in 2017-2019 amidst a toughening industry. And I do see that case: improving operations, share capture from Akamai, and some success with new storage and security products (guided to material contribution by 2H) driving growth through the end of the decade. Concerns about DIY and competition can be offset somewhat simply by the overall growth in content; it's not as if Limelight is fighting for a larger share of a declining or even stagnant market.It's just not quite a compelling case at current levels, however. Peer comparisons are tough, because most CDNs aren't publicly traded and neither Akamai (whose revenue is ~14x that of Limelight) nor Level 3 (which has significant operations beyond CDN) is a reliable peer. But I'd like to see either some sort of discount to AKAM - which requires LLNW to get near $2 - or established outperformance beyond the relatively one-time turnaround margin improvements. Limelight's decade-long history doesn't damn the bull case entirely, but it colors it, and, again, there should be at least some skepticism that this time truly is different for Limelight.LLNW is a story worth watching, however. The record traffic in March might bode well for Q1 results, and further divergence with Akamai's performance could help the bull case. The post-election range for LLNW has been about $2.15-2.60, and a return to support would make the stock a bit more attractive as well. But right now, near $2.50, LLNW's bull case just isn't quite compelling enough. We shall see if that changes in 2017.This article is part of Seeking Alpha PRO.

3657096,20875,2015-11-06T11:46:07-05:00,,"For years, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been using multiple third-party CDN providers, including Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) and Level 3 (NASDAQ:LVLT) in addition to delivering content via their own CDN. In some regions, for instance China, Apple will also use a CDN that specializes in that region, like ChinaCache and ChinaNetCenter. Apple's had a multi-CDN strategy for some time and doing some traceroutes yesterday, I see that Apple has recently added Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW) into the mix. I can't tell when Limelight was added, but from the testing I do frequently on where Apple's content is being delivery from, it looks like Limelight has been added within the last few months. There is no way to tell how much traffic Limelight has and you have to trace a lot of content to see it since Apple shifts amongst the CDNs, but the timing makes sense.On Limelight's earnings call this week, the company mentioned they signed up some customers that they had to give a low price point to, which would impact margins in the short term, before they expected the economics of scale to kick in. While Limelight had no comment when I asked them about Apple, traceroutes don't lie. I've also learned that Limelight has gotten more of Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) traffic, be it at a low price point, but a lot of volume. So two of the contracts they were talking to are clearly Apple and Microsoft. How much volume they have we don't know for sure, but it all aligns with some of the points Limelight made on their earnings call.Another interesting thing talked about on Limelight's earnings call was they are not seeing any slow down in traffic growth, which is the exact opposite of what Akamai said on their call last week. So far, no other CDN provider or content owner I have spoken to has said anything about traffic growth slowing. In fact, yesterday Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) reported earnings and said they now see 8B video views per day, up from 4B nearly six months ago. And Limelight said on their call that they ""achieved a new record for both peak bandwidth and terabytes delivered"" in Q3. Limelight also mentioned that their ""largest software and gaming customers peak traffic levels"" are ""growing at extremely higher rates versus a year ago and even sequentially.""I don't buy Akamai's excuse that customers' overall traffic growth is down and that the decline in the growth of their media business is not due to pricing or competitive pressure, when it clearly is. Akamai simply isn't getting as large a percentage of traffic from the big CDN customers as they use to be. Apple adding Limelight to the mix and Sony (NYSE:SNE) adding Level 3 to the mix are both examples of that.Disclosure: None."

Cyber Security Market - a rising tide that lifts all ships.,"Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW) is a content delivery network (CDN). The company operates a global fiber-optic network that helps content providers. Their private network solutions enable organizations to deliver faster websites, more responsive web applications, higher quality video streaming and more recently the ability to mitigate DDOS attacks.The Investment IndicatorsLLNW first caught my eye as I was doing start-up investor research in the DDOS Mitigation space. DDOS mitigation is a large and growing market and after digging a bit deeper I discovered LNNW had an assortment of indicators (outlined above, summarized below) that suggest good things to come and a potentially attractive buy opportunity here. Below is a summary list of the key indicators that suggest this company is likely headed well north in the upcoming months/years.I. Large Insider Buying with a Good Current Relative Entry Price PointLLNW has seen a very positive trend in insider buying over the past year and an accelerated buying binge by key executive team members (CEO, CFO, SVP Dev, SVP Corp Dev and IR, CMO) over the last 30 plus days. Let's face it - no one typically knows better than the inside management team what's going on at a company. When these March insider buys went public the stock saw a bump from the low $3.40s rank up to high $3.90s range. As is often the case with quick bumps in small-cap stocks, the price retreated back, and now sits at the same price area (3.40s) where most of these executives bought in. This suggests a strong entry point opportunity for all those who share the belief that execs working at a company usually have a better sense of what's going on than anyone else. And when they use their personal checkbook, in a significant way, it's usually a far better indicator than anything they might ""say"" or things analysts might project.II. 2015 Guidance and CatalystsStrong 2015 earnings guidance by management along with entry into the DDOS Mitigation space should lead to multiple positive stock price catalysts this year, including positive quarterly reports and new client wins. The company is well positioned to benefit tremendously from their entry into the DDOS product space, the increased public awareness of DDOS and a large/expanding DDOS mitigation market. More on this a bit later.III. Some Positive Supporting Balance Sheet CharacteristicsAs of the end of 2014 the company had $93.1M in cash/marketable securities (equal to roughly 28% of its current 331 million market cap), and virtually no debt, two positives that should continue to support the stock price here. While some of the key financial indicators don't scream buy, LLNW is a small-cap stock now positioning new core services in the rapidly-growing cyber security market. Higher ratios can often be justified for smaller, less mature companies if a growth opportunity surfaces.IV. Good Potential Price Support IndicatorsAs with many small-cap stocks, trade volume and insider buys can often provide good clues to support levels. LLNW had a major bump in price from the 3.40 range to the 3.90 range on larger than normal volume trading after the initial insider buying news a month ago. However, since then the price has retraced gradually, with tighter price swings and lower volumes. LLNW now seems to sit in a possible support range with few buyers or sellers (1/3 of average daily volume). The upcoming quarter (April 30) should be a positive price catalyst (again, assuming management expectations hold true), helping to support price movement and re-confirming the company's market opportunity and growth trend/potential within the cyber security market and DDOS arena.V. Entry into the DDOS Mitigation MarketFor those unfamiliar with what DDOS attacks are, and why they are so relevant to organizations, read this. Essentially DDOS attacks are attacks on web servers by hackers that can leave organizations unable to deliver web services (website access, etc). Users aren't able to access the website servers because the servers are essentially overwhelmed by these DDOS attacks. These attacks can have huge implications for organizations as they essentially shut down the ability to deliver service to consumers. These kinds of attacks are becoming more frequent and more severe. However, unlike the Sony type of attacks that created a strong catalyst impact for many cyber security providers, the DDOS attacks and providers haven't had quite the same glamorous exposure to date (not to say they haven't been discussed significantly in the media and market). The DDOS market presents a very large opportunity with some big returns for the leading providers that can truly deliver effective DDOS mitigation service. I'm guessing that LLNW insider buying and 2015 growth guidance is driven, in no small part, by the market opportunity and trends they are seeing with the increasing DDOS service need/demand/market.VI. Understanding How LLNW Fits Into the Cyber Security Market and ""A Rising Tide Lifts All Ships""While LLNW and other network services providers like Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) and Level 3 Communications (NASDAQ:LVLT) aren't typically thought of as cyber security companies, or part of the cyber security space, the role of private networks is evolving. Historically companies looked to network solution providers first and foremost to ensure faster, more reliable delivery of high bandwidth, lag sensitive content over the Internet. However, the growth of DDOS attacks and the importance of DDOS mitigation is leading to a new cyber security demand driver for private networks. Private networks are ideally situated due to the nature of how networks work to deliver solutions to help mitigate these attacks, and consequently their role in the Cyber Security market is becoming a larger business driver. The rapid growth of the cyber security market is well documented by individuals, organizations and government actions. Fred Wilson, a well-known venture capitalist, touches on the cyber security market in his outlook for 2015. He notes, ""cyber security budgets will explode in 2015 as every company, institution, and government attempts to avoid being 'Sony'd."" The government has taken numerous pro-active moves to support solutions and essentially aid the market. Companies like FireEye (FEYE), CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR), Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT), InfoBlox (NYSE:BLOX) and others have already seen tremendous growth over the past 12 months. Expect the trend to continue as the cyber security problem is far from being addressed, companies are still running vulnerable, and the issues aren't going to get fixed on their own. We've all heard it before, ""a rising tide lifts all ships"" and the cyber security space is likely a good example. For LLNW, their new DDOS mitigation product leverages their existing networking infrastructure/services and brings them full tilt into the cyber security arena, just one more indicator that appears to make them a good risk/reward play here.LLNW Investment RisksAs with all stocks there is risk, and in the case of small-cap stocks increased risk. Two particular risks that could hamper the outlook and potential for continued growth and trending with LLNW both lie in the delivery of the DDOS Mitigation product. First, while the DDOS market represents a big opportunity it also has a large number of players pursuing it, both large corporations and small start-ups. As with all industries with large market opportunities, the competitive landscape will continue to heat up, squeezing margins and reducing opportunity per provider. Second, DDOS mitigation is no easy fix. How well a company delivers on truly providing an effective solution that mitigates DDOS attacks, in relation to other providers, will play a key role in their success. There's a reason it's called DDOS ""mitigation"" versus ""prevention"" because you can't typically ""stop"" attacks or completely prevent any damage from them, you can only ""mitigate"" them. So, how effective the mitigation is will play a significant role in the product's value and success. The likely winners in the DDOS mitigation space will be those that ""mitigate"" the best and who have significant market access to roll-up clients. And then of course there is always the macro market conditions that have nothing to do with LLNW - the market as a whole goes south all bets are off."
4105758,24594,2017-09-11T12:16:46-04:00,"I passed on LLNW earlier this year; the stock has gained 45% since then.By management's own admission, ""low-hanging fruit"" on the margin front has been harvested, and revenue growth is solid but hardly exceptional.With industry leader Akamai going the opposite way, and pricing pressure in the space as a whole, the optimism seems a bit high.Limelight is doing a nice job - but I'm skeptical it's got the several years of improvement remaining that look priced in at the moment.","I wrote back in March that the bull case for Limelight Networks (LLNW) was a ""this time it's different"" kind of story. And to Limelight's credit, after a strong first half, it is starting to look like it's different this time around. A company that has seen revenue stall out for years is starting to grow the top line, with further acceleration guided in the second half. Margins have improved nicely in the first half, thanks to Limelight's efforts to improve efficiency. Limelight looks like it's finally become consistently profitable, and full-year guidance has been raised after both Q1 and Q2.So there is room for optimism. But with the stock trading at 14x EBITDA and 2x revenue on an enterprise basis, a lot of the optimism looks priced in from here. Margin improvement can continue post-2017, but it likely will slow. And the CDN (Content Delivery Network) space looks increasingly challenged, as witnessed by the recent divergence between LLNW and industry leader Akamai Technologies (AKAM):LLNW data by YChartsThat chart pretty much sums up the bull/bear divide here. Bulls can point to Limelight's recent improvement, and its potential for further growth. But, for now, and even though I was too conservative earlier this year, I lean toward the bearish side. Limelight is doing a nice job - but it's in an increasingly difficult space. And I'd argue, still, that at some point, the pressures in the space are going to overcome the improvements in the business. But at its current valuation, LLNW is priced as if growth will continue for some time.Simply looking at Limelight's first half, there's reason to see further upside from Friday's close of $3.57. Revenue growth hasn't been exactly torrid, with sales increasing 8% in Q1 and 4% in Q2. But Limelight has focused on more profitable customers over that period, with its customer count falling 14% year over year in Q2, per the Q2 release.What's been more impressive is the margin expansion. Gross margins expanded a whopping 550 bps in the first half, according to the 10-Q. Bandwidth and co-location costs - which account for over half of cost of sales, and nearly 30% of first-half revenue - actually declined 8% year over year in the first two quarters.Limelight has consolidated its data server locations, lowering fees, while software improvements and other efficiencies have provided a boost as well. SG&A has deleveraged modestly, due in large part to higher variable compensation. But net/net, margins have expanded nicely: Adjusted EBITDA rose 44% in the first half, thanks to a 420 bps expansion in margins.Meanwhile, management commentary on both calls has been strong. As noted, full-year guidance has been raised after each quarter. Limelight has talked up international expansion, including a targeted (and successful) effort to build out capacity in India. CFO Sajid Malhotra, on the Q1 call, called that quarter ""the best quarter in Limelight's history."" In Q2, the company set records for non-GAAP net income and EBITDA, and as Malhotra pointed out on the Q2 call, revised guidance suggests 2017 will be the company's best year ever.Limelight is preparing a long-term model to be released shortly, and the context of that release seems clear: the company finally feels like it's turned the corner in terms of driving consistent profitability and growth at the moment, and feels like it can turn its eye toward more aggressive and longer-term targets. It's hard to review the first half of 2017 and get the sense that there's anything but upside for LLNW stock.There are two catches, however, particularly after LLNW has doubled in the past year. The first is how much of that improvement is priced in, with the stock trading at 14x EBITDA and a steep multiple to even non-GAAP EPS (trailing twelve-month EPS is just $0.06). The second is how much improvement is left. And on both fronts, I see a reasonable amount of concern.Taking the second point first, it does seem like margin expansion is coming to an end - at least at the pace seen in the first half. Full-year guidance implies roughly ~50 bps in gross margin expansion in the second half against the ~550 bps increase seen in H1. CEO Bob Lento admitted on the Q1 call that ""most of the low-hanging fruit has been taken care of,"" as far as server optimization goes. Malhotra seemed to argue on the Q2 call that there was still room for improvement on that front, but it certainly seems like the pace of margin expansion will slow - if only because of Limelight's own guidance.And with EBITDA margins guided to 14%+ for 2017, 50 bps here and 100 bps there isn't quite enough to keep the story going. Limelight needs consistent, multi-year revenue growth going forward. And that may be tougher than it looks. The CDN product here certainly is improved, with at least one measure showing Limelight CDN as an industry leader. But that industry remains relatively challenged.For one, there is a trend of larger companies bringing CDN efforts in-house, among them Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). Malhotra responded to those concerns on the Q1 call by pointing out that growth from Amazon.com (AMZN) - now a 10% customer for Limelight despite offering its own Cloudfront CDN through Amazon Web Services - Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL) Google was outpacing overall top 40 customer growth. ""We're capturing this growth even as they build in-house capabilities,"" he said, adding ""I think we've made this point enough times to debunk the potential 'do-it-yourself' impact from these customers.""Perhaps. But it does seem as if revenue from Microsoft has declined, or at least flattened, given that company was a 10% customer in 1H 2016. And the concern about DIY isn't solely about Apple ignoring CDNs altogether. It's that third-party volume growth will be limited by DIY efforts taking some share, leaving providers like Akamai, Limelight, Level 3 (LVLT) and others to compete on price.And, indeed, that's what seems to be happening. Akamai already has cut prices once this year, and per its Q2 conference call seems set to do so again after a 9% decline in Media Delivery segment revenue. Respected industry analyst Dan Rayburn argued just last month that pricing is ""at rock bottom."" Both Lento and Malhotra have shrugged off potential pricing pressure as more of the same - but it may not be just more of the same, particularly with Akamai apparently willing to give on margins.It isn't necessarily as if Limelight's turnaround is heading for a brick wall, or is only going to last two quarters. But valuation seems to incorporate several years of pretty solid revenue growth and margin expansion. And that seems like a big ask for Limelight, given industry pressure and the limited amount of ""low-hanging fruit"" remaining.Because at this point, LLNW is pretty dearly valued. The 14x multiple to the midpoint of EBITDA guidance (note that enterprise value backs out $36 million in litigation monies payable to Akamai) is nearly double that of AKAM. This is a company that only now looks like it could be consistently profitable. Full-year guidance does suggest an acceleration in revenue growth in the back half, but margin expansion very well may slow in 2018, which puts a lot of pressure on volume given persistent pricing declines.Given Limelight's size, the current price is asking a lot, particularly with what looks like limited optionality from an acquisition. Akamai reportedly looked to buy Limelight at the beginning of their long-running battle (which continues over other patents), but recent performance would make it highly unlikely that they'd look to add to their CDN business (in fact, Akamai is trying desperately to diversify away from the space). Majors like Amazon, Verizon (VZ), and Comcast (CMCSA) have their own offerings.Even assuming a two-turn premium to Akamai's multiple, the market is pricing in something like 40% growth over the next 2-3 years, discounting the current LLNW price back at 8%. But this year's guidance suggests just 14% growth, and single-digit percentage improvement in the second half. Expanding that multiple a bit doesn't help much. Limelight's near-term target is for 16-20% EBITDA margins; giving credit for the high end of that figure, 7% annual revenue growth over the next two years, and a 10x multiple, LLNW is worth $3.59 at the moment (again, discounted back 8%).Investors are pricing LLNW as if its turnaround is only beginning - and that might be true to some extent. But the pace of the improvement in the first half simply isn't going to hold up, particularly on the margin side. That puts pressure on the top line, and for Limelight to drive volume by either keeping larger clients from bringing more CDN work in-house and/or by taking share from leaders like Akamai and Level 3. It's possible, for sure. But it seems, to me, a lot less likely than the market seems to think at the moment."
3301885,23762,2015-07-04T18:34:05-04:00,"Almost two years ago I profiled a small CDN play named Limelight Networks that was in the midst of a turnaround plan that I believed had merit.The stock was selling at under $2.00 a share at the time but I liked the risk/reward profile of the stock for many reasons.Since then the stock has more than doubled to over $4.00 a share. However, there may be more upside ahead as the company continues to improve its business.Given the amount of M&A activity going on in the markets, this small-cap concern could easily be gobbled up by a larger competitor as well.","It has been almost two years since I first shined the spotlight on a small content delivery network (or CDN) named Limelight Networks (LLNW). The stock was selling at a little less than $2.00 a share at the time after falling on some hard times. At the time of my profile, the company was just initiating a turnaround strategy and had brought in a new CEO to deliver improved shareholder returns. I thought the strategy had a good chance to succeed and liked the risk/reward profile of Limelight from an investment perspective.It turned out to be a correct call as new leadership has improved the company's underlying business fundamentals. The stock has more than doubled since that article ran to over $4.00 a share. As a nice of return as that has been, I still have a small stake in this small-cap play. The story still has many positives to it and further upside could well be ahead. Here are some of things I still like about Limelight Networks.Insider Buying and Cash Balance:One of the things that gives me confidence holding my stake even though the stock is up more than 100% over the past couple of years is insiders have confidence in Limelight Networks' future. You can see this being demonstrated by the myriad directors who have continue to make frequent purchases of the shares in 2015 even as the stock has rallied substantially. In addition, the company has a pristine balance sheet with some $80 million in net cash on the books which is almost 20% of the company's overall market capitalization of ~$425 million.The Trend Is Your Friend:Since I penned that article in August of 2013, the company has done a good job improving its operational efficiencies. Expenses have gone from roughly 60% of revenue to 55%. Gross margins have improved from approximately 35% of sales to almost 40%. Quarterly customer churn in the first quarter was the lowest since 2009 within the results reported in late April.EBITDA has gone from just under a negative $4 million per quarter to right around $1 million as of its last quarter. Adjusted EBITDA has been positive for several quarters. The company has done a good job of upgrading and rolling out new products and infrastructure including improved cybersecurity capabilities.The company has weather the loss of the business from Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) in 2014 well. Excluding revenue from Netflix, sales growth was 17% year-over-year last quarter and posting slight gains even with the low margin Netflix business in 2014 included. Limelight also posted a record breaking traffic day, month and quarter in its latest quarterly results. The company also achieved new records for speed and petabytes served.Recent Positive Catalysts:The stock went further in rally mode when Limelight reported quarterly earnings on April 30th. The company also hiked forward guidance. In addition, the stock had a positive reaction this week when Cowen initiated the shares as a Buy with a $5.00 a share price target. Two months ago in the last analyst action on this stock, B. Riley upgraded Limelight to a Buy as well with a $6.50 a share target and that call has been a good one in the two months that has followed as the stock has rallied nicely over the past 60 days.Outlook:Limelight's business metrics are definitely moving in the right direction. Analysts are starting to notice the company in a positive way. CDN traffic continues to grow impressively as more and more video gets distributed around the web. Mobile traffic and game traffic also continue to grow nicely. Given the small size of Limelight, I could easily see a larger player like Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) make a play given the huge volume of M&A activity in the market in 2015. Macquarie recently speculated Limelight would be a great acquisition target for Level 3 (NASDAQ:LVLT).In short, I see no reason to sell Limelight at this time as capital appreciation still appears to be in front of it. The company should soon see positive earnings after posting small losses in recent years. I believe the company will continue to grow or be bought out by a larger competitor at a nice premium."
4213869,104735,2018-10-24T12:31:06-04:00,"Company met quarterly expectations, but stock received 16% haircut.
        Stock looks oversold on PEG and relative valuation.
        Multi-prong strategy can drive 42% average annual earnings growth over next three years.
        Management is generating record cash flow.","On Oct. 18, Limelight Networks (LLNW) met analyst expectations for the third quarter, which is historically its slowest.Despite a seemingly strong headline result, the stock received a 16% haircut following the report. Such is the life of a small-cap technology stock, when interest rates are rising and trading volatility is spiking across the globe.[object HTMLElement]While this marks the first time in eight quarters that management did not exceed profit expectations, there was little to dispel the positive outlook I put forth about the company several weeks back. My experience with low-dollar stocks suggests this decline has created a buying opportunity, as Limelight is positioned to deliver solid growth in 2019.Excluding one-time items, the company earned $0.03 a share in the third quarter, which matched the consensus analyst estimate. Revenue increased 7% from the previous year to $49.3 million and exceeded expectations.One potential negative from the quarter is that Limelight is no longer doing business with two of its previous top-10 customers. In the initial write-up, I mentioned the company was in the process of renegotiating contracts with key customers.Management believes the capacity can be successfully replaced over time with better pricing and Limelight still managed to expand the gross margin by 30 basis point from the previous year, to 48.7%. The company is keeping a tight lid on costs and lowered its 2018 CapEx guidance by 10% this quarter.Limelight also generated a record $11.7 million of cash flow from operations in the third quarter, ending with a cash balance of $52.7 million ($0.45 a share). Management has said before that it would consider acquisitions with its growing cash pile.The company’s key product in the Content Delivery Network (CDN) market is its Orchestrate software suite and Akamai (AKAM) is its chief competitor. Limelight said last quarter that average revenue per user $73,800, which management believes may be tops in the industry. Amazon.com (AMZN) remains the company’s largest customer and only one that accounts for at least 10% of total revenue.With this quarter behind, Limelight the focus shifts toward how management can grow the business in 2019 and beyond. Through this multi-prong approach, the company said on the conference call it’s targeting potential 15% annual revenue growth and 55% gross margin within three yearsThe first avenue is new products and technologies, such as real-time streaming (RTS) video and edge computing. The company debuted its RTS service in September, which reduces the lag behind live broadcast from the current 30 or more seconds to less than one second.Another way that Limelight plans to grow over the next several quarters is with strategic partners across the globe. The company generated its first meaningful revenue from a partnership with Tencent is China this quarter.Management also just inked a deal with Ericsson, which places Limelight directly inside a carrier network for the first time, where Akamai has already been for a while.The company will be the exclusive software provider for content delivery, while Ericsson has already committed the capital to supply the hardware and capacity. It will probably be a year until meaningful sales are generated from this partnership.Consensus estimates call for Limelight to generate 42% compound annual earnings growth over the next three years. In the meantime, the stock is trading at just 20x expected 2019 earnings of $0.21 a share, which is a discount to the industry median of 26x. Similarly, the company has an enterprise value of 2x expected 2019 revenue of $222 million, compared with the industry median of 3.3x.Limelight shares had run up 28% in the two months before the latest earnings report, so some give-back was to be expected if management ended its seven-quarter streak of exceeding profit expectations. That said, the company remains on track to deliver significant growth in 2019 and beyond and certainly has room to grow into a higher price multiple."
3011236,20875,2015-03-18T14:29:49-04:00,,"DDoS and other cyber attacks are clearly on the rise. According to Akamai’s (NASDAQ:AKAM) recent State of the Internet Report, between 2013 and 2014, DDoS attacks rose 90%. And not only are the number of attacks rising, but the volume of those attacks is growing as well. Numbers from Radware’s 2014-2015 Global Application and Network Security Report, stated that 29% of attacks are over 1Gbps in size. It’s probably safe to say that attack volumes and frequency will only continue to increase, especially as companies continue to rely on the Internet to conduct their business.Many organizations already recognize the need for security. According to recent research by Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW), only 8% of surveyed executives indicated that they weren’t using some sort of security for the delivery of their digital content. What’s more, 76% indicated that the delivery of digital content is “extremely important” to their business.So what are organizations doing today to mitigate potential attacks that might interfere with their ability to deliver digital content? For many, it’s on-premise equipment (CPE). Of those surveyed in Limelight’s research, 31% are handling the security themselves. Others are employing a hybrid approach, using some CPE combined with cloud-based services. But there are a variety of problems with both of these approaches (pure CPE and CPE plus cloud). First, using any kind of CPE has both CAPEX and OPEX requirements. You not only need to purchase the hardware (redundantly, of course) but you need people to manage, update, upgrade, and operate it. Second, you need excess bandwidth (transit) to support an attack while also handling “good” traffic. Finally, combining CPE with cloud services adds significant complexity to your content delivery architecture.What’s the alternative? CDN-based security. More than half (53%) of respondents in Limelight’s research plan to rely on their CDN provider to handle content delivery security concerns in the future. And for many customers, it makes total sense for several reasons:Last week, Limelight announced its CDN-based security offering—DDoS Attack Interceptor. This solution, integrated directly with the Limelight’s content delivery services, provides proactive detection with mitigation technology in the cloud protecting customers against the downtime, loss of business and brand reputation impact associated with DDoS attacks. The solution is virtually transparent to customers and from a high-level, works the following way:Limelight’s detection system constantly monitors for malicious traffic. However, since this monitoring is not happening in-line, Limelight claims it has no performance impact on a customer’s traffic. The detection covers the broadest range of DDoS attacks—both infrastructure as well as application layer attacks. According to Limelight, their solution can prevent certain zero day attacks using “behavior-based” techniques that compare measured baselines of both volume and patterns to more intelligently differentiate good traffic from bad.It’s clear from the research that not only will DDoS attacks continue to rise (both in scope and scale) but that executives are worried about how to mitigate them. When the results can be loss of revenue, everyone starts to pay attention. And because the CDN as a cloud-based security solution provides a number of benefits over CPE or hybrid architectures, it’s no wonder that the major CDNs (Level 3 and EdgeCast by Verizon were the most recent before Limelight) have all added the service to their portfolios. It good to see Limelight moving up the stack with their product portfolio and offering more value-added-services, like security, to help them diversify their revenue away from purely storage and bit delivery. As DDoS and other attacks continue to grow in size and sophistication it will be interesting to see how these services evolve in an otherwise crowded security market with many different approaches and solutions to the DDoS problem.Disclosure: None"
2489235,54222,2014-09-11T18:12:32-04:00,"Netflix is moving to its own content delivery network, but this shouldn't be an issue for Limelight Networks in the long run.Limelight has taken steps to diversify its customer base and reduce churn, which should help it improve going forward.Limelight has robust fundamentals and this is another reason why the company looks like a good bet.","The last three months have been tough for Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW). The content delivery network services provider has been beaten down badly in the last three months as it became increasingly clear that its client Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is moving to its own content delivery platform. As a result, even though Limelight reported solid second quarter results and raised its outlook for the current year, its shares fell.Looking Beyond NetflixHowever, Netflix is just one of several Limelight customers, and it accounted for 13% of revenue last quarter. The company has been aggressively diversifying its customer base in order to mitigate the expected loss of Netflix, which has been building its own platform for two years now, and this reflects in Limelight's full-year forecast.In addition, Limelight is seeing good growth in its profitability. In the second quarter, it reported a non-GAAP net loss of $3.6 million, down from the non-GAAP net loss of $7.2 million in the prior-year period. In addition, the company reported adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 million for the second quarter, as compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $0.5 million in the year-ago quarter.Hence, even though its revenue from Netflix has been dwindling in recent times, Limelight has improved its performance. As such, although Netflix might cease to become a customer going forward, investors should not panic as Limelight has prepared itself well for this contingency.A diversified customer base will help mattersLimelight Networks is undertaking efforts to focus on account management and accelerate share gains at primary accounts. The company plans to do this by delivering enhanced feature functionality for its core products, and minimizing customer churn and employee turnover.Driven by such moves, Limelight is seeing an increase in customer satisfaction at a fast rate. Although the employee turnover is still high, it is showing signs of improvement on a year-over-year basis. Simultaneously, management is making calculated investments to improve its processes and infrastructure.Moreover, Limelight has built up a diversified portfolio of customers. On a year-over-year basis, revenue from Limelight's top-100 customers expanded by 9% last quarter, along with growth from new customers, which exceeded its expectations. In addition, Limelight management is keen on measuring customer satisfaction, and has just concluded its third global survey of its customer base. Also, the company is witnessing a rise in the Net Promoter Score, which indicates the loyalty of Limelight's customer relationships.This shows up by way of a significant reduction in the customer churn rate. According to management, ""Our net customer churn was 22 in the second quarter, an improvement from last quarter's net churn of 37 net of Clickability and last year's Q2 net churn of 48."" Hence, Limelight's strategies are paying off, and losing Netflix shouldn't hurt the business much in the long run. The company is witnessing a sequential increase in customers using its core CDN services. Additionally, the win rate is getting better and the contract value of its wins is greater than last year.New contracts will drive growthThe company has won a number of contracts that will lead to an improvement in its performance in the future. For instance, Limelight won a contract from a key global electronics manufacturer based in South Korea. The customer opted for its dynamic web acceleration service and the content delivery service to enable the distribution of software to mobile devices in order to make software updates cheaper and manageable.Also, Limelight's content delivery service was selected by an important U.S. sports and entertainment solution provider for broadcasting both live and on-demand content and delivering a superior digital experience to fans around the world. Recently, the video and content delivery service of Limelight was selected by a European video games retail company to allow distribution of all its video trailers to customers worldwide.Now, the company's focus on improving its services should help it land more customer wins going forward. Limelight is investing in its infrastructure capabilities. The company is optimizing its process flows along with the improvement of its analytics and reporting capabilities to deliver a better experience to its customers.In addition, Limelight recently announced its Orchestrate solution for media and broadcast customers. The company is of the opinion that this solution will allow broadcasters and media content owners to offer broadcast-quality video to online audiences in a convenient and fast manner. Moreover, the solution aims at enhancing the scalability, performance and protection to prospective customers.ConclusionLimelight is doing well already, and it should continue doing well even without Netflix. The fact that the company has a strong balance sheet should give it the confidence to continue investing in its growth efforts. Limelight has just half a million dollars in debt, while its cash position stands strong at $107 million. In addition, it has a very impressive current ratio of 5.41, indicating robust liquidity. Finally, the long-term projections also look impressive as Limelight's bottom line is expected to grow at a pace of 12% a year over a five-year period.Thus, investors should ignore the noise around the Netflix loss and focus on Limelight's long-term credentials."
2332805,24317,2014-07-24T08:37:59-04:00,"Limelight's content delivery network is losing customers to the tough competition.Evidence suggests Limelight's competitors offer better CDNs that are constantly improving.Management has made many bad decisions and lacks infrastructure experience.The losses and cash burn will continue for Limelight in the coming years, until it must raise cash or sell its assets for cheap.","Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW) is a content delivery network (CDN) that has been consistently delivering below average performance for customers. With a poor management team, all evidence points to a continual loss of market share to its competent competitors. In 2012, Limelight was the #2 revenue-generating CDN after Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM). Last year, Level 3 (NASDAQ:LVLT) surpassed Limelight as the #2 CDN. Right now, Limelight is ranked #4, and will likely be #5 by the end of the year after Akamai, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Level 3, and EdgeCast/Verizon. Today, there is no reason for new customers to choose Limelight over those other four top-notch CDN performers.The mechanics of a CDN operator is it gets paid by content providers such as media companies and e-commerce vendors for delivering their content to their audience of end-users. CDN technology has advanced to the point that it's a standard, commoditized service.To learn more about the CDN industry, I interviewed expert Dan Rayburn last week. He is one of the industry's top analysts and doesn't invest in stocks, so is non-biased in evaluating the publicly traded CDN operators. Before he became an analyst, he co-founded one of the industry's first streaming media webcasting production companies, Live On Line, and sold it to Digital Island for $70 million.Regarding CDN performance, he said:Regarding Limelight, he said:There is a lot of excellent, updated info on the industry from the 2014 Content Delivery Summit Pricing Presentation by Mr. Rayburn. It's based on a survey done in March-April 2014 of more than 700 customers who use CDN for video delivery. From the presentation:The above slide shows there are 32 big CDN spenders in the US of over $1M per year in both 2014 and 2012. The biggest change since 2012 is Limelight has lost most of its biggest customers, while Amazon has aggressively gained them. Limelight went from 12 large customers in 2012 to 2 large customers in 2014, while Amazon, new to the game, went from 1 to 15 large customers in that time period.Also note that both of Limelight's large customers are multi-vendor. This means that the customer uses Limelight and at least one other CDN provider, and can interchange them at will, depending on which gives a better service at the time.In my discussions with several experts in the CDN industry, the following are my estimated 2014 CDN revenue numbers from the five biggest players:Many of the above companies don't reveal their CDN numbers, so most of these are estimates. Except Level 3 said it expects $200M in CDN revenue for 2014. Akamai's media and entertainment revenue for 2014 is expected to be $800M. Its CDN revenue is most of that, so I believe $700M is a good estimate.Amazon has grown rapidly because it has one of the fastest, best-performing CDNs. From conversations with insiders, it's likely that it's the #2 revenue-generating CDN.Limelight's CDN is about 75% of its revenues, so if it generates $156M in revenues in 2014, which is the consensus estimate, then its CDN revenues will be about $120M.As content delivery is a commoditized service, the overall pricing doesn't vary much among the different CDNs. The reason why Limelight has been losing customers is because of poor performance, not pricing.Over the past several years, there has been constant CDN price erosion. This will continue in the coming years. Also from the report, on page 5, it says:This price decline will further decrease the gross margins for CDN companies. As Limelight already operates at a loss and will continue to lose CDN traffic, its earnings and revenues will be further hurt by this price erosion.Limelight Lost Customers Because Of Inferior PerformanceLimelight's decline began in 2009, when it started its strategy of diversifying its revenue away from pure CDN services and more towards cloud-based services. Because of this divergence of focus on its CDN, it completely stopped investing in its CDN. Performance tanked, and customers noticed this and left. Limelight never recovered from falling behind, and this explains the massive loss of customers between 2012 and 2014.Limelight acquired EyeWonder in 2009 for $110M to get involved in advertising. Then, when it realized that advertising doesn't fit with its core business, it sold it for $66M in 2011. It acquired Clickability, a web content management system, in May 2011. Then decided that didn't work out either, so sold it in December 2013.Limelight has realized its mistakes, and has now decided to reinvest in its CDN, in order to try to be competitive. But it is too late. Limelight will likely never be able to compete with the other top four CDNs, because it is lacking technological expertise and is at a smaller scale.Regarding Limelight, Dan Rayburn said:I agree with Dan Rayburn's assessment on Limelight's management that they don't have experience with infrastructure. For example, Limelight's CEO, Bob Lento, was brought in by Goldman Sachs at the end of 2012 as an interim CEO to try and sell the company. He wasn't able to sell Limelight, so he stayed on as CEO, even though he doesn't have infrastructure experience. Prior to joining Limelight, he spent 14 years as a senior sales executive.Earlier this year, Joe Depalo got promoted to VP of network and infrastructure. His previous job with Limelight was operations, a much different job than technically improving infrastructure.In March, 2014, Sajid Malhotra was hired as senior VP of Corporate Strategy and investor relations. Mr. Malhotra has no experience whatsoever with CDNs.Limelight Will Likely Continue Burning Cash In The Years AheadIn the Q1'14 earnings call, the company said ""we're making substantial investments in improving our processes and infrastructure."" The company guided $19.5m on capex for 2014. It also needs to fix sales team churn by providing more aggressive incentives. Expect this to lead to higher cost.High operating loss: Year after year, Limelight is burning cash with its negative operating margin. The following is from the past three years from Yahoo Finance:Limelight's gross and operating margins are the worst out of its CDN US peers. The following financial numbers are from 2013:As Limelight stays stagnant and/or loses revenues, it will continue to burn cash year after year, until its cash pile dwindles down to the point where it needs to either raise more cash or fire sale its assets.In April, Limelight announced a partnership with NeuLion, a digital video broadcasting company. It said in the PR that NeuLion partnered with Limelight because it thought its CDN performs well. However, I have a source close to the matter have told me that's not the truth. They said the reason why the two firms partnered was because Limelight helped NeuLion get a new customer. I can't provide evidence to prove this, but from my source, I believe it's true.Limelight Is UnacquireableOn June 10th, Roth increased its price target for LLNW to $4.50 from $3, saying since it won a court case and so didn't infringe on Akamai's patents, now ""the firm thinks the win could cause some investors to see an acquisition of Limelight as more likely.""But there is no one who would want to acquire Limelight. It is at the point of no return. Akamai acquired Contendo in December, 2011, one of its biggest CDN competitors at the time, for $268M. Contendo was a threat to Akamai's dominance.Verizon recently acquired CDN company EdgeCast, another stellar performer. EdgeCast is a better-managed CDN provider than LLNW, generated $100M in revenues per year, and was profitable. Verizon took it out in 12/2013 for $350M.But Limelight is a declining, stale CDN. That doesn't make for an appealing takeout target, unless it's for a very cheap price, which LLNW isn't priced at now with a $280M market cap.Many big-volume CDN users are building their own CDN in-house. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) used to be 40% of LLNW's traffic. Now NFLX is building its own CDN. It's currently 20% of LLNW's traffic, and LLNW said in its last earnings call that NFLX will leave LLNW in the middle of this year. This is a significant revenue decrease, and LLNW expects zero revenue from NFLX by Q4 of this year.With telcos or large cable companies, having their own CDN is a natural fit. When a company has a lot of content, it is better off creating its own CDN. That way, it can use it for itself and save money from paying another CDN operator, and can also sell the service to customers on the side. Comcast launched its commercial CDN service in May 2014.Limelight's Recent Rally Is UnmeritedThe following is a one-year chart for LLNW's share price:As shown in the above chart, LLNW has traded around $2 for most of the past year. Only recently, around the beginning of June, did LLNW shoot up to close to $3, for around a 40% gain. This gain isn't merited, because the fundamentals for LLNW haven't changed. There are two reasons for this jump. First, LLNW successfully defended a lawsuit from Akamai accusing LLNW of violating its patents. Second, LLNW recently hired a new executive, Sajid Malhotra, who purchased 250,000 shares of LLNW in late May and early June on the open market at above $2.00 per share.LLNW's position in the CDN industry has not improved. First, Mr. Malhotra was hired as a senior VP of Strategy, Corporate Development, and Investor Relations in March 2014. But Mr. Malhotra wasn't very familiar with the industry when he got hired. Naively, he purchased 250,000 LLNW shares at above $2.00. Notice that the other executives didn't buy many shares, most didn't buy any. Those that know the business well would stay away.Secondly, winning the Akamai lawsuit was a one-time event. Limelight might have prevented itself from losing a lot of money, about $43M, but it didn't gain any money from winning it.Despite these two occurrences, Limelight is still losing market share. So it's likely the stock will drift back down to $2 per share, where it was trading in May, once it's realized that the company is in terminal decline.Another event that might have fueled some speculation was a fake bid of $645M for Limelight. But this bid is false and should be ignored, as even Limelight itself said:ConclusionThe 2005 documentary ""Walmart, The High Cost Of Low Prices"" features small shops getting run out of business by Wal-Mart. This harsh reality is now happening to Limelight. Since CDN is a commoditized business, when you fall behind, it's tough to get back up, because it's safer for customers to go with the established, bigger players. Being the #5 CDN in revenues, things will likely continue getting worse for Limelight, unless it can somehow turn things around, which is unlikely, for the reasons stated in this article.Amazon can be thought of as a ""Wal-Mart"" in the CDN industry. It has been beating the competition through price cuts and having a fast, reliable CDN at the same time. After only launching its CDN in 2008, it swiftly brought itself to become the #2 revenue-generating CDN.I'd recommend shorting LLNW down to $1.50 per share, not much lower than where it was trading in May. Once it gets to that price, it will go lower, as it's in terminal decline, but it will take a couple years, since the company has a lot of cash.Disclosure: The author is short LLNW.

3268545,27671,2015-06-19T15:44:47-04:00,Company has recently been beating and raising quarterly guidance.Executives have bought the strength in their shares.Positive industry and fundamental trends back further gains for LLNW.,"We bought into shares of Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW) in late April, just before the company its Q1 earnings. Doing so risked entering the purgatory reserved for those who purchase stocks just before earnings releases. But given the bullish insider activity and the guidance-beating trends in its Q4 financial results, we decided it was a risk worth taking.That risk was certainly rewarded. Limelight once again beat expectations in its Q1, and raised forward-looking guidance. The stock now has the look of one that has broken out on high volume into a new uptrend. That technical trend also appears to us to be fundamentally justified-and have legs.Limelight Networks helps companies that deliver massive quantities of digital content, to securely manage and deliver it globally and on any device. The increased volume of streaming video and live events, interactive gaming, and cloud-based everything only make Limelight's services more necessary. Limelight has larger competition in its industry, however, including Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) and Level 3 Communications (NASDAQ:LVLT).After presciently buying their stock last summer and fall, seven insiders bought over $1.2 million worth of LLNW last March at an average price of $3.44 a share. Yes, we know that insiders were buying in via an incentive program that also garners them restricted shares equal to 20% of their purchase amount. But the size of the buying cluster indicated that executives are obviously bullish, and not just cheerleading on the cheap.Six of the buyers increased their direct holdings by 8% or more. One buyer bumped his stake up by over 20%. A small cap tech stock like Limelight's could have easily gapped down by more than 20% if Q1 had missed badly. The unanimity and size of the buying told us that-even though incentivized-insiders' bullishness was real.It also turned out to be well founded. Limelight posted Q1 sales of $42.3 million and a non-GAAP loss of 2 cents per share. Both metrics beat consensus expectations, which were already raised after Q4 results also beat when released back on February 2nd.The company also continued its ""beat-and-raise"" cadence. The bottom end of 2015 revenue guidance was increased by $8 million, to $164 million. That was the top end of the range management guided for just three months ago. The high end revenue guidance now is $17 0 million. For Q2, revenue is expected to be slightly down sequentially, at between $40 and $42 million. But that guidance was still above current estimates.Limelight's gross margins improved nearly 2% from last year, and headwinds from the strong dollar were relatively minor to the bottom line. This helped management increase non-GAAP net loss expectations for 2015, to be between $0.08 and $0.18 per share. That's up from the $0.10 and $0.20 loss per share guided for after Q4.This fifth sequential increase in guidance puts paid to concerns after Limelight lost its large Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) business last year-if Q4 hadn't already. Non-Netflix sales were estimated to be up 19% year-over-year, and the company now needs to spend money to build out its infrastructure to accommodate its growing business.That's not an issue for Limelight, with its strong balance sheet containing $81 million in cash (equal to $0.82 per share). Management estimates CapEx for the year of between $22 and $26 million, with the spending weighted more in the first half. That explained the relatively large (but expected) $12 million cash usage in Q1.Management gave some color on its business during its Q1 conference call. CEO Bob Lento relayed that ""customer churn was lower, employee turnover was lower,"" and ""customer satisfaction is higher"" as measured by an semi-annual, independent customer study. Limelight also recorded ""a record breaking traffic day, month, and quarter"" during Q1.CFO Pete Perrone confirmed that Limelight is ""seeing improving trends in the industry and in our business"". He also explained that the company's ""top-20 customers accounted for approximately 56% of total revenue in the first quarter, and the average revenue of these customers continues to grow at a healthy double-digit rate-a faster rate than the corporate average."" The bottom quartile of companies, on the other hand, ""represent less than 2% of our total revenue this quarter.""So the important bigger customers are growing well. That's good news for Limelight as long as it keeps these important revenue sources satisfied. But the Netflix experience reminds us all of the risk of being too reliant on a major customer.Limelight's customer base is thankfully more diverse now than a year ago. Even more positive is the trend towards ever increasing consumption of digital content on smart phones, tablets, computers and gaming consoles."
1631532,23762,2013-08-13T11:02:23-04:00,,"Thursday I picked up a new position in a small content delivery network provider called Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW) for less than $2 a share. The company has fallen on hard times and the stock has come down from over $8 a share less than two and a half years ago.This technology firm recently brought in a new CEO and is making changes to its business model that should bear fruit down the road. These changes could also provide the catalyst for the stock to move much higher over time. As importantly, its current market capitalization is less than the value of its network infrastructure and net cash on the balance sheet. It is exactly the type of low risk/high reward play I like to find before I invest in a turnaround story.Company Overview:Limelight Networks offers content delivery services to deliver media files, such as video, music, games, software and related services in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific. It competes with industry giants Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM), Level 3 Communications (NASDAQ:LVLT) and a variety of other smaller content delivery platforms.Company History:Limelight has seen impressive traffic and revenue growth throughout its history since coming public in 2007.This traffic growth is primarily being driven by exploding use of video delivered via the internet as it requires exponentially more bandwidth than other data.Turnaround Effort:Unfortunately despite growing revenues substantially over its history, the company has been unable to translate this sales growth into consistent earnings. In order to reverse this profitless growth, the company has brought in a new CEO to effect a turnaround.The company has three major problems. Its main line of business (content delivery) is a cutthroat business with low margins despite the huge growth of demand. Second, its network does not offer the same delivery performance as its larger competitors. Finally, it has numerous customers that are just unprofitable but it has retained them anyway.The new CEO is addressing all of these core problems. Limelight added 2 terabits per second of incremental capacity last quarter that is now available for consumption by new and existing customers. This in itself is more overall capacity than all but two of the commercial CDN carriers that Limelight competes against have in their entire networks. This should also provide meaningful performance improvements throughout the company's network.Second, the company dropped several customers last quarter that were simply unprofitable to keep. This will result in some temporary revenue loss but will increase profit margins over time. Finally, the company continues to increase the amount of revenue it gets from higher margin value added services such as its video and online content management tools. As of the close of the second quarter, these revenues now stand at 36% of overall sales.Net Asset Value Backstop:Whether turnarounds will ultimately be successful are always difficult to determine early on in the transformation effort. Fortunately, Limelight offers a great backstop should the effort fail to gain traction. The company has $119mm in net cash currently on the balance sheet. This represents ~60% of the company's overall market capitalization. The company is currently eating through around $1mm in cash per quarter even with the planned temporary sale declines.The remaining ~$80mm in market capitalization is less than what the company's infrastructure, revenues and existing customer relations are worth to a competitor. Currently at its current stock price, a competitor like Akamai or Level 3 could acquire Limelight's network with 9 terabit per second of capacity, ~$180mm in annual revenues, online/video content management software products and existing customers for roughly $80mm after accounting for cash.Three Scenarios:This leads to me to conclude there are three possible scenarios ahead for Limelight. First, the turnaround could be successful and lead to profitable growth. In this scenario, the stock should have considerable upside.If the turnaround does not ultimately bear fruit, Limelight would make a very attractive acquisition target. A larger competitor could eliminate a competitor, reduce pricing pressure, pick up almost $200mm in annual sales as well as some nice software products on the cheap even with a substantial premium.The last scenario is one where the company continues to muddle along and does not attract the attention of a larger player in the space. In this case, given the company's assets; the stock should have a nice floor right here around $2 a share. Limelight could also decide in this scenario the best use of its cash is to buy back stock and/or issue a quarterly dividend to reward shareholders which should boost its equity price.Summary:Limelight Networks is an example of just the type of out of favor value stock I like to invest in. It has some catalysts that could substantially boost the company's value over time. In addition, it has a significant net tax loss carry forward that could prove to be very valuable should Limelight become profitable. The company also is selling at less than what its net cash and underlying assets are worth which puts a nice floor under the stock. It is exactly the type of low risk/high reward small capitalization stock I like to ferret out and invest in accordingly. BUY.Disclosure: I am long LLNW.

2252903,23762,2014-06-04T15:13:12-04:00,"Limelight Networks has been in the news this week, as it won a patent infringement case in the Supreme Court via a 9-0 decision.The stock has some momentum that could continue for a while, as the shares are still down by two-thirds from highs made in 2011.In addition, insiders are buying shares, and the company has a fortress balance sheet and could make a logical buyout candidate.","Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW) has been in the news this week, as the company won a 9-0 decision in a patent litigation lawsuit initiated by the giant in the content delivery space, Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM). This ruling overturned a guilty verdict against Limelight from a federal appeals court. Other tech companies also breathe a sigh of relief, as an Akamai victory could have opened the door to a large number of frivolous lawsuits from litigants claiming induced infringement.Not only was it nice to see David win one against Goliath for a change, but one does not see too many 9-0 decisions coming out of a divided Supreme Court these days. The last time I penned anything about this small cap tech play in January, the stock was trading at $2 a share. This recent court decision has helped push the shares up to $2.50 a share, but the company still looks like it has some positive catalysts and its recent momentum could last awhile.An insider must have felt good about the impact of the court case, as an officer bought some $115,000 in new shares on June 2nd. This follows two other insiders buying approximately $275,000 worth of new stock in May. Insiders own over 10% of outstanding shares.Another huge plus for Limelight is that it has a fortress balance sheet, with over $110mm in net cash, which is approximately 50% of its market capitalization. To put it in perspective, Akamai could have bought Limelight for under $150mm at its current price level, ridding itself of a competitor and picking up more than $150mm in annual revenues. Given Akamai sells at nearly six times trailing revenues, this seems a better option than a legal attack, in my humble opinion.The company is challenged by the loss of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) as a client, as it is building its own content delivery system, and still accounts for ~12% of Limelight's revenues. The company is in the midst of a migration to higher-margin services, and is doing extensive customer surveys to increase retention. Despite this, the company is still posting small quarterly losses.On the bright side, the company is cash flow-positive on an operational cash flow basis, and has bought back over $25mm in stock over the past two fiscal years. It certainly has the firepower to boost stock buybacks or initiate a substantial dividend. Given the company is still not profitable on an earnings basis, this is a speculative play. The stock did trade over $7 a share as recently as 2011, and I will continue to hold a small position on the basis of possible buyout or turnaround, knowing its huge cash balance should provide a nice mitigation of downside.

1915361,20875,2013-12-24T14:30:15-05:00,,"Over two years ago Limelight Networks acquired Clickability, a SaaS provider offering a web content management platform targeting media publishers. The purchase by Limelight was an effort to try to diversify their revenue away from pure CDN services and get more revenue from cloud based services. But the web content management business is a tough one, with long sales cycles and a huge amount of customization required. When Limelight bought the business it was on a run rate of $10M for 2010, but two and half years later, Limelight disclosed in yesterday’s 8-K filing that it is only “estimated to be approximately $12.7M” in revenue for this year.Deciding it was no longer a business they wanted to be in, Limelight announced they have sold the business to Upland Software. Limelight says approximately 30 employees will transfer to Upland Software with the transaction, although financial terms of the deal were not announced. Limelight’s value-added services, which included the web content management business, were down sequentially in two of the last three quarters, so this lost revenue from selling the business, while small, is still more revenue Limelight is going to need to make up. The company wants to re-focus their efforts on the CDN business, but so far, hasn’t laid out any kind of strategy of how they plan to do that. Focusing primarily on CDN services is a tough one as the margins on delivering content is slim, especially when it comes to video and software downloads. Limelight is currently re-investing and spending money to improve the performance and scale of their network, but others like Level 3 have already surpassed them in total CDN revenue for the year.Limelight has always had a large base of CDN customers and revenue, but it’s never been able to grow it by much over the past two years. In Q1 and Q2 of this year, revenue from their CDN business had about a 10% quarter-over-quarter decline as they have continued to fall behind their peers in growing their CDN business. Last quarter, their CDN revenue did grow by 5% quarter over quarter, but we need to see if Limelight can grow that business steadily, over multiple quarters in a row. The company also needs to re-enter the market with some kind of message to CDN customers as to why they still matter in the market and why customers should think of them for CDN services. The more RFPs I see the market for large-scale CDN services, the more I see Limelight being excluded or simply written off by customers who know they offer CDN services, but don’t really think of them anymore as one of the top two vendors in the market to go to. If Limelight wants to change that, they need to re-enter the market with a new message and updated story and it can’t be just another re-branding of their services, like they seem to do every year.The company really needs to stop spending so much time and effort focusing on their “digital presence” messaging and coming up with really long names for products and instead, focus on messaging directly to customers looking for large-scale delivery of video, small objects and software downloads. If they want to re-focus their business on CDN services, like they have talked to Wall Street about, they have to start bringing that message and awareness directly to customers. The company needs to deliver a simple and effective message as to why customers (especially new ones) should think of them for CDN services, how they stand out amongst the competition and what it means for customers when Limelight says they want to “refocus” their efforts on CDN services.Disclosure: None."
2269073,20875,2014-06-15T02:26:08-04:00,,"The Phoenix Business Journal is reporting that on Friday, private equity company Tuition Build Inc. submitted a $645M bid to acquire CDN provider Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW) in an effort to take the company private. With Limelight’s stock closing at $2.83 a share on Friday, Tuition Build’s offer values each share of Limelight at just over $6.50, which is a nice premium considering that Limelight has yet to turn a profit over the past thirteen years.With Goldman Sachs still holding about 30M shares the last time I checked, they have a lot of veto power in accepting or rejecting such an offer and historically, have rejected many acquisition offers by other CDNs. Over the years Limelight had more than half a dozen legitimate offers to sell the company, including two offers from Level 3, at least two from Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) and one from AT&T (NYSE:T), for more than $12 a share, that I am aware of. Hopefully Goldman doesn’t make the same mistake this time around and gets a deal done so Limelight can get help in growing their business and making it profitable.Disclaimer: I have never bought, sold or traded a single share of stock in any public company ever."
2350725,20875,2014-07-29T03:31:22-04:00,,"About two weeks ago, on Thursday July 17th, Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW) suffered a major outage of their network that for some, measured 76 minutes of downtime. I got multiple calls from customers about the outage and Cedexis, a company that provides performance measurements from the standpoint of end users around the world, discussed the details of the outage on their blog. While they didn’t name the CDN, it was Limelight Networks, and the outage was so widespread that Cedexis said, “Little to no traffic was being passed at this time from this CDN. If this were a storm in the Atlantic it would get a name.” For a breakdown on the outage, visit the Cedexis blog post.It’s a shame that Limelight had such a major outage, considering they are once again trying to get customers to think of them when it comes to being a reliable CDN with good performance. However the bigger point is not that CDNs have downtime but rather that when it comes to customers measuring performance amongst CDNs, it is crucial that they use a third-party service that takes real user measurements (RUM). On the day of the outage, Cedexis collected more than 2 billion measurements across 40,000 networks and 100 cloud and CDN providers worldwide. This type of measurement data is crucial for content owners, especially the large ones, who use a multi-CDN strategy and want to load balance amongst CDNs based on real performance data, from actual end users.Cedexis has a platform that many content owners now use, called Cedexis Openmix, that allows them to improve the availability, latency and throughput of their content, website and mobile apps. It allows them to dynamically ingest this real user measurement data as a way to allow content owners to load balance across multiple CDNs and avoid outages. In addition to content owners, all of the CDNs now use Cedexis to compare their performance against their competitors and some even use Cedexis performance data in their service level agreements (SLA) with customers. While Cedexis may not be known by many outside of the infrastructure market, the company is quickly becoming part of the fabric of the CDN ecosystem and I would argue, the most important piece. If you can’t measure your performance, for any service, then you don’t really know what you are paying for and what you are getting in return.More and more customers I talk to, especially the larger ones that CDNs would define as enterprise, are now using Cedexis. Founded in 2009 by two Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) veterans, Cedexis is really starting to gain traction in the market and while they aren’t as big as Gomez, Catchpoint or Keynote, they are much more focused and have much better insight into what’s really taking place on the Internet. Gomez, Catchpoint and Keynote aren’t inside the last mile networks, don’t have buy in from cloud, backbone and infrastructure providers and take only a small number of real user measurements per day. They can’t truly compare network performance amongst CDN and cloud providers and Cedexis providers far superior data and analytics to what others offer.If I had to make a list of the top five hottest companies right now, Cedexis would be at the top of the list. Not only because of what they are doing, and how important it is to the market, but also because they share so much of the data – for free. You can look at the results of a few of their measurements taken over the last 24 hour period here and more data is available within their free benchmarking community, which you can sign up for on this page. It’s only a matter of time before someone in the market acquires them and makes their data and methodology part of a larger platform of web performance monitoring.Cedexis did a recent presentation at the Content Delivery Summit in May and has a really good slide deck you can download, with lots of details on how they measure, what they measure and their methodology. You can also see a video of that presentation below."
1464621,20875,2013-05-28T12:38:10-04:00,,"Last week I hosted my annual Content Delivery Summit in NYC, which brought together telecom carriers, service providers, content owners, and Wall Street money managers for a detailed look at the content delivery market. Multiple attendees from Wall Street were there talking about how Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW) is in talks to try and sell the company to Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and is desperate to make a deal.While it does not sound like any kind of agreement has been reached, such a deal would make a lot of sense for both companies as Verizon has been trying to get their VDMS business going for a few years now, without a lot of success. They are currently doing another major push right now to jump start the business and acquiring Limelight would give them customers, network resources, and the sales and product support they need. Verizon should be a lot further along with their digital media business than they are right now, and they really need to do a few acquisitions to get there. If they do, there is no reason why they can’t be a real competitor in the market, but I don’t think they can get there on their own simply by building everything in-house for their commercial CDN offering.I haven’t heard any kind of numbers mentioned of what Limelight would be worth, but their CDN business isn’t in the greatest of shape right now. Multiple customers at the show were talking about poor performance of Limelight’s network for video, and in the last few weeks, Limelight lost more experienced sales people along with other employees. The company stated on their last earnings call that they plan to reinvest in the CDN business and add more capacity, but that it would be toward the end of the year before that is in place.With Verizon having a new streaming service with Redbox, Verizon needs a better CDN for video delivery ASAP. Acquiring Limelight would give them the foundation for that and something they could build on top of. On paper, the deal makes a lot of sense, but one has to wonder what Limelight's board, and shareholders, want for the company and if they still think it's worth more than it really is. With Limelight having all new management, hopefully they are realistic on the value of the company as Limelight's previous management always thought the company was worth more than it really was, which ended up keeping them out of some potential deals.In addition to hearing about Limelight and Verizon, one person told me that XO Communications is also in discussions with Limelight. The two companies already work together and last year, XO Communications launched CDN Services using Limelight's managed CDN platform, via Concentric Cloud Solutions, a new division of XO Communications that focuses on content caching, application acceleration, and video streaming. So it's possible that XO now wants to have more control over their CDN and bring Limelight into the fold. For Limelight, this would also make sense from an acquisition standpoint, as XO has more than 60,000 small and medium-sized customers spread out across North America alone.It's too early to know how this is going to play out, but Limelight Networks is clearly shopping the company, once again, trying to get an acquisition done. Some will ask me how such a deal might impact Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM), but I'm not even going to speculate on that unless we hear a deal gets done.Disclosure: None."
1576332,39791,2013-07-26T13:26:52-04:00,,"Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW) is small Content Distribution Network (CDN) provider that was founded in 2001. The company operates in the specialized field of CDN which allows a media property to be loaded up faster and provides greater reliability than normal websites on the Internet. The company is a small fry in comparison to top CDN providers such as Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM) and Level 3 Communications (NYSEARCA:LVL). The company has not achieved a critical mass and has shown losses in the last 5 years. The CDN business requires a lot of capex and a global footprint in order to become a viable one. Limelight Network's best bet remains an acquisition by a bigger player such as Verizon (NYSE:VZ) or AT&T (NYSE:T) who might want to add/expand on their CDN offering. The company is majority owned by Goldman Sachs who would want to exit this investment. The company's stock performance has reflected its fundamentals with the stock price falling by more than 80% since its IPO during 2007. Limelight Network's investment case remains mostly as a special situation acquisition target by a bigger company looking to value add CDN offering to its product portfolio.Limelight Networks Positives1. Acquisition Target - This remains the principal reason to buy Limelight Networks as I don't think that the company will become very profitable in the near future. Verizon, AT&T and other telecom companies have been rumored in the past as potential buyers of LLNW. The stock has seen occasional spurts due to these rumors before continuing its downtrend.2. Lots of cash on the Balance Sheet means there is no Liquidity pressure - Limelight Networks is debt free, with $128 million in cash on its balance sheet ending 2012. The cash burn is not too high and the company can continue to run for some more years without facing any liquidity pressures. This is important for small growing companies which often run out of cash before their business model starts to generate sustainable profits.3. Valued added services increase to 35% of Q113 Revenues - Limelight Networks is trying to shift from being a commodity CDN supplier to a digital presence management service provider. The company's video management product ""Orchestrate"" is getting good traction and its value added services contributed to 35% of it Q113 revenues.4. Valuation remains Inexpensive - Limelight Network's valuation is inexpensive with a P/B ratio of 0.9x and P/S ratio of 1.4x. The valuation is somewhat justified given that the company has been a loss making one in the last 3 years and its revenue growth has also been mediocre at 11% pa during this period.5. Stock Repurchases provide a floor on the Stock price - The company has authorized a total of $50 million in stock repurchases and bought almost 2% of its total market float during Q113.Limelight Network Issuesa) Competitors have grown faster and have higher Margins - Limelight Networks has failed to match the growth seen by its principal competitor Akamai Technology. The company has tried to use a low pricing strategy to win customers but loses out on technology and the breadth of product offering.LLNW Revenue Quarterly data by YChartsb) Limelight Network does not possess the scale to become an effective provider - It has become imperative for large companies to have online properties which can effectively deliver content to users globally in a rapid manner. A CDN supplier needs to have a global dedicated infrastructure to be able to deliver its services on a timely manner. LLNW has been losing money as it has not reached the critical revenue base to become a successfully profitable organization. The pricing pressures on LLNW are also more than Akamai and its overall revenues fell slightly in Q113 due to the falling ASPs. Its margins are much lower than Akamai.LLNW Operating Margin TTM data by YChartsc) Financials remain unflattering - Limelight Networks has seen flat revenues in the last 3 years with annual sales of around $180 million. The company has managed to breakeven on an EBITDA basis though it continues to show overall negative net income.Stock Price PerformanceThe company has failed to live to its high expectations and its stock price has declined by more than 80% from its initial IPO price. The company is trading near its all time lows with the current stock price of $2.48. I think the expectations are quite low from this stock as it has not delivered on the growth expectations and the acquisition rumors have also never turned out to be true.LLNW Total Return Price data by YChartsSummaryLimelight Networks is trading at low valuations as the sentiment towards the stock remains poor. The company has lots of cash on its balance sheet and is also purchasing stock which provides a floor to its already low stock price. Though the company is making losses, its free cash flow remains at the breakeven level. The company is trying hard to move shift from being a pure play CDN supplier to a value added services player, providing video management and storage solutions. I think that Limelight Networks provides an opportunistic buy at the current stock price with a buyout by a bigger player providing asymmetric returns.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

291890,22829,2011-09-06T16:02:35-04:00,,"By Ben KoladaIn a move to streamline its operations, Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW) is  divesting its EyeWonder assets to DG FastChannel. Although the deal  comes at a considerable discount – DG’s $66m all-cash offer is only  slightly more than half the amount that Limelight paid in cash and stock  for EyeWonder less than two years ago – it should help the ailing CDN  vendor focus on its core business. It could even pave the way for a sale  of Limelight.As my colleague Jim Davis notes,  Limelight’s original decision to buy EyeWonder appeared strategically  sound. The idea was that EyeWonder would funnel new customers to the  Limelight CDN. That could have worked, but a missed development target  meant that ad agencies were taking business elsewhere this year. As a  result, revenue for the acquired company essentially flatlined. When  Limelight picked up EyeWonder in December 2009, the target generated  some $35m in trailing sales. The outlook two years later isn’t much  better. New owner DG FastChannel indicated that it expects revenue from  the acquired property to max out at $37m this year.Wall Street appears to back the asset sale. Following the  announcement, shares of Limelight closed the day up nearly 6% on volume  that was almost triple the monthly average. Although the company has  lost half its market value this year, due in large part to flat revenue  growth and third-quarter revenue guidance that came in below analysts’  expectations, an opportunistic acquirer could swoop in to scoop up the  company. Following the slide in share price, Limelight is sporting a  market cap of just $300m. Add in the more than $100m of cash in its  coffers and little debt, and the company could be had for relatively  cheap for an opportunistic buyer."
268422,22148,2011-05-06T13:43:58-04:00,,"Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW) is a leading content delivery network provider sometimes seen as a sexy play on the explosive growth of mobile and connected devices and the move into the cloud. The company recently reported Q1 numbers that showed incredible revenue growth with over 100% growth in mobile internet and tablet computing revenue, online video platform, and site and application acceleration services.   What isn't to like about a tech stock with such growth? One word: margins.   What LLNW doesn't want to point out is that margins are horrible and even though the company had 38% revenue growth, it still lost $.03 on an adjusted basis. A tech company with a $200M revenue base should be profitable already. Competition from Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) and Level 3 (NASDAQ:LVLT) is clearly too tough to turn this revenue growth into earnings.   It's disappointing and clearly investors need to be careful when investing in this company. The CEO claims a plan that brings the company to $400M in revenue and huge profits in a few years. I'm just not so sure that anything will change on the margin front as long as low cost provider LVLT lurks. It is the classic example of competition that constantly undercuts pricing. Why will it be different this time? On top of that, AKAM is very profitable now and has the cash flow to choke off LLNW.The focus on the topline growth of LLNW completely misses some disturbing trends from the Q1 report:  Revenue per share: Revenue was up 38%, but share count was up 22%. The revenue per share went from $.42 to $.478 or only 14% growth. It's one thing to increase shares for earnings growth, it's another to increase shares to pay employees and fund losses.   Q110 shares: 85M Q111 shares: 104M  Revenue per employee: The employee count more then doubled from March 2010. If only the rest of the economy was hiring at this rate. Naturally the revenue per employee dropped dramatically.  Q110 employees: 342 Q111 employees: 708  Q110 Revenue/employee: $111K Q111 Revenue/employee: $70K  Adjusted EBITDA: Since adjusted EBITDA is a big focus on this sector I'll look at this number versus the GAAP or even non-GAAP net loss. Actually I have no problem with using non-GAAP numbers, but I do have problems with the direction.   Surprisingly the adjusted EBITDA number actually declined year over year. How is this possible with 38% revenue growth? Partly it's the huge employee growth, but apparently there are increased costs for the new services the company is offering.   Q110 EBITDA: $5,062 Q111 EBITDA: $3,573  LLNW clearly has some intriguing growth prospects, but for now the growth comes at very high expenses causing very negative trends. Be wary of any company that always claims earnings a few years down the road. Unfortunately LLNW has numerous other competitors clamoring for market share, causing an apparent race to the bottom.

552751,29971,2012-05-02T16:37:19-04:00,,"The story of Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW) has always been one of a tediously prolonged fall from grace. After a 2007 IPO at $15, it closed its first trading day at $22.18, then lost more than half of its value in the subsequent three months. By May 2008, it was trading at the same level at which we find it today of around $2.80, with several hopeful breakouts, promptly followed by downward adjustments of disappointment.Once seen as a crown contender in the Content Delivery Network market, Limelight Networks was the solution provider of choice for YouTube, a website which, by the time of the IPO, was already a household name. It lost this head start after Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) decided to transition YouTube to a self-developed and operated CDN. From there on, Limelight Networks struggled and failed to compete against both the 1000-pound gorilla in the shape of Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM), as well as the swarm of new added-value CDNs such as Brightcove (NASDAQ:BCOV) attacking various emerging niches.A CDN sells capacity to content providers; this can be, for example, companies operating popular websites that many users on the Internet frequent. The CDN establishes geographically distributed points of presence, at which copies of the content offered by its content provider customers are kept. This in turn assures that end users receive the content at a much higher speed than would have been possible if it was still stored on the content provider's own servers, and often provides a better, less congested path for the content to follow.Other ISPs, in such a scenario, are a CDNs best friends. The more ISPs a CDN is interconnected with, the more end users have direct and fast access to the content. Thus, traditionally, a CDN establishes as many settlement-free interconnection agreements (or ""peering sessions"") as possible with other Internet service providers.In the past few days, a number of ISPs worldwide with which Limelight Networks has settlement-free interconnection agreements (known in the industry as ""peering"") were surprised to receive a notice that this interconnection agreement will be terminated.Instead, Limelight Networks is offering these peering partners to purchase inter-connectivity capacity. Many operators and technical personnel of ISPs found this move so distasteful, that a lively debate under the topic ""CDNs should pay eyeball networks, too."" ensued on the North American Network Operators Group mailing list (an open forum for technical discussion on matters relating to the operation of the Internet). What would have otherwise been an unremarkable communication between ISPs has spilled into the public domain. With every passing day, the number of ISPs subject to this treatment by Limelight Networks appears to be growing.Limelight Networks, however, with their recently introduced policy change, is betting that it can collect a toll on both sides of the same tunnel: once from the content provider, for the speedy distribution of their content, and once again from ISPs, which connect the end users to the Internet.On the surface, this seems like a sensible bet which would increase revenue by introducing a new revenue stream, potentially revitalizing the stagnant company. Indeed, companies like France Telecom (FTE) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) have been pursuing similar strategies. However - so far, the step has been met with considerable skepticism by ISPs. Some are rumored to have gone as far as preemptively terminating the settlement-free agreement in order to express their displeasure with this move. As Limelight Networks loses more and more peering with ISPs which choose not to replace it with a paid interconnect instead, it will in some instances find itself in a position where it must pay a transit provider per each bit sent to entities with which the settlement-free interconnection has been terminated.Furthermore, since all content now has to pass several networks, the reliability and quality of service experienced by end users could drop, and may result in a suboptimal user experience for end users, which will complain to the content providers - forcing content providers to re-evaluate their relationship with Limelight Networks.Barring an acquisition by a competitor in order to absorb the remaining customers (the CDN market is technologically highly specialized, and any existing technology footprint will likely have to be scrapped rather than integrated after such a move), Limelight Networks may be well on its way into the long list of 'has been' companies in the rapidly changing landscape of Internet services.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

45556,20364,2007-08-24T05:21:47-04:00,,"How much is the name Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) really worth to LimeLight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW)? Thursday, it was worth an extra 50 cents, or 6.25%, as LimeLight shares jumped to $9.01 as the company announced Thursday morning that Microsoft will use the company’s content distribution network to distribute multimedia “including video, music, games, software, and social media,” to Microsoft’s 460 million unique users in a multi-year agreement.
The thing is, this doesn’t affect Limelight’s finances in any immediate sense, because the deal was already announced a couple weeks ago in LimeLight’s conference call with analysts to discuss its second-quarter results and the outlook for the year.
At the time the company said it was in the first year of a five-year deal with a large customer that represented 14% of the company’s revenue last quarter; Microsoft, it turns out, was that customer.
In fact, LimeLight gave quite explicit forecasts for analysts as to how the money will be accounted for on the books in coming quarters: LimeLight said at the time that because it is cross-licensing technology with Microsoft, the company will be deferring a chunk of revenue in coming years, with one figure for revenue reported on a GAAP basis, and one reported on a non-GAAP basis. 
For example, last quarter, the company reported $24.7 million of “non-GAAP” revenue, including the Microsoft payment, and $21.2 million of GAAP revenue. “Of this $3.5 million, $2.6 million will be recognized in the third quarter of 2007,” the company said.”
But none of that really matters; what matters is — this is Microsoft! And you can fairly hear the crackle of acquisition prospects that may be dancing in some people’s heads. Or huge boosts in traffic revenue for LimeLight from, say, Microsoft’s Xbox network. Coming amidst pricing pressure in the content distribution business, and worries that LimeLight would be pushed aside by larger competitor Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM), winning Microsoft’s stamp of approval must feel very good to LimeLight’s fans."
257132,22829,2011-03-08T16:43:44-05:00,,"Fresh off its recent secondary, Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW) could well look to  put  some of that recently raised cash to work in some shopping trips.  (It now has  more than ample resources. Last week’s offering netted  Limelight $77m,  essentially doubling its cash holdings.) If it does  look to do a deal or two, we  expect that Limelight’s next acquisition  will complement its core content  delivery network (CDN) business. The  company has already been broadening the  range of services it can  provide in the video ecosystem, most notably with the  $110m purchase of  EyeWonder’s ad campaign creation business in December 2009 and  most  recently with the tiny acquisition of Delve Networks, a provider of  online  video platform services.One area Limelight could buy into is peer-to-peer (P2P) delivery,  since the  CDN industry is facing growing concerns about the ability to  manage increasing  loads of Internet video traffic. There are some  providers making a go of P2P by  creating tools and services around  P2P-assisted game delivery, including Pando  Networks and Solid State  Networks, that would complement Limelight’s HTTP  delivery service.  Limelight could also take a look at Octoshape, which has done  a  significant amount of work in live video transport via P2P-assisted  delivery.  Octoshape’s service can utilize multiple cloud platforms to  scale  video-streaming delivery – so even if Limelight isn’t used as the  origin CDN, it  could gain a tool for providing extra streaming  capacity to content owners  dealing with delivering large events (think  the Olympics or World Cup Soccer) to  massive audiences that might wind  up overwhelming even the largest CDNs.If Limelight continues to structure its purchases as it historically  has, the  company could use its cash and securities to make a fairly  large acquisition. To  date, slightly more than half (57%) of the  $117.6m Limelight has spent on  M&A has been in cash, with the  remainder in stock. Combine that structuring  with the nearly $150m of  cash and marketable securities Limelight now holds, and  it could wield  $300m in buying power. However, the company would obviously have  to  temper any equity use so it wouldn’t significantly dilute existing   shareholders. And we would add that Limelight’s shareholders are a  fairly  satisfied bunch, with the stock having doubled over the past  year."

40010,20404,2007-07-03T06:34:36-04:00,,"Last Friday I wondered what was up with the 27% spike in Limelight Networks’ (NASDAQ:LLNW) stock price. I thought it was an institutional investor piling on some shares, since the company’s stock debuted at about $18, zoomed up to nearly $22, but had fallen back down to $15 before the 27% spike. Yesterday, Paid Content reports on a Light Reading post that reveals that in preliminary hearings, a court sided with Limelight (and against arch competitor Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM)), thus explaining why the stock shot up on Friday: ""The court said that Akamai was trying to patent the process, not the technology and rejected the claim."" As a result of the ruling, shares in Limelight rose $4.21 (27.04%) to $19.78 on the day, after touching an all-time low of $15.13 earlier in the trading session. Rafat Ali added: “The case is complex, so if someone else understands the ruling better, let us know.” I have yet to read the 29-page report, but will sometime this week if I have time. But the premise might not be that complex if you apply it to something simpler. First off, I’m not a lawyer (again). Second, I’m not about to say that you cannot patent a process. I’m sure you can. I guess it depends on what the process is. From what I know about CDNs, I am not sure what CDNs do is patentable. I’ve not given it that much thought… but then again, I’m no brainiac from MIT. But, if you take a step back and consider that a patent is intellectual property that is not fundamentally different than copyright, then you can say that “while published works are copyright”, the process by which you print a document is not. This is probably simplifying it too much, but it does apply to the Akamai vs. Limelight Networks a bit. The judge, I would presume, probably feels that the process whereby (using the same example) does not constitute a copyrightable asset. I’m no electric engineer (or whomever does what LLNW and AKAM do) but that makes sense. If you look at this in a different form of IP, say trade secrets, you can apply the same rationale: Take Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) versus Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP), or McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) versus Burger King (NYSEARCA:BKC). Surely if McDonald’s uses a certain type of meat, or develops a super duper oven etc., or decides to have 3 people working side-by-side to assemble the world’s greatest burger, these are trade secrets that a McDonald’s employee might not be allowed to use at BK if they were to leave from one to another, but if BK too wanted to change its process of putting the patty on the bread, etc., ie. apply the same process, I’m not sure there is anything non-kosher. Now, leaving food and beverages and returning to, well, whatever it is that Limelight produces: if the folks over at Limelight Networks were hiring former employees of Akamai and these people were violating any competition or confidentiality agreements, then a court could try to prevent these people from working at LLNW, but even then, it would not be able to shut down the Arizona-based company altogether. According to a GigaOm post when it was filed, So, what processes are patentable, well, I’m not sure if that’s even a word, let alone the question I ask… but for now, all I’ll say is this: The risk with lawsuits, as I’ve written here before, is that you can blow your false sense of security by over-extending your legal right… Anyway, I’m not a lawyer to take this all with a grain of salt, but the venerable readers of this blog might trust my interpretation of legalese and its translation into English… but we won’t go there.

Somewhere in here, however, I think there is a worthwhile speculative bet. Limelight has a relatively concentrated list of interesting customers, and its business, while still in the $105m annual range, is large enough to be interestingly accretive to another player. When does it become a takeover candidate? Does it require the Akamai IP suit to be resolved? Other?"
44200,20307,2007-08-12T04:23:13-04:00,,"Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW) shares, which plunged Thursday on disappointing guidance, in particular projecting far lower EBITDA for this year than the Street had expected, extended its slide Friday, as Goldman Sachs analyst Sarah Friar downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy.
Friar writes that her upgrade of the stock two weeks ago was “a mistake” (and not a small one; the stock has since lost about half of its value). She says that “management credibility is shaken,” and adds that pricing and seasonality dynamics in the content delivery network market suggest “a maturity level in the CDN market that was not evident a quarter ago.”
“Limelight’s stumble highlights that management is still getting their arms around being a public company, and has yet to put in place a lot of the infrastructure to support execution on targets,” she writes. “Secondly, there also appears to be a shifting dynamic in the CDN industry,” with “tougher pricing.”
She says that to turn bullish she would want to see “more evidence that management has put in place the right internal infrastructure, and more time to evaluate the path that pricing is taking in the industry.”
Friar cut her 2007 EPS estimate to a loss of 6 cents from a loss of 4 cents; for next year she goes to a loss of 6 cents from a profit of 16 cents; for ‘09 she now sees EPS of 8 cents, down from 36 cents. Her price target drops to $12 from $22.
The stock is now down 47% since coming public June 7 at $15 a share."

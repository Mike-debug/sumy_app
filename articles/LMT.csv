4383099,50291,2020-10-30T15:00:00-04:00,"Current geopolitical setting would call for increase defense budgets regardless of who's in Office.China plays a key role for the US to keep increasing budgets.The pandemic, increasing deficit and debts do put constraints on any future budget.","With the presidential elections coming up, it's always the big question how certain industries will fare under a change of president. During the previous elections, it seemed that Wall Street was favoring a win for President Trump with the prospect on tax cuts and increased defense spending, while his opponent, Hillary Clinton, seemed to be going after the pharmaceutical industry and Wall Street. These elections will be one like no other due to the pandemic and many other reasons. I don’t want to make this a political piece and I ask my readers to share their views but not to make it a political discussion. My main aim is to outline why I believe that regardless of whom will be winning the presidential elections big changes to defense spending are not expected and that it will mean no disruption to the business for Boeing (BA) or Lockheed Martin (LMT).Source: House.govFigure 1: Defense budget development (Source: AeroAnalysis)Figure 1 shows that under President Obama defense spending declined in some of the years, and in fact under President Obama, there was a net decline in defense spending. Under President Trump, defense spending has increased as was expected but it should also be considered that defense spending budgets is not a clear-cut thing. So, you will have a one-year time delay for a president’s influence on the budget to be reflected in the numbers. That already shows that defense companies really won’t start suffering or gaining from a fundamental point of view as soon as the President is sworn in. Much of the price movement in election years have been forward looking in that regard and one could even say that for the current elections is largely psychological.Source: Council on Foreign RelationsEither candidate attacked the opponent on their stance toward adversaries of the United States of America. In the previous paragraph, I discussed that a change won’t trickle through immediately. Both candidates have a strategy for domestic politics as well as the approach toward the geopolitical landscape. I think that while Biden and Trump differ significantly in their views, their stance toward China likely won’t change any time soon. There are a few reasons for that. The first reason is that it would look somewhat odd to have a 180-degree change in policy from the day a possible change in Office takes effect. It would do nothing good to the image of the US as a stable partner, which already has come under significant pressure in recent years. Especially for countries as China it would look like a sudden change is a sign of weakness, and if there's something the US cannot use at this time it's looking weak on the international stage.So, the US and China certainly are not going to be buddies any time soon and that's regardless of the outcome of the elections. I'm also expecting that while both candidates will be tough on China, each in their own way, the approach will soften somewhat for the simple reason that China plays a key role in the global economy and trade.I believe that eventually, both candidates will be tough on China where they can. Trump will be to get a trade deal that he needs, while Biden will try to continue carrying out a policy where it's attempted to limit the power of China by creating and strengthening more allies in the region. Both approaches are different, but require some sort of deterrent which we can find in the form of defense budgets.Next to that, Chinese defense spending has been rising for years and it would be somewhat odd if both candidates would be tough on China or attempt to be while not making the defense budgets rise as well. We are in a time where we are looking more into hypersonic weapons, cyberwar and electronic warfare and the US would stand to lose its edge if it doesn’t invest in those parts of the defense spectrum while also keeping its existing capabilities current.One also should not forget that the relation with China is very tense at the moment, and in its effort to gain more presence in the region, the US has been selling weapon systems to Taiwan. That of course is much to China’s displeasure and it has cooled relations between the two global powerhouses even further. That cooling relation while also trying to protect US interests and expand the influence in the region cannot be rhymed with significant changes in defense spending. The US simply cannot afford to look like some kind of toothless tiger at a time where there's much at stake.As much as both candidates might want to expand their defense budgets to keep defense equipment current along with the need to innovate, a lot is going to depend on how the pandemic is being dealt with. For either candidate there might be unwanted tightening to the defense budget if the pandemic spirals out even further, so what we see is that while both candidates have been attacking each other on their approach toward China and the pandemic… The implication remains that China gives one reason to increase defense spending, while the economic impact of the pandemic pressures the possibility to significantly increase the budget, which previously already was driven by increasing deficit and debts.For Boeing and Lockheed Martin, I do expect that there will not be huge changes depending on who wins the elections. During the previous elections, defense budgets were a big thing that also kept defense names in a grip. Lockheed Martin shares have not made huge price movements this year, being down around 5%, due to fears of Biden winning the elections, but I think that pressure has been largely psychological as Biden is actually targeting a different approach to how the defense budget is spent with more focus on unmanned vehicles and cyberwarfare, whereas President Trump favors a Navy, apace and a not un-logical volume driven approach. For the upcoming elections, I believe that both candidates would like to seek budget hikes to support their geopolitical strategy, but both candidates also are restricted in hiking defense budgets by economic impact of the pandemic, the need to reallocate money for healthcare due to the pandemic, and servicing increased debt ceilings and increasing deficit. What we have been seeing so far from Lockheed Martin and Boeing is that regardless of the outcome they are projecting stable budgets, and I think that might indeed be a fair assumption as dangers haven’t declined over the past and Republicans as well as Democrats have in recent years backed higher spending. Add a pandemic, debt and deficit layer to that and stable budgets become increasingly likely which shouldn’t be disruptive for either company."
4382681,105093,2020-10-29T14:34:36-04:00,"Lockheed Martin is undervalued to its forecasted results for the first time since briefly in -18, and longer in 7 years.This marks a significant investment opportunity for conservative dividend investors, despite the troubles in some of the segments.Lockheed Martin is an undervalued ""BUY"".","I never thought I would be writing about undervalued Lockheed Martin (LMT), truth be told. It was exciting enough when General Dynamics (GD) reached the current levels of valuation, but now COVID-19 and lack of stimulus have brought another defense/aerospace stalwart to the same point.To me, this means that it's time to consider opening your bank vault and deploy some cash into one of the best aerospace/defense businesses on the planet.Let's look at Lockheed Martin.Lockheed Martin is a company active in aerospace, defense, arms, security, and advanced technologies. It's an international company that was born from a merger of the Lockheed Corporation, and the Martin Marietta Corporation back in 1995.Its revenues make it one of the largest companies in aerospace, military support, security, and technologies. It is, in fact, nearly without equal in terms of defense contracting, having been the largest company here in -14, and fighting for that first spot with its peers. This also means that the absolute, massive majority of its sales come from governmental contracts through military sales. In the beginning of the 2010s, almost 10% of the Pentagon's funds went to Lockheed Martin.[Source: LMT]The company is headquartered in Maryland and employs some 110,000 people all over the world. It's a part of the S&P 500, the S&P 100, and has annual revenues of nearly $60B.Some of its characteristic products include the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning...(Source: By U.S. Air Force photo by Master Sgt. Donald R. Allen - Aerial refueling of F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters at Eglin AFB, Fla. Public Domain, F-35A flight (cropped).jpg)...and planes like the C-130 Hercules, the Trident Missile, and much, much more. Lockheed Martin has also been active in some rather ""odd"" areas, such as developing the texture mapping chip for the Sega Model 2 arcade board, and the entire GPU for the Sega Model 3. It's a company with its fingers in many areas, both tech, and others.The company organizes its businesses into four segments. These are:On a competitive base, the company competes against other defense and aerospace companies as well as smaller competitors. Some major peers include General Dynamics, Raytheon Technologies (RTX), Northrop Grumman (NOC), and Boeing (BA).Defense companies like Lockheed Martin solve a timeless problem that its primary customer, the U.S. government, cares deeply about. At the same time, it's a problem that can't ever be solved, because technologies and products evolve, each new innovation is met by new technologies, and so forth. That means that companies like LMT enjoy constant new opportunities to develop new systems, defenses, and technologies, for as long as the U.S. views it as necessary to do so and provides the funds for the company to operate. It's certainly an enviable position - most of the time - for a company to be in.The fact that LMT is one of the largest, if not the very largest company in its field with its relationship with the government, means it has some inherent advantages. Moats to enter this market are extremely high - investment CapEx alone tops $1B a year, and to even start to develop these technologies and products from zero is a challenge that virtually no one seeks to do in this day and age.Lockheed's size and capabilities of course also give it some advantages in bidding situations, meaning the company can do things in terms of investments other companies could never consider. In a bidding war, very few can afford to go toe-to-toe with Lockheed Martin.The fact is that in this day and age, competition for Lockheed Martin has dwindled. Existing companies consolidate, and LMT is an active M&A'er as well, with the last major M&A being Sikorsky Aircraft in 2015 for $9B, adding the Black Hawk to its portfolio.(Source: LMT)Aside from being one of the primary choices in the U.S., LMT has gained international appeal. Developing their own weapons and fighters are ambitions that for most nations due to involved costs simply aren't realizable goals, which means that they buy LMT products. The F-35 alone is sold to 11 of the USA's allies, and this provides the company with advantages in these target markets.(Source: U.S. Air Force photo by 1st Lt. Christopher Mesnard - Public Domain, 1025448 A Swedish JAS-39 Gripen returns to the play areas of the Arctic Challenge exercise Sept. 24, 2013.jpg)Europe has defense companies. Sweden has SAAB (OTCPK:SAABF), and we have our SAAB 39-Gripen. But the fact is that LMT is more than twice as large as Europe's major defense companies combined. (Source)So the market position for Lockheed Martin seems favorable from the get-go. Add to this that defense spending doesn't show any sign of slowing down - not just because of increased threats, but because of the necessity of replacing legacy technology - and with tensions in the middle east and across the world, Lockheed Martin is likely to be a major player going forward.Fundamentals in the company are solid as well. LMT carries an A-grade S&P credit rating, has a less than 40% forward payout ratio, less than 2.1X net debt/EBITDA, and a nearly 20-year dividend streak without a reduction. LMT not only carried, but increased its dividend during the last recession, and the 5-year DGR rate is 10%, which is truly excellent. EPS shows exactly the kind of development we want to see, essentially a staircase beginning in 2010 at $7.82/share and ending NTM in a $25.9/share expectation. The company has performed numerous buybacks, reducing shares outstanding from 386M 10 years ago to less than 285M on an LTM basis, while increasing its sales. Again, this is extremely solid, and that's why I consider the company an unquestionable class 1 company.The company, therefore, is one of the major defense/aerospace companies in the world. It researches, develops, and manufactures the technologies that keep defensive technologies and offensive capabilities at a competitive technological level, and its primary customer is the U.S. government, through the military and various branches and institutions.Let's look at how recent results and trends have impacted Lockheed Martin.The latest set of results available to us are the 3Q20 results. In short, these results have been excellent overall. During one of the worst pandemics on record, the company managed:In short, Lockheed Martin is humming. With YoY sales and profits beats like this, it's hard to believe that the company could be trading at anything close to undervaluation.(Source: LMT 3Q20 Presentation)The segments I mentioned in the first part of the article have more or less kept to their relative size and percentage of total sales. Expectations are for this more or less to continue.(Source: LMT 3Q20 Presentation)The way operating profits are flowing in, the segmentation is virtually identical, with perhaps slightly more from the company's MFC segment.LMT has also provided an overall outlook for FY21. The company forecasts a sales increase of about $2B, margins of around the same, at 11-11.1%, and cash flow from operations of about or above $8.1B. No more than $500M worth of debt matures next year, and the company intends to continue its share repurchasing program, with $1B slated to go towards this.It is no more complicated than that. 2020 has been an excellent year for LMT, despite everything that's happened, and in the face of its declining share price due to macro, LMT continues to deliver record-breaking results. It's a strong company showing strength in a difficult market.Let's look at the company valuationHere things become fun. Unfortunately, the company is one of those where I simply nibbled a little when things dropped down, being focused on other companies. Well, this time around, LMT is in my crosshairs (no pun intended), and I don't intend to miss out on any appealing Lockheed Martin valuation.What is it that makes the company so appealing at this particular time? Take a look at the 10-year historical and forward EPS.(Source: F.A.S.T Graphs)In the specific case of LMT, I don't want to pay premium valuation, even if I don't consider the premium to be invalid, as such. But when this company is below a 15X average, or 15X normalized P/E, it's time to pay attention.For one, analysts don't miss on this company - at least not negative misses. Both on a 1-year and 2-year basis, analysts are either correct with 10% margin of error, or they underestimate the company. That means that the forecasted EPS growth of 2020-2023 is not only likely, it's downright indicative in my book.(Source: F.A.S.T Graphs)This brings us to the forecasted returns.(Source: F.A.S.T Graphs)Even based on a forecasted earnings multiple that's in line with the current one - around 14.5X, LMT will provide what could turn out to be market-beating returns to investors - and anyone who believes that this company will trade below par for very long needs to take another look at the share price history.A return to anything approaching the normal premium will deliver to investors not annual rates of return of 9-10%, but annual RoR of 16-17%, with total rates until 2023 approaching 64%.Unless you belong to the bear category of investors here, this is a company you as a dividend investor want to own in your portfolio, and at current valuation, there is the very real possibility of not only expected growth but mean reversion towards higher valuation multiples.When it comes to LMT, my valuation targets are extremely simple. Whenever the company breaches its 15X fair value P/E based on an average or normalized EPS, I have an alarm going off. That alarm went off a few days ago, and I bought a small number of shares.Due to the current macro situation, I'm careful, but at the same time, I don't want the company to rocket back up without having dipped more than a toe in the water this time. My target for LMT is that I want 1.5% of my portfolio in LMT shares - and that requires building my exposure substantially. Whenever the company approaches a 3% yield - much like GD - it's time to drop things and take a look at LMT.The current 2020 price target for LMT based on a 15X average weighted P/E-valuation is around $363-$368/share. As things currently stand, that makes LMT around 3-5% undervalued. With LMT, that's certainly enough to react on.S&P Global analysts would take a completely different tact here, and tell me I'm being foolish for completely ignoring the company's premium. As the market sees LMT, an average of 21 S&P global analysts give the company a minimum of $390/share and a maximum of $509/share, coming to a mean of $434.69/share, marking a market undervaluation of 23%, if you'd like to go by these estimates.By any account, even my very conservative one, LMT is currently substantially undervalued.(Source: Unsplash)The bullish thesis for Lockheed Martin is a simple one - an excellent company will continue to outperform over time and will continue to, if not excel, at least meet expectations. At this valuation, this will return market-beating amounts of money to investors. LMT bulls like myself point to the company's outperformance over time, flawless dividend history stretching 17-20 years, and the largest backlog ever recorded.The tailwinds for this company are not to be trifled with and to be completely honest with you, I don't consider COVID-19 to be even capable of severely impacting this company's prospects - unless raw material producers start being impacted, which doesn't seem to be the case here.No, the collective positives of this company indicate outperformance not only over the long term but the medium term. 3% yield isn't sector-leading, but it's hard to think of a company with a larger moat, customers with better credit rating or payment ability, or products that are considered necessary and non-discretionary at this time.The Lockheed Martin Corporation is the largest defense contractor in the world. It has superb competitive advantages, and its focus is an extremely specialized, hard-to-enter industry with extremely picky customers. Virtually no companies apart from its direct peers can actually compete on any level with its scale, offerings, and relationships.Being an LMT bull is, quite simply, very easy.(Source: Unsplash)Nothing is as clear-cut as this, however. I draw your attention to a quote from my GD article.The same argument can be made for Lockheed Martin. In fact, with Lockheed, it's, even more, an argument as LMT doesn't have the Gulfstream argument at all.The point is that there is a bearish stance to be taken here. I view this stance to be valid on two points and two points only.This is my view of the bearish argument for LMT, as it currently stands.LMT is a company I've had in my crosshairs for a while. I've bought sporadically when it's been cheap, but never above a few shares, and today hold no more than 0.1% of my portfolio in the company. I intend to change this, and this article marks the change, as well as my first review and following of the company.(Source: Europäische Sicherheit und Technik)I view the Lockheed Martin Corporation as an essential must-have Industrial stock together with General Dynamics and similar, safe stocks in the same sector. While I did not serve in the U.S. army - I served in the Germany Bundeswehr, the picture that often comes to me when I look at an overview of my portfolio and formulate a strategy for going forward is one of a battlefield, or a commander directing his troops. Each amount of money or dollar being a soldier, and being sent out to bring home victory, in the form of capital appreciation or dividends. Some ""battles"" or investments aren't going as well at this time. Some I'm confident in, some I may even regret sending ""troops"" into. This anecdote isn't unique and you may view your portfolio in different ways - a garden, or other things as well, but the point remains to make good choices.I believe that choosing to invest in a company such as Lockheed Martin at what is essentially an undervaluation is something that could provide long-term and short-term alpha.No, the company won't double your money in the short term. You'll have no 8% yields to lean on - there are other investments for that. But compared to other companies, your money will quite likely be very safe. That's not something that can be said for very many investments, in the end.Lockheed Martin is 3-5% undervalued at the time of writing this article, and that makes the company a ""BUY"".Thank you for reading.At 3-5% undervaluation to even a very conservative valuation, Lockheed Martin is a ""BUY""."

We're expert in space sector investing and as luck would have it, space is driving defense growth. Well, not luck exactly. Since the 1950s, jeux sans frontieres in space have served as the marketing department for defense proper. Between the US and the USSR first time around, each country outdid the other to pull off feats wherein as intended, the people were amazed. Satellite in orbit, dog in orbit, human in orbit ... USSR ahead. Spacecraft rendezvous, spacewalk ... USSR ahead. Then US spending got serious and the home team started winning from behind. It was an acquisition, of course, that delivered the US the victory first time around. The design genius acquired when Wernher von Braun was plucked from Europe and planted in Huntsville, AL, was the foundation for the US' eventual victory. Design skill coupled with truly huge amounts of spending that the US alone could afford. A second Manhattan Project in short.Fast forward to 2020. The US federal space program caught a cold during the financial crisis and as a result of the shuttering of many NASA and other government programs, two things have happened. First, venture capitalists are starting to make money from their space sector investments. The poster child being SpaceX (SPACE) which will, we hope, IPO one day. Where the government has stepped back, private companies and investors have most certainly stepped in. Second, a different incarnation of the original Space Race is now upon us. The opponent this time is China, whose space technology isn't uniformly excellent and whose safety standards are lower (ergo its stuff is cheaper) but they do in fact have a lunar rover on the wrong side of the Moon right now, the side that cannot ever see Earth. To aid with the radiocomm, they also have a satellite relay station in lunar orbit. Yes, this is happening now, whilst the US is still agonizing over the cost of the SLS rocket, the Artemis program, wondering how on Earth Boeing (BA) was so colossally embarrassed by the SpaceX performance on Commercial Crew thus far, and other internally-focused wrangles.Whoever occupies the White House after the election has this real-world problem to deal with. China is number 1 on many global measures. The US was number 1 on those measures. China intends to continue to climb. Most folks in the US don't see the US as playing second fiddle to anyone. And so the newly elected President, whoever he may be, in our view has to power up the US space program and with it the US defense program in order to walk the walk as well as talking the talk.And that, we think, means a positive future for the leading defense stocks, all of whom have meaningful space divisions, most of whom acquired those divisions or material parts thereof. In the case of Lockheed Martin (LMT) that was the acquisition of Martin Marietta in 1995, for Northrop Grumman, the acquisition of Orbital ATK in 2018, and so forth.In that context, we were at Buy in our subscription service going into Q3 earnings for LMT. The stock chart has consolidated into a suitably 2020-like, anything can happen pattern. Could go up, could go down. (That's what our decades of investing experience gets you folks. Could go up, could go down).LMT usually beats and raises and we figured this time would be no different. It wasn't. Beat and raise. Great numbers. Here are the numbers.Source: Company SEC filings, YCharts.com, Cestrian AnalysisTTM revenue growth of +10% (on revenue of $64bn, no mean feat), stable margins, continued deleverage to a thoroughly-capital-inefficient 0.9x TTM EBITDA before retirement obligations. In other words, what good looks like.Backlog kind of flat which is a nag; at NOC backlog is up +25% year on year as a result of big wins in the nuclear renewal program, at Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD) backlog is up almost 50% on recent nuclear and NASA wins; so flat at LMT is a little disappointing.Despite the solid quarter and the depressed price going in, the stock headed for the basement and commenced digging.Here's what you'll pay for this 10% growing, almost-unlevered big ol' stable company as of today's close.1.7x TTM revenue and 11.3x TTM EBITDA. Read that again. And then remind yourself why you haven't bought the stock already.Well, here are some reasons not to.But the big call with LMT is: what happens to defense spending come November? We're optimists on this. We think the US has no choice but to step up on this front, unless it is going to choose a path of managed decline over the next fifty years (a foreign policy playbook available at all good bookstores in the UK. Where they still have a lot of bookstores because, you know, people used to like books back when the UK was on top, and who needs all these new-fangled computer thingummies anyway).Whether you choose to own LMT at this point, we think, comes down to - are you a momentum investor / trader (in which case this piece-of-wet-string stock behavior will have you thoroughly bored already and you will have bailed by now), or do you see this as a pre-election doldrums position still.Speaking for our staff accounts, with hope in our hearts we remain at Buy on LMT and we remain owners of the stock.Cestrian Capital Research, Inc - 22 October 2020."
4372467,50291,2020-09-04T09:30:25-04:00,Lockheed Martin received a $62B contract that puts the ceiling for further F-16 Block 70/72 orders and services.The contract award is important for the F-16 production line.Order demonstrates the strength of the F-16 franchise next to the F-35.,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) has been one of the names I have been bullish on for some years. Admittedly, the stock price performance since I wrote my first report on Lockheed Martin has only outperformed the broader market by a few percent, but its total return has been strong and that's realized by strong growth in the dividends. In turn, that ability to grow dividends is driven by a strong product complementary product portfolio and ongoing wins in the field.Source: RTL NieuwsIn this report, we have a look at one of the most recent wins marking the biggest contract awarded to Lockheed Martin in recent years.Figure 1: Contract overview F-16 (Source: AeroAnalysis)Data from the Defense Contracts Monitor shows that the contract awarded in August has been the biggest contract awarded in recent years. The contract for the F-16 is valued at $62 billion where a couple of things should be taken into account. The first thing that is very important to realize is that the contract award does not mean that Lockheed Martin has been handed a bag of money with $62B in it. Lockheed Martin was awarded a so called “ indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity” (IDIQ) contract for a 10-year period. When fully awarded and funded that contract averages around $6.2 billion per year which already puts that $62 billion in context. Additionally, this is an IDIQ contract which is a contract hull used when the customer cannot predetermine, above a specified minimum, the precise quantities of supplies or services that it will require during the contract period. An IDIQ contract award basically sets the ceiling of a program or order and if the need arises governments place delivery orders against that initial IDIQ contract. So, it's no given that over that 10-year timeframe the entire IDIQ will be funded.The initial delivery order called for the delivery of 90 F-16 fighters valued $4.9B. However, of that $4.9B only $3.9B was obligated at time of award. So that big $62B contract has an annualized value of $6.2B, which further reduces to $4.9B for the initial order and $3.9B in fund obligated at time of award.Source: SUWallsAlthough, the funds obligated are just 6% of the total ceiling the contract remains an important one as there remains significant chances for follow up orders for more fighter jets and services as the potential value of the contract is $62B. Also for the strategic interests in the region the contract is important. Sixty-six of the F-16 fighters are destined for Taiwan and it helps the US strengthen its grip in the region by sales to strategic allies. That's not something that's completely new as then-President Obama also tried to engage more strongly with countries in the region, most notably Vietnam, to get a grip on China and the influence it tries to exert on the South Chinese Sea. Selling fighter jets to Taiwan is not something we see often and marks a step up in the tensions between the US and China. Overall, this contract fits in the US foreign policy and it's a sensitive contract award. In fact, it's so sensitive that the Department of Defense didn’t reveal the customer for the F-16s. However, we do know that the sale was already approved last by the Trump Administration last year and Lockheed Martin anticipated sales to other countries. Last year, F-16 sales for 25 units to Morocco were approved. In 2008, Morocco ordered 24 F-16s so we can conclude that the first tranche of 90 fighter jets consists of 66 F-16s for Taiwan and 24 for Morocco.What also should be emphasized is the role of older generation fighter jets. Currently we do see that investors think that countries always need the most advanced systems. Taiwan is a prime example of why the US would want to strengthen the position of allies to serve the strategic interests in the region and globally but at the same time not sell the latest technology military equipment. Another reason why countries could be looking at the F-16 instead of the F-35 is the pricing. The F-16, while less capable, will suffice for many nations at a lower procurement and operating price.For Lockheed Martin this contract is important. A year ago the backlog for the F-16 was just 30 units and we are now seeing the F-16 backlog being increased by 90 units with possibly more to come in the future strengthening the franchise.While the notion of a $62B contract might need some context placement in terms of timeframe as well as the contract being an IDIQ contract serving as a ceiling transforming the $62B into a $4.9B initial delivery order with $3.9B in funds obligated at award, the importance of the F-16 contract is huge. The F-16 offers a good alternative to customers that the US won’t allow to procure the F-35 or for whom the F-35 is too pricey. Providing the less capable F-16, still allows Lockheed Martin to provide foreign military customers with products supporting US foreign policy and reflects the strength of Lockheed Martin’s fighter jet line up. It's contract awards like these that strengthen Lockheed Martin’s fundamental business, enabling market-outperforming total returns."
4381799,104980,2020-10-27T16:20:51-04:00,"Lockheed Martin's most recent 8.3% dividend increase from a quarterly dividend of $2.40/share to $2.60/share managed to meet my expectations.In addition, Lockheed Martin reported 10.1% YoY growth in revenue YTD and 7.6% YoY growth in diluted EPS YTD while the company also maintained its strong balance sheet.Adding to the case for an investment in Lockheed Martin, is the fact that shares are trading at what I estimate is a 10% discount to fair value.Between its 2.8% yield, 7.0-8.0% annual earnings growth potential, and 1.1% annual valuation multiple expansion, shares of Lockheed Martin are primed to meet my 10% annual total return requirement over the next decade.","Staying consistent with the theme that I brought up in my previous article on National Retail Properties (NNN), I continue to believe that the core of a dividend growth investor's portfolio should be comprised of dividend stocks with track records of delivering dividend growth regardless of whether the operating environment is favorable or unfavorable in the immediate term.An example of a stock that fits this mold, which has recently recaptured my attention, is that of Lockheed Martin (LMT).As I'll discuss below for the first time since I last covered the stock in August, Lockheed Martin's dividend safety and high-single digit annual growth potential remains intact, Lockheed Martin once again delivered steady results in the third quarter while it continued to maintain a healthy balance sheet, and Lockheed Martin is currently priced at a moderate discount to my estimated fair value, which is why I continue to rate shares of the stock as a buy at this time. While Lockheed Martin's current 2.78% yield is within a reasonable range of the S&P 500's current 1.70% yield, I will be measuring both Lockheed Martin's diluted EPS and FCF against its dividend obligation to determine the extent of Lockheed Martin's dividend safety, as well as to approximate the annual dividend growth potential over the long-term.Through the first 9 months of this fiscal year, Lockheed Martin has generated $17.92 in diluted EPS (per page 2 of Lockheed Martin's Q3 2020 earnings press release) against $7.20 in dividends/share, for a diluted EPS payout ratio of 40.2%.When compared to the 39.6% diluted EPS payout ratio through the first 9 months of FY 2019 (according to data sourced from Lockheed Martin's dividend page and page 2 of Lockheed Martin's Q3 2020 earnings press release), Lockheed Martin's diluted EPS payout ratio is roughly unchanged. From an FCF standpoint, Lockheed Martin generated $6.376 billion in operating cash flow against $1.044 billion in capital expenditures through the first 9 months of the fiscal year, for total FCF of $5.332 billion (based on data sourced from page 18 of Lockheed Martin's Q3 2020 earnings press release).Measured against the $2.036 billion in dividends paid out during this time, Lockheed Martin's FCF payout ratio equates to 38.2%.This is once again in line with Lockheed Martin's FCF payout ratio of 37.8% through the first 9 months of FY 2019 (again sourced from Lockheed Martin's dividend page and page 18 of Lockheed Martin's Q3 2020 earnings press release), which leads me to believe that Lockheed Martin's dividend is rather safe for the foreseeable future.Given that Lockheed Martin's payout ratios are in a very sustainable range, I am reiterating my opinion that Lockheed Martin is positioned to slightly expand its payout ratios in the long-term, which I believe will help the stock to deliver dividend growth slightly ahead of whatever annual earnings growth it achieves over the long-term.Since Yahoo Finance is forecasting 9.0% annual earnings growth over the next 5 years for Lockheed Martin and Lockheed Martin's recent dividend increase was 8.3%, I believe it is reasonable for me to maintain my expectation of 7.75% annual dividend growth over the long-term.Image Source: Lockheed Martin Third-Quarter 2020 Earnings PresentationLockheed Martin's operating results for Q3 2020 were very impressive, especially in light of the operational challenges facing most businesses as a result of the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic.Lockheed Martin managed to increase its backlog for the 9th consecutive quarter as nearly $17 billion in new orders during the quarter exceeded the ~$16.5 billion in net sales, taking its backlog to a record $150.4 billion as indicated by CFO Ken Possenriede's opening remarks during Lockheed Martin's Q3 2020 earnings call.Lockheed Martin's $16.495 billion in reported net sales during Q3 2020 represented 8.7% YoY growth compared to the $15.171 billion in net sales generated in Q3 2019 (data sourced from page 5 of Lockheed Martin's Q3 2020 earnings press release).Lockheed Martin's strong net sales growth in the third quarter was led aggregately by its Aeronautics segment, followed by its Missiles and Fire Control, Rotary And Mission Systems, and Space segments, respectively.Starting with Lockheed Martin's Aeronautics segment, net sales rose 8.1% YoY from $6.178 billion in Q3 2019 to $6.680 billion in Q3 2020 (as per data sourced from page 5 of Lockheed Martin's Q3 2020 earnings press release).Moving to the Missiles and Fire Control segment, Lockheed Martin's net sales surged 14.2% YoY from $2.601 billion in Q3 2019 to $2.971 billion in Q3 2020 (according to data sourced from page 5 of Lockheed Martin's Q3 2020 earnings press release).Lockheed Martin's Rotary and Mission Systems segment posted $3.998 billion in net sales in Q3 2020, which was a 7.8% YoY increase from the $3.709 billion in net sales generated in Q3 2019 (per data sourced from page 5 of Lockheed Martin's Q3 2020 earnings press release).Rounding out Lockheed Martin's segments, the Space segment delivered 6.1% YoY growth in net sales from $2.683 billion in Q3 2019 to $2.846 billion in Q3 2020 (as indicated on page 5 of Lockheed Martin's Q3 2020 earnings press release).Lockheed Martin's 8.7% YoY net sales growth was partially offset by lower segment operating margins (~11.0% in Q3 2019 versus 10.7% in Q3 2020 based on data sourced from page 5 of Lockheed Martin's Q3 2020 earnings press release).Lockheed Martin posted $6.05 in diluted EPS in Q3 2020, which represents 6.9% YoY growth compared to the $5.66 of diluted EPS generated in Q3 2019 (page 2 of Lockheed Martin's Q3 2020 earnings press release).Overall, Lockheed Martin reported $48.366 billion in net sales through the first 9 months of this fiscal year, which represents 10.1% YoY growth compared to the $43.934 billion in net sales through the first 9 months of last fiscal year (also according to page 2 of Lockheed Martin's Q3 2020 earnings press release).What's more, Lockheed Martin managed to advance its diluted EPS 7.6% YoY from $16.66 through the first 9 months of FY 2019 to $17.92 through the first 9 months of this fiscal year (as per page 2 of Lockheed Martin's Q3 2020 earnings press release). Image Source: Lockheed Martin Third-Quarter 2020 Earnings PresentationAs a result of Lockheed Martin's exceptional third quarter, the company revised its sales outlook upward by $1 billion for this fiscal year from its July midpoint of $64.25 billion to its October outlook of $65.25 billion as illustrated by the slide above.This also translates into a $150 million increase in Lockheed Martin's midpoint segment operating profit for this fiscal year of $6.975 billion as of July 2020 to $7.125 billion expected as of October 2020.Continuing on the trend above, Lockheed Martin's diluted EPS forecast was raised $0.55 to $24.45 for this fiscal year compared to the July 2020 forecast midpoint of $23.90.Expectations for FAS/CAS pension adjustments and cash from operations for the fiscal year remain the same compared to July's forecast of $2.09 billion and greater than or equal to $8.00 billion, respectively.Moving to Lockheed Martin's balance sheet, Lockheed Martin boasted ~$3.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of Q3 2020, which was a ~$700 million boost sequentially from the last time that I covered Lockheed Martin (page 17 of Lockheed Martin's Q3 2020 earnings press release). This leaves Lockheed Martin with plenty of liquidity to navigate any uncertainty pertaining to COVID-19 in the months ahead.Furthermore, Lockheed Martin's interest coverage ratio has improved significantly over the past year, with its interest coverage ratio surging from ~10.9 through the first 9 months of last fiscal year to ~13.7 through the first 9 months of this fiscal year (as per page 15 of Lockheed Martin's Q3 2020 earnings press release).When I take into consideration Lockheed Martin's steady operating results in the third quarter, ample liquidity, and healthy/steadily improving interest coverage ratio, I believe that Lockheed Martin remains capable of making a great long-term investment if shares are acquired at or below fair value.While Lockheed Martin is a blue-chip defense contractor, that doesn't make the company immune from risk. Since I have already covered Lockheed Martin's COVID-19 related risks in previous articles (i.e. potential production facility disruptions, increased supply chain costs, and remote work challenges), I will be reiterating several key risks from Lockheed Martin's most recent 10-K. The first key risk to Lockheed Martin is as a result of the company's international presence (just under a third of total net sales in 2019 according to pages 14-15 of Lockheed Martin's most recent 10-K). While Lockheed Martin's international presence significantly expands its addressable market, it also subjects the company to a number of risks, such as unfavorable foreign currency translation and differing regulatory environments.Although unfavorable currency translations often are neutralized over time as the strength of the U.S. Dollar waxes and wanes, the risks of differing regulatory environments and potential sanctions being imposed on Lockheed Martin are risks that have the potential to adversely impact Lockheed Martin's financial results at any given time.Due to the variability in regulations around markets throughout the world, it is of utmost importance that Lockheed Martin invests adequately in compliance to avoid fines and penalties from the countries where it conducts its operations. It's worth noting that any modifications to existing regulations or the introduction of new regulations in key markets around the world could significantly increase Lockheed Martin's compliance costs.The next risk to Lockheed Martin is its concentration of net sales to the U.S. Government (roughly two thirds of Lockheed Martin's total net sales in 2019 per page 9 of Lockheed Martin's most recent 10-K).While I believe it is likely that U.S. defense spending will continue to steadily rise over the long-term as the need for cutting edge military technology is a relative constant, investors would be wise to remember that U.S. defense spending can vary from one presidential administration to the next, and the defense budget is contingent upon the availability of Congressional appropriations.In the event that appropriations for defense spending are limited by other priorities in the federal budget, this could result in less being allocated to defense spending, which would also limit the growth potential of Lockheed Martin going forward, possibly weighing on the company's long-term dividend growth in the process.The final risk to Lockheed Martin is the fact that the company relies on subcontractors, suppliers, and joint venture partners to meet its obligations to its customers (page 13 of Lockheed Martin's most recent 10-K).In the event that Lockheed Martin's subcontractors, suppliers, or joint venture partners fail to uphold their end of the bargain on projects, Lockheed Martin could be adversely impacted in a number of ways, including project terminations and/or reputational damage, which could unfavorably impact the company's operating results and impair its earnings power in the long-term.Although I have discussed several key risks associated with an investment in Lockheed Martin, the above discussion isn't to be interpreted as one that is complete. For a more thorough discussion of Lockheed Martin's risk profile, I would refer interested readers to pages 9-20 of Lockheed Martin's most recent 10-K, pages 50-53 of Lockheed Martin's most recent 10-Q, and my previous articles on the stock.Even though Lockheed Martin is a well-established Dividend Contender with 18 consecutive years of dividend increases, it remains important for both prospective and current shareholders to avoid overpaying for shares of Lockheed Martin to minimize the risks of a lower starting yield, valuation multiple contraction, and lower annual total return potential.This is precisely why I will be using two couple valuation metrics and a valuation model to determine the fair value of Lockheed Martin's shares.The first valuation metric that I'll utilize to arrive at a fair value for shares of Lockheed Martin is the TTM PE ratio to 13 year median TTM PE ratio.As indicated by Gurufocus, Lockheed Martin's current TTM PE ratio of 16.12 is slightly below its 13 year median TTM PE ratio of 16.33.Assuming a reversion to its 13 year median TTM PE ratio of 16.33 and a fair value of $379.02 a share, Lockheed Martin's shares are trading at a 1.3% discount to fair value and offer 1.3% upside from the current price of $374.20 a share (as of October 25, 2020). The next valuation metric that I will use to estimate the fair value of Lockheed Martin's shares is the current price to book ratio to 13 year median price to book ratio.As per Gurufocus, Lockheed Martin's current P/B ratio of 21.20 is materially lower than its 13 year median P/B ratio of 23.01.Factoring in a reversion to its 13 year median P/B ratio of 23.01 and a fair value of $406.13 a share, shares of Lockheed Martin are priced at a 7.9% discount to fair value and offer 8.5% capital appreciation from the current share price.Image Source: InvestopediaThe valuation model that I'll be utilizing to assign a fair value to shares of Lockheed Martin is the dividend discount model or DDM.The first input that goes into the DDM is the expected dividend/share, which is simply the annualized dividend/share. In the case of Lockheed Martin, that amount is $10.40 following last month's 8.3% dividend increase.The second input into the DDM is the cost of capital equity, which is the annual total return that an investor requires on their investments. Although this typically varies from one investor to the next, I require 10% annual total returns because I believe that such return levels adequately reward me for the time and effort that I put into researching investment opportunities and periodically monitoring my investments.The third input into the DDM is the annual dividend growth rate over the long-term or DGR.While the first two inputs into the DDM require only data retrieval to find the annualized dividend/share and subjectivity to set the required annual total return rate, accurately forecasting the long-term DGR requires an investor to factor in numerous variables, including a stock's payout ratios (and whether those payout ratios are positioned to expand, contract, or remain the same over the long-term), future earnings growth potential, the strength of a stock's balance sheet, and industry fundamentals.When I take into consideration that Lockheed Martin's payout ratios are in a position to slightly expand over the long-term and that the stock is likely to deliver 7.0-8.0% annual earnings growth over the next decade, I believe that my previous 7.75% annual dividend growth rate over the long-term remains justified.Upon plugging the three inputs above into the DDM, I am left with a fair value of $462.22 a share, which implies that Lockheed Martin's shares are trading at a 19.0% discount to fair value and offer 23.5% upside from the current share price.When I average the three fair values together, I compute an average fair value of $415.79 a share, which indicates that shares of Lockheed Martin are priced at a 10.0% discount to fair value and offer 11.1% capital appreciation from the current share price.Lockheed Martin's diluted EPS and FCF payout ratios remain very comfortable through the first 9 months of this fiscal year at 40.2% and 38.2%, respectively. Given the sustainability of these payout ratios, I am expecting a slight expansion over the long-term to the mid 40% range, which would allow for many more dividend increases in the years ahead that are similar to the 8% increase announced last month.Lockheed Martin's 10.1% YoY growth in revenue and 7.6% YoY growth in diluted EPS through the first 9 months of this fiscal year are a testament to the company's ability to deliver steady operating results in even the most challenging operating environments.Lockheed Martin's balance sheet has also materially improved over the past year, with its interest coverage ratio increasing from ~10.9 at this time last year to ~13.7 through the first 9 months of this fiscal year.Further bolstering the case for an investment in Lockheed Martin, is the fact that shares of the stock are currently trading at what I estimate is a 10% discount to fair value.Between its 2.8% yield, 7.0-8.0% annual earnings growth potential, and 1.1% annual valuation multiple expansion, shares of Lockheed Martin are primed to meet my 10% annual total return requirement over the next decade.It is with the foregoing points in mind that I am once again reiterating my buy rating on shares of Lockheed Martin at this time."
4380511,50291,2020-10-22T08:10:27-04:00,"Lockheed Martin continues adding contracts.We consider the $60B month-over-month decline meaningless and disfigures.Compared to the same month last year, Lockheed Martin grew its order activity during the month, according to the TAF Defense Contracts Monitor.","In June 2020, we launched the Defense Contracts Monitor on The Aerospace Forum. The Defense Contracts Monitor is an interactive dashboard that we populate weekly with new contracts awarded to Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). Currently, the monitor consists of more than 1,000 contracts, and we expand that as we are adding more companies to our coverage and update the monitor weekly.Source: Times of IsraelIn this report, I want to have a look at the order inflow for Lockheed Martin during the month of September. You can read the August report here. For this analysis, we used the TAF Defense Contracts Monitor, which we have made available to subscribers of The Aerospace Forum.Figure 1: Lockheed Martin contracts in September 2020 (Source: The Aerospace Forum)In September, Lockheed Martin was awarded 45 contracts valued at $2.6B, with funds obligated on time of award standing at $2.6B or 53%. The contrast with last month is big, but that was caused by a framework contract disclosed in August valued $62B, which gets incrementally firmed and funded.The F-35 unsurprisingly was Lockheed Martin’s main program for contract awards. The program received 6 contracts during the month valued $1.1B. The biggest contract valued $709 million provides for the procurement of materials for production Lots 15 through 17. Other F-35 contracts including engineering to further develop F-35 capabilities and contracts for F-35 support.The second biggest platform for Lockheed Martin during the month was the UGM-133 Trident II for which it received a $500 million contract for missile production for the US Navy. The UGM-133 Trident II is a submarine launched ballistic missile that has a very important role in the US nuclear triad.During the month, there were not a lot of contracts that really stood out, but there certainly were many contracts as the DoD fiscal year came to an end, and what we observed is that, while the F-35 and the Trident D5 programs raked in $1.6B in contract value, the smaller contracts raked in a total of $1B in contract value. So, we are seeing that across the portfolio Lockheed Martin is booking small wins that are adding up, and that is something I do like about this company.In September, US Navy sales accounted for almost 85% or $2.2B of the contract awards driven by the F-35 and Trident D5 contracts. The US Army and US Air Force accounted for roughly 8.4%, leaving around 6.3% for foreign customers, including Australia, Iraq, Italy, and Qatar. Funds obligated were lower at $1.4B or 53% of the contract value. Month over month, we saw contract value decline by $61.3B, but that mainly reflects the inclusion of indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts which form frameworks against which delivery orders are placed. Nevertheless, funds obligated dropped from $4.6B to 1.4B. Compared to a year ago, contract awards increased by $300 million, while funds obligated at time of award grew by ~$500 million, so we are seeing some appreciable growth there, and also in the year-to-date comparisons, we see that with $114.5B (including a $62B IDIQ contract) in contract awards and $28.4B in funds obligated versus $29.4B and $15.5B a year ago. So, you could say that the values have roughly doubled versus a year ago.During the month of September, contract awards decreased from $63.9B to $2.6B month over month, and compared to the same month last year, the increase was $300 million. The big month-over-moth difference can be attributed to the F-16 IDIQ in August, but we are actually more interested in the year-ago sales, which showed that contract awards grew in September, and the year-to-date numbers also showed very satisfying growth.What I could appreciate in September is that we saw a solid contract award stream, most notably for 2 programs in terms of value, but also the other programs showed smaller yet very important inflow. It shows the strength of the company to serve customers with a variety of products that are relevant now, but also that the company is positioning itself for the future.Lockheed Martin has now won over $100B in contracts, including IDIQs which are incrementally firmed. So, in terms of filling the backlog or the skyline, Lockheed Martin is having a strong year. Funds obligated, which shows how much cash is handed over at the time of award, were appreciable as well.I believe that, going forward, Lockheed Martin is a nice name to have in your portfolio as the company continues booking wins in a challenging geopolitical playing field. We do these kinds of contract overviews on the request of readers to keep them updated, because it is exhaustive to get all data in the right form to analyze.From these pieces, we unlikely will see our bullish view turn based on a single month, but by doing a detailed analysis on a monthly basis, we can provide readers with the most detailed insights on where Lockheed Martin is winning (or not), and we can detect trends or trend reversals in appetite for weapon system orders earlier, which, ultimately, the informed investor can benefit from."

You can read the July report here. For this analysis, we used the Defense Contracts Monitor which we have made available to subscribers of The Aerospace Forum.F-16 Lifts contract awardsFigure 1: Lockheed Martin contracts in August (Source: AeroAnalysis)In August, Lockheed Martin was awarded 16 contracts valued at $63.9B with funds obligated on time of award standing at $4.6B or 7%.By far, the biggest contract was for the F-16. Lockheed Martin was awarded a $62B indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract for the F-16. The $62B contract puts a ceiling for the procurement of F-16 aircraft, services and ammunition orders. The initial delivery order is for 90 F-16 Viper (Block 70/72) fighter jets, 66 of which are likely destined for Taiwan and the other 24 for Morocco. The contract award was discussed in more detail in a previous report emphasizing the strategic importance of the contract award for the US foreign policy as well as the F-16 backlog.Source: The Times of IsraelLockheed Martin also received a $911.7 million modification to an existing contract for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense or THAAD. The contract provides for additional development of THAAD, to support test programs and warfighter requirements. Lockheed Martin describes THAAD as Integrated Air and Missile Defense with proven Hit-to-Kill technology. The system is designed to defend against short and medium-range ballistic missiles by using the kinetic energy of an interceptor to eliminate the incoming ballistic missile by impact in the re-entry trajectory of the missile flight. The Defense Contracts Monitor shows that since 2018, Lockheed Martin has received $8.7B in contracts for the THAAD system making it one of the key missile defense programs that Lockheed Martin offers next to the Patriot and Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense. Since 2018, the Missile Defense Agency and Saudi Arabia have accounted for nearly 90% of the contract value.Source: Bharat ShaktiThe THAAD platform in terms of value was distantly followed by the MH-60 or Seahawk, which received two contracts valued at $217 million. The first contract is for the production, delivery and integration of 39 low-frequency sonars for MH-60 helicopters for India, Denmark and the US Navy. The second contract awarded on the 27th of August procures labor and hardware for developing software for Network Enabled Weapon capability for the MH-60R/S. Network Enabled Weapons have software and hardware integrations that turn so-called “dumb bombs” or free-fall bombs into precision-guided ammunition with a datalink allowing for target updates.Lockheed Martin also received notable orders for the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System launchers and from the Space Development Agency for the development of Tranch 0 satellites, which the Space Development Agency describes as follows:In August, foreign military sales accounted for almost ~97% or $62.25B of the contract awards driven by the contract for the F-16 IDIQ contract. However, the funds obligated were lower at $4.7B reflecting that the F-16 order represents a ceiling that can be filled over time. While the F-16 is prominently reflected in the August contract awards, we see that Lockheed Martin continued to add to current projects such as Aegis, THAAD and the M142 but also continues to add to projects of the future such as the Tranche 0 contract.During the month of August, contract awards increased from $17.8B to $63.9B month-over-month and compared to the same month last year the increase was $60B reflecting that the IDIQ contract for the F-16 was a welcome outlier that fits Lockheed Martin’s sales effort with the F-35 as its pinnacle product but with an important role for the F-16 to serve the needs of US allies.What I could appreciate in the August order inflow was the continued order inflow for programs such as the F-35, F-16, MH142, Aegis and more. It shows that Lockheed Martin keeps winning in all parts of its product portfolio. We see that next to the F-35, the F-16 still has an important role and we are also seeing that Lockheed Martin is winning contracts for the future such as Network Enabled Weapon capability and data connectivity contracts.It shows the strength of the company to serve customers with a variety of products that are relevant now, but also that the company is positioning itself for the future where smart weapons and low latency data connectivity are going to play a bigger role making weapon systems smarter and more interconnected than they already are today.Lockheed Martin has now won around $30B in contracts in the first half of 2020 and Q3 already is an $80B+ quarter. So in terms of filling the backlog or the skyline, Lockheed Martin is having a strong year and even stronger third quarter. Funds obligated, which shows how much cash is handed over at the time of award, stood at $4.6B for the month which is almost $2B higher compared to last month and $3.1B higher compared to the same month last year.I believe that going forward Lockheed Martin is a nice name to have in your portfolio as the company continues booking wins in a challenging geopolitical playing field.

Helped by strong demand for the F-35, which accounted for $7 billion in total new orders, the F-35 team also reported key accomplishments. That includes around $1 billion in combined sustainment and development awards.Lockheed reported higher net sales of around $700 million for the F-35 program. Profits from the program increased by around $130 million.On Aug. 14, Lockheed announced it won a $62 billion 10-year contract from the U.S. Air Force for F-16 fighter jets. By selling the jets to foreign countries and performing the working primarily on U.S. soil – Greenville, S.C., and Fort Worth, Texas – this firm is a job creator for the country.Lockheed completed the Sentinel A4 Radar Program preliminary design review in Q2. It also delivered the AN/TPQ-53 radar system to the U.S. army. Its development in the radar space is one of the reasons I follow RADA Electronic Industries (RADA), another aerospace and defense firm based in Israel. Still, investors may want to compare Lockheed’s prospects to bigger firms.They are listed below, along with the SA author score:Source: SA PremiumBelow: Lockheed shares barely moved in the year-to-date period:Lockheed’s President & Chief Executive Officer, James Taiclet, said, “both the Sentinel A4 and the TPQ-53 are part of Lockheed Martin's open scalable radar architecture, the cornerstone of each of these systems design, which allows for upgrades that will not only extend the lives of the radars but evolve their capabilities over the next 40 or so years.”Investors should not ignore the major advancements in Lockheed’s radar technology. For example, the TPQ-53 “locates and tracks enemy indirect fire, neither a 360 degree or a 90-degree mode.” The firm is currently producing around 190 units worth $1.6 billion.Investors may have knocked a few points from Lockheed’s stock in recent days ahead of the upcoming U.S. elections. Yet the oil sector and drug store may become a battleground for the debates. The budget environment for defence spending over the next few years is not likely to change. Even if it did, Lockheed may adjust its operating costs, just as Raytheon did by cutting costs.Furthermore, Lockheed has a backlog of $150 billion in equipment and services. Customer needs will not change and are already contractual commitments. LMT’s stock dipping below the $400 level suggests that markets are once again forgetting about this company’s strong prospects. For example, Lockheed is expecting double-digit growth for its F-35. Production in the high single digits in the last quarter is better than management expected.Margins may rise, even as capital expenditure increases. With around $8 billion in cash on hand expected this year, the firm may spend at comfortable levels on research and development. Plus, Lockheed will maintain its dividend. The CEO said, “w e're committed to the dividend, there's absolutely no question. That is our priority. And we don't see that changing in the future.”In a 5-year discounted cash flow model, assume revenue grows by around 10% annually.Model courtesy of finboxSavvy investors may tweak the metrics and growth assumptions on finbox and come up with a different price target.With my metrics, as shown above, LMT stock is worth nearly $500.00. The 8% discount rate would account for the company's stable business over the years. It also assumes interest rates unchanged over the next 2-3 years. Lockheed recently demonstrated strong revenue growth and a backlog, supporting a perpetuity growth rate of 4% in this model.Simplywall.st's fair value on Lockheed stock is slightly more optimistic:Data courtesy of simplywall.stThe three-week-long technology stock correction may pull the aerospace and defense sector lower.

The U.S. - China trade war, trouble with Russia, and the ever-worrying state of the Middle East. Now we have a pandemic and recession as well.In all of these it's good to have a company like Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). First, it's working each and every day to keep the Western World, and some other countries, safe. Second, when stuff is risky out there, it usually means more business for this company.Data by YChartsAnd more business it has certainly been! Over the last five years the stock has gone from $203 to the current level of $386.81, which equals a return of 91% -- before dividends. That is 13.8% on average per year and adding in the approximate yield of 2%, we arrive at around 16% per year. Pretty nice performance for such a defensive (pun intended!) and solid company.Historical Dividend GrowthNow, back in the old days, things weren't all rosy. This meant that the fundamentals were not in place to offer steady annual dividend growth. But a few years into this century things got solid enough for Lockheed to confidently increase its dividend every year. The company has now upped its dividend for 17 straight years.Ten years ago the dividend stood at $0.63 per share per quarter. It now stands at $2.40. That's a full 14% increase per year on average. That is, quite frankly, amazing dividend growth for such a large and solid company like this. Good things don't last forever, though, and the growth rate has come down significantly lately. Last year it was hiked by 9% and 10% the year before that. So it is slowing, but still growing robustly.Data by YChartsSo as we have already been commenting on, the dividend is reliably growing every year, if only a little bit more slowly now than before. The payout-ratio has been all over the place -- from a low of 40% to a high of well above 100%. The high number was due to one-offs so I don't place too much emphasis on that. I'm happy to see that the company is now back to its more normal level of just above 40%.In my opinion a payout-ratio of about 40% is very conservative for a company like this. It has a lot of long-term contracts with predictable earnings and an increasing defense-budget as far as the eye can see. Yet, the company needs to retain a good chunk of cash for research and development in order to stay ahead of the competition. Everything below 50% is very comfortable in my book.September Dividend HikeThe Board of Lockheed has had a habit of announcing the new and higher dividend in the end of September each year. We're getting close to that date now, so it's time to assess what kind of dividend growth investors can expect. This being an odd year or not, Lockheed Martin is sure firing on all cylinders! It had nothing short of a blowout quarter. Earnings per share climbed by 22% and most divisions were growing well into the double digits. It also raised its 2020 EPS guidance to $23.75-$24.25.Furthermore, the longer term future also looks bright, being backed up by an ever-increasing backlog. This spring, the U.S. Department of Defense awarded the company yet another order for 78 new F-35 fighter jets. A couple of years ago there was big news when its order backlog reached $100 billion. So what has it grown to now? In its Q2 financial tables we can see that it grew to $144 billion by year end 2019 and to a full $150 billion by the end of June 2020. That is a 50% larger order book than only three years ago. A large and growing order book makes for a solid foundation for this company going forward.So back to the current year: As we can see on pages 3 and 4 of its earnings report, it expects cash flow from operations to exceed $8 billion while the quarterly dividend payout was $671 million. On an annualized rate that equals a payout ratio to cash flow from operations of 33.6%. If you annualize and deduct the last quarter's capital expenditure number, the payout ratio to cash flow will still not be higher than 50%. The point is, there is a lot of room to hike the dividend.If it hits the middle of the target range, that is $24 of earning per share, the current payout ratio would be 40%. In a pandemic year there is no reason to go all out on a limb and offer investors more than they expect. On the other hand, when operations are as solid as they are, investors should be rewarded. On balance, this argues in favor of consistency. That is, keep the increase pretty much in line with recent years.In recent years the growth rate has been pretty steady around the 10% mark, with a notable down-tick last year to 9%. If it were to be raised by a round number, like last year, of $0.20, that would entail a percentage-wise growth of 8.3% -- too low. The next round number would be too high as a hike of $0.30 would mean a 12.5% hike. That hasn't happened for many years. My prediction is therefore for a hike of $0.25 to $2.65 per share per quarter. This would translate into a 10.4% dividend growth rate and a payout-ratio of 44%. Pretty much in line with historical precedent and within a conservative payout ratio.Risk FactorsA major risk is that there are few and powerful customers -- governments. These can push price by playing up competition but also use other tools like risk of regulation in other business areas. Another risk is all the politics involved, projects can be shelved or changed or some late night deal can change the budget allocation, hurting Lockheed Martin in the process. Another risk is that a lot of countries are increasingly trying to build up their own defense industries, which increases competition. For instance, India has a goal of becoming self-reliant within defense manufacturing. Russia is trying to sell its technology and systems to a lot of the same countries as Lockheed Martin, Turkey is a recent case in point. In Africa, Russia is a fierce competitor to U.S. companies. A Russian advantage is that it doesn't have to care as much as U.S. companies about human rights, thus they are able to sell to shady regimes that Lockheed might be precluded from. Litigation is of course also a risk to consider.Lockheed Martin is a well-established global player with a nice growth rate. On the face of it, it looks like a good investment. However, all astute investors know that even great companies can turn out to be sub-par investments if you pay too much for it. So to that end, I'll compare the company to two peers. As peers I've chosen Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) and Raytheon (NYSE:RTX). As for the latter, it's important to remember that the merger with United Technologies was completed earlier this year. As such, the company is somewhat different from the old Raytheon people may be familiar with.Source: MorningstarThe Price/Sales category is won by Raytheon with Lockheed and Northrop Grumman tied. As for Price/Earnings the picture is changed quite a bit as Raytheon is the loser of that category. Lockheed Martin comes in at second place, barely beaten by Northrop. The pretty juicy dividend yield of Raytheon at 3.1% wins the dividend yield category. Again, Lockheed comes in second place with Northrop the loser.I don't think you will go wrong with any of these companies. However, even though Raytheon has the most appealing dividend, I would consider Lockheed and Northrop the most interesting, with a good combination of a fairly conservative P/E ratio and nice dividends.As for Lockheed Martin, over the next three years, Wall Street analysts expect this company to turn out an average annual EPS growth rate of 9.5%. If we assume no change to the fairly conservative P/E multiple and add in the dividend yield of 2.5%, we arrive at an expected total annual shareholder return of 12.0%. That is a very good number in my book, considering the great defensible qualities of this company, lately exemplified by the stellar performance in the middle of a pandemic.Conservative dividend growth investors who seek a sweet balance between current income and the steady robust growth of that income should add Lockheed Martin at these levels.Lockheed Martin has been working hard defending the Western world, all while sending an ever-increasing dividend check to its investors. This has been going on for 17 years and will not stop now. Even a pandemic can't stop this company growing. The dividend will be increased by more than 10% in late September, growing the incomes of loyal investors. It looks like this company will continue to grow robustly for many more years. This is a nice set-up for conservative dividend growth investors who seek a nice current income as well as the knowledge that this income will grow robustly for many more years. Investors buying today can expect to earn total returns of approximately 12% over the coming three years."
4377069,22889,2020-09-30T16:47:09-04:00,"Lockheed Martin has a long track record of rewarding shareholders via share buybacks and dividend growth.The company recently raised dividends by 8.3% and added an additional $1.6 billion to its share buyback program.Some investors are worried that military spending might decline in the future, perhaps restricting the company's ability to grow further - especially with a Democrat Presidential win.I argue that both sides of the aisle are hawkish towards China and Lockheed Martin will continue to grow regardless of who is President in 2021.","On September 25th, 2020, Lockheed Martin (LMT) authorized a fourth quarter 2020 dividend of $2.60 per share, an 8.3% increase over the previous dividend. Moreover, the company expanded its share buyback program by $1.3 billion, raising the total authorized to $3 billion.This represents an increased commitment to distribute cash back to Lockheed Martin shareholders in multiple ways. As of Friday's close, this brings Lockheed Martin's forward dividend yield to 2.69%. The share buyback program now represents just under 3% of LMT's market cap.These developments extend the tradition of dividend growth, with LMT's 5 and 10 year dividend CAGR at 10.39% and 14.42% respectively. Over the past 15 years, LMT's number of shares outstanding has declined by just under 200 million.Overall, since the mid 2000s I'd say this is a very shareholder friendly company. The question is, will this continue?Data by YChartsData by YChartsI believe Lockheed Martin stock is under pressure because people are concerned that a Joe Biden presidency would lead to China-friendly and globalist policies and a smaller military budget.To examine this, I'll first look at history.The post cold-war period was one in which US military spending as a percent of GDP declined. On a dollar-basis, however, it essentially remained flat from 1990 ($306b) to 2000 ($302b). If you adjust for inflation, this is quite a significant dollar decline in military spending.Source: MacrotrendsOne would naturally think that this post cold-war period would have been one of the worst times to be a Lockheed Martin investor. From January 2, 1990 to December 31, 1999, the stock provided an annualized total return of 10.43% (including reinvested dividends).Source: dqydj.comWhile 10.43% annualized is a solid return, it is below LMT's average between January 2, 1990 to today, which is 15.3%. During the 1990s Lockheed Martin underperformed bellwether stocks like IBM (IBM) (27.51% annualized), GE (GE) (54.55% annualized) and Procter & Gamble (PG) (32.22% annualized).One can conclude that Lockheed Martin stock was affected by the relative decline in military spending after the cold war ended, but this was not fatal to LMT's stock price.Could the same thing happen from January 2021 (post inauguration) to January 2031? That's what many investors seem to be pricing into LMT stock, if Biden wins the Whitehouse, as indicated by the recent flat performance.Some investors believe US military spending will decline in the future. This clearly poses a risk to defense contractors in general, including Lockheed Martin.A further risk to LMT is that the composition of defense spending changes. The aeronautics segment accounted for 40% of Lockheed Martin's 2019 revenues. The F-35 program alone represented 27% of Lockheed Martin's net sales in 2019 and is expected to rise in future years, according to company filings. If US military spending shifts away from aircraft in general - or specifically the F-35 program - this could have a material impact on Lockheed Martin's revenues.However, I have to disagree with this view. I believe military spending will continue to grow well into the future as 1) America requires a strong military to dominate global geopolitics in order to maintain reserve currency status, and 2) America seeks to contain China's expansive intentions - both economically and territorially.This is the one issue that seems to unite Americans, both Republican and Democrat. While some investors expect a Democrat win would lead to cuts in military spending, I don't believe this to be the case. Indeed, a July 2020 article by The Diplomat outlines Biden's hardening stance on China:In general, I believe the tenor of relations with China has shifted significantly as diplomats and politicians increasingly realize that China is playing by its own rules. I don't see this as a Republican vs. Democrat issue. After all, over the past few decades we've had both sides of the aisle try to form a strategic economic relationship with China. Now members of both parties are recognizing the failures of this policy. Some came to the realization sooner than others. But I believe that if there's one thing Americans now agree on it's that China is more of a strategic competitor than ally.The article continues:In all likelihood, attitudes towards China quickly shifted after China's response to COVID-19, its hostile takeover of Hong Kong and recent detention of Canadian citizens. I think neither Republicans nor Democrats can afford to be seen as soft on China, because I believe Americans are uniting around the idea that China is a competitor on every front and voters will not accept weakness. A new cold war is brewing.As President Roosevelt famously said, ""speak softly and carry a big stick"". In other words, geopolitics must be backed up by a strong military. With a cold war comes hot investment in military equipment, like the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II and F22 Raptor. Consequently, it is reasonable to assume that military spending will remain strong over the next several years as American seeks to contain China's expansion. As one of America's leading defense contractors, Lockheed Martin - in addition to Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Raytheon Technologies (RTX) - should be a chief beneficiary of such spending.This is all a long way to say that I believe Lockheed Martin will continue to grow revenues - and in turn, cash flows and dividends - over the next several years. Further underscoring this is LMT's huge $150b order backlog.Since many investors are underestimating Lockheed Martin's potential, I believe it is a good value. Currently LMT trades at under 17x forward earnings and at a discount to fair value, based on the following (relatively conservative) assumptions:- 8% discount rate- 5% annual revenue growth- 15% EBITDA/Revenue- 3.5% terminal growth rate- Capex at 3% of revenues- Net working capital of 4.6% of revenues- Depreciation at 1.9% of revenues- 26% tax rateSource: Finbox.comWhile I concur that there are reasons to be concerned about Lockheed Martin's future, my opinion is that they have a low probability of materializing. First, as I previously stated, I believe America is growing increasingly united behind a cold war with China, which will result in increased military spending. Second, military posturing in far-away lands requires a strong air presence, which should benefit Lockheed Martin. I think the $150 billion backlog more-or-less supports this view. Consequently, Lockheed Martin is worthy of further investigation by long-term dividend growth investors.Note: If you are interested in dividend growth investing, please hit the follow button and leave a comment below!"
4371991,22889,2020-09-01T16:40:42-04:00,"Government military spending will continue to grow, due to the geopolitical situation and need to preserve US dollar dominance.Lockheed Martin is a fairly recession-proof company and should continue to grow over time.At 17x earnings, Lockheed Martin is attractively valued and is only slightly above the long-run average for the S&P 500.Lockheed Martin provides an attractive dividend that has grown considerably over time.","According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute 2020 Fact Sheet (for 2019) SIPRI Military Expenditure Database the world spends $2 trillion per year on defense. That's a lot of money. Of course, much of that goes to logistics, personnel, energy, etc. However, a significant portion is used to buy weapons and equipment.With a new cold-war emerging between China and the United States, investment in defense should at least maintain its current share of overall budgets. Beyond rising tensions, defense spending is intertwined with economic dominance. US dollar hegemony requires a strong military. For the United States, military spending is the expense of the exorbitant privilege that comes from having the world's reserve currency. Perhaps someday another currency takes its place, but not without the emergence of a better alternative. Today, there is none. Indeed, this is one of the reasons the US seeks to contain the rise of China's geopolitical power. For these reasons, US defense companies are joined at the hip with the US government, providing support for defense contractors like Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrup Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD). Lockheed Martin in particular derives over 70% of its revenue from the US government.Source: Lockheed MartinI realize the video above is meant as a marketing tool, but I still think it provides a summary of what the company is doing. Widely recognized for its F-35 program, Lockheed Martin provides a vast range of aeronautics, missiles and fire control, rotary and missions systems and space solutions to governments around the world.LMT continues to capture new defense spending. The benefits of military spending have accrued to LMT, with annual revenues growing by about 33% over the past decade. Of course, LMT doesn't match the hyper-growth trajectory of companies like Tesla (TSLA) or Facebook (FB), but that's OK. Companies like Lockheed Martin are the meat and potatoes of the investing world. Unexciting but satisfying. Nevertheless, Lockheed Martin's $144 billion order backlog can buy you a lot of meat and potatoes.Looking closer at the most recent quarters and the 2008/09 Global Financial Crisis it becomes apparent that LMT is fairly recession-proof. Revenues have continued to grow despite the Covid-19 recession. This type of revenue performance has awarded unrelated companies like Apple (AAPL) with 40x p/e multiples. Meanwhile, LMT is trading at 17 times earnings. (Of course, Apple and Lockheed Martin are completely different companies in totally different industries, but I couldn't help but note the difference. Especially now while stable/growing revenues are so precious. The main reason for this particular valuation gap is the assumption that AAPL will continue to grow as it has over the past decade. Will it? I'll save that discussion for another article.)This isn't the LMT vs AAPL show, but for illustration purposes it's helpful to point out how p/e expansion has priced many stocks out of reach for value investors. Meanwhile, companies like Lockheed Martin trade at p/e multiples close to where they were a year ago.For comparison purposes only, the divergence between AAPL and LMT valuations - which were once equal - has grown quite wide. In an environment where the broad market trades at a 30x p/e multiple (see chart below), LMT (being only slightly above the long-run average of 15.81) appears cheap.Source: MultplOne of the reasons LMT's multiple remains reasonable is that it hasn't participated in the massive big-tech growth rally since the March 2020 low, underperforming both the S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100. Instead, LMT's performance has fallen more in line with traditional industrial sectors. The contrast though is that the revenues of most industrial companies have been hammered by the economic crisis, while the revenues of Lockheed Martin have not.As a dividend investor, what I particularly like about LMT is its commitment to returning cash to shareholders by growing its dividend over time. Over the past 5 years, LMT has grown its dividend by 10.39% annualized. A decade ago, LMT paid a quarterly dividend of $0.63/share. Today it pays $2.40/share, providing investors who bought 10 years ago a 14% yield on cost. It's one thing to grow dividends, but it's another to grow dividends sustainably. I believe dividend growth sustainability requires revenue growth and ample dividend coverage. Given this, I believe Lockheed Martin's dividend is fairly secure for two main reasons:1. Given the geopolitical backdrop, revenues should continue to grow.2. Operating cash flows adequately cover debt repayments, share repurchases and dividends.I'll add a 2a: I think as long as the US government is posturing in a cold war, all branches of the military-industrial complex must appear strong. Although this is pure speculation, I couldn't foresee the US government - under today's conditions - not do everything in its power to support the strength of LMT's balance sheet and cash flows. That includes its dividend. How? I don't know, but where there's the political will there's a way. In my opinion, the long term case for Lockheed Martin is strong. Unfortunately, the world is far from a peaceful utopia so defense spending should continue to rise. Also, I believe today's prices (and valuation) are an attractive entry point for Lockheed Martin shares. Finally, for long term dividend growth investors I believe LMT presents a compelling case as it has a demonstrated history of growing its payout and has the revenue growth and financial muscle to continue doing so. Given these points, Lockheed Martin could very well be a buy-and-hold forever dividend growth stock."

The company is proving to be highly resilient during the global pandemic. In fact, Lockheed Martin managed to report solid Q2 results despite fears of underperformance. All of Lockheed Martin's major business segments grew on a Y/Y basis during the quarter.Lockheed Martin is clearly strengthening its position as the leading defense contractor. Not only is Lockheed Martin posting strong financials, but the company is also increasing its exposure to promising high-tech industries. Lockheed Martin has much to look forward to even in this tough environment.Lockheed Martin has performed surprisingly well over the past few quarters.Source: YChartsLockheed Martin has a track record of strong financial performance. The company continues to perform well both financially and operationally despite COVID-19. In Q2, the company reported net earnings of $1.6 billion and generated $2.2 billion in cash from operations. Lockheed Martin now has an enormous backlog of $150.3 billion, making it one of the safest and most promising companies in the entire industry.Despite coronavirus-related disruptions, Lockheed Martin still managed to experience impressive growth in its major business segments. The company's Aeronautics, MFC, Space, and RMS segments grew 17%, 16%, 6%, and 7% respectively. What's more, Lockheed Martin raised its entire outlook for 2020 as a result of its strong performance.Lockheed Martin notably increased its sales and segment operating profits despite the economic downturn.Source: Lockheed MartinLockheed Martin continues to position itself at the forefront of many promising new industries. The company is making notable strides in the incredibly promising space segment. The industry is opening up like never before with companies like SpaceX (SPACE) pushing the boundaries of space technology.ULA (United Launch Alliance), which is a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing (BA), recently won a multi-billion-dollar Pentagon contract to launch national security space missions. Although ULA is splitting this contract with SpaceX, the launch industry is large enough to accommodate multiple players. The space industry is also growing at an incredible pace, which makes Lockheed Martin space business one of its most promising in the long term.Lockheed Martin's core businesses are also stronger than ever. In fact, Lockheed Martin just won a $62 billion 10-year contract for F-16 fighter jets. The company also booked $7 billion in quarterly orders for its F-35 products alone in its latest quarter. Lockheed Martin's core business and presence in emerging sectors place the company in a great position over the long term.Lockheed Martin's space business will likely grow rapidly moving forward.Source: Lockheed MartinRising geopolitical tensions, especially between the US and China, will add an additional layer of uncertainty and volatility to Lockheed Martin. In fact, China recently announced that it will sanction Lockheed Martin as a result of arms sales to Taiwan. As the conflict over trade and territorial claims escalate, Lockheed Martin could be put in an increasingly tough situation.On the other hand, rising global geopolitical tensions could help bolster Lockheed Martin's demand as government defense spending grows around the world. Given Lockheed Martin's role as a key global supplier of defense technologies, the company could see upside as tensions around the world escalate.Lockheed Martin is one of the most stable and best-performing companies in the defense space. Despite a global pandemic, Lockheed Martin has managed to experience growth in all of its major businesses. Lockheed Martin still has upside at its current market capitalization of $110 billion and forward P/E ratio of 16."

Image Source: Lockheed Martin Corporation – Second Quarter of Fiscal 2020 IR Earnings Presentation Our favorite defense contractor is Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) as we like its focus on fiscal discipline, its stable cash flows, its operational prowess, its nice dividend, and its promising growth outlook. Additionally, shares of LMT yield ~2.5% as of this writing and Lockheed Martin's per share quarterly payout has grown by roughly four-fold since 2009. The firm’s biggest growth driver for the foreseeable future is its F-35 jet fighter, though please note Lockheed Martin also has a major helicopter business after completing its purchase of Sikorsky Aircraft in November 2015. In this article, we will cover why we like Lockheed Martin and how we arrived at our fair value estimate of $432 per share of LMT.During the initial phases of the coronavirus (‘COVID-19’) pandemic, Lockheed Martin was able to continue churning out meaningful free cash flows, defined as net operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Over the first half of fiscal 2020 (period ended June 28, 2020), Lockheed Martin generated $3.9 billion in free cash flow, up 38% year-over-year. Lockheed Martin paid $1.4 billion covering its dividend obligations and another $1.0 billion repurchasing its stock during this period. Its net debt load shrank from $11.1 billion (inclusive of short-term debt) at the end of fiscal 2019 (period ended December 31, 2019) down to $9.8 billion (inclusive of short-term debt) as of June 28, 2020.This strong performance is not an outlier, but part of a longer-term trend in the company’s financial and operational performance. Lockheed Martin has posted solid revenue growth on a GAAP basis over the past few fiscal years as you can see in the upcoming graphic below.Image Shown: Lockheed Martin has steadily grown its annual GAAP revenues each fiscal year from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2019. Image Source: Data from Lockheed Martin’s Fiscal 2019 Annual Report, chart made by ValuentumAs Lockheed Martin’s top line continues to grow on the back of rising F-35 deliveries, which grew from 66 deliveries in fiscal 2017 (period ended December 31, 2017) to 134 deliveries in fiscal 2019 (period ended December 31, 2019), management did a solid job controlling costs. Revenue growth combined with cost containment efforts and growing economies of scale helped drive Lockheed Martin’s GAAP operating margin higher during this period as you can see in the upcoming graphic down below.Image Shown: Lockheed Martin’s GAAP operating margin has steadily climbed higher over the past few fiscal years. Image Source: Data from Lockheed Martin’s Fiscal 2019 Annual Report, chart made by ValuentumAs it concerns equity valuation, we are big believers that the true value of equities is entirely based on expectations of the company in question’s future free cash flows, discounted at the appropriate rate (the weighted-average cost of capital). The purpose of analyzing a company’s historical financial performance is to get an idea of how the firm might perform in the future. Backward-looking ambiguous metrics like trailing twelve-month P/E ratios do not provide any insight into a company’s true valuation or intrinsic value. Even forward P/E ratios fall short, as that only captures the firm’s expected performance over a one-year period, though most of the intrinsic value of equities comes from the mid-cycle (Year 6-Year 20) and perpetuity (Year 21+) business phases which we will cover in just a moment.Based on our discounted free cash flow analysis, Lockheed Martin has a fair value estimate of $432 per share. In the upcoming graphic down below, we highlight the key valuation assumptions used in our enterprise cash flow models to derive that figure. Please note that our net debt figure takes the funded status of Lockheed Martin’s pension plan into account, and furthermore, that most of the intrinsic value of LMT comes from Year 6+ (with the forecasted discounted free cash flows from Year 1-Year 5 representing roughly one-quarter of the total intrinsic value of its equity). To read more about enterprise cash flow models and discounted free cash flow analysis, please check out our book Value Trap (we recently published a second edition that includes our commentary regarding COVID-19 and equity markets, among other things).Image Shown: Our fair value estimate for Lockheed Martin stands at $432 per share. Image Source: ValuentumShould Lockheed Martin outperform these assumptions, the top end of our fair value estimate range for LMT sits at $529 per share. That will depend in large part on the trajectory of US defense spending, which we want to stress has been resilient over the past several decades regardless of which political party is in control.During Lockheed Martin’s latest earnings report, the firm boosted its full-year guidance for fiscal 2020 as you can see in the upcoming graphic down below. In particular, Lockheed Martin’s ‘Aeronautics’ unit has performed very well of late, which is expected to generate about two-fifths of the firm’s operating profit this fiscal year.Image Shown: We appreciate management’s confidence in Lockheed Martin’s near-term performance, especially given the harrowing times the world is currently facing due to COVID-19.

Farther out, Lockheed Martin’s $150.3 billion total backlog as of June 28, 2020, supports its medium-term outlook.Lockheed Martin is a high-quality company with a nice dividend to boot. Its business model is well-positioned to ride out the storm caused by COVID-19 while keeping its growth trajectory and financials intact. We see the company offering investors a combination of capital appreciation and dividend growth upside."
4370507,50291,2020-08-25T09:30:18-04:00,Lockheed Martin added an importing IDIQ contract for the C-130J valued at $15B.Smaller but also very important contracts were for the Hellfire missiles and F-35.2020 contract awards reach $47.7B of which $22.2B was obligated at award.,"Recently, we launched the Defense Contracts Monitor that we populate weekly with new contracts awarded to Boeing ( BA) and Lockheed Martin ( LMT). Currently the monitor consists of more than 600 contracts and we are working on quickly expanding the number of years and contracts covered in the monitor but also expanding toward other companies in the defense industry. With market sentiment turning negative for commercial aircraft, we saw more interest in the defense side and that triggered me to relaunch defense coverage including names such as Lockheed Martin, and we are aiming to expand that going forward.Source: Wallpaper AbyssLockheed Martin has been one of the names I wrote about earlier. Since then, shares of Lockheed Martin gained almost 68% vs. 50% for the S&P 500. Unfortunately due to local regulations I'm not allowed to own shares of Lockheed Martin, but names like Lockheed Martin are the kind of names I really would like to be a core holding in my portfolio. In this report, I want to have a look at the order inflow for Lockheed Martin during the month of July. You can read the June report here. For this analysis, we used the newly-developed Defense Contracts Monitor  which we have made available to subscribers of The Aerospace Forum.Note from Author: Boeing recently changed the way it reports orders and deliveries. As a result, we had to rework the way the data is loaded into our databases which resulted in the monthly reports for Boeing, Airbus and Lockheed Martin (LMT) to be delayed.Figure 1: Lockheed Martin contracts in July (Source: AeroAnalysis)In July, Lockheed Martin was awarded 16 contracts valued $17.8B with funds obligated on time of award standing at $2.6B or 15%.By far the biggest contract was for the C-130 platform. Lockheed Martin was awarded a $15,000,000,000 indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract for C-130J development, integration, retrofit and production activities for all C-130J variants. The contract provides flexibility to accommodate the broad enterprise of activities associated with the C-130J program. The contract award does not mean that the company has been handed $15B in cash, but serves as a contract vehicle allowing the US Air Force to fund procurement and support items against that $15B IDIQ contract.The C-130J is the newest version of the Hercules, which first flew in 1996, is used for military transport as well as air-to-air refueling missions, making it a highly-capable aircraft. Currently the US Air Force has 132 C130J aircraft in service with another 18 on order. Source: Alpha CodersLockheed Martin also received three contracts for the F-35 with a combined value of $1.9 billion:Source: hereAnother big contract was the $702.9 million contract from the US Army for the AGM-114 Hellfire. The Hellfire missile is the primary 100-pound (45 kg) class air-to-ground precision weapon for the armed forces of the United States and many other nations. At a unit cost of $70,000, the contract would allow for the manufacturing of more than 10,000 missiles.In July, foreign military sales accounted for almost ~84% or $15B of the contract awards driven by the contract for the C-130. The US accounted for 16% of the contracted value but part of the $15B contract is likely also contracted on behalf of the US Air Force. month-over-month contracts awards jumped by $14.6B driven by the C-130 contract bringing the 2020 contract awards to almost $47.7B of which $22.2B was obligated at award.During the month we saw contract awards increase. Overall, what I'm liking about Lockheed Martin is the consistency in winning contracts around $15B in Q1 and also roughly $15B in Q2 and Q3 should be an even stronger quarter as contracts are being awarded before the DoD fiscal year ends. Lockheed Martin has a highly versatile product line up and that showed with fighter jet contracts, contracts for the C-130 and Hellfire missiles. There are a lot of platforms that Lockheed Martin can book wins for. The F-35 had its problems and still has high operation costs, but its importance to Lockheed Martin is clear. I believe that going forward Lockheed Martin is a nice name to have in your portfolio, even though Dutch Law does not allow me to put the money where my mouth is."
4365139,24443,2020-08-06T09:23:04-04:00,"Lockheed Martin is an important aerospace and defense company that should also end up as a major space exploration contractor.LMT has a strong dividend that it appears capable of continuing to grow, which should become a desirable distinguishing characteristic.The company's F-35 program continues to ramp and be a major source of nearly guaranteed government purchasing into the next decade.LMT's position as one of a few crucial major American aerospace and defense contractors effectively makes the company systemically important.","Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is a global aerospace company that primarily sells its products to the U.S. Department of Defense and other U.S. federal government agencies. The U.S. government makes up about 70% of Lockheed's sales, with the bulk of the remainder coming from wealthy allied nations. In addition to its fighter aircraft, Lockheed also sells helicopters, missiles, fire control systems, as well as space systems.All of these businesses continue to perform well for Lockheed, and the company has been able to continue growing its sales and earnings within 2020. Lockheed's products are essential, and their primary buyer is likely to continue wanting more aerospace and defense products for the foreseeable future. Further, the essential nature of Lockheed's business makes it likely that the government would back the company, which should support its equity and bond pricing.Lockheed Martin increased its dividend in each of the last 18 years and currently has a five-year dividend growth rate of about 10 percent. Lockheed's dividend is roughly 40% of its annualized earnings, which is fairly well covered and which should allow the company to continue incremental increases in the coming years in proportion to the earnings growth.Beyond Lockheed's growing dividend, the company also has a history of repurchasing shares. The dividend tends to be less than half current free cash flow, and the dividend plus the repurchase plan generally combine to equal about two-thirds of free cash flow.Lockheed has done a decent job of accelerating its repurchase plan during moments of market weakness over the last several years, which sometimes helps the company continue to raise its dividend on the remaining shares without having a significant change to the total amount of dollars it distributes.(Source: LMT Q2 earnings presentation)All this means Lockheed has a continuing high probability of being able to pay its dividend and continue to increase it. When Lockheed reported its Q2 numbers in July, the company noted that its total dividend plus buybacks for the quarter were 51% of free cash flow and that it would have no change in its cash deployment strategy going forward. That strategy seems to include 10% annual dividend increases, and I believe that is highly probable going forward.Last month, Lockheed Martin reported an increased 2020 sales and profit outlook. Though the guide was not a significant change from prior outlook, the improved expectations are comforting. (Source: LMT Q2 earnings presentation)Lockheed increased its midpoint sales outlook by about $1.1 billion, and the increase was spread across aeronautics, space, and rotary & missions. This indicates strength in many of the company's business segments and a continued diversity of revenue streams. (Source: LMT Q2 earnings presentation)Further, space is now a serious portion of Lockheed's business, accounting for about $11.5 billion in revenue, and over $1.1 billion in annual profit. Other highlights from the earnings report include that the company increased its total midpoint profit expectations by $100 million, and Lockheed commented that its backlog was now greater than $150 billion.Lockheed did have to slow down its production of F-35s due to Covid-19-related changes to operations, and also due to supply chain disruptions, but demand for the product continues to be strong. There were hopes that Lockheed would have the capacity to make about 141 F-35s in 2020 and 160 in 2021, but it now looks more likely to be in the 120-130 production range for 2020. These aircraft cost about 94 million (F-35A) and $122 million (F-35B) per fighter.Lockheed's older F-16 fighter program also continues to be a source of revenue through both new sales, maintenance and major upgrading programs. These aircraft are mostly bought and upgraded internationally. Nations such as Greece, Slovakia, and Bahrain are within the F-16 program.While less substantial and also selling to clients whose default risk is greater than the U.S., these defense programs are generally seen as essential by the sovereign states, so they are likely to pay up. All of these aircraft eventually require complicated servicing, modifications, retrofitting, and maintenance. Lockheed builds sticky multi-decade relationships with the sale of these aircraft.Also last month, the U.S. approved Japan's planned purchasing of 105 F-35 joint strike fighters.Lockheed Martin is a major space contractor. The company will make over $11 billion in revenue in 2020 from contracts related to space launches, satellites and spacecraft development. Lockheed is also the prime contractor building NASA's Orion spacecraft, which is designed for long-duration, human deep space exploration.Lockheed Martin is likely to be one of the best situated companies to capitalize upon outer space development over the next several decades. Lockheed already provides systems for governments and corporations to manage space assets, including battle management systems for avoiding space debris.Lockheed's deep defense and NASA connections will likely provide it with several opportunities within space exploration and protection. These markets have the potential to become considerably larger businesses than terrestrial aerospace and defense. Lockheed's existing security clearance is likely to make it a preferred contractor by decision makers.Lockheed Martin is already the prime contractor building NASA's Orion, a spacecraft designed for long-duration, human deep space exploration. Orion is part of a larger base camp development program that will be deployed over the next decade. (Source: Lockheed Martin Corporation website)European orders may slow in the coming quarters. Germany chose to not buy the F-35, and that decision was likely primarily because it wants to support a European effort to produce a new competitive fighter plane. Europe will have its Eurofighter again, which reduces the likelihood of new contracts with certain European nations.Former versions of the Eurofighter Typhoon were competitive, and the next generation could develop into a competitive threat in new markets, but especially within Europe. Despite this threat, the Eurofighter is unlikely to be a near-term concern and it is possible the whole project will fail. I believe the F-35 program already has sufficient support to keep it a success, but also plenty of international support to help increase the margins. Operational efficiencies may make the F-35A cost similar to the F-16V, which should keep it competitive too.Another concern is that Russia's S-400 air defense system might be superior or at least comparable to Lockheed's THAAD missile system, but at a much cheaper price. The S-400 not only competes with the THAAD system, but also complicates jet fighter sales. This could also reduce missile system margins.There are security concerns about allowing certain nations to have access to both F-35 fighter jets and S-400 defense system, due to a fear that combining the two could allow for advanced vulnerability testing of exploitable weaknesses. This issue was raised when Turkey initially announced it would buy the S-400 system, and such complications are likely to show up again with nations that buy Russian and Chinese systems that may be integrated with Lockheed's technology. The ultimate decisions are not Lockheed's to make, but rather the U.S. government.Lockheed Martin continues to perform very well, including recently increasing its outlook in spite of Covid-19 related headwinds slowing production of its flagship product. Lockheed has a strong dividend that is well covered and which is likely to continue growing annually. Lockheed was also an aggressive repurchaser of shares over the last few years at lower prices.Lockheed is an important government contractor, which means it is likely to get government support if it ever needed it, which it does not, and possibly even receive preferential bond consideration by the Federal Reserve. Lockheed is also an important contractor to NASA, which is likely to remain lucrative and cool for the foreseeable future."
4363888,104980,2020-08-03T15:00:06-04:00,"Lockheed Martin's payout ratios through Q2 2020 remain very sustainable at 40.4% of diluted EPS and 35.3% of FCF and provide plenty of room for future dividend growth.Lockheed Martin delivered 12.4% YoY revenue growth from Q2 2019 to Q2 2020 and 15.8% YoY diluted EPS growth from Q2 2019 to Q2 2020.Along with its strong liquidity, LMT is capable of being a great, long-term investment if shares are acquired at or below fair value.Fortunately, shares are trading near fair value despite the 7% run-up in the share price since I covered the stock last month.Between its 2.5% yield, 7-8% annual earnings growth, and 0.4% annual valuation multiple expansion, Lockheed Martin is positioned to meet my 10% annual total return requirement over the next decade.","A true measure of whether a stock is worthy of consideration for a dividend growth investor's portfolio lies not only in how a company performs in a stable operating environment, but also how a company performs in an uncertain operating environment.One company that has delivered strong operating results in a stable operating environment, and more recently in the uncertain operating environment, is Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT).As I'll discuss below for the first time since last month, Lockheed Martin's safe dividend with high-single-digit growth potential, solid Q2 2020 operating results and strong balance sheet, in combination with its attractive stock price relative to my estimated fair value prompted me to reiterate my buy rating for shares of the stock.While Lockheed Martin's yield of 2.53% is relatively close to the S&P 500's yield of 1.82%, I will nonetheless be evaluating the EPS and FCF payout ratios through the first half of 2020 to determine the extent of its dividend safety and further determine the growth potential of the dividend going forward.Starting with Lockheed Martin's diluted EPS, the company delivered $11.87 through the first half of FY 2020 against dividends/share of $4.80 paid out during that time for a diluted EPS payout ratio of 40.4%.Compared to the $11.00 of diluted EPS through the first half of FY 2019 and dividends/share of $4.40 paid out to this time last year, Lockheed Martin's payout ratio is essentially in line with where it was a year ago.Moving to FCF, the company generated $4.496 billion in operating cash flow through Q2 2020 against $636 million in capital expenditures for total FCF of $3.860 billion.Against the $1.364 billion in dividends paid out during this time, that equates to an FCF payout ratio of 35.3%.When measured against the $3.331 billion in operating cash flow generated through Q2 2019 and $533 million in capital expenditures, total FCF was $2.798 billion.Against the $1.260 billion in dividends paid out through Q2 2019, this works out to an FCF payout ratio of 45.0%.Given Lockheed Martin's stable diluted EPS payout ratio and improved FCF payout ratio over the past year, I maintain that it is reasonable to conclude that dividend growth will slightly exceed diluted EPS growth over the long term.When considering that Yahoo Finance analysts are forecasting 9.1% annual earnings growth over the next five years, Lockheed Martin's desirable payout ratios, and what the company has managed to achieve through the first half of 2020 despite COVID-19, I reiterate my 7.75% annual dividend growth rate over the long term.Image Source: Lockheed Martin Second Quarter 2020 Earnings PresentationLockheed Martin's operating results for Q2 2020 were spectacular, especially given all of the operating challenges that businesses across many sectors of the economy faced as a result of COVID-19.One of the many things that stuck out to me in Lockheed Martin's Q2 2020 earnings results was the fact that its backlog managed to grow once again to an all-time high of more than $150 billion as indicated in the above slide.As mentioned by new CEO James Taiclet during Lockheed Martin's Q2 2020 earnings call, the company received nearly $22 billion in orders during the quarter, which more than offset the $16 billion in sales during the quarter.Most notably, the Aeronautics segment led the way with orders, logging over $9 billion in orders, with $7 billion of total orders booked for the F-35. Missiles and Fire Control followed closely behind, with several Defense Department PAC-3 awards, including one worth over $6 billion to supply PAC-3 MSE interceptors, launcher modification kits, and associated equipment to support the United States and foreign military sales customers across multiple contract years, as noted by CEO James Taiclet's opening remarks in Lockheed Martin's Q2 2020 earnings call.The Rotary and Mission Systems and Space segments also received over $1 billion each in orders during the quarter to round out Lockheed Martin's backlog story.Lockheed Martin also delivered 12.4% YoY growth in its revenue from $14.427 billion in Q2 2019 to $16.220 billion in Q2 2020 led by volume in the Aeronautics and Missiles and Fire Control segments, according to CFO Kenneth Possenriede's opening remarks during Lockheed Martin's Q2 2020 earnings call.As was the case in my previous article on Lockheed Martin, the Aeronautics segment was the primary driving factor of its impressive overall top-line growth, with its revenue surging 17.2% YoY from $5.550 billion in Q2 2019 to $6.503 billion in Q2 2020.The Missiles and Fire Control segment once again closely trailed the Aeronautics segment, upping its revenue 16.2% YoY from $2.411 billion in Q2 2019 to $2.801 billion in Q2 2020.The Rotary and Mission Systems segment produced 7.2% YoY growth in revenue, increasing from $3.768 billion in Q2 2019 to $4.039 billion in Q2 2020.Rounding out the segments, the Space segment managed to increase its revenue 6.6% YoY from $2.698 billion in Q2 2019 to $2.877 billion in Q2 2020.When Lockheed Martin's 20 basis point expansion in operating margin (10.8% in Q2 2019 to 11.0% in Q2 2020 based on the data in Lockheed Martin's Q2 2020 earnings press release) is combined with the above top-line growth, we can begin to understand how the company was able to grow its operating profits by 15.2% YoY from $1.554 billion in Q2 2019 to $1.790 billion in Q2 2020. Lockheed Martin Second Quarter 2020 Earnings PresentationDelving into Lockheed Martin's capital allocation during Q2 2020, the final piece of the puzzle is illustrated above by the fact that the company repurchased $259 million of shares during Q2 2020, which is how it generated 15.8% growth in its diluted EPS from $5.00 in Q2 2019 to $5.79 in Q2 2020 as indicated by CFO Kenneth Possenriede's opening remarks in the Q2 2020 earnings call.Lockheed Martin's $930 million of capital allocated to dividends and share repurchases allowed the company to retain $909 million or 49.4% of its FCF, which leaves it with ample FCF to handle a potential downturn in its operations.In addition, Lockheed Martin built upon its cash and cash equivalents position, with that surging from a bit less than $2.0 billion to end Q1 2020 to just under $2.9 billion as of June 28, 2020.Finally, Lockheed Martin's interest coverage ratio surged from ~10.3 in Q2 2019 to ~13.2 in Q2 2020 based on the data in the Q2 2020 earnings press release.When I take the developments in the above section and this section into consideration, I reiterate my conclusion that Lockheed Martin is operationally and financially sound at this time. Lockheed Martin Second-Quarter 2020 Earnings PresentationLockheed Martin also provided updated guidance in its Q2 2020 earnings release, with the company adjusting its Aeronautics, Space and RMS segment sales forecasts upwards and the Missiles and Fire Control segment's previous forecast reiterated, as noted by CFO Kenneth Possenriede's opening remarks during the Q2 2020 earnings call.As a result, Lockheed Martin revised its midpoint total sales figure for FY 2020 upward by $1.125 billion from $63.125 billion to $64.250 billion.Segment operating profit was also adjusted to account for the above, which explains the $100 million increase in that estimate from Lockheed Martin's April 2020 forecast to July 2020 forecast.Lockheed Martin also revised its diluted EPS figure upward from a midpoint of $23.80 in its April 2020 forecast to $23.90 in its July 2020 forecast.Rounding out the recent update in guidance, Lockheed Martin estimates that it will generate cash from operations of greater than or equal to $8 billion in FY 2020, which is a $400 million upward revision from the prior forecast as per CFO Kenneth Possenriede's opening remarks in the Q2 2020 earnings call.When I factor in Lockheed Martin's strong operating results through the first half of 2020 and upward revisions in guidance for the fiscal year, strong interest coverage ratio, and ~$2.9 billion cash and cash equivalents position, I believe the stock is capable of being a great, long-term investment if shares are acquired at or below fair value.Even though Lockheed Martin is the largest defense contractor in the world, the company faces its fair share of risks that both prospective and current shareholders must occasionally monitor to determine whether the investment thesis remains intact.Because the COVID-19 risks that I discussed in my previous article on Lockheed Martin haven't materially changed in the past month, I'll be solely focusing on a non-COVID-19 set of risks that developed in the month between when I last covered the company and now that are outlined in pages 50-51 of the most recent 10-Q.The risk that I'm alluding to is that political issues and considerations in the U.S. and abroad could have a material impact on Lockheed Martin's business (pages 50-51 of the most recent 10-Q).On July 14, 2020, China announced that it may impose sanctions against Lockheed Martin as part of its response to the recent Congressional Notification of the potential Foreign Military Sale of Repair and Recertification Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) Missiles to Taiwan (page 50 of Lockheed Martin's most recent 10-Q).While the vast majority of Lockheed Martin's Q2 2020 sales were generated in the United States (80.4% per data sourced from page 13 of the most recent 10-Q), it's worth noting that a material minority of its sales were generated in international markets and the company will continue to follow official U.S. government guidance on sales to Taiwan.Although China has yet to announce the specifics of potential sanctions against the likes of Lockheed Martin and the company expects any potential sanctions to have minimal impact on its sales at this time, it expects that these sanctions could seek to restrict its commercial sales or supply chain, including its supply of rare earth or other raw materials, and could also impose sanctions on its suppliers, teammates or partners.Despite the minimal overall impact of this development in the grand scheme of Lockheed Martin's operations, it's still worth monitoring whether or not China imposes sanctions against any of Lockheed Martin's suppliers or partners because those could result in some level of difficulty on the part of LMT's suppliers to deliver the necessary raw materials to Lockheed Martin, which could have a disruptive impact on the company if its contingency plans prove to be inadequate.While on the topic of geopolitical developments, it's also worth mentioning that at any time, the U.S. government could impose restrictions or delays on the sale or delivery of Lockheed Martin's products to countries such as Saudi Arabia or suspend sales of key products such as the F-35 to Turkey as was the case last summer (though the U.S. Air Force recently announced it would be purchasing the F-35 jets that were denied to Turkey by awarding Lockheed Martin an $862 million firm-fixed-price contract).It goes without saying that geopolitical developments could have a material impact on Lockheed Martin's financial results at any point in time.Although I have discussed several key risks associated with an investment in Lockheed Martin, the above discussion isn't to be interpreted as a complete discussion of the risks facing the company. For a more comprehensive discussion of the risk profile, I would refer interested readers to pages 9-20 of the most recent 10-K, pages 48-51 of the most recent 10-Q, and my previous articles on Lockheed Martin.Despite the fact that Lockheed Martin has proven itself to be a high-quality defense contractor, investors must still determine the fair value of shares before contemplating an investment in the stock in order to reduce the risk of overpaying for shares because significantly overpaying regardless of a stock's quality results in a triple threat combination (lower starting yield, increased risk of valuation multiple contraction, and lower total return potential).The above is precisely why I will be using a couple valuation metrics and a valuation model to arrive at a fair value for shares of Lockheed Martin.The first valuation metric that I'll be utilizing to determine the fair value of Lockheed Martin's shares is the TTM PE ratio to 13-year median TTM PE ratio.As per GuruFocus, Lockheed Martin's TTM PE ratio of 16.61 is a bit higher than its 13-year median TTM PE ratio of 16.08.Factoring in a reversion to its 13-year median TTM PE ratio of 16.08 and a fair value of $366.90 a share, shares are trading at a 3.3% premium to fair value and pose 3.2% downside from the current price of $379.00 a share (as of August 2, 2020).The second valuation metric that I will use to approximate the fair value of shares is the TTM price to FCF ratio to the 13-year median TTM price to FCF ratio.As indicated by GuruFocus, Lockheed Martin's TTM price to FCF ratio of 15.55 is a tad below its 13-year median TTM price to FCF ratio of 15.93.Assuming that Lockheed Martin's TTM price to FCF ratio reverts to 15.93 and a fair value of $388.26 a share, shares are priced at a 2.4% discount to fair value and offer 2.4% capital appreciation from the current share price.Image Source: InvestopediaThe valuation model that I will be using to assign a fair value to shares of Lockheed Martin is the dividend discount model, or DDM.The first input into the DDM is the expected dividend per share, which is another term for the annualized dividend per share. While the current annualized dividend/share is $9.60, I estimate that the company will be announcing an 8.3% increase to its annualized dividend next month, bringing it to $10.40.For the sake of this article, however, I will be using the current annualized dividend/share of $9.60.The next input into the DDM is the cost of capital equity, which is the annual total return that an investor requires from their investments. While this often materially varies from one investor to another, I require 10% annual total returns on my investments because I hold the opinion that such returns provide adequate reward for the time and effort that I spend researching investment opportunities and occasionally monitoring my investments.The third and final input into the DDM is the long-term dividend growth rate, or DGR.Unlike the first two inputs into the DDM that require merely data retrieval and subjectivity, accurately projecting the long-term DGR requires an investor to consider a multitude of factors, including a stock's payout ratios (and whether those payout ratios are positioned to remain the same, contract, or expand in the long term), annual earnings growth potential, industry fundamentals, and the condition of a stock's balance sheet.Given that Lockheed Martin's payout ratios are on the low end of ideal and that annual earnings growth is positioned to be 7-8%, conservatively, over the next decade, I am maintaining my annual 7.75% long-term DGR.When I plug the above inputs into the DDM, I arrive at a fair value of $426.67 a share, which indicates that shares of Lockheed Martin are trading at an 11.1% discount to fair value and offer 12.6% upside from the current share price.Upon averaging the three fair values, I compute a fair value of $393.94 a share, which implies that shares of Lockheed Martin are priced at a 3.8% discount to fair value and offer 3.9% capital appreciation from the current share price.Lockheed Martin's dividend coverage has held steady over the past year in terms of its diluted EPS payout ratio and markedly improved in terms of FCF payout ratio, which is due to the fact that the company is firing on all cylinders from an operational standpoint.As a result of Lockheed Martin's continued manageable payout ratios and its strong top- and bottom-line growth delivered in Q2 2020 and through the first half of FY 2020, I believe the company will deliver about as strong of a dividend increase in 2020 (even with the current challenges of COVID-19) than it did with its 9.1% dividend increase last year.Lockheed Martin's ~13 interest coverage ratio through Q2 2020 is a marked improvement over its ~10 interest coverage ratio through Q2 2019, not to mention the fact that the cash and cash equivalents position has nearly doubled from $1.5 billion at the end of Q2 2019 to $2.9 billion at the end of Q2 2020.Adding to the case for an investment in Lockheed Martin is the fact that the current share price indicates that it is trading at a 4% discount to fair value based on my interpretation of data sourced from GuruFocus as well as the dividend discount model.As a result of Lockheed Martin's high probability of meeting my 10% annual total return requirement over the next decade with its 2.5% yield, 7-8% annual earnings growth, and 0.4% annual valuation multiple expansion, I am maintaining my buy rating on the shares at this time."

Lockheed is a leader in the development and manufacture of missiles, helicopters, and jets for the defense industry.Lockheed Martin is one of the companies that I estimated was undervalued back in late 2012. While it appears to have been the case, I, unfortunately, didn't follow through on that decision by trying to get too cute with the valuation. Since then, the share price has outperformed the S&P 500 by roughly 2.3x.Data by YChartsWhen I began investing, the dividend growth strategy appealed most to me. Part of that was due to its simplicity: focus on quality businesses, buy at reasonable valuations, and ignore the noise in the day-to-day stock price movements. I've had some duds following this strategy, but I've had plenty of big winners over time as well. A history of growing dividends isn't fool-proof in preventing you from picking losers; however, I do think it helps to weed out some of the potential missteps that can occur when picking less established businesses.Image by author; data source Lockheed Martin Investor RelationsAccording to the CCC list, Lockheed Martin is a Dividend Contender with 17 consecutive years of dividend growth.During Lockheed Martin's dividend growth streak, year over year raises have ranged from 6.7% to 56.9% with an average of 18.5% and a median of 15.2%.Expanding that out to the 13 rolling 5-year periods and annualized dividend growth has ranged from 9.3% to 25.8% with an average of 17.6% and a median of 18.6%.The 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year rolling period dividend growth rates since 2002 can be found in the following table.Table and calculations by author; data source Lockheed Martin Investor RelationsThe payout ratio is a quick way to gauge the safety of the dividend which is of upmost importance for a dividend growth strategy because inevitably mishaps will occur that cause temporary issues with the short-term earnings and cash flows of a business.Image by author; data source Lockheed Martin SEC filingsLockheed's payout ratios have seen massive fluctuations over the last decade. Based on net income, the payout ratio has ranged from 33% up to 108% with free cash flow payout ratios ranging from 33% to 218%. I'm not concerned about it, although it is something to note before investing in Lockheed Martin. Excluding the outlier years, the average payout ratio is 45% based on net income and 44% based on free cash flow.When looking at businesses to invest my savings into, I first want to look at how the business has performed over time across a variety of metrics.Image by author; data source Lockheed Martin SEC filingsThe first thing that I want to look at when digging into a business is the trend in revenues. The reason revenue growth is at the top of the list is because cost cutting, while valid, typically has a limit in terms of increasing profits and cash flows, whereas sales are the real driver in the long-term growth of the business.From FY 2010 through FY 2016, sales growth was pretty stagnant showing just 3.2% total growth over that time. Since then, revenue growth has accelerated with year over year change of 8%, 5%, and 11%. In total, Lockheed has grown revenues 30.6% or ~3.0% annualized over the last decade.Gross profits increased substantially rising 105.9% in total or 8.4% annualized. Likewise, operating income has grown 118.1% in total or ~9.1% annualized. That's quite impressive considering the meager revenue growth over that time.Operating and free cash flow have seen similar increases rising 106.1% and 113.7% in total and 8.4% and 8.8% annualized, respectively.Image by author; data source Lockheed Martin SEC filingsLockheed's gross margins have risen nicely over the last decade from 8.9% in FY 2010 to 14.0% for FY 2019. The 10-year average sits at 10.8% while the 5-year average is up to 12.3%.My preference is to see free cash flow margins greater than 10% which Lockheed has failed to meet except for in FY 2017. The general trend is towards rising free cash flow margins although I question whether much further improvement will be achievable. The 10-year average sits at 7.0% with the 5-year average at 8.3%.Image by author; data source Lockheed Martin SEC filingsThe free cash flow return on invested capital, FCF ROIC, is my profitability metric of choice. The FCF ROIC represents the annual return of cash that is theoretically available to distribute to owners based on the capital invested in the business.Lockheed's FCF ROIC has fluctuated significantly over the last decade; although the trend over time has been fairly consistent with FCF ROIC's averaging 28.5% over the last decade. The 5-year average is a still strong 26.9%.I consider myself a part owner in the businesses that I invest in and as such I want to see capital and free cash flow allocations that make sense. That means I want to see cash flow spent on reinvesting in the business through capital expenditures first and foremost. With sustainable cash flow above the capex needs of the business, I want to see a management return that cash to owners through a rising dividend. Excess cash flow above that should then be used for strategic acquisitions, reducing debt, share buybacks or building up a cash buffer.To understand how Lockheed Martin has used its cash flow, I examine 3 variations of the metric, defined below:Ideally, the investment candidate would show positive FCFaDB more often than not as that would mean the business generates enough cash flow through operations to fund the capital allocation decisions of management. I'm not worried about a negative FCFaDB in any particular year as opportunities can sometimes be fleeting. Instead, I focus on the trend over the longer term.Image by author; data source Lockheed Martin SEC filingsAs we saw earlier, Lockheed Martin has generated positive and generally increasing FCF over the last decade. In total, Lockheed has generated $34.62 B in FCF over the last ten years. That FCF has allowed management to grow their dividend payment every year and pay out a total of $17.76 B in dividend payments over that time. That puts the 10-year cumulative FCFaD at $16.86 B.Management at Lockheed has spent a total of $19.40 B on share buybacks over the last decade or $2.54 B more than was available through FCFaD.The $19.40 B spent on share repurchases reduced the shares outstanding from 368.3 M in FY 2010 to 283.8 M at the end of FY 2019. That's good for a total reduction of 22.9% or ~2.9% annualized. Although we do need to keep in mind that Lockheed spent ~13% more on share buybacks than was available through FCFaD.Image by author; data source Lockheed Martin SEC filingsAs an investor in the equity of a business, my preference is for less debt than more although I realize that given the low interest rates available in the market over the last decade it also makes sense to lever the balance sheet some. Lockheed Martin has routinely kept a levered capital structure with an average debt to capitalization ratio over the last decade of 82%.Image by author; data source Lockheed Martin SEC filingsWhile the absolute levels of debt in terms of capital structure are high, the debt appears to be quite manageable. The 10-year average debt-to-EBITDA, debt-to-operating income, and debt-to-free cash flow ratios are 1.2, 1.9, and 3.7, respectively. For FY 2019, those levels are 1.3x, 1.5x, and 1.8x, respectively.Image by author; data source Lockheed Martin SEC filingsFor valuing a potential investment, I like to take a multi-pronged approach using dividend yield theory, minimum acceptable rate of return (MARR), and a reverse DCF as a reality check.The MARR analysis requires you to estimate the future earnings and dividends that a business will provide, apply a reasonable expected multiple on those earnings for a terminal value and then determining whether the expected return surpasses your hurdle rate.Analysts, currently, expect Lockheed Martin to report FY 2020 EPS of $24.17 and FY 2021 EPS of $26.65. They also expect Lockheed Martin to manage EPS growth of 9.1% per year over the next 5 years. I, then, assumed that Lockheed Martin would be able to grow earnings at 5% per year for the following 5 years. Dividends are assumed to target a 40% payout ratio.For reasonable future multiple, I let history be my guide. Looking back at the last 10 years of data, the TTM P/E ratio that Lockheed Martin has obtained in the market has ranged from ~8x to ~25x. For the MARR analysis, I'll examine P/E ratios covering that range.Data by YChartsThe following table shows the potential internal rates of return that an investment in Lockheed Martin could generate provided the assumptions laid out above are reasonably close to what actually occurs. Returns include dividends taken in cash and are calculated with a purchase price of $395.59, Friday's closing price. Returns are run through the end of calendar year 2025, ""5 Year"", and calendar year 2030, ""10 Year"".Additionally, I've calculated at what price I could purchase shares in order to produce the returns that I desire from my investments. My typical hurdle rate is 10% and for Lockheed Martin, I'll also examine 12% and 8% return targets.Dividend yield theory is another valuation method that I like to use. Dividend yield theory operates under the idea of reversion to the mean with the 5-year average dividend yield as a rough proxy for the fair value of the business.Image by author; data source: Lockheed Martin Investor Relations and Yahoo FinanceLockheed Martin, currently, offers an initial dividend yield of 2.43% compared to the 5-year average forward yield of 2.67%.I also like to use a reverse DCF as a reality check to see what the current market price implies regarding the future of the business. I use a simplified version of the DCF built on the maximum of the 3-, 5- and 10-year average EBIT margin, a tax rate of 20%, with 0% and 10% EBIT margin improvement and using both 8% and 10% hurdle rates.For the 8% hurdle rate scenario with no margin improvement, revenue growth needs to be 3.6% annualized over the next 20 years to justify the current price. With an 8% hurdle rate and 10% EBIT margin gains, the required revenue growth drops to 3.2%. Additionally, the 10% hurdle rate scenarios require revenue growth of 5.8% and 5.3%, respectively, to support the current share price.One of the pretty amazing things about the defense industry is just how long some of the contracts go. Lockheed's F-35 contract is scheduled to go through 2070 which is truly remarkable. Of course, that also comes with the caveat that margins are going to be fairly regulated compared to a true free market. It's a trade-off that's served Lockheed Martin and its shareholders well.In my opinion, the biggest risk to Lockheed Martin would be defense budget cuts specifically from the United States which wouldn't be unreasonable considering the massive spending by the United States compared to the rest of the world.SourceWhile that's a real possibility, it's not one that I'm too concerned with due to the fact that it requires the different parties to actually agree on something, which is highly unlikely, and for the entire system of the last 50+ years to be bucked. Lockheed Martin also had roughly 28% of FY 2019's revenues from international customers which should help insulate any cuts from domestic defense spending although geopolitical risks are there as international sales have to be approved by the U.S. government.Dividend yield theory suggests a fair value range of $326 to $400. While the MARR analysis suggests a fair value between $370 to $460 based on a 10% hurdle rate.One thing to note is that Lockheed Martin should announce a dividend increase in September, if they keep with recent history, which would boost up the dividend yield theory fair value range. Assuming ~8% increase to $2.59 per quarter pushes the fair value to $352 to $432.A back-of-the-envelope calculation for the business compounding rate of Lockheed Martin over the last decade based on reinvestment rate and ROIC puts the compounding rate just under 9%.Ideally, I'd like to purchase shares lower than the current level although I do believe that shares are in the fair value range and represent so good value here with a high likelihood of producing ~10% IRRs over the next decade. I will be looking to purchase additional shares for my portfolio this coming week."
4361679,53262,2020-07-29T10:00:00-04:00,"BA, ITA & The rest of the aerospace and defense sector have recovered strongly off March lows.While the market has stubbornly stuck to recent highs, this sector has faded correctively.While a few names can be more immediately bullish, for most of the sector it looks like a wider consolidation is needed.","We published our last public update on Boeing (BA) and the aerospace industry on March 20th: ""Boeing's Nosedive: From Leading The Dow To Asking For A Bailout (Video)."" We were pretty adamant that it was a ""must-hold"" low or BA could go into an unrecoverable flat spin - the same flat spin responsible for the death of Lt. Nick Bradshaw. In the first line of our last article, we said, ""It is time to go full flaps and put the gear down if BA is going to hold as a fourth wave!"" Not only did Boeing hold, it executed a textbook ""touch-and-go"" maneuver, soaring back up 109%!We followed the sub-wave path and had our subscribers ready for a consolidation. After getting a corrective pullback to a perfect 61.8% retrace on May 14, we were looking for a swing move up again. BA climbed another 99% for a perfect measured move! Since then, it has been consolidating correctively again, allowing for yet another swing attempt toward the 280 region. Whether this would count better as a 5th up from the March low or the C-wave of a 3rd is a little ambiguous, but as always, the smaller degree sub-waves will give us clues along the way.But we did not only call the bottom on BA in 2020, we also correctly identified the top in 2019. On April 30, 2019, we published ""Stall Warning,"" and in November published ""Holding Pattern,"" showing the March 2019 high for Boeing as a major top that was not likely to be breached before seeing significantly lower prices.In the following video, we again go over the Elliott Wave patterns we see on the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (BATS:ITA) as well as its major components. We examine how they have evolved off the significant low we pointed out. And we project what to expect in the months and years ahead. Discussing technical analysis in text can get a bit tedious, so we highly suggest you watch the short video where we can point to specific things on the chart.As discussed in the above video, the vast majority of components in the aerospace sector and indeed ITA itself count the March low as a large-degree fourth wave, and the movement off that low so far is just the start of the larger-degree fifth waves that should continue to carry prices higher over the next several years.The ITA only got three waves up from the March low so far as an ABC pattern; in a vacuum, this pattern is not in and of itself bullish. Quite the opposite, in fact, we look for ABC patterns as corrective consolidations, either retraces or bounces, before continuation of the prior move. So, how is it that we are seeing this bullishly? The answer is two-fold: context and an EW pattern called an Ending Diagonal.First, context, as mentioned above, the ITA and most names count as a larger-degree fourth wave completed into the March lows as support. Elliott Wave Theory provides several guidelines for where fourth waves should target and hold support. While the drop in February and March was violent, it came into the ideal target support region for all of those guidelines. Not only did it hold support in the region of the prior wave (4) inside the Primary 2, it came back to the red 100% Fib extension of P.2, it was a 50% retrace of the P.3, and it also held in the region of the wave twos inside the extended (5)th. Additionally, though the ""(B.)"" wave of our fourth made a higher high; this is called an Expanded Flat, and it implies that the underlying bullish trend that began at the 2009 low is still strong. This confluence of context allows us to remain confident in the larger Primary wave 5 despite the initial ABC structure.Second, the Ending Diagonal. A diagonal is an EW pattern consisting of five subwaves, but unlike an ""impulse,"" each of these subwaves is an ABC move. The ""Ending"" part of the name just means that it is the final move in a larger pattern. The initial move off 2009 for ITA's Primary wave 1 was actually a Diagonal too, a Leading Diagonal. Another characteristic of diagonals is that the waves two and four are often deeper and/or wider than in a standard impulse. So, while ITA has already retraced more than 38.2% of the ABC up from March, it is possible that this is only the A wave in a wider and deeper wave (2). The B wave should bounce more toward the 180s, and there is a chance that bounce turns into the start of (3). Since the larger fifth waves for most of these names are targeting ultimate highs well beyond those seen in early 2020, the risk:reward is favorable for initial exposure. ITA's Primary wave 5 targets the 300s, and there is some nice Fib confluence ~370.Moving on to the individual names, BA did drop far deeper than ideal for the same-degree fourth, but allows for a fourth at a larger degree to have completed. It clearly has the same ABC move up, but allows for a slightly different interpretation as just the B wave retrace inside the (3) of a larger Leading Diagonal off March. Even a ""nominal"" higher high in BA over the 2019 top to the next Fib extension easily puts BA at 711. While there is a near-term risk of a deeper retrace to 120s, current immediate support is 160-157.Raytheon Technologies (RTX) has potential for an even more bullish interpretation off the March low. If so, it should really hold the recent 58 low; fading below that would most likely put it in the same wave (2) of a diagonal as we discussed on ITA. Lockheed Martin (LMT) perhaps has the strongest-looking chart off the March low as an Impulse. It easily counts as the start of a third already off the 337s. It should be in just wave 1 of that third. The larger pattern is easily heading toward the 600s, and there is even some nice Fib confluence into the 700s.Transdigm Group (TDG) also fits well within the patterns shown by other members of the squadron. Though it counts best as one degree higher for a Cycle degree 5th starting, it too has a clear three-wave up structure for wave 1 of an Ending Diagonal. The ideal support for more of a wave 2 retrace is the 328-290 region, and the 5th wave up here can easily target 1161. No, that is not a typo, that is $1161 per share.General Dynamics (GD) also has the same three waves up so far, which can count as the wave (1) of an ED for P.5. It does look a bit more bullish off the July low so far, but the wave (1) as is was slightly smaller than ideal for an ED targeting the 300s. 268 is the minimum Fibonacci extension I would like to see hit for P.5 in GD, but 324 and 364 are more preferable. I am open to a larger wave (1) in a more complex pattern.Teledyne Technologies (TDY), while not as convincingly bottomed in a comparable larger-degree fourth wave as the others, has a more impulsive-looking pattern off the March low similar to LMT. Ideally, the 289 low in July holds and the third targets 745. Even just a measured move targets the 574 region off that support, so the risk:reward is very favorable.Northrop Grumman (NOC) was not as strong as the others off its March low, but it is also important to consider that it held a much higher relative low and did not even get under the December 2018 bottom. You could blame a LOT of ITA's -53% slide on BA, but others got hit hard too. While NOC's -33% was no cakewalk, it was substantially less severe. It also has a very clear three-wave retrace into the July low as support, and a measured move off that targets 387-420.Our Thursday webinars often end up being well over an hour, and this one was no exception. I had to cut the video short for this article, but we continued to discuss more of the components of ITA. Many other names support the bullish thesis for the next several years playing out, and show their own nuanced subwave patterns. Another standout that can certainly hang with the big boys is Kratos Defense & Security (KTOS). Where most of the large caps here count large fourth waves at the March low, KTOS can count a Primary wave 2. The move off that extreme is awkward because of the massive reversal bar, but it is hitting resistance at the .618 Fibonacci extension, which is perfectly consistent with the wave (1) inside a Primary wave 3. We would love to see a dip under the 12s for the wave (2) retrace to get close to the 38.2%. The upside potential here long term is as impressive as their orange painted drones."
4359947,50291,2020-07-22T14:53:52-04:00,"Lockheed Martin posted strong results enabled by prudent mitigation measures taken.Strong results reflect top-line growth on stable margins.Company has guided up for the remainder of 2020, which is a strong sign.","Lockheed Martin (LMT) presented its second-quarter results on the 21st of July. In this report, we have a look at the results which I think show why especially during these challenging times Lockheed Martin is a very interesting name to own in the aerospace and defense industry.Source: MarTech SeriesSource: Lockheed MartinStarting off with revenues and operating profits, we already see two things we are liking about Lockheed Martin. The first one is that while many companies are seeing COVID-19 driven declines, Lockheed Martin sales were up 12%. The second thing we like about the presented results is that while sales increased by 12%, there was a 15% increase in operating profits. So, there is a nice margin expansion there.Aeronautics sales were up 17% from $5.55B to $6.5B and that really reflects that Lockheed Martin has done a very good job shielding production from any COVID-19 disruptions. Year over year, we saw F-35 deliveries decline by 4 units and C-130J deliveries by 3 units. Given COVID-19 supply chain and logistics challenges, I think that is not too bad, and if you couple that to the 17% increase in sales and 25% increase in profits, that is actually great.The Missiles and Fire Control segment saw sales increase from $2.4B to $2.8B on strong volumes, generating a 13% increase in profits on a 16% increase in revenue. So, there was some margin contraction there, but given that this is a high-volume business segment, that was to be expected due to the pandemic. Rotary and Mission Systems sales increased 7% to $4B while profits jumped 24% driven by higher volumes and higher margins. Space sales increased 7% to $2.9B but posted lower 13% profits due to lower margins.All that led to a 15% jump in profits showing that so far, Lockheed Martin has been able to limit the COVID-19 impact on its production and, of course, the demand for their product portfolio is reflected as well. During the quarter, Lockheed Martin announced a $128 million charge, moderating the 22% growth in earnings per share to 16%. The non-cash charge was recognized as Lockheed Martin and Sikorsky sold their 40% stake to Abu Dhabi based EDGE.Translating all of that to cash level, cash from operations rose 30% to $2.1B. That, however, is not fully reflective of strong core performance as it includes various cash preserving measures under the CARES Act and accelerated receipts. Absent these elements, the increase in cash from operations would be around 20%, in line with the EPS growth.Source: Lockheed MartinFrom the Q2 earnings, I liked the margin expansion as well as the solid top-line growth despite the challenges COVID-19 poses. What I also like was that despite the COVID-19 challenges to the entire production system, Lockheed Martin guided up on sales, segment profits, EPS and cash. In times, where many companies have withdrawn outlooks… guiding up really should be considered a sign of strength. What I like even more about this is that the guidance takes into considerations COVID-19 challenges, so this is a guidance in light of the pressures faced today and it even includes some of the pressures expected to Q2 flowing into H2 2020. Sales have narrowed down to the upper end of the previous range. Segment profits are expected to be $100 million higher than previously guided and cash from operations is expected to be 5% higher than previously guided for. So, on the broad lines, we are seeing confidence for the rest of the year even taking supply chain risk and customer side risks in mind.Aeronautics and more specifically the F-35 will likely have some top line pressure due to COVID-19, while the same holds for the high-volume Missiles and Fire Control which has products such as the Hellfire and MGM-140 in its portfolio.Looking at the Lockheed Martin results for the second quarter and the first half of 2020, I think there is a lot visible that investors can appreciate. Despite the pandemic which affects the supply chain side, the production side as well as the ability to deliver, Lockheed Martin realized year-over-year growth and margin levels were strong. Following the 2020 guidance, on some segments there might be some pressure, but overall, the guidance is upbeat and that includes pressures from the pandemic of which part of the anticipated pandemic pressure that did not occur in Q2 is flowing to H2 2020 and that is baked into the guidance. So, overall, we see the latest results and guidance as a strong reflection of quality of the portfolio, the strong mitigation measures taken and solid core performance that is partially offset by any pandemic pressure that did creep into top-line and cost."
4360525,104097,2020-07-24T05:02:59-04:00,"Given my preference for high-yielding dividend investments, the inclusion of Lockheed Martin in my portfolio may seem quite strange given their low dividend yield of only around 2.50%.What it lacks in short-term income, it easily makes up for in the long term due to the very high quality of their operations that largely appear Covid-19-resistant.Based upon my valuation, it appears that their intrinsic value is still almost 50% higher than their current share price.Whilst this is partly being boosted by the current low interest rates, a Monte Carlo Simulation proves that this is not the sole cause with a very impressive 90% of results showing higher valuations.Following this analysis and the strength of their first half of 2020 results, I believe that upgrading my rating to bullish from neutral is appropriate.","Since I am firmly a dividend investor and one that particularly favors high-yielding investments, the inclusion of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) shares in my portfolio may seem rather odd. Especially since their current low dividend yield of only around 2.50% is hardly exciting. However, deep under the surface, other considerations make this a worthy investment even for income investors who normally chase a higher income.Image Source: Wikipedia.Regardless of exactly what investment strategy an individual investor normally pursues, most will still find the very high quality of their business very attractive during these turbulent and increasingly unpredictable times. This quality stems from a combination of well-run operations and a heavy focus on government contracts, which ultimately leads to them having resilient financial performance that has largely defied the Covid-19 pandemic. There are not many companies who have seen their revenue and operating profit increase 12% and 15% year on year, respectively, as the graphs included below display.Image Source: Lockheed Martin’s Second Quarter Of 2020 Results Presentation.When looking towards the future, this strong performance should continue due to their growing backlog, which supports their ability to continue generating higher earnings in future years. This has increased from a solid ~$75b at the end of 2014 to a massive ~$144b at the end of 2019, as the graph included below displays. By the time the first half of 2020 closed, it had reached yet another record milestone at a staggering $150b.Image Source: Lockheed Martin’s First Quarter Of 2020 Results Presentation.This all translates well into securing their future by helping ensure that their strong financial base remains intact and thus setting a very solid base to provide returns to their shareholders. A more detailed analysis of their dividend sustainability and, by extension, their solvency can be found in my previous article. To summarise the findings briefly, even if they were to suddenly see their earnings decrease upwards of 33%, they would still have no issues remaining a going concern due to the strength of their financial position. Whilst their results for the second quarter of 2020 have subsequently been released, they have not altered these findings and if anything, they have only strengthened their financial position.Apart from the very high quality of their business, I must also confess to being attracted to their shares for a similar reason many are attracted to gold and its mining companies. They provide a hedge in case certain broadly negative black swan events transpire, which in this case would be military tensions, conflicts and wars.Tensions between various countries, most notably the United States and China, have been rising for years and 2020 has only seen these increase further with frequent talk of a new cold war. Whilst I am not necessarily suggesting that these tensions will turn hot with actual combat, the probability of continuing worsening relations will nonetheless spill over into the economy and thus cause damage to the earnings of many companies.Whether this damage stems from lower cross border travel and investment or higher tariffs, the bottom line result for investors remains the same, being headwinds for most industries. Although there is one industry whereby this actually provides a tailwind, which is obviously the defense industry who will see continued increasing demand for their products and services. Their current dividend yield is historically quite low, as the graph included below displays. This may at first lead some investors to believe that their shares are overpriced; however, when digging deeper this does not appear to be the case.Since they are a very mature and established company that only pays out a small portion of their free cash flow in the form of dividends, the discounted cash flow valuation utilized a scenario based around their estimated free cash flow per share. If interested, all of the details regarding the inputs utilized for these valuations can be found in the subsequent section.The valuation produced a result of $550.70 per share, which indicates that their intrinsic value is 47.07% higher as of the time of writing. This indicates that despite their current dividend yield being towards historically low levels, the intrinsic value for their shares is still significantly higher than their current share price.Some investors are likely to argue that this simply stems from low interest rates that decrease their cost of equity and thus boost their intrinsic value. Whilst there is obviously a degree of substance to this notion, it alone does not completely account for the entirety of these results.To further illustrate how the odds are stacked favorably in the long term for investors regardless of interest rates, a Monte Carlo Simulation has been provided with a wide range of 121 different cost of equity assumptions. It can be seen in the graph included below that a very impressive 90% of all intrinsic values were equal to or above their current share price, with the average intrinsic value being 37.08% higher.These extremely impressive results speak to the sheer value that their shares still offer investors despite their otherwise expensive appearance, which in turn proves that the higher intrinsic value is not simply a function of low interest rates. These results should also in theory translate to providing investors with minimal downside risk in the long term, even though the short term will almost certainly remain bumpy.Image Source: Author.Their free cash flow per share for 2020 and subsequent five years were based on their free cash flow of $5.83b in 2019 divided by their latest outstanding share count of 279,542,050 and then scaled by their consensus earnings per share estimates, as per Seeking Alpha. At the time of writing, these were $24.15, $26.47, $28.90, $29.76, $30.03 and $30.70 per share for 2020-2026, respectively. The long term has shown there to be a historically strong correlation between the growth in their free cash flow and net income, as the graph included below displays. It was assumed that following 2026 their free cash flow per share would only grow at 1.125% per annum perpetually into the future, which is only half the common 2% to 3% long-term inflation target set by many central banks.The discounted cash flow valuations utilized a cost of equity as determined by the Capital Asset Pricing Model that utilized a 60M Beta of 0.82 (SA), expected market return of 7.50% and risk-free rates as per the United States Treasury Yield Curve on July 23, 2020, which reflects that risk-free rates are higher in the long term than the short term. The Monte Carlo Simulation utilized a wide range of 121 different cost of equity assumptions, which include expected market returns from 5% to 10% and risk-free rates from 0% to 5%, both of which used 0.5% increments.Even though their shares can appear rather expensive with just a curious glance, it pays to dig deeper with this investment since the value that is still embedded in their shares is very attractive even for income investors who normally seek a high income. Following this analysis and the strength of their Covid-19 defying results, I believe that upgrading my rating to bullish from neutral is appropriate.Notes: Unless specified otherwise, all figures in this article were taken from Lockheed Martin’s Q2 2020 10-Q and 2019 10-K SEC Filings, all calculated figures were performed by the author."
4359272,102875,2020-07-19T22:53:00-04:00,"COVID-19 had no material impact on Lockheed Martin’s business, and with more than $140 billion worth of deals in its backlog, the company will thrive in the current environment.By being a defense contractor, the economic downturn will not affect Lockheed Martin, and the company’s EPS for 2020 is forecasted to be $24.11 per share.We consider the stock to be one of the most attractive, pandemic-resistant long-term plays on the market right now.","COVID-19 had no material impact on Lockheed Martin (LMT). With more than $140 billion worth of deals in its backlog, the company will thrive in the current environment, and its business could be considered pandemic-proof. As the US annual defense budget is expected to increase from $676 billion in 2019 to $906 billion by 2030, Lockheed Martin, as Pentagon’s biggest contractor, will undoubtedly benefit from such growth. While there’s a risk that the company could lose some of its foreign orders from the oil-rich Gulf states, which are currently suffering from the low oil price environment, Lockheed Martin will be able to offset all of those losses by winning additional defense contracts from the Department of Defense. At the same time, with more than $10 billion in debt, the company is not going to have a liquidity crisis anytime soon, as its EBIT could cover its interest expenses 13 times over. By trading at P/E of 16x, we consider Lockheed Martin to be one of the best aerospace stocks on the market right now with the potential to create value in the long run. For that reason, and because of the fact the company will be able to sustain its dividend payments with a payout ratio of more than 40% for a long time, we opened a long position in Lockheed Martin.While the US economy entered a recession in the first half of the year and recorded the largest unemployment rate in its history, Pentagon’s biggest contractor Lockheed Martin said that the pandemic had no material impact on its business. In Q1, its revenues of $15.69 billion were up 9.4% and its GAAP EPS of $6.08 were above analysts’ estimates by $0.28. By being a defense contractor, Lockheed Martin will always outperform its civil aerospace peers during economic downturns. While companies like Boeing (BA) and Airbus (OTCPK:EADSF, OTCPK:EADSY) are experiencing order cancellations for passenger planes on a massive scale, Lockheed Martin’s businesses from aeronautics, missile and fire control, and rotary and missions systems fields are all experiencing double-digit growth. We could see from the table below that even when compared to other defense contractors, Lockheed Martin is also able to outperform them, as its operating and net margins of 13.53% and 10.21%, respectively, are above the industry’s median margins.Source: Capital IQThanks to its technical advantages against others, Lockheed Martin will continue to receive new orders from the Department of Defense and create value for its shareholders. In June, the company won a contract worth $1.04 billion for the production of guided missile systems, and just recently, it was awarded $15 billion to develop C-130J transport aircraft for the U.S. Air Force. The defense industry will continue to be the most crucial part of the national security strategy of the United States, and the country’s annual defense budget could grow to $906 billion in 2030, a 34% increase from $676 billion in 2019. The government always has much deeper pockets than businesses and consumers, and as a result, companies like Lockheed Martin, which are also crucial for the United States national security, are always going to be great investments even in turbulent times.In recent years, Lockheed Martin has been exploring the opportunities to establish a stronger presence in space, the final frontier outside Earth. After the creation of US Space Forces in late 2019, the Congress allocated to it $15.4 billion in 2021, which accounts for nearly 60% of the NASA budget, and that number will increase over the years. As space projects become more lucrative once again, Lockheed Martin is not wasting any time and is already making progress on the space front. The Air Force Space Command already launched two of the company’s GPS Block III satellites and could purchase additional units if needed. At the same time, NASA has already ordered a dozen of the company’s Orion space capsules and is committed to purchasing more if needed. While space projects will account for a fraction of the company’s revenues, they have a high potential to become profit machines in the next couple of decades as countries around the world start to allocate more funds for space exploration.When it comes to risks, there are a few of them. The biggest risk for Lockheed Martin's business comes from overseas. Right now around 30% of the company's revenues come from the oil-rich Gulf States like Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, and UAE. In 2017, Saudi Arabia signed a letter of intent to purchase $110 billion worth of defense equipment from the US manufacturers right away and $350 billion worth of defense equipment in the next 10 years. Two years later, the country officially signed the agreement to purchase Lockheed Martin’s THAAD missile defense systems for $15 billion. While that deal is likely to be completed, there’s now no guarantee that the rich oil state will be able to keep its promise and honor the rest of the deal in the foreseeable future considering the current low oil price environment and an ongoing recession. Saudi Arabia's economy expects to shrink by more than 6% this year, and there’s a risk that the country will start to cancel all the other defense orders to stabilize its economy.Another risk comes from China. Recently, the Chinese Communist Party sanctioned Lockheed Martin for its participation in a $620 million deal to ship its Patriot missile systems to Taiwan. At this point, it’s unknown how the sanctions will affect the company, but the company’s Shanghai Sikorsky Aircraft joint venture will likely be negatively affected by that decision.While those foreign risks might hurt the company’s revenues in the short term, Lockheed Martin will be able to offset them by increasing its market share and getting additional valuable contracts back at home. At the same time, with a $144 billion worth of orders, the company will have enough time to prepare for the possible cancellation of orders and look for other customers, if needed. Even with less than $2 billion in cash and $10 billion in debt, it is not overleveraged and will not face a liquidity crisis if some orders are canceled. Right now, Lockheed Martin’s interest rate coverage is 13x, which means that its EBIT could cover its interest expenses 13 times over. At the same time, the company’s Net debt/EBITDA ratio has been decreasing in the last five years, and it now stands at 1.2x, way below its peers with similar balance sheets.Source: KoyfinWith that in mind, we should also not forget that Lockheed Martin is one of the most shareholder-friendly companies out there. Despite the ongoing pandemic, it does not need to preserve cash and continues to repurchase its shares and pay dividends to shareholders, with a payout ratio of 40%. In late June, Lockheed Martin announced that it’ll pay its quarterly dividend of $2.40 per share in late September, and those who buy its shares before September 1 will be eligible for the payment. While there’s a risk that Lockheed Martin decides to cut its dividends later on if some foreign orders are indeed canceled, such a risk is minimal, in our opinion. By trading at a P/E ratio of only 16x and expecting to generate earnings of $24.11 per share in 2020, we consider Lockheed Martin stock to be one of the most attractive, pandemic-resistant plays on the market right now. Its opportunities outweigh all the risks, in our opinion, and recently, we opened a long position in the company and plan to hold it at least for a couple of years."
4358939,50291,2020-07-17T10:00:13-04:00,Lockheed Martin won $3.2B in contracts in June.Year-to-date total now stands at nearly $30B.F-35 and Patriot missiles boosted contract awards during the month.,"Recently, we launched the Defense Contracts Monitor that we populate weekly with new contracts awarded to Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT). Currently the monitor consists of more than 600 contracts and we are working on quickly expanding the number of years and contracts covered in the monitor but also expanding toward other companies in the defense industry. With market sentiment turning negative for commercial aircraft, we saw more interest in the defense side and that triggered me to relaunch defense coverage including names such as Lockheed Martin, and we are aiming to expand that going forward.Source: Wallpaper AbyssLockheed Martin has been one of the names I wrote about earlier. Since then, shares of Lockheed Martin gained almost 60% vs. 40% for the bigger market. Unfortunately due to local regulations I'm not allowed to own shares of Lockheed Martin, but these are the kind of names I really would like to be a core holding in my portfolio. In this report, I want to have a look at the order inflow for Lockheed Martin during the month of June launching the monthly defense order overviews for the company. For this analysis, we used the newly-developed Defense Contracts Monitor which we have made available to subscribers of The Aerospace Forum.Figure 1: Lockheed Martin contracts in June (Source: AeroAnalysis)In June, Lockheed Martin was awarded 27 contracts valued $3.2B funds obligated on award standing at $2.4B or 75%.At $1.1B, the F-35 was the highest contributor to defense sales. Almost $730 millions provides for the delivery order for five F-35A aircraft, one F-35B and four F-35C aircraft while the remainder provides for technical services and long-lead materials.Source: Military AerospaceBy far the biggest contract Lockheed Martin received during the month was a foreign military sales contract for the PAC-3 for incidental services, hardware, facilities, equipment, and all technical, planning, management, manufacturing, and testing efforts to produce Phased Array Tracking Radar to Intercept on Target Advanced Capability-3 missiles. The Phased Array Tracking to Intercept of Target (PATRIOT) Advanced Capability-Three (PAC-3) program is an air-defense, guided missile system with long-range, medium- to high-altitude, all-weather capabilities. It's designed to counter tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and advanced aircraft.For the MH-60 Romeo Seahawk, Lockheed Martin received a $370 million contract to develop software and hardware solutions for India, which was cleared for the purchase of 24 Romeo Seahawks last year. The helicopters with anti-surface, anti-submarine warfare, search and rescue missions capabilities provide a key piece on India’s presence in the region where China is intensifying its grip.In June, foreign military sales accounted for almost 43% or $1.37B of the contract awards driven by the PAC-3 contract. The US accounted for 27% of the contracted value, followed by India and Italy accounting for 12% each. The remainder came from South Korea. Month-over-month contracts awards jumped by $500 million bringing the H1 2020 contract awards to almost $30B of which $19.5B was obligated at award. Quarter-over-quarter contracts awards jumped by $700 million.During the month we saw contract awards increase and also quarter-over-quarter defense contracts awards saw an increase. Overall, what I'm liking about Lockheed Martin is the consistence in winning contracts around $15B in Q1 and also roughly $15B in Q2. Lockheed Martin has a highly versatile product line up and that showed with fighter jet sales, contracts to support surface-to-air missiles, contracts in support of helicopters with anti-surface, anti-submarine ware and search and rescue capabilities as well as 44 M270A2 Multiple Launch Rocket Systems. There simply are a lot of platforms that Lockheed Martin can book wins for. The F-35 had its problems and still has high operation costs, but its importance to Lockheed Martin is clear. I believe that going forward Lockheed Martin is a nice name to have in your portfolio, even though Dutch Law does not allow me to put the money where my mouth is."
4358255,53552,2020-07-13T18:36:24-04:00,"Shares of Lockheed Martin have sagged as Joe Biden's electoral prospects have improved, amid concerns about defense spending.Lockheed's $144 billion backlog and international business will insulate its business from short-term defense spending fluctuations.With shares now less than 15x earnings, investors should use periods of weakness like this to buy shares in this steady dividend grower with a strong balance sheet.","Shares of Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) have shed about 15% of their value over the past month, and at $350, there is now a compelling opportunity to buy a steady dividend grower at an attractive price. Interestingly, the recent peak in Lockheed Martin's share price on June 8 came one week after former Vice President Joe Biden became the favorite to win the presidency in betting markets. It is also worth noting that LMT shares more than tripled during the Obama Administration, so it is not as though defense stocks have to do poorly during Democrat Presidencies, as many programs enjoy broad bipartisan support.(Source: RealClearPolitics.com)Now, I do not know who will win the Presidential election. Given LMT's primary customer is the federal government, investors do need to be aware that political happenings can drive price movements over the near term. However, these movements can provide valuable entry points for long-term investors because LMT is positioned to drive strong results irrespective of who wins the Presidency. Indeed, because of the federal government's fiscal year, the first time the next President will have a say on Pentagon spending will be for the 10/1/2021-9/30/22 period, still sixteen months from now.This year, Lockheed expects to generate about $63 billion in revenue, up about 5% from 2019. Critically, LMT has a $144.1 billion backlog, which provides for over 2 years of business. Importantly, Lockheed is also winning significant new business, ensuring it doesn't eat much into its backlog. During the first quarter for example, its backlog actually grew by $140 million, meaning it booked more in orders than it delivered.Indeed, two years ago, Lockheed's backlog was $105 billion. LMT has capitalized on increased defense budgets of the past few years to win about $160 billion in new business, led by its F-35 fighter jet. Critically, its backlog is diversified across each of its four main business units with each unit having 2-3 years of orders at current revenue rates.(Source: Lockheed Martin)Given the long-cycle nature of Lockheed's business, like fighter jets and missile defense systems, its business is somewhat insulated from short-term movements in defense spending, because the Pentagon is making multiyear investments in LMT products. This backlog will serve as a steady cash flow generator even if the Pentagon budget is eventually trimmed by a future Administration. But even if Pentagon spending is cut, it is not as though Lockheed will see its orders fall to zero as there will always be some defense spending. With its existing backlog, even if Lockheed could only replace 50% of revenue with new backlog, its backlog would support $63 billion/yr in revenue for seven years. How many businesses have that kind of revenue visibility? This stability has been a reason why defense contractors often command premium multiples, but at 15x earnings, now is an exception.In other words, Lockheed's backlog provides a substantial margin of safety against even extreme reductions in defense spending, at which point the politics of defense spending could shift. Indeed, owning defense contractors like LMT can serve as a portfolio hedge against a continued increase in tensions against China, which would bolster bipartisan support for defense spending but likely weigh on the broader stock market.It is also important to recognize that, while the US is Lockheed's primary customer, it is not the only customer. The US accounts for about 73% of revenue, while Europe is 11%, Asia 9%, and the rest of the world 7%. While US defense spending could fall in the future, Lockheed can offset this partially by boosting its global sales; indeed, Europe, is steadily increasing defense spending to meet NATO commitments.Lockheed's large backlog, long-cycle projects, and foreign exposure provide a steady book of business, despite potential worries about short-term trends in Pentagon spending. At current revenue levels, LMT can generate over $5 billion in free cash flow, or about $17.75 per share, with earnings per share of nearly $24. That gives the stock an over 5% free cash flow yield and a less than 15x P/E ratio.I believe this is a compelling valuation to own the premiere US defense contractor, given it can sustain these earnings for years even in a bearish defense spending environment. With this free cash flow generation, LMT is well positioned to continue increasing its $2.40 ($9.60 per year) dividend at a 5-10% pace or using excess free cash flow to tactically repurchase shares, thereby increasing EPS even if overall earnings stay flat. LMT has also used the strong results of recent years to further strengthen its balance sheet. At the end of 2018, it carried $14.1 billion in debt, while it now has $12.6 billion in debt. This decline in debt is despite having $10 billion more per year in revenue, which all else equal, could support more debt. This balance sheet strength gives LMT the capacity to engage in strategic M&A or even use debt to fund share repurchases if the stock were to fall further.As investors appreciate the durability of its free cash flow, with the potential for low-single digit growth in a more benign defense spending environment, I believe shares can look past near-term politics and trade back over $400, which would be a 17x earnings multiple. I would take advantage of recent weakness to accumulate shares here to enjoy share price appreciation and a steadily growing dividend."

The company continues to operate at the forefront of many advanced technology industries. While the coronavirus has had a negative impact on Lockheed Martin, the company is proving to be relatively resilient during the pandemic. In fact, Lockheed Martin has recovered most of its losses over the past few months.Lockheed Martin experienced a strong Q1 and outperformed expectations. The company's quarterly GAAP EPS of $6.08 and revenue of $15.65 billion beat expectations by $0.28 and $580 million, respectively. Lockheed Martin has fared relatively well during the pandemic as many of its services have been considered essential. Despite the current economic downturn, Lockheed Martin is well-positioned moving forward.Lockheed Martin has rebounded in recent months after a sharp drop.Data by YChartsLockheed Martin's quarterly sales grew an impressive 9% Y/Y in Q1. The company's Aeronautics segment performed particularly well with 14% Y/Y growth. The company notably experienced ~$900 million in F-35 orders and $3.6 billion in other awards. While Aeronautics has been performing exceptionally well, the segment is already starting to experience disruptions as a result of the coronavirus. Such disruptions will almost certainly have a negative impact on Lockheed Martin's business in 2020.Lockheed Martin's RMS segment also performed well and was awarded over $7 billion this quarter, with Sikorsky accounting for over $4 billion in awards alone. Perhaps the most promising aspect of Lockheed Martin is its growing space business. The frontiers of space are opening up like never before with figures like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos investing billions into the industry. Lockheed Martin is among the top companies leading the space charge.While Lockheed Martin is not as flashy as companies like SpaceX, it is making rapid progress on the space front. In fact, the company recently had two of its GPS III spacecrafts accepted into operations by the Air Force Space Command. Lockheed Martin could see a great deal of upside as a front runner in the burgeoning space industry.Lockheed Martin is making big moves on the space front.Source: Lockheed MartinWith many of Lockheed Martin's products deemed essential, the company will be relatively shielded from the negative impacts of the pandemic. The company also boasts a strong backlog, which should help the company overcome near-term hurdles. As such, it would not be surprising to see Lockheed Martin continue to outperform expectations going forward. However, the coronavirus is still expected to have a material impact on the company's operations for the next few quarters.Lockheed Martin is well-positioned to weather the current crisis. The company has built a strong balance sheet over the years and continues to maintain robust financials. Lockheed Martin generated $2.3 billion in cash from operations and maintained a sizable backlog of $144 billion in Q1. While the coronavirus does make the near-term murkier, Lockheed Martin is strong enough to withstand any potential economic headwinds.Demand for Lockheed Martin's products are also not likely to be significantly impacted by the coronavirus given that the company's customer base largely consists of governments and other large organizations. The need for defense and advanced technologies should remain relatively stable even in this turbulent current period. While Lockheed Martin's sales outlook for 2020 has been reduced as a result of the pandemic, the company is still expected to grow ~6% over 2019.Many of Lockheed Martin's largest customers are governments from the Middle East. Many of these governments derive their revenues from fossil fuels like oil. With oil prices plummeting and renewable energy technologies rapidly gaining steam, countries like Saudi Arabia will likely become increasingly financially strained moving forward.This could have a large negative impact on Lockheed Martin as the company relies on many of these countries for a sizable portion of its sales. If countries like Saudi Arabia become less financially stable, they may have to cut down on their arms spending. However, the volatility in the Middle East is only growing, which means that demand from the region will likely not decline anytime soon. Considering the fact that the majority of Lockheed Martin's sales to the region are defensive systems, the company should still see robust demand from this region for the foreseeable future.Saudi Arabia is one of Lockheed Martin's largest customers, which means that a cash-strapped Saudi Arabia could have a negative impact on Lockheed Martin.Source: Getty ImagesLockheed Martin plays an essential role in national security, which means that the company will likely be less affected by the pandemic-induced downturn. On top of this, Lockheed Martin ended Q1 with a very strong balance sheet and a solid backlog. Despite some near-term macroeconomic headwinds, the company still has more upside at its current market capitalization of $101 billion and forward P/E ratio of 15. Lockheed Martin is at the forefront of some of the largest and most promising advanced technology sectors."
4358223,104980,2020-07-13T16:05:54-04:00,"The fact that Lockheed Martin's diluted EPS and FCF payout ratios are both below 40% suggest that the stock's dividend is very safe for the foreseeable future.
        Despite the difficult operating environment, Lockheed Martin managed to advance its revenues by 9.2% in Q1 2020, its diluted EPS by 1.5%, and FCF by an impressive 46.6% YoY.
        Lockheed Martin is also trading at what I believe is an 8% discount to fair value based on my interpretation of data sourced from Gurufocus, as well as the DDM.
        Between its 2.7% yield, 7-8% annual earnings growth, and 0.8% annual valuation multiple expansion, I believe shares of Lockheed Martin are positioned to exceed my annual total return requirement of 10% over the next decade.","In an uncertain operating environment amid a global pandemic, it's especially important that a dividend growth investor focuses on high-quality dividend growth stocks.What better way to play off of the long-term trend of growing global defense spending, than to discuss the largest defense contractor in the world in Lockheed Martin (LMT).As I'll discuss below for the first time since I initiated coverage in the stock last October, Lockheed Martin boasts a well-covered dividend with annual high-single digit growth potential, Lockheed Martin also delivered strong operating results for Q1 2020 and possesses an investment-grade balance sheet, and trades at a discount to my estimated fair value, which backs up my bullish thesis for Lockheed Martin.Even though Lockheed Martin's yield of 2.73% is well within a reasonable range of the S&P 500's 1.87% yield, I continue to maintain that it is always reasonable to examine the safety of a stock's underlying dividend.Lockheed Martin generated $6.08 in diluted EPS in Q1 2020 against $2.40 of dividends/share paid out during that time, for a diluted EPS payout ratio of 39.5%, which is a slight improvement to when I last covered the stock's diluted EPS payout ratio.Moving to FCF for Q1 2020, Lockheed Martin generated $2.314 billion in operating cash flow against $293 million in capital expenditures, for total FCF of $2.021 billion (according to data sourced from page 6 of Lockheed Martin's most recent 10-Q).Against the $693 million of dividends paid during the first quarter, this equates to an FCF payout ratio of 34.3%.This is once again an improvement to the last time that I covered Lockheed Martin.Given that Lockheed Martin's payout ratios are undoubtedly sustainable at current levels and that I actually expect them to slightly expand over the long-term, I believe that Lockheed Martin's long-term dividend growth will slightly exceed whatever earnings growth Lockheed Martin is able to achieve for shareholders.When factoring in that Yahoo Finance analysts are forecasting 8.8% annual earnings growth over the next 5 years (a notable decline from Lockheed Martin's 15.8% annual earnings growth over the previous 5 years), I believe Lockheed Martin is positioned to conservatively deliver long-term annual dividend growth of 7.75%.Image Source: Lockheed Martin 1st Quarter 2020 Earnings PresentationLockheed Martin delivered fantastic operating results in Q1 2020, especially through the lens of COVID-19 and its detrimental impact to the operating results of many businesses in the first quarter of this year.Starting off with revenue, Lockheed Martin generated $15.651 billion in Q1 2020, which is a 9.2% YoY increase from the $14.336 billion generated in Q1 2019 (according to page 5 of Lockheed Martin's Q1 2020 earnings press release).Leading the impressive advance in revenue, was the Aeronautics segment, which grew its revenue 14.1% YoY, according to CEO Marillyn Hewson's opening remarks during Lockheed Martin's Q1 2020 earnings call, from $5.584 billion in Q1 2019 to $6.369 billion in Q1 2020.The Missiles and Fire Control segment followed closely behind Aeronautics, posting 11.4% YoY growth in revenue from the $2.350 billion generated in Q1 2019 to $2.619 billion generated in Q1 2020.The Rotary and Mission Systems segment was the only segment to post a decline in revenue, although that decline was only 0.4% YoY from the $3.762 billion generated in Q1 2019 to $3.746 billion in Q1 2020.Rounding out the segments, the Space segment increased its revenue 10.5% from $2.640 billion in Q1 2019 to $2.917 billion in Q1 2020. Image Source: Lockheed Martin 1st Quarter 2020 Earnings PresentationAs I had previously alluded to in my analysis of Lockheed Martin's dividend safety, Lockheed Martin's FCF in Q1 2020 comfortably covered the company's dividend obligation.Lockheed Martin's FCF surged 46.6% YoY from $1.379 billion in Q1 2019 to $2.021 billion in Q1 2020.When also including the $756 million in share buybacks completed during the first quarter, Lockheed Martin managed to retain 28.3% or $572 million of its FCF.This allowed the company's cash position to increase from $1.514 billion at the beginning of the quarter to $1.988 billion at the end of the first quarter (page 18 of Lockheed Martin's Q1 2020 earnings press release).The fact that Lockheed Martin maintains a near $2 billion cash and cash equivalents position in combination with its 28.3% FCF retention rate leaves the company with both ample liquidity and a cash flow cushion in the event of a COVID-19 related downturn. Image Source: Lockheed Martin 1st Quarter 2020 Earnings PresentationLockheed Martin managed to maintain its all-time high backlog of orders at $144 billion by securing more than $15 billion in orders during the quarter to offset the near $16 billion in sales during the quarter, as indicated in CEO Marillyn Hewson's opening remarks during Lockheed Martin's Q1 2020 earnings call.Leading the way with orders during the quarter, the RMS segment booked over $7 billion, led by its Sikorsky organization, which booked over $4 billion of orders, according to CEO Marillyn Hewson's opening remarks in Lockheed Martin's Q1 2020 earnings call. Image Source: Lockheed Martin 1st Quarter 2020 Earnings PresentationIn many ways, Lockheed Martin's updated outlook for 2020 that was discussed during its Q1 2020 earnings call is the same as the prior outlook.The only discernable difference between the two outlooks, is that Lockheed Martin revised its mid-point 2020 sales outlook downward by $375 million from $63.500 billion to $63.125 billion.Lockheed Martin's $23.80 midpoint diluted EPS forecast for FY 2020 would represent an 8.4% YoY increase over the $21.95 in diluted EPS generated in FY 2019.When I take into consideration Lockheed Martin's robust outlook for 2020, strong cash position, and ample retained FCF, I believe that Lockheed Martin is capable of making a solid long-term investment if shares are acquired at or below fair value.While Lockheed Martin is the clear leader of the defense contractor industry, the company faces its fair share of risks. Rather than focusing on risks from Lockheed Martin's most recent 10-K (as they're mostly redundant from the previous 10-K when I initiated coverage in the company), I'll be discussing the COVID-19 related risks facing Lockheed Martin as outlined in Lockheed Martin's most recent 10-Q.The first COVID-19 related risk facing Lockheed Martin, is that while the company's U.S. production facilities have been operating to meet national security commitments to the U.S. Government and military, any COVID-19 outbreaks at production facilities could result in a temporary halt to production, which could adversely impact Lockheed Martin's operating and financial results in any given quarter.It's worth mentioning that while U.S. production facilities have been operating near capacity through COVID-19, the different practices of other countries aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19 could result in international production facility slowdowns or stoppages, which could also result in negative developments in Lockheed Martin's operating and financial results.COVID-19 has also resulted in travel restrictions and limitations to the amount of flight test operations and training that is being conducted, which could unfavorably impact Lockheed Martin's operating and financial results if these limitations continue in the quarters ahead.As a result of Lockheed Martin's dependence on its small and medium-sized supply chain partners and the difficulties some of these supply chain partners are facing in operating to meet their obligations to Lockheed Martin and the U.S. Government, it's worth noting that if Lockheed Martin is unable to mitigate or work around the potential milestone delays on key programs, this could compromise Lockheed Martin's ability to deliver on its contracts with the U.S. Government, which could harm the company from both a financial standpoint and a reputational standpoint.Another risk facing Lockheed Martin, is that COVID-19 could result in delays in inspection, acceptance, and payment by its customers.While teleworking has been highly beneficial to many industries of the economy, it remains a challenge to complete inspections and acceptance of a program when such a program is classified, and remote work compromises the classified nature of a program.Until COVID-19 restrictions pertaining to inspections are lifted, Lockheed Martin may be adversely impacted by delays in sales and cash flows.The final COVID-19 related risk to Lockheed Martin, is that while the company's ability to access liquidity has been relatively unaffected to date, any negative developments pertaining to COVID-19 could result in downturns in the global capital markets, potentially leading to difficulty on the part of Lockheed Martin in accessing the capital markets.Even though I have discussed several key COVID-19 related risks facing Lockheed Martin, I certainly haven't discussed all of the risks associated with an investment in Lockheed Martin. For a more comprehensive discussion of the risks facing Lockheed Martin, I would refer interested readers to pages 43-45 of Lockheed Martin's most recent 10-Q, pages 9-20 of Lockheed Martin's most recent 10-K, and my previous article on Lockheed Martin.Although Lockheed Martin is a blue-chip defense contractor, investors would be wise to determine the fair value of a stock before considering an investment to minimize the risk of overpaying for a stock because as we know, overpaying for a stock not only results in a lower starting yield, but it also increases the likelihood of experiencing painful valuation multiple contraction over the long-term.Taking the above into consideration, I'll be using a couple valuation metrics and a valuation model to establish a fair value for shares of Lockheed Martin.The first valuation metric that I will utilize to arrive at a fair value for shares of Lockheed Martin is the TTM price to FCF ratio to the 13 year median TTM price to FCF ratio.According to Gurufocus, Lockheed Martin's price to FCF ratio of 15.39 is a bit below its 13 year median TTM price to FCF ratio of 16.01.Factoring in a reversion to its 13 year median TTM price to FCF ratio of 16.01 and a fair value of $365.40 a share, shares of Lockheed Martin are trading at a 3.9% discount to fair value and offer 4.0% upside from the current price of $351.25 a share (as of July 10, 2020).The next valuation metric that I will utilize is the TTM PE ratio to 13 year median TTM PE ratio.As indicated by Gurufocus, Lockheed Martin's TTM PE ratio of 15.94 is slightly below its 13 year median TTM PE ratio of 16.09.Assuming a reversion to its 13 year median TTM PE ratio of 16.09 and a fair value of $354.56 a share, shares of Lockheed Martin are priced at a 0.9% discount to fair value and offer 0.9% of capital appreciation from the current price.Image Source: InvestopediaThe valuation model that I'll be using to assign a fair value to shares of Lockheed Martin is the dividend discount model or DDM.The first input into the DDM is the expected dividend per share, which is the annualized dividend per share. In the case of Lockheed Martin, that amount is currently $9.60 (and likely to increase in September).The second input into the DDM is the cost of capital equity, which is another term for the annual total returns that an investor requires on their investments. Although this can vary significantly from one investor to the next, I require 10% annual total returns because I believe that provides ample reward for the time and effort that I dedicate to researching investment opportunities and periodically monitoring my investments.The final input into the DDM is the long-term dividend growth rate or DGR.While the first two inputs into the DDM are a matter of data retrieval and subjectivity, accurately forecasting the long-term DGR requires an investor to consider numerous variables, such as a stock's payout ratios (and whether those payout ratios are positioned to expand, contract, or remain the same over the long-term), annual earnings growth potential, the strength of a stock's balance sheet, and industry fundamentals.When I factor in that Lockheed Martin's payout ratios are positioned to slightly expand over the long-term and that annual earnings growth is conservatively going to be 7-8% over the next decade, I believe a 7.75% long-term DGR is a reasonable expectation.Upon plugging the above inputs into the DDM, I am left with a fair value of $426.67 a share, which implies that shares of Lockheed Martin are trading at a 17.7% discount to fair value and offer 21.5% upside from the current price.When I average the three fair values together, I compute a fair value of $382.21 a share, which indicates that shares of Lockheed Martin are priced at an 8.1% discount to fair value and offer 8.8% of capital appreciation from the current price.Lockheed Martin's reputation as the largest defense contractor in the world has allowed it to deliver 17 consecutive annual dividend increases (and most likely its 18th consecutive annual dividend increase come September), and as a result of Lockheed Martin's low payout ratio, I suspect there will be many more dividend increases in the future.Lockheed Martin's operating fundamentals remain quite strong, with FCF surging from Q1 2019 to Q1 2020, and an investment grade balance sheet.Shares of Lockheed Martin are also trading at what I estimate is an 8% discount to fair value, which is reasonably attractive in a somewhat overvalued broader market such as the one we find ourselves in at this time.Between its 2.7% yield, 7-8% annual earnings growth, and 0.8% annual valuation multiple expansion, I believe shares of Lockheed Martin are positioned to exceed my annual total return requirement of 10% over the next decade.As a result of the aforementioned points, I affirm my buy rating on shares of Lockheed Martin."
4349819,104097,2020-05-24T18:17:04-04:00,"Pockets of strength for dividend investors during this severe economic crisis are few, such as Lockheed Martin.No one is questioning their dividend sustainability presently, but the same was said for Boeing not long ago and thus the potential for lower defense spending is a real risk.Even if their operating cash flow was to decrease by 33%, they could still easily cover their dividend payments, but their share buybacks would largely cease.Since their leverage would still remain reasonably low in this scenario, it indicates that they would be able to sustain their dividend throughout this theoretical moderately severe downturn.Since nothing material has eventuated since publishing my previous article, I continue to believe that a neutral rating is appropriate.","There have been very few pockets of strength for dividend investors during this severe economic crisis, such as the global defense giant Lockheed Martin (LMT). It would be safe to say that few investors are questioning their ability to sustain their dividend at the moment; however, the same could have also been said for Boeing (BA) not all that long ago. Whilst I am certainly not suggesting the same fate awaits Lockheed Martin, it nonetheless is still worthwhile to stress test their dividend sustainability since a Presidential election is only months away and a key export market, Saudi Arabia, is under immense budgetary pressure.When assessing dividend coverage, I prefer to forgo using earnings per share and use free cash flow instead, since dividends are paid from cash and not from “earnings”. The graph included below summarizes their cash flows from the last quarter and previous three years.Image Source: Author.It should come as little surprise nor need much explanation that their historical dividend coverage has been excellent, with an average across 2017-2019 of 184.07%. Whilst it temporarily dropped below 100% during 2018, this was simply due to them making large additional discretionary pension contributions to the tune of $3.574b. Once removing these, their average dividend coverage for the same period of time increases to a very solid 234.83%.Unless something significant and largely unexpected changes, there are zero reasons to believe that they cannot continue covering their dividend in the future. To stress-test their dividend sustainability, two scenarios were envisioned whereby their operating cash flow decreases by 25% and 33% whilst capital expenditure remains unchanged, which utilized the average of 2017-2019 without the discretionary pension as a base.If either of these two scenarios came to fruition, it would see their operating cash flow decreased to only $5.125b and $4.578b, respectively, which as the graph above indicates is well beneath their results for 2019 of $7.311b. This would then see their free cash flow decrease to only $3.812b and $3.265b, respectively, which, based on my calculations, would still be sufficient to provide dividend coverage of 141.59% and 121.28%, respectively. Naturally, this would still be adequate to cover their dividend payments without the use of debt; however, it would mean the end of their generous share buybacks and significantly reduce any future growth.Since they could still theoretically cover their dividend payments in both of these scenarios, the impact on their financial position will ultimately determine whether they are still sustainable during these theoretical downturns. The three graphs included below summarize their financial position from the last quarter and previous three years.Image Source: Author.After reviewing these financial metrics, it easily can be seen that their current leverage is low and safe, as primarily evidenced by their net debt-to-EBITDA of 1.12 and interest coverage of 14.13. It is nonetheless still important to analyze the impact if either of the aforementioned two scenarios eventuated.It would be reasonable to assume that any decreases in operating cash flow were met with an equivalent decrease in EBITDA. After once again utilizing the average of 2017-2019 and net debt from the first quarter of 2020 as the bases, the two scenarios would see their net debt-to-EBITDA increase to only 1.67 and 1.87, respectively. These are both still reasonably low and safe, especially for a company during what would be a moderately severe downturn, which indicates that they would not be required to reduce their dividend in order to deleverage.Image Source: Author.Thankfully, their current liquidity is strong, as evidenced with a current ratio of 1.23 and a modest cash balance relative to their current liabilities and operating cash flow. Since they would still be producing free cash flow in the aforementioned two scenarios, there are no material reasons to be concerned about their liquidity. Since they are a very large company that is critical for national security, it would be very unlikely that they cannot access the necessary financing to meet any upcoming liabilities.Whilst it is still too early to know whether a potential new Presidential administration will see defense spending reduced, the risk exists nonetheless as the fiscal impacts from this coronavirus economic crisis will continue being wide-ranging. Thankfully, it appears that even in a moderately severe scenario, they will still be able to sustain their all-important dividend; however, it would obviously not stop their share price from decreasing. Since nothing material has eventuated since publishing my previous article, I believe that maintaining my neutral rating is appropriate.Notes: Unless specified otherwise, all figures in this article were taken from Lockheed Martin’s Q1 2020 10-Q, 2019 10-K and 2017 10-K SEC Filings, all calculated figures were performed by the author."
4338066,52502,2020-04-16T15:47:28-04:00,"Between the COVID-19 crisis and the oil price war Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries will suffer a severe fiscal shock, which will lead to severe cuts in military spending.Gulf countries have been a major driver of US military equipment exports growth in the past few years, which benefited Lockheed immensely, with some very lucrative contracts signed.In the absence of continued robust foreign sales revenue growth, profitability, as well as product development will suffer this decade, while Lockheed's stock price assumes continued growth.","As the COVID-19 crisis continues to develop from one day to the next, it is increasingly hard to predict what the stock market or any individual stocks will do this year, or perhaps even next. For shorter-term investors, investing will be more like a lottery, with very little analysis to base decisions on. For those of us whose average buy and hold and then sell time is measured in years, there are already some decent indicators in regards to what one might expect going forward, given how the crisis is changing the world. Lockheed Martin's (LMT) prospects for the future can be analyzed from two perspectives. The first is its past performance metrics, which are a testament to demand for its products as well as Lockheed's ability to execute its contracts profitably. The second has to do with analyzing its primary market, namely governments. It is in this regard that we have to examine the effects that the current crisis is having in regards to future government priorities, given the fiscal damage that is likely to be incurred as well as shifting priorities that governments may have this decade. One government, in particular, namely Saudi Arabia, which has been one of the main sources of revenue and profits growth for Lockheed will most likely have to make deep cuts to its military budget. Together with military budget cuts elsewhere, it may bring Lockheed's growth path to an end and perhaps even cause a reversal of fortunes for the company and its investors.Lockheed's full-year results for 2019 show continued improvement in revenues as well as profits. Total revenues hit $59.8 billion, compared with $53.8 billion in 2018. Net earnings increased from $5.05 billion in 2018 to $6.23 billion last year. Guidance for 2020 revenues was for $62.8 billion on the low-end and $64.3 billion on the high-end. It remains to be seen how things will turn out given possible disruptions to contracts, but even so, it is one of the few companies which are likely to continue being profitable this year and maintain revenue levels or perhaps even see an increase for the year.For now, what we know is that Lockheed continued to rack up sales contracts with Saudi Arabia. Just at the end of last year it was announced that Lockheed won a contract to deliver four multirole frigates to the Saudi military for $1.96 billion. Several smaller deals were also announced last year, but there was one $15 billion deal for missile defense systems that stands out. Saudi Arabia's neighbors including UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, and others have been buying weapons from Lockheed in the past decade as well, making this region a vital market for not only Lockheed Martin but also for the overall US arms industry. I cannot stress enough just how important it is for many expensive weapons design projects to achieve profitability through scaling up beyond what the US military is willing to purchase. These extra sales help fund innovation and development which is key to Lockheed's global technological leadership position.For decades now the US and the Persian Gulf Arab states have had a very special relationship. American military hegemony in the world allowed the US to offer protection for the newly rich petro-states in the Arab World. In return for that protection the Arab states used their petroleum riches to prop up the US dollar by only accepting America's fiat currency as payment for their oil. A large chunk of that money has been spent on buying American made military hardware, which helped increasingly sophisticated projects that needed scale to be viable. While other important markets around the world, including the members of the NATO alliance as well as US partners in Asia and elsewhere, helped the US arms industry become arguably the most advanced and sophisticated through providing the needed scale, the loss of the Gulf region clients will likely be a major blow.Data source: StatistaNote: I choose to use export value data for 2019 to prevent distortions caused by US government preferential prices and other effectsIn unadjusted terms Saudi Arabia bought $3.4 billion worth of weapons from the US in 2018. It has been the largest weapons importer in the world for the past five years or so. Its military budget has been ranked as third in the world, behind the US and China. Unlike most other countries that rank near the top in terms of military spending, it has a very limited ability to produce its own sophisticated weapons, which is why it is the top importer in the world.As I pointed out in a recent article entitled ""Saudis Will Cry Uncle"" assuming an average Brent price of oil of $30/barrel, Saudi Arabia is looking at a hole in the budget of about $123 billion for this year. This estimate does not include any additional fiscal pressures that the COVID-19 outbreak may put on the kingdom. Saudi Arabia's total FX reserves amount to about $500 billion, which may seem like a lot, but given that it currently imports about 80% of its food needs as well as many other goods and services that it is not self-sufficient in producing for the domestic market, it is not such a comforting cushion. It is a cushion that will be reduced drastically this year.Even if we are to assume that things will get back to some sort of normal in the not very distant future, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait and other countries in the region will have to take economic diversification and other investments more seriously. This means that there will be far less money available for defense spending, which was never going to be sustainable at the high levels that the Gulf countries, especially Saudi Arabia have been spending at. I should point out that even under normal circumstances with an assumed price of $58/barrel for Brent oil Saudi Arabia was set to run a deficit of $51 billion or 6.5% of GDP. In other words, even before this crisis it was on an unsustainable path. With welfare spending being a vital pillar of Saudi social stability the other big-spending item that will most likely be cut by default will be military spending. Saudi Arabia spent almost 9% of its GDP on the military in 2018. I do believe that it will bring it in line with most other countries around the world in the next few years.One of the main reasons why Saudi Arabia has been so aggressive with its military spending in the last few years has been the perceived need to counter Iran's creeping influence in the region. It spearheaded a disastrous military intervention in Yemen, where militias allied with Iran threatened to take over the whole country. It was also active in supporting militias in Syria against the Assad regime, which is closely aligned with Iran. In case that a confrontation with Iran would become a full-blown conflict, Saudi Arabia justifiably feels vulnerable. It needs to export oil and import massive volumes of food and other goods. All Iran has to do is disrupt those flows. Its domestically produced missiles, drones and other capacities are proving to be enough of a threat to those flows that Saudi Arabia felt it needed to acquire enough high-tech solutions to counter the threat.The successful strike on Saudi oil facilities executed by either Iran or its proxies with apparently rather simple drones which managed to evade Saudi air defenses exposed the limits of hi-tech defense systems when faced with unconventional tactics. It helped to highlight the shortcomings of making massive investments into technologies that are mostly meant to fight a conventional war while facing a potential opponent that managed to develop technologies and tactics which can get around such defenses. Cheap, plentiful and effective drones have the capacity to not only evade technologies that have been developed more for conventional planes and missiles, but they can also overwhelm defenses with their sheer volume that can potentially be launched at any particular target.In addition to the inadequacy of certain technologies in counteracting new threats such as cheap drones, the Iran threat is also arguably diminished by the fact that it is faced with an economic crisis, in large part due to the US sanctions. Iran may not necessarily have the economic resources to fight a war against its main regional rival. It may not even have the resources to adequately back some of its regional allied militias in Yemen and Iraq. A weakened Iran poses less of a threat to Saudi Arabia, UAE and others, therefore it may provide an extra incentive for these countries to cut back on their military spending.Lastly, we should acknowledge the fact that there is an emerging competition for Lockheed's products. Russia's S-400 air defense system seems to beat most competitors purely on price/effectiveness. In other words, systems like Lockheed's Patriot and THAAD are winning contracts not so much based on pure quality/price versus the S-400 but rather based on long-standing alliances and relationships. This too is not necessarily a sustainable situation. We already saw NATO member Turkey break ranks in this regard. India resisted US pressure and bought the system as well. Egypt, UAE, Qatar and Saudi Arabia expressed interest although it remains to be seen whether they will go for it or not.Since the 2008 crisis no continent performed worse economically than Europe. EU average growth since then has been about half that of the US. To make matters worse Western Europe is the region worst hit by the COVID-19 epidemic thus far. There has been a great deal of hope placed on the idea that President Trump's policy of pushing European countries to increase their military budgets to 2% of GDP will lead to growth in US arms sales this decade. The outbreak of the COVID-19 virus in Europe which led to most economic activities in the EU shutting down is likely to leave some very deep economic scars that will last beyond this year. Several countries such as Italy are set to see their government debt, which is already dangerously high rise even further.Most EU countries will likely not only look to keep government spending and deficits in check to stem the long-term fiscal deterioration that this crisis will inflict, but will also shift investment priorities towards more health system preparedness and other considerations, with military spending most likely losing out. For instance, there is a strong push in the EU to make the post-crisis recovery a green one. In other words, governments will be encouraged to invest heavily in cutting emissions resulting from economic activities. As far as investing in the military, there is also a strong push within the EU to shore up its domestic arms industry, so there are new projects, such as a new German-French fighter that is being implemented.With a P/E ratio based on last year's results currently at over 16 as I write this, Lockheed stock can only be considered to be reasonably priced if we are to assume continued growth in sales volumes and profits. Even though it is off of its all-time high price of just under $440/share, at a price of over $360/share, it did not see much of a correction when compared with the overall market. It is true that unlike most other companies around the world Lockheed is not as likely to lose revenues this year, because most of it will come from contracts that were agreed to in previous years. Beyond this year however new international contracts will become harder and harder to come by. It remains to be seen whether American resolve to maintain current military spending levels this decade will materialize or not and at least help preserve Lockheed's domestic market. My guess is that something will have to give, because the market may not tolerate trillion dollars or higher deficits indefinitely, neither will the Federal Reserve be able to maintain a policy of propping up the US credit market year after year. In the last two months it increased its balance sheet by about two trillion dollars. In the meantime, there is growing pressure on the US budget with a perceived need to spend elsewhere, such as on infrastructure, education, green tech and so on.When looking at past data and trends, it is hard to argue that Lockheed Martin's stock is not a strong buy going forward. There has been a steady growth in revenues, and the growth has been profitable. For instance, look at its dividend cover. Its full-year earnings per share were $22, while its dividend per share was $9 for the full year. Its dividend cover ratio, therefore, is 2.44. Any ratio with a value higher than 1 tends to be considered decent. Lockheed's dividend looks as safe as it can be at this point. Currently, the dividend yield is just under 2.6% which is not particularly generous, but there is very little indication that it may be cut any time soon, which is not something that can be claimed about many other companies these days.Lockheed stock is priced for the data we have from the past, which is expected to be seen in future trends as well, whether in regards to growth, or profitability. Given that its sales are based on the future willingness of governments to spend on military hardware at a time when most governments around the world will see their fiscal positions devastated by this year's events, it should not be taken for granted. It is arguably outright foolish to expect this decade to be the same as the last one, given the way we started. Things will be very different and it does not look like Lockheed will be among the winners."
4358595,105308,2020-07-15T10:14:33-04:00,"Lockheed Martin has lagged the market's rally, trading at an attractive valuation.Prudent EPS and DPS growth estimates point towards double-digit medium-term returns.A sector-like valuation multiple expansion makes a $500 share price more than likely.Despite revenue diversification risks, the stock holds the potential for market-beating returns.","Lockheed Martin (LMT) has surprised me lately. Like every other stock, shares plummeted during the Coronavirus selloff. While there has been a partial recovery, it has been trending downwards over the past month. In the meantime, the rest of the market has been hitting all-time highs by the day. The reason LMT has surprised me is that the company's cash flows are extremely secured and stable, in a growth sector, with a very attractive valuation. At its current price, it seems like the market has mispriced shares. In a valuation-agnostic world where much of the tech sector has skyrocketed to absurd valuations, Lockheed Martin offers a magnificent opportunity, priced exceptionally attractively.Source: Business InsiderIn this article, we will:Image source: goodfon.comLockheed Martin has been delivering astonishing profitability over the past decade. Excluding a one-off charge in 2017, the company has never reported lower EPS than the year prior, achieving a CAGR of 12.1% over this period. DPS has also seen a CAGR of 14.6% since 2010, highlighting management's commitment to returning capital to shareholders.Source: Data from Seeking Alpha, AuthorInvestors all over the globe have been worried over the past few months, as the Coronavirus crisis has resulted in multiple dividend cuts across the board. There are few companies whose cash flows and profitability are well-secured during this pandemic, and Lockheed Martin is proudly on the list.In its Q1 report, the company reassured investors of any distress, as revenues and EPS increased by 9% and 1.5%, respectively. Moreover, being confident, management guided for FY2020 EPS of $23.65-$23.95, indicating no real adverse effects from the virus, as the profitability is still growing on a YoY basis.The reason Lockheed Martin's management is so confident with guidance is the same reason investors should be sleeping well at night. That is, Uncle Sam backs the majority of the company's revenues. Many intricacies exist in the current market environment, but one thing is for sure. Uncle Sam's pockets are pretty deep, and they never run out of sweet dollars. The U.S. government is unlikely to ""run out"" of money since it can always raise taxes or literally print more of it. Therefore, the company's largest customer is well-secured.In fact, the U.S. government accounted for 70% of FY2019's sales. Another 28% of turnover is coming from other international customers, whose credibility and reliability are also robust, as they are usually themselves, or tied to, governmental entities.With a robust defense and aerospace backlog in its arsenal, we expect the stock to keep on delivering on its consistent EPS growth, in-line with management's guidance. However, to be prudent, we are going to estimate a more cautious outlook, in which medium-term EPS CAGR is 10% (way lower than the 5-year average of 15%), and DPS CAGR is 7.5% (against its 5-year average of 9.3%). Plugging in these growth rates, we get the following projections. Source: AuthorGoing back as to why Lockheed Martin is an attractive investment, let's consider the future returns an investor is expected to enjoy based on our estimates. If shares retain their current P/E ratio of around 15 in the medium term (2025), investors are expected to enjoy a CAGR total return of 12.84%. If, on the other hand, the stock undergoes a valuation expansion towards its historical average of around 18X earnings, that figure jumps to a considerably attractive 16.6%. The reason for such charming, double-digit returns, is the result of the company's low valuation, extremely secured cash flows, and a juicy dividend yield of 2.75%. Source: AuthorSounds like a lot? Well, it's not out of the ordinary for the stock to deliver such returns. Despite the recent decline in its share price, the stock has still managed to return a CAGR of 20.6% with dividends reinvested. In other words, a $10,000 investment in 2010 would have turned to nearly $66,000 today.Source: dqydj.comMoreover, keep in mind that we used management's guidance as FY2020's EPS, which the company has been historically beating. Analysts, in fact, expect slightly higher EPS of $24.12. Still, with our prudent estimates, EPS is more than likely to hit $28.98 by 2022, not only based on the company's historical performance and secured government contracts but also from its consistent stock repurchases, which have reduced the share count by a whopping 36% over the past 15 years. An excellent illustration is how the company kept on repurchasing stock during the last financial crisis, as a result of its quality cash flows, as we have mentioned.With such EPS and a fair valuation multiple of around 18, this implies a 2022 share price of about $521. We believe that this valuation is very reasonable since many of the company's sector peers trade at similar if not higher multiples. Examples include:To include an additional margin for error, we expect a share price of $500, in 2022, if the company delivers on these expectations.Despite Lockheed's many qualities and reliable customers, there are some risks to consider. For once, governmental entities are incredibly secure, but at the same time, the company's revenues are not diversified enough. Defense budgets have been favorable for defense companies on a worldwide basis over the past decade. However, if a potential recession occurs as a result of the pandemic or other facts, these budgets may be reduced in the future, limiting shareholder returns. The company is financially solid and has historically withstood such cases (e.g., repurchasing during the last financial crisis), but the risk remains.In regards to revenue diversification, 70% of sales are attributed to the U.S. government, 60% of which arise from the Department of Defense. The department's budget is not guaranteed to keep on increasing over time, as was the case from 2010 to 2017, despite Lockheed proliferating during this period.Source: StatistaMoreover, as management expressed in their latest 10-K, the F-35 program, which consists of multiple developments, production, and sustainment contracts, is the company's most extensive project. It represented 27% of total net sales in FY2019 and is anticipated to serve a higher percentage of its sales in the future. Again, the company's diversification, in terms of its pipeline this time, could be contracted. Should anything regarding the F-35 program go wrong, the company's revenues and, in turn, profitability is most likely to be very adversely affected.Lockheed Martin has been a high quality, double-digit return compounder, with an impressive track record of shareholder returns. Considering the company's consistent backlog, management's confident guidance, and the stock's attractive valuation, we believe that shares are extremely attractive. Investors are set to benefit not only from the robust underlying EPS and DPS growth but also from the potential for a well-deserved, and in-line with its sector, valuation multiple expansion.According to our prudent estimates, which indicate a share price of $500 and beyond by 2022, we forecast double-digit returns in the medium term. Unfortunately, the U.S. dividend withholding tax is not the most favorable for European investors, reducing our appetite to buy shares. Were we located in the U.S, however, in the current valuation-agnostic world, we would hit the buy button in a heartbeat, at the current price levels."
4331210,104941,2020-03-11T13:42:14-04:00,"Lockheed Martin has taken a beating over the past week, which has created an attractive entry point for investors.Defense spending has steadily increased over America's 200+ years of existence, and it shows no signs of abating.Even if it were to abate, Lockheed Martin has an inherent hedging mechanism: its space and aeronautics segment.I rate Lockheed Martin as a buy.","Source: LockheedMartin.comMy secular bullishness on aerospace and defense stocks is predicated on five key pillars.These five pillars serve as the basis on which I will construct the following investment narrative, and in light of these five pillars, I have built stakes in Lockheed Martin (LMT), L3Harris Technologies (LHX), and Northrop Grumman (NOC).The Trump administration and the recent coronavirus outbreak have clearly highlighted the stark divide between the political realities of China and the U.S. That is, one operates as an authoritarian, self-avowed communist superpower; whereas, the other operates as a democratic (though not perfect) nation focused on empowering individuals through creating an environment where life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are seen as rights.With that being said, both entities are vying for global hegemony, and as we've seen over the last 70 years of U.S. dominance, he or she who carries the biggest stick and controls the world's reserve currency influences the policies of the rest of the 190 or so countries. In the 21st and 22nd centuries, China wants to be that power, hence, we've witnessed a dramatic rise in military spending by the CCP, as can be seen below.Source: MotherJones.comHere's another chart to illustrate the accelerating rate at which China spends on its military.Source: www.brookings.eduAs can be seen above, China has dramatically increased its defense spending in a bid to compete with the United States as the world's most influential superpower. In response, the U.S. has accelerated its defense spending as well.Source: Washington PostAs can be seen above, U.S. defense spending has re-accelerated, and in light of the growing Chinese threat, this spend should only continue to grow.My line of reasoning, in this case, can be summed up by the following points:This leads to the conclusion that defense spending will continue to accelerate, which is reality. Even if the world were to achieve complete peace (which is far from happening in the next 100 years), the next frontier of defense would be space, where there are far more threats to us than those on earth.Companies such as Lockheed Martin, Northrup Grumman, and L3Harris Technologies are indispensable to the United States. That is, their work cannot be outsourced to a cheaper international alternative. This has been extraordinarily highlighted by the supply chain disruptions that have occurred in the U.S. as a result of our reliance on China as the world's cheap manufacturing hub.NAFTA (Now USMCA) was signed so that western industrial democracies could coalesce and form a union that would champion certain political ideologies through combined economic might. We have forsaken those ideals in pursuit of short-term profits and have damaged our self-reliance and national security as a result. While masks and certain technologies might not be as vital to national defense as, for example, fighter jets and space defense technology, the combination of the coronavirus disruptions and China's aggressive military spend should only further solidify and fuel defense spending in the U.S.Defense contractors, such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing (BA), and Northrup Grumman, employ a tactic known as political engineering, whereby, these defense contractors establish operations in as many locations across the U.S. as possible. This leads to the creation of jobs in numerous political districts across the United States.In the ""Who We Are"" page of Lockheed Martin's website, they claim to have suppliers to the company in every single U.S. state.So, the U.S. Congress is certainly not incentivized to reduce the flow of money that creates jobs in their communities and enhances national security. Instead, there is incentive to actually expand the defense budget so as to create more jobs in their respective political districts.This is further evidenced by a chart that Lockheed Martin published with respect to the economic impact from the F-35 fighter jet. It's a very interesting, interactive map that can be found here. Now, to be clear, I am not ascribing intent with respect to Lockheed Martin or any defense contractor for that matter. I am only stating that they have operations in many locations, and the U.S. Congress is, therefore, incentivized to support these companies so as to ensure these jobs stay in their political districts, which, in turn, appeases the constituencies of the elected officials.Space is a growing frontier, and Lockheed Martin is focused like a laser on the segment. Below, we see how Lockheed Martin breaks out its revenues:Source: Lockheed Martin FY19 10-KAs can be seen above, Lockheed Martin's Space segment accounts for approximately 16% of sales and grew 14% yoy from 2018 to 2019. Its space segment consists of products found below.Source: Lockheed Martin's TwitterJust as a city, county, state, or globalized economy needs a defense/police force, so too will space. Such a reality is depicted below.Source: Lockheed Martin's TwitterAnd, in my last article on Lockheed Martin, I discussed the implications of Space Force. While some readers thought it wasn't wise to base an investment thesis on the coming demands of the Space Force, it's still worth noting that this segment of the military will demand hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of Lockheed Martin equipment over the coming two decades.If you're a new reader, here's an introduction to how I value stocks. If you've been here before, feel free to skip to what you know matters. I call my valuation model the ""L.A. Stevens Valuation Model"", whereby I arrive at the true intrinsic value of a company from a few angles; at the end of which, I provide a precise estimate as to what you could expect in the way of total returns. Here's an outline of the model:So, let's get started!In order to complete step 1, we must make a few notable assumptions, a few of which are based on consensus analyst estimates that are based on company guidance.Source: YChartsTraditional Discounted Cash Flow ModelSource: Data compiled from YChartsTherefore, Lockheed Martin is, currently, overvalued by about 3.4% (at a price of $369), but this is far from the end of the story.Let's check out how Lockheed Martin's capital return programs will influence the rate at which the company grows free cash flow per share throughout the 2020s.In step 2 of the L.A. Stevens Valuation Model, I assess the effect of share count fluctuations on the rate at which free cash flow per share grows.Source: YChartsAs can be seen above, Lockheed Martin has prolifically repurchased shares over the last decade, decreasing shares outstanding by a little over 27% over the last decade, which is incredible to say the least.With this in mind, we must adjust the rate at which free cash flow per share will grow in our discounted cash flow model.Discounted Cash Flow Model With Share Repurchases IncorporatedSource: Data compiled from YChartsOnce I factored in a 25% reduction in shares outstanding, which is 2% less than what was achieved over the last decade, I arrived at an effective free cash flow per share growth rate of 7.04%, which resulted in a fair value of $446.35.So, in light of the fuel that will be applied to free cash flow per share growth through buybacks, Lockheed Martin is undervalued by about 17.13% as of a share price of $369.87.But we're still not done! So far, we've determined the extent to which Lockheed Martin is undervalued, but we haven't determined total return one should expect.Step 3: Normalizing Share Price For Growth Post-10yrIn step 3, I normalize the share price for post 10-year growth. The discounted cash flow model doesn't truly determine what future expected returns will be; so, therefore, we must make one last assumption, i.e., what its price to free cash multiple will be at the end of 10 years.Source: Data compiled from YChartsTherefore, if one were to buy Lockheed Martin at $369, they should expect an annualized return of 8.26% based on share price appreciation alone.Now, let's factor in the dividend. Below, I provide a depiction of what investors can expect to receive if they were to buy Lockheed Martin in a Roth IRA and if they were to DRIP it.Notable assumptions:Source: HughCalc.orgIn light of the above DRIP scenario, one could expect to receive 10.87% total annualized return if they were to buy Lockheed Martin at ~$370.The greatest risk to Lockheed Martin would be a dramatic reduction in spending on defense. Certain political factions could dramatically reduce defense spending so as to fund social welfare programs or reduce the U.S.'s growing budget deficit.The returns that I illustrated in this article are highly, highly conservative. Over the last decade, Lockheed Martin has grown its free cash flow at between 12-15% annualized; it has raised its dividend by about 15% each year, and it has a backlog of orders worth $144B.Therefore, even if everything goes as poorly as possible, you will still generate market beating returns. If everything goes very well, i.e. free cash flow grows 10%+ each year and the dividend is raised at a rate higher than 10% each year, your returns will be in the mid to high teens, and you will decimate the market.I'm betting on the latter in my L.A. Stevens Investment Fund, although it's incumbent upon you to decide for yourself.As always, I'm very grateful for your readership! Please remember to follow, and happy investing!"
4321553,103639,2020-02-05T09:02:31-05:00,"The space sector is experiencing strong growth in revenues, earnings and indeed stock prices.It's easy to think the New Space Race favors young, unprofitable companies like SpaceX or Virgin Galactic.In fact the majority of value growth to date has accrued to the old-line defense companies - their revenue growth and cashflows are enjoying a boost from their space-sector activities.Some of these companies also pay a solid, safe, growing dividend yield.  We walk you through five such space stocks below.Our top dividend pick in the sector is Lockheed Martin.","DISCLAIMER: This article is not directed at, nor intended to be relied upon by any UK recipients.

Cestrian Capital Research Inc or its employees or the author of this article or related persons may have a position in any investments mentioned in this article. Any opinions or probabilities expressed in this report are those of the author as of the article date of publication and are subject to change without notice.If you're not following the New Space Race - otherwise known as the Second Cold War - let us walk you through the backdrop for a moment.The headlines hitting your screen every day about the Second Coming of Space, be they from CNBC, your favorite investment bank (pick one - Morgan Stanley, UBS, Credit Suisse), are quite warm and fuzzy. Space is cool once again. Whether the coverage be about rich folks' upcoming rocket rides into space with Virgin Galactic (SPCE), Elon Musk's SpaceX (SPACE) re-using rockets, building a human habitat on the Moon (SPACE again) or sending crash test dummies in sports cars into solar orbit (yes, SPACE again), all this stuff is happy days indeed. And truly the engineering of such feats is incredible, as are the much-reduced launch costs.Now, this as you can imagine is already driving some ambitious capital-gain-focused business plans. SPCE has had its own spell of tulip mania - and we expect more such speculative stocks will follow. See our note on that topic here.We think the mother lode of space-sector IPOs will be SpaceX (SPACE) if and when it comes to market. This is the big disruptor in grownup space business, which is to say federal government business. SPACE is in essence a trucking business. It has cheap re-usable rocket-trucks and it can ship a whole lot of tonnage to the International Space Station for a lot less money than its competitors. Pretty soon the company is expected to be able to ship astronauts to the same location for a lot less money than its competitors. (The crewed program will bill NASA $2.6bn vs. the $4.2bn that Boeing (BA) is charging to do the same thing).But don't expect a dividend anytime soon from Virgin Galactic, SpaceX, or any of the VC-backed moon-shot stocks that may follow.Equally, don't think that the New Space Race is all about performing a burn of investors' money in the hope of reaching higher and higher orbits.Because here's the really surprising thing. Space is driving a whole lot of value in a whole lot of old-line defense companies that pay safe-as-houses dividends. And because the space sector is growing - fast - we believe the growth will help to boost the absolute dividend payments from those stocks. Right now, these defense stocks trade at what we think are acceptable multiples given their growth - and that means that yields are pretty good as a function of their safety, certainly in the current interest rate environment.We'll walk you through a handful of those stocks. Our top dividend pick amongst them is Lockheed Martin (LMT) - we explain why below.Space is undoubtedly cool and exciting. The first truly pure-play public space stock is Virgin Galactic (SPCE) - we cover them - see our notes on the company here. For a big enough check, currently $250k, they'll give you a smart set of pajamas - sorry, a spacesuit - and fly you to just-about-space and back. We imagine the trip will be incredible.But the real money in space is arising because space is becoming militarized. Contrary to most every utterance of every spacefaring nation, and contrary to various international treaties, it's now quietly accepted that space will be a contested domain and an acceptable theater for conflict of Earthly origin.This doesn't mean Star Wars stuff - not for a while anyway. It does mean that military satellites are considered legitimate targets for attack either by other spacecraft or from the ground. Both China and India have tested anti-satellite weaponry successfully. Right now it is thought that a Russian satellite is shadowing a US military satellite, with no good intentions it seems.If you think back to the original Space Race, which began in the late 1950s and peaked with the Apollo Moon missions in the late 1960s and early 1970s, it was entirely political and military in nature. The US was locked in a cold war with the former Soviet Union. Whilst hard to comprehend today, when the poor economy and living conditions of the Soviet Union are now known, there was real concern that the Soviet Union had employed a different economic and political system to good effect - that it was delivering greater military might, more success in space (biggest rockets; first satellite to orbit the Earth; first human to orbit the Earth) and therefore that it would appeal more as the post-WWII order began to solidify and smaller states leaned to the US or to the Soviet Union. Kennedy, who by NASA's own word (check the NASA History Division) was not particularly interested in space, saw that US boots on the Moon would deliver a crushing blow to the USSR. He was right. Once the Soviet Chief Designer of rockets passed away and once spaceflight got hard - really hard, with difficult orbital mechanics, on-orbit rendezvous, lander modules and so on - and really expensive - the USSR could no longer compete. The US space program, together with its very close cousin the ballistic missile program, was one of the key factors that exhausted the USSR financially and led to its collapse. (Well, that and an economic system that simply doesn't produce enough wealth to be self-sustaining).Not only has space always been about demonstrating political might, the technology enabling that display has always been shared with the defense industry. NASA launch vehicles and large intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) are sometimes more or less interchangeable. The guidance systems developed to fly rockets are also used in ICBMs. And today, the leading merchant producer of solid rocket motors, Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD), is an emerging leader in propulsion systems for next-gen hypersonic missiles. Space is defense, and defense is space.The real driver of economic returns in the space industry right now is the Second Cold War. With China - and maybe with India too. Both are spacefaring nations and both have expansionist foreign policy. Today China has a robotic spacecraft exploring the far side of the Moon - a place that US spacecraft have yet to visit. The Chinese Chang-e 4 rover relays its signal back to Earth via a comms satellite in lunar orbit. Again, not something the US has ever achieved. India just failed to land a robotic mission on the Moon but we anticipate it will try again soon. At the same time, China and Russia are touting hypersonic missile technology that they say is deployable today. And the overall backdrop is the gradual withdrawal of the US from its hegemonic position atop the world table. The US' retreat to within itself has certainly been embraced by the current administration but in truth it began under the previous President. The price of this retreat is the increasing belligerence of other states. And the price of that ... is big defense spending.Among the space/defense companies we cover, Northrop Grumman (NOC), Lockheed Martin (LMT), and Raytheon (RTN) have already reported Q4 and full year 2019 earnings. What was common to all three was growth in backlog. ""Backlog"" represents long-term orders, usually placed by a federal agency, that cannot yet be recognized as revenue.Here's how LMT, NOC and RTN are performing on the backlog front right now.Source: LMT, NOC, RTN SEC filings.In each case, backlog is growing at or above the typical rate of organic revenue growth for the defense sector. 10-20% growth in annual orders is more akin to a growth sector, not a federal contractor stalwart. These multi-year order books mean we can expect to see higher rates of revenue growth among these stocks for awhile yet.Here's how cash is piling up at these companies.First, LMT. Deleverage of 1.3x TTM EBITDA in five years (whilst also increasing dividends, conducting buybacks etc) - and 0.4x TTM EBITDA in 2019 alone.Second, NOC.Source: Company SEC filingsAgain, delevered by 0.5x TTM EBITDA in 2019 alone.And finally, Raytheon (RTN).Source: Company SEC filings.Now in virtually a net cash position.And, turning to dividends, here's what a strong balance sheet is doing for each of these companies. Enabling solid dividend yields and plenty of runway to pay the dividend for some time yet.Below for completeness we include Park Aerospace (PKE), a niche materials supplier for hypersonics and rocket nozzles, amongst other things, and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), the #1 federal employer of space-sector staff in the US. We also include AT&T (T) to benchmark against - it's a great dividend stock that we also cover and know well.Our pick of the space crop here for dividends is Lockheed Martin, for the following reasons:For what it's worth, we think the stock has solid capital gain potential too.For all the above reasons we're at Buy on Lockheed Martin.Cestrian Capital Research, Inc"

Any opinions or probabilities expressed in this report are those of the author as of the article date of publication and are subject to change without notice.Lockheed Martin (LMT) stock has enjoyed a wonderful few years. Over pretty much any period you care to measure, it has outperformed the S&P500. Here's the 5-year chart for instance - on a total return (including dividends) basis.Source: YCharts.comUp just shy of 3x the increase in the S&P500. We've covered the stock for awhile now here on SA. You can find our prior work on the business here. But if you want the elevator pitch, the company is well managed, is winning serial large contracts from the US Federal government and other such governments, grows well, has strong margins and generates plenty of cash. Oh, and it pays a dividend too. What's not to like?Here's the numbers to the end of 2019:Again, pretty good, right? Sustained revenue growth from 2015 onwards, increasing operating margins, and cashflow margins in the low double digits - that's cashflow margins, after capex, after change in working capital. You know, the actual money the business produces before it pays the IRS or its lenders. The benefit of which can be see in the deleverage.And here's the dividend growth. Unbroken over ten years.Source: YCharts.comSo - capital gain and dividend growth too. It's been a great stock to own.LMT headed into the crisis slowly, eventually caught up with the market's decline, then bounced upwards rapidly and has kept climbing. Here's the stock's percentage change in price YTD, again vs. the S&P500 proxy ETF SPY.Having been at Buy last year and then moved to Neutral as part of moving to 100% cash (you can see our note on that here), we had LMT on our shopping list for stocks to buy once the selling stopped. For our subscribers, we went back to buy before the open on 26 March. The stock is up some 14% since then, vs. around 2% for the S&P500. That's a nice return in just a few days - a little quicker than we expected, in fact.So is LMT a good stock to own in this brave new world?We think fundamentally, yes. Here's some of the reasons why:Every company is saying the same thing right now as regards 2020 guidance - ""we don't know"". And the market knows this but has still ticked up some 10% from its lowest point. So in a world where guidance is in essence suspended and where most companies can't tell you what the cash inflow will look like this year and where many of those companies are highly levered - we think LMT looks in good shape.The one real risk we see is that LMT cuts its dividend, to lower its cash outflow. We can see that being a problem were it to come to pass. In the last earnings call, the company said it believes some 50% of its shareholders are there mainly for the dividend. The rational thing for all companies to do right now is to suspend dividends, but we've yet to see a major enterprise do that due to the furore it would cause among shareholders. So it's probable that LMT simply raise their leverage a little in order to maintain dividend payout. Aside from that, if the market takes another downturn it will likely bring LMT down with it, but again, we expect LMT to rise up out of any such scenario fairly quickly.So in short: we're back at Buy as of 27 March, up nicely since then, and indeed will be adding a little more on Friday 3 April. Cestrian Capital Research, Inc - 2 April 2020."
4324607,104579,2020-02-16T13:41:38-05:00,"Lockheed shares are up 25% since I added them to my portfolio.The company pays an attractive and growing dividend and continues to be a beneficiary of increased defense spending.Going forward, I expect continued share price appreciation as results continue to be consistent.","SourceLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has been a beneficiary of the growing defense budgets of countries around the world. Being a premier manufacturer of planes, helicopters, missiles, and more, the company continues to see revenue rise in almost any economic environment. Due to defense being necessary and technology always evolving, the company has a stream of revenue that is as close to guaranteed as you can get. Last year, shares pulled back after a rather good earnings report. I took the opportunity to finally add shares to my portfolio. I have long waited to initiate a position in the company and missed my chance many times to take a stake. The move has proven to be successful as the shares have risen a nice 25% from my entry point. I took another chance to add 30% more shares to my position after another pullback from another earnings release. The company should continue to grow and benefit from demand for defense-related products. Furthermore, margins are never really pressured as the products are generally proprietary and not found elsewhere.In the fourth-quarter earnings report, Lockheed reported earnings that beat on both the top and bottom lines.Source: Seeking AlphaThe company saw revenue grow 10.2% and earnings grow 20.5%. The company reported full-year earnings of $21.95, which were well above its guidance for earnings, $21.15 at the top end.The company reported full-year sales of almost $60 billion, which represented revenue growth of over 11%.Source: Earnings SlidesAdditionally, the company continued to return a healthy amount of its cash to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends.2020 guidance shows that the company expects to have another great year.Source: Earnings SlidesEarnings are expected to grow another 10% and revenue about 7-9%. Cash from operations in the fourth quarter of 2019 was $1.5 billion. The company can report lumpy cash flows, however, as it still funds its pension on an ongoing basis. This quarter the company did not make any pension contributions. Seeing the pension being funded is always a positive as it prevents a future overhang of liability from becoming a problem. For the full year in 2020, the company sees cash from operations coming in over $7.6 billion.This should come easily as the company had a record backlog up 10% to $144 billion.The growth in backlog every year for the last five years shows that demand is not slowing down and that growth should continue across the board. I expect the continued growth in the backlog to help support sales in times of economic hardship. Of course, backlog could change, but given the non-cyclical nature of the business, it is probably safe to say that the company has two years' worth of revenue already in the pipeline. With continued growth in every division, we can see why Lockheed shares continue to trade at a higher P/E multiple than other defense sector companies.Source: 10-KStrong growth in every division should give investors confidence that the company is firing on all cylinders. It is not always the case that every division within a company will see harmonious growth, so seeing this is great. The space division should continue to see growth as the expansion of private sector space exploration and development will cause the need for manufactured components. Also the potential for a future military division for space ventures could help immensely.The company continues to improve its balance sheet as well.Source: 10-KThe company reduced pension liabilities by about 1/3 in the last year, which is a huge improvement. While net debt is now at its lowest levels in years. As we saw earlier, the company is going to generate around $7.6 billion in cash this year. With the dividend costing about $2.5 billion, there is plenty left over for share repurchases, debt reduction, investments, and pension funding. This amount of cash generation and a stronger balance sheet will continue to let the company focus on future opportunities. With technological advances and competition continuing to heat up, Lockheed needs to ensure it has premier products to win contracts with or else its R&D spend is a loss.The company expects there to be significant increases in its CH-53K deliveries in the coming years.Source: Investor PresentationThis will be a boost to future revenues, and the potential for international sales will further more add to the demand.Perhaps the most exciting part about Lockheed's future is the growing need for replacement aircraft.Source: Investor PresentationWith many of the aircraft aging quickly and the needs from the military changing, the demand for new machines will only pick up. This is a positive, long-term trend for Lockheed Martin and inevitably its stock.Additionally, not only is offensive military spend important, but also a growing need for defensive equipment has become important.Source: Investor PresentationLockheed has no shortage of equipment, and brilliantly as it continues to develop new offensive equipment capabilities, it increased demand for defense. Lockheed has been working on laser technology, bringing what was long fiction to reality. As this happens, it by nature creates the need for defense systems that can withstand laser attacks. This will only continue to develop its portfolio of options and the need for defense against one more possible attack method.Knowing the growth for revenue is strong, it is only a matter of paying a fair price for the stock. While such tailwinds create a higher growth rate and thus higher valuation metrics, every now and then the market offers an opportunity that shouldn't be overlooked.Looking at valuation versus peers, we see the following:Data by YChartsLockheed trades at the highest forward P/E ratio, but the shares also offer the second highest yield and one of the lowest PEG ratios. This means investors probably are getting a fair deal considering the better-than-expected growth but small premium assigned to future earnings.Looking at valuation metrics for the last five years, we can see where shares should generally trade.Source: MorningstarThe shares trade above their five-year average P/S ratio, but trade below their average P/E ratio. Lockheed currently trades at a discount to its forward P/E and trades at a discount to its cash flow. Given all the above information, it is safe to say that the stock isn't overvalued, but isn't undervalued by much either. However, getting shares at such a low forward multiple now with guidance issued may be a good deal. Investors should remember this company consistently grows sales and will continue to see its valuation grow alongside it.Looking at historical yield to see if it is above average or below is one of my favorite methods to see if a stock is undervalued.Source: YieldChartThe average yield for LMT is 2.37%, with shares currently yielding 2.2%; this means shares are trading close to in line with their average yield. This means the shares are not over or undervalued in this case either. I see the potential being in the next dividend raise.If the company raises the dividend close to its five-year average growth rate of 11.4%, let's say 10%, the shares should offer a future yield around $10.40, which would represent a 2.37% yield at today's prices. This would be right in line with the average dividend yield. Additionally, the company has been raising its dividend for 17 years, with the last increase being 9.61% to $2.40 per quarter or $9.60 annually. Continuing to grow the dividend in the future is a focus for management, and there is plenty of room to do so with a payout ratio of less than 50%.Lockheed Martin offers investors the chance to benefit off the growing demand for defense needs by countries around the world. A growing population and new technologies will continue to grow the demand for a variety of products. Additionally, aging machines in the defense fleets around the world will create a need for continued replacement along with additions. This will benefit Lockheed Martin for many years to come and is evident by the large backlog already present. The company faces little risk other than a lower defense budget from the United States, its largest customer, but it will be very hard to do this with nations around the world ramping up. If the shares pull back again from here, I will be adding more to my new position. The brief pullback after earnings was a great chance to add a great company at a fair price to the portfolio."

The company has performed very well in recent years and continues to dominate many advanced technology industries. In fact, Lockheed Martin increased the sales and operating profits of all its major business segments in 2019.While Lockheed Martin is suffering from the negative impact of the coronavirus like many others in the industry, the company's long-term prospects remain bright. The escalating US-China geopolitical tensions, which are growing considerably worse, will only further bolster Lockheed Martin's business. Lockheed Martin could see a great deal of upward momentum with defense and security concerns intensifying.Global geopolitical tensions have been ramping up even before the current pandemic. With violent protests springing up all around the world, global instability appears to be on the rise. The US-China relationship, in particular, is growing even more unstable as these two nations' interests continue to diverge.The trade war, Hong Kong protests, and coronavirus outbreaks are just a few of the major events putting the US-China relationship under strain. Many experts even think that the US and China are headed towards a Cold War. Such a scenario will put Lockheed Martin in an increasingly vital position.Lockheed Martin reported net sales of $59.8 billion in 2019. A large percentage of the sales came directly from the US Government. In fact, 61% of Lockheed Martin's total net sales were from the Department of Defense alone. With growing global threats, Lockheed Martin will likely see even more business from the US government moving forward.Given that the US government accounted for 71% of Lockheed Martin sales in 2019, growing national security concerns will only benefit the company. Lockheed Martin currently provides the US government with some of the most advanced military technology in the industry. Lockheed Martin provides advanced Aeronautics, MFC (missiles and fires control), RMS (rotary and mission systems) and space technologies to countries around the world.Lockheed Martin's major businesses have all experienced impressive growth from 2018 to 2019.Source: Lockheed MartinAll of Lockheed Martin's major business segments have experienced growth from 2018 to 2019. While Lockheed Martin's businesses are firing on all cylinders, the company's space segment could be one of the most important growth drivers moving forward. While Lockheed Martin's space sales only grew 11% from 2018 to 2019 (less than MFC and Aeronautics), this segment may have the highest growth potential out of all the company's businesses.Lockheed Martin space segment is still one of the company's smaller businesses with sales of ~$11 billion in 2019. Despite this, space offers Lockheed Martin huge opportunity to expand its business. The space frontier is opening up in ways never seen before. A new generation of highly innovative companies like SpaceX (SPACE) and Blue Origin (BORGN) have made space an incredibly promising new market. Innovative technologies like reusable rockets have opened up new commercial opportunities and even new markets.Lockheed Martin is one of the few companies embracing the space trend. The company's space segment is growing its backlog faster than most of its other businesses. Not only is Lockheed Martin involved in more traditional space activities like satellites and payloads, but it is also involved in the cutting edge space technologies.The company recently delivered the Mars 2020 Rover Aeroshell to the Kennedy Space Center. The Aeroshell is designed to protect and encapsulate the Mars 2020 Rover during its space mission and atmospheric entry. Lockheed Martin is one of the few companies capable of developing such advanced technologies and will likely play an increasingly integral role in pushing the space frontier.Space is a highly promising market for Lockheed Martin.Source: Lockheed MartinWhile Lockheed Martin has an incredibly diverse product portfolio, the company is incredibly reliant on its F-35. In fact, the company's F-35 program accounted for 27% of consolidated net sales and 69% of Aeronautics' sales in 2019. With how much money has been spent on the F-35, it is not surprising to see these aircraft comprise such a large portion of the company's sales.There are obvious risks of having such a high percentage of sales concentrated on one product line. A downturn in F-35 sales could have a disproportionate impact on the company. In fact, Turkey's recent removal from the F-35 program is already expected to materially impact Lockheed Martin's cash flows.The rise of artificial intelligence and advanced robotics could also put more competitive pressure on Lockheed Martin. The growing versatility of UAS (unmanned aerial systems) like drones could even make the fighter jet obsolete in the long term. While Lockheed Martin definitely has the resources and expertise to adapt to such changing technologies, the company still has a lot invested in traditional defense technologies like fighter jets.Lockheed Martin's reliance on the F-35 could present many risks moving forward.Source: Lockheed MartinLockheed Martin is currently firing on all cylinders. The company currently has a record backlog of ~$144 billion, which will likely only increase in 2020. Moreover, the company reported a record operating profit of $6.574 billion and $2.556 billion in dividends in 2019. Lockheed Martin is clearly well-positioned given its strong financials and growing businesses.Lockheed Martin currently boasts a market capitalization of $94 million and a forward P/E ratio of 14. With geopolitical tensions ramping up and a widening space frontier, Lockheed Martin will have even greater opportunities in the future. Lockheed Martin still has upside even in the midst of the current global pandemic. The company's fundamentals remain solid and could even become stronger as global tensions grow."

Any opinions or probabilities expressed in this report are those of the author as of the article date of publication and are subject to change without notice.We cover Lockheed Martin (LMT) as part of our space-sector focus. Now, the space sector is certainly exciting insofar as SpaceX (SPACE) launches come with box-office appeal for free - re-usable rockets landing on drone ships was the stuff of science fiction not so long ago - but from an investor's standpoint space is most interesting because it is the bleeding edge of the defense industry. And in case you hadn't noticed, the world is getting a little uglier of late - this is probably a bad thing overall but it's good news for the defense sector, so we will take our wins where we can find them.LMT announced its Q4 2019 earnings today - a very strong set of results. We summarize the numbers below. But what really stood out for us today with this stock were two things.Firstly, the stock barely moved on the day. At the time of writing the stock is sat in the aftermarket at $437, up just 1% on yesterday's close. We believe the stock is a buy at this price and we have it at Buy - Long Term Hold as a result.Secondly, on the earnings call the management team talked up the cashflow generation over the next couple of years and confirmed an analyst question about the potential for dividend growth. Still the stock did not react.Now, to quote the CFO on the earnings call today, he said ""half our shareholders are income investors"". As well they might be. For despite the big run-up in the stock price in 2019, and consequent reduction in yield, the company still pays a 2% yield with ample cover. The company also has, we believe, a very bright future ahead of it. Defense companies have pretty good visibility into future revenues, earnings and cashflows, and this company is now delivering on the major next-gen fighter aircraft program for the Allied countries - winning orders far beyond the US armed services. It also provides some essential building blocks in the US's campaign to win the second Cold War, which is quietly building in the background.So we think this is a compelling income stock. Clearly 2% is a modest yield, but we think that the forward yield is likely to rise as a result of dividend increases ; and we think there is substantial capital gain potential too. Here's why.Here's LMT's numbers going back to 2013.This is what good looks like for a company of this size. 11% revenue growth - all organic - in 2019, solid EBITDA margins, big conversion of EBITDA into unlevered pretax cashflow, and rapid deleverage after a big acquisition (in 2015, LMT paid $9bn for Sikorsky, taking leverage up to 2.4x TTM EBITDA; that leverage is now down to just 1.1x).In defense companies, as you probably know, forward visibility is much clearer than in many other sectors. They all publish their 'backlog', which usually means orders placed which cannot yet be recognized as revenue. Backlog never translates directly into revenue, for many reasons (some orders are not at all certain, some are of uncertain quantity or value, some are not yet backed by a federal budget at the customer, etc etc). But generally speaking, particularly for the better-managed companies - of which LMT is surely one - backlog up = good news.Here's the backlog story from LMT.Source: YCharts.com, Company SEC filings, Cestrian AnalysisConsistent growth every quarter over a couple of years - at the same time as growing revenue. (That means they are both selling stuff - taking orders - AND delivering stuff - recognizing revenue and collecting cash. Needless to say - that's good).Now turning to valuation. Even after a huge runup of late - see our last note on the topic - the multiples are still reasonable in the light of the growth.Source: YCharts.com, Company SEC filings, Cestrian AnalysisHere's the last ten years' worth of trailing yield for LMT and its comparator stocks Raytheon (RTN) and Northrop Grumman (NOC), both of which we cover, together with the dividend yield of the S&P500 as a baseline comparison.Source: YCharts.comFor pretty much the whole period, LMT has paid between 2-4x the yield of the S&P, and more than RTN and NOC too. This is impressive in the light of the stock price performance of the group.Source: YCharts.comNOC has delivered superior capital gain over those ten years, but LMT has delivered over 2x the S&P500 and about a third more gain than RTN too.So as a stock to own on a total return basis, LMT has been compelling for a decade.We think that can continue.The company guided today to around 6-7% growth in revenue for 2020 vs. 2019. Given that they are in production mode for the single most important revenue line, F-35 fighter jets, we anticipate that this will deliver improved operating margin too. Defense companies get hit on the margin line when developing product; and reap the reward on margins when shipping. F-35 is gaining share in most corners of the Allied countries and we expect it will be a very successful and long-lived line. So we think the stock price will be taken care of by growth in both revenue and margins. Save for a general market correction, we believe LMT to be a sound place to seek capital gains whilst somewhat protecting that capital too.And dividends?Here's a few notes from the earnings call today. They come from our notes as the call happened, but you can see the points verbatim in the transcript too.Cashflow growthManagement were asked by Goldman Sachs and others whether operating cashflows can continue to grow over multiple years. Answer: yes, based on our 3-year forecasts, cashflow will grow through 2021 and again in 2022. Could be a little impact from Tax Reform Act hit to R&D accounting in 2022 but overall that's not a major issue. Cashflow is strong from F-35 unwinding contract assets [that means moving into production mode] and from Sikorsky developments moving into production.Cashflow return to investors? Management said they anticipate $1bn share repurchases in 2020 and an 8%+ increase in dividend. They said they may refinance whole balance sheet or may repay the $1.2bn of near-term maturity debt from 2015 Sikorsky deal, but that this won't impact repurchases or dividend increase. They said they will be opportunistic (buy low) with buybacks, as they did in Q4 2018.One analyst (Cai von Rumohr at Cowen - we've seen him ask smart questions at one of the other defense stocks we cover, Science Applications International Corp (SAIC) ) said - even if you increase the dividend by 10% - you still have an awful lot of cash left. Management confirmed this was the case and said, ""50% of our shareholders are yield investors, so the dividend matters"". And, as a direct quote, they said, ""we WILL use cash - it's not going to sit on our balance sheet"".There was talk of M&A from the CFO, more so than is normal on these calls, but the CEO sat on that a little, saying they were happy with the current product portfolio.So our takeaway was that the forward yield can move up to say 2.2-2.3% on a constant-stock-price basis (an 8%-10% increase in dividend payout from the current trailing yield of 2.06%). And although we ourselves don't much like stock buybacks (we think they're not really in shareholders' interest - better to do something productive with the cash or pay it out to shareholders, one or the other - yes we know this is a minority view), we can't argue that the market does tend to like them. And so any uptick in buybacks will probably be supportive of the stock price.We were surprised at how glum many of the analysts sounded on the call. Not one ""congratulations guys"" or similar, odd given the stellar 2019 performance. On the numbers above, you'd expect some increased price targets, and with those, a bump in the stock. Maybe those analysts know something we don't. But on what we know - we'd say this is a going-up stock. We own the stock personally and we added to our holding as the market opened this morning (after the earnings were announced, but before the earnings call). So if you're thinking of availing yourself of the rising yield potential, you might factor that into your timing.Cestrian Capital Research, Inc - 28 January 2020."
4321776,85096,2020-02-05T19:54:12-05:00,"Lockheed Martin’s dividends are above average at 2.2% and have increased for 18 years in a row, a solid dividend income company.Lockheed Martin’s total return overperformed the Dow average for my 49 month test period by 60.58%, which is great, and the present price presents a fair entry point.Lockheed Martin’s three-year forward CAGR of 13% is great and will give you good steady growth with the increasing worldwide economy and the defense budgets.Lockheed Martin’s cash flow is good and will allow the dividend to be increased, and share buybacks with cash left over for new aircraft development.","Lockheed Martin’s (LMT), the largest manufacturer of military defense systems and other non-defense government systems, is a buy for the dividend income and total return growth investor. Lockheed Martin has good cash flow, and the company uses some of the cash to expand its product line. The remainder of the cash is used to increase dividends each year and buy back shares raising the stock price. Lockheed Martin is 1.0% of The Good Business Portfolio, being my IRA portfolio of good business companies that are balanced among all styles of investing. I want to add to this starter position whenever cash is available.The graphic below shows the F-35, the United States most advanced fighter, and a big part of LMT’s sales.Source: Sky NewsI use a set of guidelines that I codified over the last few years to review the companies in The Good Business Portfolio (my portfolio) and other companies that I am reviewing. For a complete set of guidelines, please see my article ""The Good Business Portfolio: Update to Guidelines, August 2018"". These guidelines provide me with a balanced portfolio of income, defensive, total return, and growing companies that hopefully keeps me ahead of the Dow average.When I scanned the five-year chart, Lockheed Martin’s has a great chart going up and to the right for 2015- 2020 YTD in a strong solid pattern with a dip at the end of 2018 following the market.Data by YChartsLockheed Martin is being reviewed in the following topics below.I use total return as my starting point in looking at a company’s business. The total return must be greater than the Dow's total return over my test period. Lockheed Martin’s beats against the Dow baseline in my 49-month test compared to the Dow average. I chose the 49 month test period (starting January 1, 2016, and ending to date) because it includes the great year of 2017 and 2019, and other years that had a fair or bad performance. The great Lockheed Martin total return of 118.03% compared to the Dow base of 57.45% makes Lockheed Martin a good investment for the total return investor that also wants some increasing income. Looking back five years, $10,000 invested five years ago would now be worth over $25,100 today. This gain makes Lockheed Martin a great investment for the total return investor looking back, which has future growth as the United States and worldwide economy continues to grow with the increasing defense budgets.Dow's 49 Month total return baseline is 57.45%.Lockheed Martin does meet my dividend guideline of having dividends increase for 8 of the last ten years and having a minimum of 1% yield. Lockheed Martin’s has an above-average dividend yield of 2.2% and has had increases for 18 years, making Lockheed Martin’s a good choice for the dividend growth investor. The dividend was last increased in September 2019 for an increase from $2.20/Qtr to $2.40/Qtr or a 9% increase. The five-year average payout ratio is moderate, at 43%. After paying the dividend, this leaves cash remaining for increasing the business of the company by expanding its product line, increasing foreign sales, and buying back shares, all of which raise the earnings and value to the shareholder.I only like large-capitalization companies and want the capitalization to be at least greater than $10 billion. Lockheed Martin’s easily passes my rule. Lockheed Martin is a large-cap company with a capitalization of $122 billion. Lockheed Martin’s 2020 projected operating cash flow at $7.5 billion is great, allowing the company to have the means for company growth, increasing dividends each year, and buying back shares that increase the stock price. Large-cap companies like Lockheed Martin have the cash and ability to buy other smaller companies and weather any storms that might come along.Lockheed Martin’s S&P CFRA rating is five stars or strong buy with a recently increased target price to $523. Lockheed Martin’s price is below the target by 24%. Lockheed Martin is below the target price at present and has a moderate forward PE of 18, making Lockheed Martin’s a strong buy at this entry point for the dividend income and total return investor and with the large backlog of the company. I rate Lockheed Martin’s a buy for future growth and a good growing income, and quality does not come cheap. The cash flow is what drives LMT stock price up, and the company returns the cash to the shareholder with increasing dividend and share buybacks, both of which add to the value of the shareholder.I look for the earnings of my positions to consistently beat their quarterly estimates. For the last quarter on January 28, 2020, Lockheed Martin reported earnings that beat expected at $5.29 by $0.28, compared to last year at $4.39. Total revenue was higher at $15.88 billion more than a year ago by 10.2% year over year and bear expected total revenue by $600 million. This was a great report with a bottom-line beating expected, and the top line increasing and a bottom-line increase compared to last year. The next earnings report will be out late April 2020 and is expected to be $5.94 compared to last year at $5.99 a small decrease. The graphic below shows a comparison of earnings between 2018 and 2019.Source: Earnings call slidesOne of my guidelines is would I buy the whole company if I could. The answer is yes. The total return is great, and the increasing dividend for 18 years makes a good combination of growth and income. The Good Business Portfolio likes to embrace all kinds of investment styles but concentrates on buying businesses that can be understood, makes a fair profit, invests profits back into the business, and also generates a fair income stream. Most of all, what makes LMT interesting is the long-term growth of the economy and defense budget, giving you an increasing growth in the military sector.Lockheed Martin is the largest manufacturers of military defense systems sold in the United States and foreign countries.As per excerpts from ReutersOverall, Lockheed Martin is a good business with a 13% CAGR projected growth as the worldwide economy grows going forward with the increasing demand for LMT's military products. The F-35 program provides a strong base of ongoing sales for the best fighter jet in the world for years and years to come. The good earnings and revenue growth looking forward provides LMT with the capability to continue its growth as the defense business increases, and foreign sales are expanded.The paraphrase below from the 4th quarters earns call. Over the year, the corporation achieved extraordinary sales growth, earnings performance, strong cash generation, and record backlog. Missiles and Fire Control had the highest overall growth in 2019, exceeding the prior year by 20%. Deliveries of tactical and strike weapons, development work on new hypersonic and classified programs, and PAC-3 missile production were the strongest contributors to the increase. Aeronautics also saw strong sales growth in the quarter and year with 2019 annual sales finishing 12% above 2018, led by our F-35 program, which grew 14% in 2019. This quarter, the backlog increased $6.6 billion and is now approximately $144 billion, reaching a record level for the fifth consecutive year. And we had a strong quarter of cash flows allowing us to use $1 billion to pre-fund our required 2020 pension contribution and a portion of our 2021 payment and still generate over $7.3 billion of cash from operations for the entire year. The F-35 program had an especially successful quarter and year. During the fourth quarter, our F-35 team delivered 51 fighter jets, bringing the total deliveries in 2019 to 134 aircraft, exceeding our joint government and industry target of 131 aircraft, a nearly 50% improvement from last year and a 200% increase from 2016.The graphic below shows the guidance for 2020.Source: Earnings call slidesThis shows the feelings of top management for the continued growth of the Lockheed Martin business and shareholder return with an increase in future military growth. LMT has good growth and will continue as the world's military budgets grow. The graphic below shows the growing backlog, which turns into future earnings. Source: Earnings call slidesLockheed Martin is a good investment choice for the total return and income investor with its great projected growth as worldwide defense budgets increase, and the company buying back shares. Lockheed Martin is 1.0% of the Good Business Portfolio and will be added too when cash is available. LMT gets a bit of an edge over other defense companies because it has a high income and better growth prospects. If you want a steady growing total return and income, in the growing defense business, LMT may be the right investment for you.The five companies comprising the largest percentage of the portfolio are Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) at 8.1% of the portfolio, the Eaton Vance Enhanced Equity Income Fund II (EOS) at 8.1% of the portfolio, Home Depot (HD) at 9.0% of the portfolio, Omega Health Investors (OHI) at 9.2% of the portfolio, and Boeing (BA) at 11.1% of the portfolio. Therefore, BA, EOS, JNJ, OHI, and HD are now in trim or close to trim position, but I am letting them run a bit since they are great companies.Boeing is going to be pressed to 15% of the portfolio because of it being cash positive on 787 deferred plane costs at $1.3 billion in the third quarter of 2019, an increase from the second quarter. Boeing has dropped in the last nine months because of the second 737 Max crash, and I look at this as an opportunity to buy BA at a reasonable price. From the latest news on Boeing is a rumor that Warren Buffett is taking a position on BA, maybe he knows a good investment. It now looks like the 737 Max will not be approved until mid-year, but the FAA has said it could be earlier because Boeing is making good progress.JNJ will be pressed to 9% of the portfolio because of its defensive nature in this post-BREXIT world. Earnings in the last quarter beat on the top and bottom line, and Mr. Market did nothing. JNJ in April 2019 increased the dividend to $0.95/Qtr., which is 57 years in a row of increases. JNJ is not a trading stock but a hold forever; it is now a strong buy as the healthcare sector remains under pressure.The total return for the Good Business Portfolio is ahead of the Dow average from 1/1/2020 to date by 0.7%, which is a nice gain above the market for the portfolio with BA a strong drag. Each quarter after the earnings season, I write an article giving a complete portfolio list and performance, the latest article is titled “The Good Business Portfolio: 2019 3 rd Quarter Earnings and Performance Review”. Become a real-time fllower, and you will get each quarter's performance after the next earnings season is over in a few weeks."
4315219,50291,2020-01-07T06:00:00-05:00,"Despite the Boeing crisis impact on the supply chain and even the US GDP, aerospace continues to be positioned well to return value to investors.While I remain bullish on the industry, escalation of any sort could stall economic growth.For Boeing, 2020 will be all about resurrecting itself and redefining its strategy.","Given concerns about the economy, oil prices and trade war fears, should investors steer clear of the aerospace industry? Or does the business, not only the big players but also smaller ones, present a long-term opportunity?Dhierin-Perkash Bechai has been covering the aerospace industry on Seeking Alpha for well over five years, combining his knowledge about the aerospace industry, which is his field of expertise, with his ability to analyze ""the numbers."" Dhierin's work is a mix of covering news events, earnings reports, product launches and performance comparisons and market outlooks, aiming to provide in-depth coverage of the aerospace industry exclusively on Seeking Alpha, to give readers the tools to better analyze investing opportunities.His articles often are not styled as an ""I would buy this at X and sell at Y,"" but function as puzzle pieces for investors to complete their own ""due diligence jigsaw puzzle"" that create an image with which investors can make proper investment decisions, or at least get a better understanding of the dynamics that are involved. Ultimately, it's his goal to make an incredibly complex and big industry understandable for people who are interested in investing in the industry. Next to his regular coverage on the platform, Dhierin also has established The Aerospace Forum for investors who want to dive a bit deeper into the industry with possibilities to have high-grade discussions and access to data.Despite a chaotic 2019, which will see part of the consequences drip through in 2020, I remain bullish on the aerospace industry. The main reason is because while Boeing (NYSE:BA) is a huge player in the aerospace industry, there are other names that can continue their stellar performance in 2020.On top of that, a trade deal with China could be a positive to Boeing specifically (not so much to other defense contractors). Each year we see all sorts of headlines toward the end of the year outlining how the next year will be the end of the bull market. While we do see mounting tensions, I don’t think we are at an inflection point.For 2020, it’s difficult to point at one thing and say that is what will drive performance, but that's simply because the sectors are extremely big. For aviation, reduced fears of a recession and a trade deal should be considered positives offset by possible higher oil prices as tension in the Middle East continues to exist.Source: GoodFonWith that tension in mind, defense contractors should be in a good spot. I continue to be a big fan of Lockheed Martin (LMT), Raytheon (RTN), United Technologies (UTX) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) shares though regrettably I didn’t buy shares of any of these companies.For commercial aircraft, I believe that a resolution to the Boeing 737 MAX crisis will give Boeing shares a clear direction (positive or negative), though full recovery of the delivery profile and profitability could be stretching well into 2021.For Airbus (OTCPK:EADSF), we see improvements in the singe aisle delivery stream as a positive, while improvement in the margins on Airbus A350 production also should benefit the European jet maker. It will be interesting to see how Airbus’ defense arm performs as that arm will be restructured after recording falling sales figures.All with all, it's not one element that will be the main driver, but each sector and, in some cases, even each company has a specific set of drivers. Overall what seems to be holding is that aerospace will be most influenced by economic growth (and stability) and tension being at a level such that it allows for continued economic growth but also higher defense spending.A combination of economic slowdown fears, the China trade deal not happening and overall global tension. This is not just specific to the aerospace industry, but throughout the year tariffs and “on and off” signals on a trade deal with China have affected share price performance. With the 2020 Presidential Elections upcoming I can’t imagine that President Trump would not look to reach an agreement with China, but if for some reason that trade agreement isn’t reached, I’d consider that the biggest element that could adversely impact performance as it likely will make fear return to the markets and taper overall economic growth expectations.Source: CNBCThis has been partially addressed above but increased political tension (think about tension in the Middle East) likely will benefit the big Defense companies, while escalation could hurt the overall economy and stock market. So, the risk would be an escalation in the Middle East.What I’d also consider a risk is President Trump not winning the elections. I have no political preference for any of the 2020 Presidential Elections, but at this point, it does seem that many Democratic presidential candidates are willing to go after big corporations and “the greedy Wall Street investors that make unethically big profits.” It’s all wrapped in “higher taxes for the super rich” but surely something that could scare off the markets and hit the average Joe who is investing for his/her retirement.One element that's getting a lot of attention is the Boeing 737 MAX crisis. The mistakes made are clear. What I think is not getting enough attention is the fact that this is multi-dimensional crisis involving regulation, transfer of certification tasks, customer relations, financials and development trajectories. The MAX crisis is likely going to affect the way aircraft are being certified in various jurisdictions while Boeing is seeing significant timeline challenges with regard to future aircraft developments, and you could ask yourself how much of a surprise that really is given that while Boeing is struggling getting the MAX back in the air, Airbus is marching ahead with its Airbus A321XLR development. Where the European jet maker can, they will continue pressuring Boeing… that's something that makes the MAX crisis, even though it already is a big crisis, a magnitude bigger than many think.In 2019, we saw that aviation was put in the dunce’s corner, especially in Europe. Big changes are required in the way we move and consume to reduce environmental impact, but we are currently seeing talks about flying with electric vehicles, supersonic travel and traveling by train. All of these “modern alternatives” do have drawbacks.Source: SpoorproTraveling within Europe by airplane is now being regarded as “not done,” reality is that traveling from West Europe to East Europe can still take almost two days while the airplane takes you there in three hours. Everybody wants to be conscious about the environment, but it remains to be seen who's willing to sit in a train for nearly two days while the aircraft gets them to a location within hours. When I chose to aspire a career in aerospace engineering I was told that aircraft would soon be obsolete with the arrival of high-speed trains, fact is that in certain parts of the world the airplane will still be the fastest way to travel for years to come. Traveling by train is a good alternative to air travel, but the state of train networks in certain parts of the world does leave a lot to be desired.One way to travel faster is supersonic air travel. Over the past years, we have seen people being outraged by the fact that aircraft still cruise at the same speed they did a decade ago. Fact is that supersonic air travel comes at a price, a price very few people are willing to pay. So we have yet to see how appealing supersonic aircraft will be. What we do see is that the train can be less demanding on the environment, is cheaper but slower while supersonic travel is fast, expensive and even more polluting than conventional air travel. Air travel isn’t particularly environmentally friendly and electric aircraft are still far off (though it's something that's getting more attention), but I do think that what often is not considered is that many aerospace technologies end up being applied in other applications. Aerospace invites for innovations, and by putting the industry in the dunce’s corner, part of efforts to reduce the carbon footprint on a unit basis that benefits other industries might be reduced. If you are a bear on the aerospace industry thinking that left and right it will be overtaken by novel technologies, at least for the coming decade and possibly two to three decades, you might find an unpleasant surprise.Source: Daily SabahFor Boeing, 2020 will all be about getting the MAX recertified, regain confidence from regulators and customers and regain financial strength. It will be a year for Boeing to reflect, but also pick up the pieces and improve the culture in the company as a whole while rebalancing engineering skill and financial tradeoffs. Boeing stopped buying back shares, which boosted share prices for years, and kept the dividend constant. In 2020, the company has to come up with a plan that strengthens its positions in the long term. If I look at how “well” share prices have been holding while uncertainty is still looming large, I don’t see an opportunity in Boeing share prices at present. At least not with an appreciable risk profile that would convince me to add to my position.For Airbus, I don’t think there's anything indicating that the jet maker can win big from Boeing’s misery in the near term. For a year, I have been hearing how Boeing would lose thousands of orders already logged. Reality is that it didn’t happen. Long term Airbus might get ahead in the development cycle which would strengthen the company’s position in the market, but Boeing, Airbus and their customers ultimately benefit from a healthy degree of competition between the jet makers.Looking at the various aircraft and defense-related companies:In the end, I think you don’t need to dig very deep to see that the aerospace industry shows market-outperforming returns but you should be weighing certain developments and keep in mind that this is an industry with a very long-term vision."
4318050,86786,2020-01-21T11:06:46-05:00,"As a young investor, you have the advantages of a longer time horizon and higher risk tolerance than your Roth-focused parents.We review the top four dividend stock picks from my previous article.I offer four new high-yield dividend stock picks for 2020.","Editor's Note: this article was amended on 1/21/2020 to remove a company that doesn't pay a dividend(Source: 30 Rock)I’m back. And this time, I’m early! Last year, I wrote my top five dividend stocks for young investors for 2019 way late – in March.At least it’s better than skipping a year, like I did in 2018. Anyhow, let’s get to it. We’ll follow the same formula: Reviewing the performance of our picks from 2019 and then getting into the picks for 2020.But first let me clarify the point of this article: Young investors have two things going for them. Namely, (1) young investors can accept risk that older investors cannot and (2) young investors rarely have the experience and restraint to convert capital gains into income, thereby making dividend stocks great choices for growing their accounts without much need to worry about money management.Now, let’s get to my track record, which is nearly impeccable, if I do say so myself. If you don’t believe me, see for yourself: Here are 2017’s picks. And here are 2016’s picks.Now let’s get to reviewing 2019’s picks:Delek Logistics Partners (DKL)(Source: Stockcharts.com)I were expecting a better oil market in 2019, and am currently seeing a lot of gains from this prediction. The yield was over 10% at entry, and so I was not much worried about short-term pullbacks. This was in part a momentum play, but it was also a value play, as I calculated this company to be underpriced as per its discounted cash flows.Indeed, DKL beat the US oil and gas industry by 8.7% and managed to grow its earnings while the rest of the industry saw earnings regress.B&G Foods (BGS)(Source: Stockcharts.com)Our only loser in 2020, B&G was our hedge. As a consumer staple stock, it tends to outperform when the market underperforms. As we know, 2019 was a great year for the market, and thus we saw underperformance in all stocks in this sector.This holding was still able to capture the 8% dividend, but this did not make up for the losses in the stock. The company saw withering earnings, though to less of an extent than the food industry (-6.5% vs. -11.2%). While I’m not satisfied with going 4 for 5, it is always smart to have at least one hedge in your portfolio so that if the market tanks, at least something in your portfolio rises.CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust (CORR)(Source: Stockcharts.com)This was a real estate investment trust – or REIT. CORR was able to rally harder than the US market despite the REIT market underperforming the market. I mentioned in my last article that the real estate market only explains 30% of CORR’s variance. This was in part a momentum play, not an industry play, and it shows that you don’t always have to wait for a dip before buying equities.I noted insider buying as one reason for expected excess returns, and indeed it was after Q2’s earnings that the stock began to rally hard. I usually don’t make earnings predictions for REITs – and I didn’t here – but investigating earnings trends before an investment of duration one quarter or longer can certainly pay off. As we enter 2020, oil is looking bullish, so CORR might continue its upward movement.PennyMac Mortgage (PMT)(Source: Stockcharts.com)This was more of a traditional real estate type of investment but is focused on residential mortgage loans instead. The entry point was on the back of an optimistic earnings report, and that clearly paid off. Strong earnings and management sentiment have strong predictive validity for a stock lasting at least one quarter, and PMT showed strong earnings all through 2019.While US mortgage REITs underperformed the market (4.6% vs. 26.1% returns), they are considered safer than other types of equities. In PMT’s case, we saw a return 3x higher than the US mortgage REIT market. In short, picking the right REIT can give you market-quality returns without the risk.Outfront Media (OUT)(Source: Stockcharts.com)OUT was also a sort of REIT play, with this company engaging in marketing efforts (e.g., billboards and sports marketing). OUT not only outperformed the REIT market but the general US market as well, showing 35% returns over the year. I made this recommendation shortly after Citigroup (C) downgraded the company to neutral, showing that we need not trust the analysts.I originally emphasized the idea that analysts are often wrong and that we should trust those with skin in the game instead. The large amount of insider buying supported this pick. And my financial lexical analysis of the company’s earnings calls showed management optimism rising sharply, a factor that typically predicts excess returns.2020’s Top Dividend StocksNow, let’s take a look at this year’s picks. I’m ordering these picks by return on investment, lowest to highest.One Liberty Properties (OLP)This diversified REIT offers a 6.5% dividend yield. In fact, of all the picks for 2020, OLP offers the highest dividend yield. The dividend here is key, as it leads the stock price.Many dividend stocks tend to react to dividend hikes and cuts, but few react to the extent that OLP does. For example, Papa John’s (PZZA), a stock I recently looked, has moved with its dividend only 50% of the time. However, OLP’s stock moves with the dividend 82% of the time, making the dividend the pillar of the stock:(Source: Damon Verial; data from Tiingo)OLP management knows this. This is why they are paying almost the entire of their earnings to their shareholders as dividends. OLP bears would call this irresponsible, but once you make the connection that dividend maintenance equals stock price maintenance, you can understand this attribution of earnings cash:(Source: Simply Wall St.)While the company has not raised dividends as they have done in the past, they have not cut either. The company is clearly attempting to establish itself as a reliable dividend payer. They might not be raising dividends anytime soon, but they will fight tooth and nail to maintain the dividend, only bowing to recessions – as with the last two dividend cuts.Obviously, this dividend investment comes with risk. But risk comes with a premium; you take a risky investment, you are – on average – compensated for that risk. For OLP, you are compensated with a high dividend yield (6.6% vs. the REIT market average of 3.8%).It is possible OLP trades flat, but you still get the 6.5% yield. However, I want to be able to show winners in 2021, so of course I wish to pick stocks I think will rise over the year. While I might have chosen OLP for its yield and price-to-dividend correlation, the money flow patterns in the stock were what actually put it on my watchlist:(Source: Stockcharts)The timing seems right to buy at the bottom, and you should do so if your risk tolerance is high enough.Ally Financial (ALLY)ALLY has outperformed both the US consumer finance sector and the overall market in 2019 but ended up fizzling at the end of the year. I do not think this stock’s rally is over. One aspect supporting this idea is the high amount of buybacks the company committed to engage in.(Source: Gurufocus)It might seem that ALLY has met its maker, as the stock has consistently pulled back since September. However, the technical signals show that a bottom is likely in. The charts show a strong level at support at $29.41, which corresponds to the technical signs of a bounce, meaning that this strong company is not done yet:(Source: Stockcharts)The company is set to remain profitable into the coming year. Should the company need to raise debt to overcome its temporal weakness, it will find itself with little problem of raising debt. The company has seen its credit rating soar over the last year with upgrades from many institutions, with the most recent being an upgrade by Moody’s from Ba2 to Ba1.The company’s earnings, revenue, and growth rate are all on the upswing. The dividend might be the lowest of the companies here, at 2.25%, but the company’s financials are strong. If we continue see such growth, a yield of 2.25% will seem high, meaning it is best to lock it in now:(Source: Simply Wall St.)Extended Stay (STAY)Extended Stay is a contrarian pick in the lodging industry. The stock is STAY, which is a relatively simple business (long-term hotel rentals) with a dividend yield of 6.3%. The company’s stock is showing a 11% loss for 2019, when the markets were almost universally up. But when everything is trading at all-time highs, finding the good amongst the beaten-down stocks is the smart bullish move. STAY is almost certainly underpriced, as per its discounted free cash flow valuation*:(Source: Simply Wall St.)*Model uses a hospitality industry beta of 0.94, a risk-free rate of 1.7%, and an equity risk premium of 5.44%. The total equity value is calculated by summing the present value of the next ten years of free cash flow and the terminal value, discounting the sum by the cost of equity (or discount rate, which is calculated from the numbers above). Cost of equity is the risk free rate summed with the equity risk premium multiplied by levered beta. Here, the cost of equity is computed to be 9.7%, which we use to discount all the future cash flows for the next ten years and terminal value, arriving at a total equity value is $6,770. Divide this value by the outstanding shares, and the result is a fair value of roughly $37.50, hinting at a 61% underpricing.Some might scoff at such a valuation, but one group not scoffing is insiders. Insiders have been buying up shares of STAY to where we only see insider buying in the last quarter, no selling. In the last three months, we have 8:0 open market buys, which is more bullish than the yearly statistic of 37:9 because of the lack of selling (selling typically indicates a relative top though does not necessarily point to a bearish reversal).(Source: Simply Wall St.)The most interesting pattern I have found in this stock is a seasonal one. It might behoove you to take this position as a half-year position rather than a full-year position due to a seasonal pattern I’ve found. In short, STAY outperforms the first half of the year but falters the second half:(Source: Damon Verial; data from Tiingo)Better yet, enter in late January – or early February – and exit in June. This strategy gives roughly 5.5% ROI per six months, while freeing your capital for the rest of the year. Note that buy-and-hold players of STAY are in the red, while the seasonal strategy is highly profitable:(Source: Damon Verial; data from Tiingo)The stock is still showing rather negative price action, but this is reversing, with the smart money speculating on the long side, fighting against the dumb money, who are taking profits on bumps upward. Look for a buying action at the end of the day to find the perfect entry point. Otherwise, just enter in Jan/Feb, as per the seasonal strategy.Lockheed Martin (LMT)LMT has the highest ROI and is the most heavily traded of the companies we are looking at. You are probably already familiar with this security and aerospace company, especially on the back of the potential US-Iran military clashes in the news, news that brought the stock to new highs. Currently, it might appear too expensive to buy, as the stock has risen 52% this year, outperforming the market by a factor of one.However, January 3rd produced an up gap, which appears to be a continuation gap:(Source: E-Trade Pro)I backtested this gap to find results supporting the idea of a continuation gap. A new support level, then, has formed at around $403. As per my backtests, LMT tends to stall a bit after this sort of up gap but begins upward momentum after roughly one week.Here is the return gained by buying LMT after this sort of up gap and holding for three weeks:(Source: Damon Verial; data from Tiingo)And here is 10 weeks – roughly one quarter’s worth of holding:(Source: Damon Verial; data from Tiingo)So, buying right now, at an all-time high, is not a statistically poor decision, as the high appeared with a continuation gap. One relevant problem here is that dividend seekers might not be satisfied with the current dividend payouts, as the price rise per share has brought the yield down to 2.34%. Still, this is a larger dividend yield than the aerospace and defense industry average (1.7%), and LMT has been consistently raising its dividend:(Source: Simply Wall St.)Another problem is the 344% debt-to-equity ratio:(Source: Simply Wall St.)Companies with high amounts of debt are more likely than the fiscally healthy to cut their dividends during economic slowdowns and recessions. Still, LMT’s earnings more than cover its dividend (42% of earnings go to the dividend payment). For now, the dividend is safe.Speaking of economic slowdowns, the industrial sector, which contains LMT, outperforms during this phase of the business cycle:(Source: SPDR Americas Research)Hence, as we see economic growth peaking, as we are now, we are presented with a good entry point for LMT. The macro environment, business cycle phase, and political fears all support a long position in LMT.ConclusionAs a young investor, you have the advantages of a longer time horizon and higher risk tolerance than your Roth-focused parents. This allows you to seek out higher yields at a higher risk, which bestows upon you a risk premium, the phenomenon of seeing higher returns when investing with a riskier portfolio. Now, I’m not saying you should go balls-to-the-wall (that’s an aeronautical term, by the way) and go all-in with high-yield dividend stocks, but you could easily make a subsection of your portfolio dividend-focused.If you go this route, consider some or all of the four stocks above. My track record for picking entry times for dividend stocks is so-far quite strong. Review my theses above but do also perform your own due diligence before investing in any company.Happy investing."
4316497,22742,2020-01-13T11:43:16-05:00,Lockheed Martin is on solid footing with its F-35.Wall Street analysis; market price determination.Main Street analysis; assessing operational performance.Strong dividend growth and good long-term growth prospects.,"Lockheed Martin (LMT), the largest defense contractor in the world, should benefit greatly if there is a further escalation in the recent conflict between the United States and Iran. That is clearly the sentiment on Wall Street based upon the reaction on the day after the U.S. took out the highest-ranking military leader of Iran, Soleimani. The S&P 500 Index closed down -0.71% on the news, while Lockheed Martin was up strongly. The company is well positioned to generate good results for the foreseeable future due to its deep relationship with the U.S. government.Lockheed Martin makes a wide range of military aircraft, including the F-35 fighter jets, as well as sonar technologies, ships, missile defense systems, and missiles used by the Navy. Its weaponry should be of the first to see action in any significant conflict.The F-35, Joint Strike Fighter program alone has the potential to generate over $1 trillion in future revenues from the manufacture of the planes to long-term contracts for parts and servicing the aircraft for our military and that of our many close allies around the world. We expect revenues to increase steadily for many years.At Friedrich Global Research we focus more on consistency of performance over the long term to determine the quality of a business. Every management team attempts to tell a positive story about the future prospects of a company. That doesn’t always square well with reality. Many analysts rely upon company forecasts to determine assumptions used to forecast future results. Assumptions often require adjustments (stress on the word “often”). Consistently superior past results and sustainable revenue growth prospects are, in our opinion, a better indication of the future. The numbers don’t lie. Earnings can be, and often are, manipulated. Cash is cash. That is why we focus on the numbers, especially free cash flow.Main Street is where Lockheed Martin operates, and Wall Street is where its shares trade. The Lockheed Martin shares available Wall Street are in the public domain allowing the company has little control over price. Lockheed Martin is required to release its earnings reports each quarter, and from time to time, it also provides press releases to its shareholders and the general public giving updates on how its operations are doing on Main Street.Main Street is where Lockheed Martin invests in its own operations and sells to its customers. How well the CEO of Lockheed Martin and its management do in selling those products or services determines how profitable the company will be. Wall Street then reacts based on the success or failure of management to meet its goals.Our algorithm was designed over the last three decades to assist all investors (both pro and novice alike) in assessing companies at a glance. The algorithm can also assist users in analyzing an entire index like the S&P 500, an ETF, mutual fund, or an individual portfolio with the use the Portfolio Analyzer that we developed.Many years ago, while reading Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A) (BRK.B) 1986 letter to shareholders, we discovered a ratio, which Mr. Buffett entitled ""Owner Earnings,"" or what we may consider to be Mr. Buffett's version of ""Free Cash Flow."" In that little footnote, Mr. Buffett explains how to use owner earnings and states that it is one of the key ratios that he and Charlie Munger use in analyzing stocks. In that article, he defined the term ""owner earnings"" as the cash that is generated by the company's business operations.This free cash flow ratio was originated by Arnold Bernhard founder of The Value Line Investment Survey, many years ago. This ratio was the basis of our 60-year back-test of the DJIA from 1950 to 2009. The results speak volumes and provides the reasoning for our focus on free cash flow analysis.Price to Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio = Sherlock Debt Divisor / [(net income per share + depreciation per share) - (capital spending per diluted share)]Sherlock Debt Divisor = Market Price Per Share - ((Working Capital - Long-Term Debt)/Diluted Shares Outstanding))These are the ratios we use when analyzing a stock on Wall Street, and below are the ratios used when analyzing a stock on Main Street.FROIC, which means ""Free Cash Flow Return on Invested Capital"" is:Forward Free Cash Flow = [((Net Income + Depreciation) (1+ % Revenue Growth rate)) - (Capital Spending)]FROIC = (Forward Free Cash Flow)/(Long-Term Debt + Shareholders' Equity)What the FROIC ratio does is tell us how much forward free cash flow the company is generating on Main Street relative to how much total capital it has employed. So, if a company invests $100 in total capital on Main Street and generates $20 in forward free cash flow it, therefore, has a FROIC of 20%, which we consider excellent. We use this, along with numerous other ratios to determine how a company is performing on Main Street and have found over the years that when companies are out-performing in this manner Wall Street will eventually figure it out and price the stock accordingly.A major concern that we have these days in analyzing a company's debt relative operations and whether management is taking on more debt than it requires. Debt, or leverage can be extremely beneficial within certain parameters. On the other side of the coin, the use of debt can also be excessive and put a company's future in jeopardy. So, to determine if a company's debt policy is beneficial or abusive use, something we call the Sherlock Debt Divisor.What the Divisor does is punish companies that carry excessive debt and rewards those that use debt wisely to leverage both growth and profitability while not jeopardizing flexibility in capital structure. To do this we take a company's working capital and subtract its long-term debt. The result (on a per share basis) is used to adjust the market price before calculating the other ratios. If working capital is larger than long-term debt the price is reduced, thereby improving (rewarding) results and vice versa.Determining the Sherlock Debt Divisor requires the following four bits of financial data. TTM (trailing twelve months) is ""trailing 12 months"" is about as close to real-time data as we can get, based on when each company reports. The current analysis is taken from the Lockheed Martin’s September 29, 2019 filing with the SEC (except for the market price).Market Price Per Share = $413.74Working Capital = Total Current Assets - Total Current LiabilitiesTotal Current Assets = $19,803,000,000Total Current Liabilities = $15,515,000,000Working Capital = $ 4,288,000,000Long-Term Debt = $12,652,000,000Diluted Shares Outstanding = 283,900,000Sherlock Debt Divisor = Market Price Per Share - ((Working Capital - Long-Term Debt)/ (Diluted Shares Outstanding))Sherlock Debt Divisor = $413.74 - ((4,288,000,000 - $12,652,000,000)/ 283,900,000)), or $443.20Since Lockheed Martin has more Long-Term Debt vs. Working Capital, we, therefore, must punish it and use the new $443.20 as our new numerator in all our calculations.Price to Bernhard Buffett FCF Ratio = Sherlock Debt Divisor/[(net income per share + depreciation per share) - (capital spending per diluted share)]Sherlock Debt Divisor = $443.20Net Income per diluted share = $5,985,000,000/283,900,000 = $21.08Depreciation per diluted share = $1,171,000,000/283,900,000 = $4.12Capital Spending per diluted share = $-1,300,000,000/283,900,000 = $-4.57$21.08 + $4.12 - $4.57 = $20.63Price to Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio = $443.20/$20.63 = 21.48Now, if one goes to our Friedrich Legend (on what is considered a good or bad result), you will notice that our result of 21.48 is considered average.We last ran our data file for Lockheed Martin on January 4, 2020, and our algorithm produced a recommendation to our subscribers that Lockheed Martin is a “Hold” as our Friedrich Data File and Chart below show. There you also will find the last 10 years of Lockheed Martin's Price to Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow results.Source: Friedrich DatabaseNow that we have shown in detail how to calculate our Price to Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow ratio, let us move on and explain to everyone how to calculate our FROIC ratio.First, we calculated our Forward Free Cash to be used in the FROIC calculation:Forward Free Cash Flow = [((Net Income + Depreciation) (1+ % Revenue Growth rate)) - (Capital Spending)]Net Income per diluted share = $5,985,000,000/283,900,000 = $21.08Depreciation per diluted share = $1,171,000,000/283,900,000 = $4.12Capital Spending per diluted share = $-1,300,000,000/283,900,000 = $-4.57$21.08 + $4.12 - ($4.57) = $20.63Revenue Growth Rate TTM = 9%[(($21.08 + $4.12) (109%)) - ($4.57) = $22.898Long-Term Debt = $12,652,000,000Shareholders Equity = $3,893,000,000Diluted Shares Outstanding = 283,900,000FROIC = (Forward Free Cash Flow)/ ((Long-Term Debt + Shareholders' Equity)/Diluted Shares Outstanding)$22.898/$58.28 = 39.289%FROIC = 39%Now, if one goes to my Friedrich Legend again (on what is considered a good or bad result), you will notice that our result of 39% is considered Excellent and tells us that Lockheed Martin on Main Street produces $39 in forward free cash flow for every $100 it invests in total capital employed.Going forward, with such a strong FROIC result, Lockheed Martin is hitting on all cylinders on Main Street, but on Wall Street it has already had an amazing run and is no longer a bargain. The Friedrich Sell Price on Lockheed Martin is $854.97, therefore if you own it, Friedrich currently believes there could be at least 100% upside left before there is a need to sell. Long-term investors may want to consider LMT for both growth and the 2.34% yield, which has risen by a compounded average rate over 15% per year over the last 10 years.In conclusion, it's our belief that free cash flow analysis is the ultimate tool when analyzing companies. If you don’t believe us, please take a few moments to check out the back-test details and results linked earlier in the article. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask them in the comment section below."
4317156,104097,2020-01-15T18:25:46-05:00,"Headlines have recently been filled with news regarding the military strikes between the United States and Iran, which obviously has helped propel Lockheed Martin's share price to all-time highs.Given their share price has surged around 50% during the last twelve months, on the surface it seems as though there is no upside potential without a war breaking out.Nevertheless, there is still modest upside potential remaining, even when using a materially higher risk free rate.The main risk to any current investment in their shares remains uncertainties surrounding the next Presidential election later this year.","Following the recent military strikes between the United States and Iran, it is easy to understand why defense contractors have seen their share prices rising to all-time highs. One such company is the industry behemoth, Lockheed Martin (LMT). Given that their share price has surged around 50% during the last twelve months, it may appear as though that there is no upside potential remaining unless an actual war were to break out. Nevertheless even without this humanitarian disaster eventuating there still appears to be modest upside potential remaining at their current share price.Aside from the fairly normal assumptions that they will continue maintaining an adequately strong financial position, the primary assumption relates to their cash conversion, specifically their free cash flow to net income ratio. The graph included below compares these two metrics since the merger of Lockheed and Martin in 1995, which clearly shows that despite being lumpy, their free cash flow has fairly closely tracked their net income on average. It was assumed that in the future their free cash flow to net income ratio will be 90%, which should provide a realistic middle of the road assumption based upon their historical performance.Data by YChartsThe valuation scenario foresees their earnings per share and thus free cash flow per share following the consensus estimates provided in the graph below for 2020 through 2025, which as of the time of writing are $24.17, $26.43, $27.64, $27.39, $30.60 and $30.20. Given the aforementioned free cash flow to net income ratio assumption of 90%, this means their free cash flow per share is foreseen being $21.75, $23.79, $24.88, $24.65, $27.54 and $27.18 during this same time period.Image Source: Seeking AlphaAfter 2025 the scenario simply foresees their free cash flow growing at a steady pace of 2.50% per annum perpetually into the future, which is a significant slowdown from the compounded annual growth rate of 5.71% from 2019 to 2025. Naturally if a major military conflict were to eventuate, then these earnings estimates would be increased significantly, however, the probability of such an outcome happening is outside of the scope of this valuation.The valuation scenario used a standard discounted free cash flow model, which naturally works in the exact same manner as a discounted dividend model. Their cost of equity was estimated with the Capital Asset Pricing Model and whilst this model is not perfect, it still provides enough accuracy for the purpose of this analysis. This model produced a cost of equity of 7.55% with the following inputs, a risk free rate of 4%, a 60 month Beta of 0.71 (SA) and an expected market return of 9%.The observant reader will likely notice that the risk free rate is significantly higher than the current United States Treasury yield of 1.85%, meanwhile the expected market return of 9% is also higher than the 7.50% normally assumed in my valuations. Both of these were purposely altered to ensure that the valuation and thus potential upside of their shares is not simply just a function of diminished broader future expectations.The valuation returned a result of $472.38, which is 12.73% higher than their current share price of $419.02 as of the time of writing. This indicates that their current share price still offers modest upside potential even if a war does not break out. Naturally any major military conflict would significantly increase the upside potential, however, I would be very wary of relying on such a devastating outcome to justify an investment.Given their very high reliance on funding from the United States government, this is naturally the biggest risk to this valuation and any subsequent investment thesis. The later part of this year will see the next Presidential election and clearly the outcome could have significant implications for military funding. It does not matter which area of the political spectrum an investor's personal beliefs reside, it is well known that the re-election of President Trump would be the most favorable outcome for the defense industry. Unfortunately it is still too early to assess the extent that they may be impacted if a different candidate wins the election. Ultimately only time will tell who will lead the United States for the next four years and thus set the backdrop for the defense industry.Although the valuation still produced a result that indicates upside potential, since this was only modest, I believe a neutral rating is warranted with a possible upgrade depending on the outcome of the next Presidential election."
4318547,104941,2020-01-23T08:57:30-05:00,"With SPY blasting through all-time highs, finding value isn't nearly as easy as it was a year ago. I provide three stocks to pick up today.I begin with a discussion regarding the Fed's recent operations. The next two bullet points highlight the main ideas of the discussion.Since the Fed began pumping money into the repo market in October of 2019 via ""Not QE"", the market has soared to record highs.The Fed has made no indication that they plan to stop their ""Not QE"" operations anytime soon and may even cut their target rate again in the future.LMT, SQ, and AVGO are fantastic businesses that still represent value in the U.S.' frothy, central bank fueled market.","Since mid-October, the Fed has been executing a generous ""Not QE"" policy. Fed Chairman Powell was quoted as saying, ""This is not QE... In no sense is this QE."" Despite the Fed's curious moniker for their current operations, their latest policy entails lower target interest rates and injecting liquidity into the repo market. The repo market is essentially where institutions, such as hedge funds and banks, access liquidity quickly.So, with the Fed injecting cash into the financial system at a rate comparable to post-crisis QE, assets will, with more or less assurance, continue to inflate, as they have done for the last decade. Many stocks have already had astronomical rises in the past 12 months; however, there are still pockets of value yet to be traded into the stratosphere. Here are a few that still have room to run!Lockheed Martin (LMT) is the largest defense contractor by revenues derived from defense contracts. However, ""defense contractor"" may not be the perfect moniker by which to call the company any longer. An aeronautical defense agency might be more fitting.According to their 10-Q, they operate in four segments; into which they segment their revenues:Source: Lockheed Martin Q3 2019 10-QHistorically, Lockheed Martin has been known as a defense contractor, and such is borne out by their ""Missiles and Fire Control"" and ""Rotary and Mission Systems"" segment, both of which have been growing steadily.But I love the stock for their orientation to the skies, where massive growth is set to occur literally indefinitely for mankind. As can be seen above, Lockheed Martin's aeronautics and space divisions grew at 12.7% and 9.6% respectively. With the introduction of the United States' Space Force, look for dollars from the government to be funneled into Lockheed Martin's coffers, and in turn, into your portfolio!The stock, as of January 20, 2020, trades at a substantial discount to its 5-year median price to free cash flow. Lockheed Martin's present valuation rests at about a 14.67% discount to its 5y median valuation. Look for the stock to test that valuation level in the coming months, which implies 17.2% upside from here.Source: YCharts.comAdditionally, Lockheed Martin's valuation has been depressed relative to their peers, likely as a result of lower free cash flow due to an acceleration in spending on working capital. However, I see this as a short-term headwind, setting Lockheed Martin up for a strong, secular share price increase in the coming years.Source: YCharts.comLMT: The King Of BuybacksIf the secular growth trend of mankind's forays into space and undervaluation relative to their usual valuation haven't swayed you, then maybe their generous capital return programs will! As you can see below, Lockheed Martin has bought back an astounding ~30% of their outstanding shares over the last ten years.Source: YChartsFew other companies can boast such generous capital return programs while maintaining robust growth in their top and bottom lines. In addition, Lockheed Martin has steadily increased their dividend over the same time period.Source: YChartsYes, Lockheed Martin has had a substantial run up from their lows during the Christmas Massacre of 2018, but for this aeronautics and defense behemoth, there's still more room to run this year and into the coming decades! Pick up this lifetime hold and set it to DRIP for multi-decade investment horizons.LMT: Discounted Cash Flow ModelSource: YChartsAs you can see in the above DCF model, Lockheed Martin is being substantially undervalued relative to their potential for free cash flow growth and generation over the coming decade. 15% growth may be generous, but with the effects of another 30% of shares being bought back, it may actually be conservative.If you'd like to read more about why I love defense stocks and why we are about to see a secular increase in defense spending globally, check out my article here. All of my opinions regarding these stocks are largely informed by my time serving as an Engineer Officer in the U.S. Army and my long-term study of geopolitics.At this point, I'm getting a bit tired of shouting to the world through my recent articles about Square's (SQ) present undervaluation, which has been brought on by their superstar CFO's recent departure and their CEO's questionable behavior, as well as narratives about their business being eaten alive by competition.However, Square's negative narratives and present valuation belie the company's fantastic underlying financials. The company has been growing their revenues at upwards of 40% yoy for the last 5 years, and despite calls for competition destroying their business, gross margins have been improving. For a company that allegedly operates in an ultra-competitive space, their 40% gross margins are sure curious.Square's present sales growth rate of 40+% yoy and 40% gross margins, along with stable, growing free cash flow, are being vastly undervalued relative to the company's peers.Source: YChartsIn the above chart, we see Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) valued at 36x sales, while growing their sales at 44% yoy. In contrast, we see Square valued at 6.9x sales, while growing their last quarter sales at 43.57% yoy. Additionally, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), at 8.1x sales, grew their sales at 18% last quarter. With 40% gross margins at Square, it doesn't take a financial savant to tell that the market is grossly undervaluing Square's fantastic core business: supplying a POS solution that takes care of inventory management, employee management, and data analytics.SQ: Discounted Cash Flow ModelSource: YChartsConservatively, Square's share price could reach $120, and I would not bat an eyelid.

The stock is prominently featured in ETFs such as the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOXX) and the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH).Perhaps to a greater extent than any other company, Broadcom has been in the crosshairs of the U.S.-China trade tensions. 50% of the company's revenue during 2017 and 2018 was derived from China; however, that number was reduced to 35% in 2019. Meanwhile, Broadcom has been consistently growing their free cash flow per share through strategic acquisitions of CA Technologies and Symantec.Source: Broadcom Company Overview FY19Due to the headwinds, the company has faced in their core semiconductor business as a result of U.S./China tensions, their valuation has become depressed to a decade low.Source: YChartsBroadcom, currently, trades at a 37.12% discount to their 5-year median price to free cash flow, which means the stock's valuation would need to increase 59% in order to reach its historic median valuation. As we've discussed Broadcom faces headwinds, to be sure, but these headwinds don't warrant a discount of 37.12%, especially in light of management's guidance for $25B in revenues for 2020, which would represent an 11% yoy increase.In addition to Broadcom's U.S.-China headwinds, the company is going through a value-depressing strategic shift in their business, where they have distanced themselves from complete reliance on the often volatile chip market. To read more about their strategic shift in-depth and why you should pick up this blue chip dividend payer, check out my recent article entitled, ""Broadcom: Oil Might Be Dead But Chips Are Just Getting Started"".Lockheed Martin, Square, and Broadcom are three of my favorite stocks in my portfolio, although they have not performed as well as their peers, in large part due to very temporary headwinds that pose not long term threat to their businesses. Nothing has materially changed for the stocks for their valuations to re-rate as they have. That is, their free cash flows are still growing steadily and their core businesses are humming along as they've always.When jumping into quality stocks that are facing temporary setbacks or just being mispriced by the market, it helps to remind ourselves of the philosophies of the greatest investors of our time:- Warren BuffettAnd to close, I want to be clear on my ratings for all three of these stocks. I am very bullish on LMT, SQ, and AVGO.Happy investing and let me know what you think!"

        We come at Lockheed from the space side - its space business was looking unexciting mid last year.
        That all changed in Q3 with a large NASA contract award for up to twelve Orion capsules.
        Lockheed's improved space market position, together with ongoing strength in F-35 and other programs, means that even at the current valuation we're at Buy - Long Term Hold.","DISCLAIMER: This article is not directed at, nor intended to be relied upon by any UK recipients.

Any opinions or probabilities expressed in this report are those of the author as of the article date of publication and are subject to change without notice.We first wrote up Lockheed Martin (LMT) in June last year. You can find that note here. In summary we said - the company is well run, growth looks set from the F-35 program, and assuming F-35 executes, the stock looks fully priced. We took a Neutral position, which in our lexicon means ""we ourselves would not buy at this price, at this time"".Here's a snapshot from the article.So clearly, we missed a winner. Total return 21% since then, a little under twice the return of the S&P500.Now, such is life and in particular such is the life of an equity research business. It's inevitable that we're going to miss winners. We can live with this. We figure that if we avoid losers and miss a couple winners, then overall that's a good recipe for good returns. We try hard to miss losers, and so far we're doing OK with that - you can check all our notes here.Now that Q4 earnings are almost upon us - LMT reports on January 28th - we're taking another look at the stock. Now, we come at LMT from the space side - the space market is the focus of our business. When we posted the above note, LMT's space business was looking rather dull and ex-growth. The impetus for prior growth in that division was the acquisition of Martin-Marietta in 1995. We felt that impetus had slowed - hence the title of that note.The catalyst for us now taking another look is less the ennui of regret and more the big order that NASA handed to LMT at the end of Q3 - of which more below.LMT, together with Northrop Grumman (which we're happy to say we've been at Buy on since February 2019 - see our initiation note from that time), has been on fire through 2019 and into 2020. Check the chart below. LMT total return of 69% from 1 Jan 2019 to date has far outpaced the S&P and even the Nasdaq. (By the way - here's a little secret that most investors haven't noticed: the high-growth, tech-heavy Nasdaq is being outpaced by space stocks over most periods you care to measure. One of the many reasons we're excited about investing in space. See this note of ours on this topic, which includes details on some of those stocks. )Look at the financials - we've prepared a summary below and highlighted in green the particularly impressive lines. This is a very well-run business. Revenue growth is strong for a company of this size ($54bn revenue in 2018) in a usually slow-moving industry. And cashflow margins - by which we mean EBITDA minus capex minus change in working capital, ie. money actually produced by the business after it has paid all the bills, but before it pays lenders, dividends or the IRS - are very strong at between 11-15% sustained over the last six years. Finally the company has very little leverage - at the end of 2018 it was just 1.5x levered. That spike you see to 2.4x in 2015 came after the $9bn acquisition of Sikorsky in November of that year. You can see how quickly the company delevered thereafter.If you're an old hand at reading financials, you need no comment from us. If you're new to reading this kind of thing, take it from us - this is what good looks like in an industrials business.Remember our focus is space, and from space we get to defense. (Since space and defense are going to be increasingly the same thing, as the second Cold War intensifies. As in the 1960s, so it shall be in the 2020s). So when we looked at LMT back in June, here's what we saw in the space business:No revenue growth to speak of, and ho-hum segment margins.Now, why this bothered us is specifically because space is going to be defense, and defense, space. So if you want to invest long-term in a defense stock, we believe it needs to be on its A-game in the space segment. That's why we loved NOC so much back in February - because it swooped to buy Orbital ATK for $10bn, which now looks a bargain. And it's why we still love NOC. We saw LMT preoccupied with F-35 niggles, and whilst we recognized its superb Earthbound performance, we felt that for the long term it had to fix its space growth problem. Else it would be outpaced in what we think will become the highest-growth segment in defense - and if that were to happen you can expect its valuation multiples to come down.In September, LMT got a shot in the arm on this front. NASA placed a big order for not less than six Orion capsules. Orion is the spacecraft that NASA will use for its crewed ""going forward to the Moon"" missions (you're not allowed to say ""going back to the Moon"", it seems) and beyond that for its crewed Mars missions. So it's a big deal. And you can see the impact in the backlog, as follows:Source: Company SEC filingsLook at the big step-up in space sector backlog. Now that gets us excited. As does the overall growth in backlog building up to Q3 2019.There are other things about LMT's space-related business that also get us interested. The company is getting very serious about hypersonic missiles - this is an area where the US may be behind China and Russia in developing next-gen missile offense and defense systems. Certainly these very high speed (>5x the speed of sound) systems are an increasing priority for the US defense budget - and that will benefit LMT and its motor provider Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD), which we cover elsewhere on SeekingAlpha.Here's how LMT is valued as of the close of Friday 24 January.2.3x TTM revenue, for a company of this size with backlog up 26% in Q3 '19 vs. Q3 '18 (see the backlog table above), and 15.2x EBITDA for a company that, on average over the last six years, turns more than three-quarters of that EBITDA into unlevered pretax free cashflow? That's good enough for us.So, 69% total return in a little over a year notwithstanding, LMT remains at an acceptable valuation we think - with a long-term view at least. In this hair-trigger Fed-fuelled market, who knows what tomorrow may bring. We make no comment on trying to trade LMT in the short term. But with a three to five year and beyond view? We think this is a solid Buy - Long Term Hold.NASA Orion Capsule Illustration. Image Source: NASACestrian Capital Research, Inc - 26 January 2020."

Shares currently yield 2.27%.Analyzing Lockheed Martin, the business, through its cash flow and balance sheet.Valuing Lockheed Martin using a MARR analysis and dividend yield theory.","When you think of the defense industry, Lockheed Martin (LMT) is surely one of the first names that comes to mind. The defense industry is unfortunately one of those necessary evils in the modern world. Lockheed is a leader in the manufacturing of planes, missiles, helicopters and just about anything else related to defense. The US is by far the leader in defense spending and Lockheed has huge exposure to the US government, ~70% of FY 2018 revenues; however, Lockheed also has exposure to other countries around the world. With defense spending likely to rise and technology always updating and evolving, Lockheed Martin is poised to continue to reap the rewards of that necessary evil.The majority of my investments are in dividend growth companies. That means I want the companies I own to both pay and grow their dividend payment over time. By focusing on the dividend, I believe it helps to shift the focus towards the business fundamentals and the valuation and away from whatever the share price is doing in the short term.Image by author; data source: Lockheed Martin Investor Relations.*An interactive version of this chart can be found here.Lockheed Martin is a Dividend Contender with 16 consecutive years of dividend growth which covers the Great Recession of 2007/9. Lockheed's streak started back in 2003. The idea behind dividend growth investing is that you're selecting businesses that have a strong business model that will allow them to grow the dividend faster than the pace of inflation.The 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year rolling dividend growth rates since 2003 are shown in the following table.Table and calculations by author; data source: Lockheed Martin Investor Relations*2019's dividend assumes a payment of $2.20. Calculations are based off that assumption, although Lockheed Martin should announce a raise later this month.** An interactive version of this chart can be found here.As you can see in the above table, Lockheed has consistently rewarded investors with rapid dividend growth. Of the 16 1-year periods during Lockheed's dividend growth streak, annual dividend growth has ranged from 9.9% to 56.9% with an average increase of 20.6% and a median increase of 16.5%.My preference is to look at longer periods of time to see how the business has performed. Of the 12 rolling 5-year periods annualized, dividend growth has ranged from 11.4% to 27.3%. The average annualized dividend growth rate has come in at 19.7% with a median growth rate of 20.5%.Image by author; data source: Lockheed Martin SEC filingsSome of that rapid dividend growth has been fueled by a rising payout ratio. Excluding FY 2017 and including the TTM period, Lockheed's average earnings payout ratio has been 43.5%. Looking at the free cash flow payout ratio, the average has come to 43.7%, exclusive of FY 2012 and FY 2018.Businesses with some kind of advantage will show it in their financials. Companies that routinely grow sales, cash flow generating, grow their dividends or have higher margins than competitors, have some kind of advantage whether it's switching costs, patents, brand or some other form of barrier to their business model. As such, I prefer to examine the strength of the business through its financials as well as gain insight into management's plans.Image by author; data source: Lockheed Martin SEC filingsLockheed has managed to grow revenue from $43.8 B in FY 2009 to $53.8 B in FY 2018. That's ~22.6% total growth or 2.3% annualized. The TTM period is currently showing stronger revenue growth and sits 6.9% above FY 2018's level.Cash flow from operations has declined from $3.5 B to $3.1 B over the same period which is roughly a 10.0% decline in total or 1.2% annually. The TTM period is showing a nice rebound in operating cash flow and sits at $5.9 B.Likewise, free cash flow has seen a precipitous decline falling from $2.6 B to $1.9 B for the same period. That's approximately 29.4% total decline or 3.8% annually. However, once again the TTM period is perking back up and sits at $4.6 B. Image by author; data source: Lockheed Martin SEC filingsSince operating and free cash flow have both compressed, it should come as no surprise that Lockheed's cash flow margins have been under pressure. I generally want to see free cash flow margins above 10% as a sign of a strong cash generating business. Unfortunately, Lockheed has only hit that level twice over the last 10 years. Lockheed's average free cash flow margin for the last decade comes in at 6.9% and for the last 5 years it's 8.1%.Alternatively, I like to look at the free cash flow return on invested capital, ""FCF ROIC"", as a way to view the profitability of a business. The FCF ROIC is the cash based return that the business earns on the capital invested in the business. In theory, if you own the entire business outright under the current capital structure that would be the annual return that the business is generating to you in cash. Additionally, I want to see an FCF ROIC greater than 10% as well. Image by author; data source: Lockheed Martin SEC filingsLockheed's FCF ROIC has seen drastic moves both higher and lower over the last decade. Lockheed has generally been well above the 10% threshold with just one year, FY 2012, coming in at 9.8%. The average FCF ROIC over the last decade has been 27.9% with the five year average at 26.3%. Lockheed's FCF ROIC might not be a model of consistency; however, its profitability is generally very strong.When a company generates cash through its operations, I want to see a management team allocate the surplus in the following order:To understand how Lockheed uses its free cash flow, I calculate 3 variations of the metric, defined below:The reason that I examine the free cash flow this way is that it gives me insight into management's plans and how prudent they are being with their excess cash. A business with strong fundamentals and a prudent management will maintain positive FCFaDB more often than not. A few years of negative FCFaDB is not a concern because the economy waxes and wanes and sometimes opportunities come up that require spending more cash than is generated by the business. A positive FCFaDB is also what allows management to reward shareholders with a rising dividend and share repurchases to return excess cash to owners. If a management routinely has negative FCFaDB then they will be forced to seek alternative funding via asset sales, debt or drawing down cash on the balance sheet; none of which are good for me the shareholder. Image by author; data source: Lockheed Martin SEC filingsAs we saw above, Lockheed has maintained positive FCF every year over the last decade. Cumulatively, Lockheed has generated $31.43 B in FCF which has allowed management to pay and grow the dividend every year.Over the last decade Lockheed has paid out $16.11 B in dividends to shareholders in total. That puts the cumulative FCFaD at $15.31 B. Lockheed has had two years, FY 2012 and FY 2018, with negative FCFaD which is a bit of a concern.With a positive $15.31 B in cash flow to work with, Lockheed has been able to move to share repurchases as a way to return additional cash to shareholders with organically generated cash. Unfortunately, management has spent $20.05 B on share repurchases over the last decade which puts the FCFaDB at -$4.74 B. Lockheed has seen negative FCFaDB in 8 of the last 10 years. Image by author; data source: Lockheed Martin SEC filingsThe $20.05 B spent on buybacks have reduced the share count from 388.9 M in FY 2009 to 286.8 M in FY 2018. That's good for a 26.3% reduction in the share count or 3.3% per year.As I mentioned earlier, my preference is to see companies reinvest in the business with their excess cash, then move to paying and growing the dividend and only if there is still left over cash then move to share repurchases. The following chart shows the cash returned to shareholders portioned out between free cash flow supported dividends and share buybacks as well as buybacks funded by other sources. Image by author; data source: Lockheed Martin SEC filingsAs you can see not all of the share repurchases over the last decade have been funded from internally generated cash flow. Roughly 1/3 of the cash spent on share repurchases has been sourced from other means, i.e. debt, asset sales, cash on the balance sheet.Due to the overspending of cash flow, Lockheed's balance sheet has seen a corresponding decline. In FY 2009 the debt to capitalization ratio was roughly 55%; however, by the end of FY 2018 debt accounted for 91% of the capitalization ratio. Total debt has risen by over $9.0 B over that time. Image by author; data source: Lockheed Martin SEC filingsThe debt on Lockheed's balance sheet is overly burdensome at this time. Using TTM data, Lockheed's free cash flow interest coverage ratio was 6.7x which is excellent coverage. Management could also pay down the entire debt load with 3.0 years of the TTM FCF and 6.4 years of the TTM FCFaD. My preference is still to see less debt than more and it appears that management is working on reducing the debt load after it peaked in FY 2015 at $15.3 B and is now at $13.5 B.When it comes to valuing a business, one method that I like to use is the minimum acceptable rate of return, ""MARR"", analysis. The MARR analysis entails estimating future earnings and dividends that a company will produce and come up with a best guess on the valuation that market participants will value that earnings stream at. If the expected return is lower than your hurdle rate, then you wait for the expected return to rise before investing or look for other opportunities.Analysts expect Lockheed Martin to report FY 2019 EPS of $21.21 and for FY 2020 EPS to come in at $25.36. Over the next 5 years analysts expect Lockheed to show 14.5% annual earnings growth. I then assumed that Lockheed would be able to grow earnings at 7.0% per year for the following 5 years. Dividends are assumed to target a 40% payout ratio for the MARR analysis.When it comes to determining the future valuation that market participants will value an earnings stream at, I like to use history as a guide. Over the last decade, Lockheed Martin has typically traded between ~10x - 25x TTM P/E ratio. According to Morningstar, Lockheed's 5 year average TTM P/E is 23.5x. For the MARR analysis, I'll examine P/E ratios ranging from 10x - 25x.Data by YCharts[object HTMLElement]The following table shows the potential internal rates of return that an investment in Lockheed Martin could provide at varying ending P/E ratios. Returns follow the assumptions above and assume a purchase price of $388.25, Friday's closing price. Returns include dividend payments taken in cash and are calculated through the end of calendar year 2024, ""5 Year"", and calendar year 2029, ""10 Year"".Additionally I like to calculate the purchase price targets that would generate the returns that I desire from my investments. The target returns that I will use to determine the price targets are 10%, typically my minimum threshold for investment, and 17%. The 17% is derived from the ~11% estimated 10-year earnings growth rate plus the starting dividend yield of 2.3% plus 2.25% for 25% undervaluation realized over 10 years.Dividend yield theory is a valuation methodology that looks at the historical dividend yield that a business has provided, specifically comparing the current yield to the 5-year moving average yield. The idea behind dividend yield theory is largely reversion to the mean.Image by author; data source: Yahoo Finance and Lockheed Martin Investor Relations*An interactive version of this chart can be found here.The 5-year average dividend yield for Lockheed Martin is 2.78% which equates to a $316 share price based on the current quarterly dividend of $8.80. For dividend yield theory I consider the +/- 10% band to be the fair value range for the business in question which in Lockheed Martin's case would be $287-$352. That suggests that shares have possible downside risk of 9%-26%.Since Lockheed Martin is due to announce an increase to their dividend payment this week, the dividend yield theory values should be adjusted. Using the estimated dividend payment of $2.42, 10% higher than currently, shifts the fair value range higher to $316-$387 which suggests shares are trading at the top end of the fair value range.The big problem with owning Lockheed Martin is not related to the business fundamentals, rather it's getting over the fact that for the most part the business profits from destruction. I'm sure everyone wishes that the defense industry wasn't necessary, but the fact of the matter is that as long as there are people on this planet the defense industry will be here to stay.Lockheed isn't the most consistent company that I've looked at; however, there's a lot to like about the business. For one, dividend growth and capital gains have been fantastic due in large part to the business improving, although valuation expansion has played a role in the impressive price improvement.Lockheed's FCF margins aren't quite where I'd like to see them at, but their FCF ROIC is very impressive while regularly coming in north of 20%. I do have some concerns regarding the balance sheet, but nothing that is too worrisome as the debt is manageable and interest payments are well covered by free cash flow. In addition management appears to be undergoing a deleveraging process with total debt declining ~8% since the end of FY 2015. I do expect share repurchases to play less of a part in driving shareholder returns going forward which is something to consider.My largest concern lies with how reliant Lockheed Martin is on government defense spending, specifically the United States. While I believe that defense spending will always be a part of spending by governments around the world, there's no denying that Lockheed is highly reliant on the United States government.According to Wikipedia, the USA spent $643 B on defense spending in 2018 which is 3.8x the next largest spender, China. Adding to this risk is the fact that 70% of Lockheed Martin's revenues are from the US government in 2018 with another 28% from international governments. That's a heavy reliance on government defense spending, especially from the United States, which could be at the forefront of any potential cuts in government spending both domestically and internationally.Based on the MARR analysis, shares of Lockheed Martin appear quite attractive if you're after 10% annualized returns. Even looking at 13% annualized returns, estimated earnings growth plus the dividend yield, you could still stomach roughly 20% valuation compression to a 15x TTM P/E and still generate 13% annualized returns. That's pretty impressive and due in large part to the forecast growth of earnings. I would peg the fair value range based on MARR between $360-$430.The fair value based on dividend yield theory isn't quite as generous as it ranges from $316-$387. At a current price in the market around $388, Lockheed's shares are on the high end of fair value; however, you'd still be set up to capture most of the growth of the business without giving up too much from yield normalization, i.e. share price falling to have shares offer the 5-year average dividend yield.Given the growth expectations Lockheed Martin is really attractively valued compared to other businesses that I've looked at with similar growth profiles. Lockheed Martin looks like a solid investment based on MARR and a reasonable one based on dividend yield theory. I'd be tempted to initiate a position in my portfolio around current price levels; however, I would look for better valuations before committing a serious amount of capital."

The company's focus remains sharp on the F-35 fighter jet -- its most extensive program at about 25% of revenue -- as the company hastens output and improves affordability. Longer-term expectations aren't without risk, given budget uncertainty and intensifying battles for funding among significant weapons programs. However, Lockheed Martin remains a cash flow machine that is hard to go wrong with.1) Aircraft and Ships funding on the riseAircraft makers Boeing(BA), Lockheed(LMT), and Northrop(NOC), and shipbuilders Huntington Ingalls(HII) and General Dynamics(GD), are fairing well in Senate and House defense bill markups, which are up to $20 billion above the 2020 defense budget request, including another boost to the F-35. The U.S. seeks to replace aging fleets and improve capabilities.  Source: Defense newsSpace-based systems, while smaller at about $12 billion annually, should be a continued area of outsized growth.Senate and House appropriators are working with top lines $15-$20 billion above the president's 2020 budget requests, supporting critical programs for defense contractors and a view of sector-wide revenue growth into the next decade. Space-based systems, while smaller at about $12 billion annually, should be a continued area of outsized growth. The graph below illustrates the funding requests by each category. Aircraft and Ships lead the funding rise. However, all sectors are on an upward trend amid the U.S. fleet revamp.Source: Pentagon Budget Docs, BloombergThe Senate Appropriations Committee's 2020 defense bill supports funding 96 F-35 purchases for 2020, while the House bill supports 90 vs. the Pentagon's request for 78, continuing the recent trend of above-requested approvals. Lawmakers will have funded the purchase of at least 59 more F-35s than the Pentagon requested in 2017-20, underscoring the program's strong political support. Funding higher levels of the F-35 and supporting higher output are crucial to keeping unit costs down, yet appropriators are tasked with balancing Pentagon plans to fund more fourth-generation F-15s. The columns illustrate the F-35 Unit procurement Outlook for 2020. Source: Bloomberg Intelligence2) Overseas sales: A key revenue driver into 2020sForeign sales will remain a key revenue driver for U.S. defense contractors through the next decade, as allies bolster forces and capabilities. Revenue from international customers rose 12% in 2018 for the largest U.S. contractors combined, driven by Boeing's Kuwait F/A-18 deal and Northrop's acquisition of Orbital ATK. Overseas customers account for about a quarter of revenue for the group. This is up from 15% a decade ago. The graph illustrates the Oversee defense revenue (% of total). In my opinion, International revenue growth is very significant. Geopolitical uncertainty keeps increasing over the past few years, and international orders for defense products and services for LMT will follow this trend, as a result.Lockheed's F-35, the only stealth fighter jet in production, is integral to the future of U.S. and allied militaries. Over 3,000 are expected to be built, replacing a diverse set of aircraft, including the fleet-leading F-16. Timeliness and costs have improved, and a multiyear agreement for almost 500 aircraft will help drive unit prices lower, boosting confidence in the program.At over $400 billion to develop and procure, the F-35 is the U.S.'s most extensive weapons program. The aircraft accounts for 25% of prime contractor Lockheed Martin's revenue. Northrop Grumman and BAE are significant partners. Pratt & Whitney is the sole engine builder, while Rolls-Royce makes the B-model, vertical-lift system.  Source: ukdefencejournal3) F-35 Production plan is to top 170 a yearLockheed delivered 91 F-35s in 2018 and targets 131 F-35s in 2019. The output is seen rising to over 170 by 2022, representing a five-year more-than 25% compound annual increase and underscoring its role as a key growth driver for the company and suppliers. The program is estimated to generate over $15 billion of revenue in 2019 for prime contractor Lockheed, or more than a quarter of total sales, and over $2 billion for key partner Northrop Grumman. The graph shows the F-35 production outlook. Source: Bloomberg4) Stronger cash flows bolster defense contractors' share buybacksShare repurchases among the large defense contractors remain elevated in 2019, after a 2018 boost. I expect this trend will expand over the coming years. Cash flow is accelerating, and capital spending is peaking. A potential defense-spending plateau could re-emphasize shareholder returns.Spending by the large U.S. defense contractors on share repurchases increased in 2018 for the first time in three years, and it kept pace in 1H. The recent capital-spending cycle is peaking as the capacity to meet the production of new programs, such as the F-35 and B-21 bomber, is put in place. Lockheed says it already has the capacity to build more than 180 F-35s a year, twice 2018's deliveries. A potential slowdown in the U.S. defense spending expansion may usher in a more considerable emphasis on share repurchases by contractors as growth opportunities wane and with capacity in place to meet near-term needs. Defense contractors spent aggressively on share buybacks in 2012-16 as military budgets were tightened. A strengthening free-cash-flow outlook bodes well for shareholder returns. 5) Rooted Q3 ReportAs far as the latest report, Lockheed delivered relatively substantial numbers.Highlights From Recent Results:Lockheed's recent orders are weighted toward longer-term programs, underscoring 2020's revenue growth target of 5%, moderately below expectations.Source: BloombergStill, a 1.2x book-to-bill this year, including a strong demand for shorter-cycle missiles, suggests the company is conservative with its outlook. Lockheed raised its revenue view at least three times in each of the past three years. Operating margin will come under some pressure in 4Q, notably in the Missiles & Fire Control and Space businesses, as positive contract adjustments from earlier in the year won't repeat. However, it is still on an upward trend and miles away from the past five years. The higher-production F-35 program over the next decade should further improve margins.Source: BloombergThis will also weigh on 2020 profitability, though it remains robust at almost 11% on a segment level. Lockheed’s EPS may top $25 a share next year, nearly double from 2017, on healthy revenue growth and pension adjustments. Source: Bloomberg6) Fair valuationIn my view, LMT's valuation remains fair and in line with competitors/industry partners. The stock is currently trading at a PE of 15.6 vs. the competitor's PE of 15.1. I believe that a lower valuation should attract buyers, as what happened when the stock neared a PE multiple of ~12. The U.S. defense programs are going strong, and unless changed, I don't see any reason as to why LMT should trade lower, considering its strong buybacks and solid dividends.Source: BloombergEven after the rally, LMT has undergone, it still manages to return a significant shareholder yield of ~5.64%. The yield is impressive, considering also includes the $437M in financing activities, affected by raising $600M of long-term debt while paying back only $163M.Source: BloombergIn my opinion, LMT is a fantastic stock to hold in the defense sector. As long as defense budgets are on the rise, governments around the world will need to utilize LMT's products and services. I believe that the future outlook is optimistic based on my analysis, as well as the ongoing geopolitical uncertainty. The valuation seems fair, and while I would love to initiate a position, U.S. dividend withholding taxes are not the friendliest in Europe, so I will have to pass. A great stock to own, nonetheless."
4290667,104812,2019-09-10T04:37:49-04:00,"Lockheed Martin has increased the quarterly rate of its dividend on an annual basis for 16 consecutive years, and we forecast another rate hike to be announced later this month.A strong earnings outlook suggests the company has room to grow its dividend in the coming years.The article includes our dividend forecast for the stock and discusses trends in the payout ratio.","Defense and Aerospace giant Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE:LMT) has become a favorite among dividend growth investors with 16 consecutive annual increases going back to 2003. Looking back at the dividend history, the company has a very consistent pattern of announcing the Q4 rate hike in late September, which we expect to continue this month. The stock has been a strong performer during this decade and a big winner in 2019, up nearly 50% year to date, driven by better-than-expected earnings. This article forecasts the new dividend rate investors can expect, and discusses trends in the company's payout along with the long-term dividend growth outlook.(Source: FinViz.com)What's curious about LMT's dividend is that the timing follows a near-clockwork type schedule. We think this level of consistency and transparency is a positive for investors that may depend on the distribution as part of a regular income stream. Going back over the past decade, the Q4 dividend has always been announced in late September with a record date set on the first business day of December, and ultimately, the payment occurring on the last Friday business day of the year. We note that since 2003, the Q4 payout has included a rate hike which has been in the double-digit percent range.We expect the next dividend announcement to occur on Thursday, September 26th, with a record date of Monday, December 2nd and the payment date to occur on Friday, December 27th, 2019.LMT dividend historySource: Company IR / table by authorLockheed Martin has a history of paying dividends going back to 1995 but did cut the rate in the year 2000, which at the time was connected to a weaker earnings outlook following the stock market collapse of that year. Annual rate hikes resumed in 2003, with annual increases averaging 17% in the period since. We note that the increases have decelerated to a 10% average since 2015, with companies often viewing that threshold of ""double-digit"" growth for the dividend as an important benchmark to maintain.LMT annual dividend rate hikeSource: Company IR / graph by authorWhile Lockheed does not have a stated dividend policy, in the 2018 annual report, there were comments reflecting the company's cash deployment strategy highlighting the importance of the continued dividend:When analyzing historical payout ratios, it's important to recognize that companies vary in terms of how they set the dividend. In some cases, there is a clear connection between the payout and earnings or some other measure of cash flow. In Lockheed's case, GAAP earnings have grown steadily over the past decade but have been outpaced by the dividend growth over the past decade. This measure has also been more volatile considering non-recurring items, including the 2017 impact of the Tax Reform Act. The more traditional ""payout ratio"" based on earnings has increased from 30% in 2009 to 47% in 2018 and 42% over the trailing twelve months as of Q2 2019.Based on the table below which tracks the payout ratio in terms of earnings, free cash flow and EBITDA, we think the EBITDA measure has been the most consistent in recent years in describing Lockheed's dividend. The annual payout has averaged 30% of EBITDA since 2011 and been fairly steady, while EPS and free cash flow have had a wider variance.LMT dividend payout ratiosSource: Data by YCharts / table by authorConsidering the current quarterly dividend rate of $2.20 per share, we are forecasting a dividend increase of $0.25 per share to a new quarterly rate of $2.45. The 11.4% increase, if confirmed, would be the largest increase since 2014. Our forecast is fairly bullish compared to the 10% increases over the past three years, but we think the company has room here to reward shareholders considering the strong operational environment and outlook. EBITDA of $8.53 billion over the trailing twelve months through Q2 2019 is up 14% from $4.485 billion last year. This suggests that Lockheed has room to grow the dividend and maintain a stable or lower payout ratio.The company raised its full-year earnings guidance in the Q2 results to a range of $20.85-21.15, up from a previous target of $20.05-20.35, with a favorable outlook on profitability, which bodes well for a higher payout. From the Q2 conference call, management's optimistic tone bodes well for a more aggressive dividend increase compared to a flat 10% hike, in our opinion:Market EPS expectations are also bullish. Compared to EPS of $17.59 for 2018, current consensus estimates see the company earning $21.23 this year, an increase of 22% and above the high end of company guidance. The market also estimates EPS growth of 19% in 2020 and 9% in 2021. Indeed, the favorable outlook helps explain the strong market performance in the stock price this year.Data by YChartsWe forecast a new quarterly rate of $2.70 in 2020, a 10.2% y/y increase from our 2019 estimate. By 2021, all else equal, we think the company could reach a quarterly rate of $3.00 per share, an 11.1% y/y increase. The payout ratio in terms of earnings would remain between 40% and 45%, while tracking 30% of EBITDA assuming flat margins. It's worth noting that the company also maintains a share repurchasing authorization of $2.5 billion as of June 30, 2019. This is approximately the same amount as the annual dividend distribution. Lockheed has repurchased $500 million in common stock this year, highlighting the higher importance it places on the dividend compared to buybacks, which is in contrast to other companies that have done the opposite. This is a favorable trend for dividend investors, and also supports our view on strong dividend growth by the company.In terms of the dividend yield, our rate hike forecast implies a forward yield of 2.6%. By this measure, LMT appears fairly valued relative to its dividend yield over the past 5 years, since the stock really took off back in 2014. Overall, we have a neutral view on the direction of the stock price from the current level beyond the broader moves in the market but like the dividend growth outlook in particular. LMT currently trades at a P/E ratio of 18.7x (18.0x on a forward earnings basis), which compares to a 5-year average 18.5x. Again, the stock's valuation appears reasonable, and we think a Hold rating on LMT is appropriate.Data by YChartsInvestors can expect a dividend rate hike by Lockheed Martin later this month. We forecast the company will announce its next dividend on Thursday, September 26th, increasing the quarterly rate by 11.4% to $2.45. The forward yield on the stock is 2.6%, based on the current share price. A strong earnings growth outlook should provide room for the company to continue increasing the distribution for shareholders in the coming years."
4278543,104579,2019-07-29T05:47:53-04:00,"Lockheed reported great second quarter results and had a brief pullback.Being ever so opportunistic, I saw the results as great and decided to start a position in the stock.The company pays an attractive and growing dividend and continues to be a beneficiary of increased defense spending.","Photo SourceLockheed Martin (LMT) has been a beneficiary of the growing defense budgets of countries around the world. Being a premier manufacturer of planes, helicopters, missiles, and more, the company continues to see revenue rise in almost any economic environment. Due to defense being necessary and technology always evolving, the company has a stream of revenue that is as close to guaranteed as you can get. With shares trading down after the initial earnings report, I took the opportunity to add shares to my portfolio. I have long waited to initiate a position in the company and missed my chance earlier in the year to get shares. However, after this report, there was no doubt shares offered opportunity.In the third quarter earnings report, Lockheed reported earnings that beat on both the top and bottom lines.Source: Seeking AlphaThe company saw revenue grow 7.7% and earnings grow 23.4%. The company also raised its forecast for earnings per share of approximately $20.85-$21.15 (from $20.05–$20.35), on net sales of about $59B up from $56.75B.-$58.25B.Source: Earnings SlidesCash from operations in the second quarter of 2019 was $1.668 billion. The company can report lumpy cash flows however as it still funds its pension on an ongoing basis. This quarter the company did not make any pension contributions. Seeing the pension being funded is always a positive as it prevents a future overhang of liability from becoming a problem. For the full year the company see cash from operations coming in over $7.6 billion.The company continued to grow its backlog to a now astounding $137 billion and growing. Last time I reviewed the company it was only $109 billion. I expect the continued growth in the backlog to help support sales in times of economic hardship. Of course, backlog could change, but given the non-cyclical nature of the business it is probably safe to say that the company has two years' worth of revenue already in the pipeline. With continued growth in every division we can see why Lockheed shares continue to trade at a higher P/E multiple than other defense sector companies.Source: 10-QStrong growth in every division should give investors confidence that the company is firing on all cylinders. It is not always the case that every division within a company will see harmonious growth, so seeing this is great. The space division should continue to see growth as the expansion of private sector space exploration and development will cause the need for manufactured components. Also the potential for a future military division for space ventures could help immensely.The company continues to improve its balance sheet as well.Source: 10-QThe company reduced pension liabilities by about 1/3 in the last year, which is a huge improvement. While debt only saw a slight increase, it is not overwhelming considering the steady stream of cash Lockheed generates. As we saw earlier, the company is going to generate around $7.6 billion in cash this year. With the dividend costing about $2.5 billion, there is plenty left over for share repurchases, debt reduction, investments, and pension funding. This amount of cash generation and a stronger balance sheet will continue to let the company focus on future opportunities. With technological advances and competition continuing to heat up, the company needs to ensure it has premier products to win contracts with or else their R&D spend is a loss.The company expects there to be significant increases in its CH-53K deliveries in the coming years.Source: Investor PresentationThis will be a boost to future revenues and the potential for international sales will further more add to the demand.Perhaps the most exciting part about Lockheed's future is the growing need for replacement aircraft.Source: Investor PresentationWith many of the aircraft aging quickly and the needs from the military changing, the demand for new machines will only pick up. This is a positive long-term trend for Lockheed Martin and inevitably its stock.Additionally, not only is offensive military spend important, a growing need for defensive equipment has become important.Source: Investor PresentationLockheed has no shortage of equipment and brilliantly as it continues to develop new offensive equipment capabilities it increased demand for defense. Lockheed has been working on laser technology, bringing what was long fiction to reality. As this happens, it by nature creates the need for defense systems that can withstand laser attacks. This will only continue to develop their portfolio of options and the need for defense against one more possible attack method.Knowing the growth for revenue is strong, it is only a matter of paying a fair price for the stock. While such tailwinds create a higher growth rate and thus higher valuation metrics, every now and then the market offers an opportunity that shouldn't be overlooked.Looking at valuation versus peers we see the following.Data by YChartsLockheed trades at the second highest forward P/E ratio, but the shares also offer the highest TTM yield and lowest PEG ratio. This means investors probably are getting a fair deal considering the better than expected growth but small premium assigned to future earnings.Looking at valuation metrics for the last 5 years, we can see where shares should generally trade.Source: MorningstarThe shares trade slightly above their 5-year average P/S ratio but trade below their average P/E ratio. It currently trades at a premium to its forward P/E, but trades at a discount to its cash flow. I do not believe the forward P/E has been adjusted by Morningstar to reflect the higher guidance yet. Given all the above information, it is safe to say that the stock isn't overvalued but isn't undervalued by much either. However, getting shares at such a low forward multiple now with guidance just raised may be a good deal. Investors can take advantage of the share price now and if it should pull back again maybe increase their position.Looking at historical yield to see if it is above average or below is one of my favorite methods to see if a stock is undervalued.Source: YieldChartThe average yield for LMT is 2.3%, with shares currently yielding 2.39%; this means shares are trading in line with their average yield. This means the shares are not over or undervalued in this case either. I see the potential being in the next dividend raise.If the company raises the dividend close to its 5-year average growth rate of 11.4%, the shares should offer a future yield around $9.75 which would represent a 2.65% yield at today's prices. This would be an above average dividend yield. In the last 24 years, shares have only yielded above 2.6% about 37% of the time. The spike in the yield was during the last government administration when defense spending was due to be cut. However, that has since been increased and the government is pro defense. Additionally, the company has been raising its dividend for 17 years, with the last increase being 10% to $2.20 per quarter or $8.80 annually. Continuing to grow the dividend in the future is a focus for management and there is plenty of room to do so with a payout ratio of less than 50%.Lockheed Martin offers investors the chance to benefit off the growing demand for defense needs by countries around the world. A growing population and new technologies will continue to grow the demand for a variety of products. Additionally, aging machines in the defense fleets around the world will create a need for continued replacement along with additions. This will benefit Lockheed Martin for many years to come and is evident by the large backlog already present. The company faces little risk other than a lower defense budget from the United States, its largest customer, but it will be very hard to do this with nations around the world ramping up. If the shares pull back again from here, I will be adding more to my new position. The brief pullback after earnings was a great chance to add a great company at a fair price to the portfolio."
4295433,104980,2019-10-07T13:21:57-04:00,"Having raised its dividend for the past 17 years, Lockheed Martin is a Dividend Contender.Despite the inherent risk of being the leading defense contractor, Lockheed Martin is a well-managed defense contractor with a strong balance sheet.Adding to the case for an investment in Lockheed Martin is the fact that the company is trading at what I believe to be fair value.Between Lockheed Martin's 2.5% yield, 7-8% earnings growth, and a static valuation multiple, Lockheed Martin is likely to deliver annual total returns of at least 9.5-10.5% over the next decade.It's for these reasons that I'm proud to announce I have finally opened in a position in Lockheed Martin.","As I discussed in my article on Wells Fargo last week, there are a few sectors that I would like to increase my allocation to in the years ahead. Specifically, I'd like to increase my allocation and diversification within the financial services, industrials, and technology sectors to an extent.Image Source: Personal CapitalI took yet another step toward increasing my exposure in financials and industrials. Aside from the position that I initiated in Wells Fargo last week, I also initiated a position in Lockheed Martin (LMT). As a side note, I'll also be detailing my other purchases for the month of October in a few weeks.Today, we'll analyze Lockheed Martin's dividend safety and growth profile, the company's fundamentals and risks, as well as the valuation at the current price.I'll then conclude the article by offering my prediction of Lockheed Martin's annual total return potential over the next decade.As a dividend growth investor, I have found it's always prudent to examine the safety of a company's dividend, as well as the growth potential of such dividend. We'll assess the extent to which Lockheed Martin's dividend is safe by measuring both the company's EPS and FCF payout ratios.In its prior fiscal year, Lockheed Martin generated $17.59 in diluted EPS against dividends per share of $8.20 during that time, for an EPS payout ratio of 46.6%.For the current fiscal year, Lockheed Martin recently raised its outlook from $20.05-$20.35 in diluted EPS to $20.85-$21.15 against dividends per share slated to be $9.00, for an EPS payout ratio of 42.9%, using the diluted EPS midpoint figure of $21.00.Moving to the FCF payout ratios, Lockheed Martin generated $3.138 billion in operating cash flow in 2018 (which was due to an exceptionally high $5.0 billion in pension contributions in 2018 according to page 23 of Lockheed Martin's most recent 10-K) against $1.278 billion in capital expenditures, for total FCF of $1.860 billion.Against the $2.347 billion in dividends paid during this time, Lockheed Martin's FCF payout ratio equates to 126.2%.Through the first 6 months of this year, Lockheed Martin has generated $3.331 billion in operating cash flow against $533 million in capital expenditures, for total FCF of $2.798 billion (page 6 of Lockheed Martin's most recent 10-Q filing). Against the $1.260 billion in dividends paid during that time, this works out to a much more sustainable 45.0% FCF payout ratio.When examining this entire fiscal year, Lockheed Martin is expecting a ramp up in both operating cash flow and capital expenditures for the second half of this year.As detailed in the company's most recent earnings call, CFO Kenneth Possenriede stated that Lockheed Martin is now expecting $7.6 billion in operating cash flow against $1.7 billion in capex, for total FCF of $5.9 billion.Against the roughly $2.6 billion in dividends that will be paid out this fiscal year, we arrive at a sustainable 44.1% FCF payout ratio.When we factor in Lockheed Martin's sustainable payout ratios, strong balance sheet, and record backlog, it becomes clear that the company's dividend is quite safe for the foreseeable future.Image Source: Simply Safe DividendsGiven our analysis above, it should come as no surprise that Simply Safe Dividends and I are in agreement that Lockheed Martin's dividend is very safe for the foreseeable future.Now that we've established that Lockheed Martin's dividend is safe, we'll discuss the company's dividend growth potential going forward.Image Source: Simply Safe DividendsAs a side note, Lockheed Martin recently announced a 9.1% increase in its quarterly dividend from $2.20/share to $2.40/share, which isn't yet included in the image above.With that addressed, I believe it is reasonable to expect Lockheed Martin's dividend to mirror whatever earnings growth the company can deliver over the long-term due to its ideal payout ratios at this time.Given that Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq are forecasting annual earnings growth of 14.5% and 7.3% over the next 5 years, respectively, it's highly likely that Lockheed Martin will at least be able to continue with the high single digit increases for the foreseeable future.In fact, I would argue that the only reason the company's dividend increase wasn't 10%+ this year was due to the upcoming 2020 elections. Rather than potentially overextending itself with a 15 or 20% raise and the possibility of a less military spending friendly administration, Lockheed Martin wisely opted to remain conservative with its dividend increase this year until the aftermath of the 2020 elections is clear.Now that we have addressed the safety and growth potential of Lockheed Martin's dividend, we'll transition into what will be driving the growth that the analysts have forecasted in the years ahead.Lockheed Martin is the largest defense contractor and largest supplier of fighter aircraft in the world. While the company is most known for its Aeronautics segment and specifically its F-35 joint strike fighter, the company's other three segments meaningfully contributed to the $53.8 billion in net sales in 2018.Lockheed Martin operates in the following four business segments:Aeronautics: According to page 3 of Lockheed Martin's most recent 10-K, Aeornautics is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Major programs include the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter (which contributed to 27% of total consolidated net sales in 2018 and 68% of Aeronautics sales in 2018), the C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon, and F-22 Raptor. The Aeuronautics segment as a whole represented 40% of Lockheed Martin's total consolidated net sales in 2018.Missiles and Fire Control or MFC: According to page 4 of Lockheed Martin's most recent 10-K, MFC provides air and missile defense systems; tactical missiles and air-to-ground precision strike weapon systems; logistics; fire control systems; mission operations support, readiness, engineering support and integration services; manned and unmanned ground vehicles; and energy management solutions. MFC also has contracts with the U.S. Government for various classified programs. Major programs include Patriot Advanced Capability-3, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense air and missile defense programs, Multiple Launch Rocket System, Javelin tactical missile program, Apache, SNIPER, Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night fire control systems programs. The MFC segment accounted for 16% of the company's total consolidated net sales in 2018.Rotary and Mission Systems or RMS: According to page 5 of Lockheed Martin's most recent 10-K, RMS provides design, manufacture, service and support for a variety of military and commercial helicopters; ship and submarine mission and combat systems; mission systems and sensors for rotary and fixed-wing aircraft; sea and land-based missile defense systems; radar systems; the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS); simulation and training services; and unmanned systems and technologies. In addition, RMS supports the needs of government customers in cybersecurity and delivers communications and command and control capabilities through complex mission solutions for defense applications. Major programs include the Blackhawk and Seahawk helicopters, Aegis Combat System, CH-53K King Stallion helicopter, VH-92A helicopter, and Advanced Hawkeye Radar System. The RMS segment accounted for 26% of total consolidated net sales in 2018.Space: According to page 5 of Lockheed Martin's most recent 10-K, Space is engaged in the research, design, development, engineering and production of satellites, space transportation systems, and strategic, advanced strike, and defensive systems. Space provides network-enabled situational awareness and integrates complex space and ground global systems to help our customers gather, analyze and securely distribute critical intelligence data. Space is also responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems. The segment's major programs include the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile, Space Based Infrared System and Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared system programs, and Advanced Extremely High Frequency system. The segment accounted for the remaining 18% of total consolidated net sales in 2018.Now that we have a better understanding of Lockheed Martin's business segments, we'll transition to our discussion of Lockheed Martin's operating fundamentals.Image Source: Lockheed Martin 2nd Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call PresentationContinuing upon its strong financial results the past several years, Lockheed Martin reported yet another strong quarter, beating analyst GAAP EPS estimates by $0.23 and posting a revenue beat of $260 million. The company delivered 8% YOY sales growth and 6% YOY segment operating profit growth.In addition to the strong quarter from Lockheed Martin, the company also reported that its backlog reached yet another record, topping $137 billion. This suggests that the company is positioning itself for continued success in the future.Image Source: Lockheed Martin 2nd Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call PresentationLockheed Martin continued to return capital to its shareholders in the 2nd quarter, returning 59% of FCF through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. The company executed $219 million of share buybacks in Q2 2019, which certainly isn't an insignificant amount for a company with a market cap just north of $100 billion, especially considering that given the recent authorization of an additional $1 billion in share repurchases, the total remaining authorization for future repurchases is approximately $3.3 billion (3% of the company's market cap).The company's strong operating fundamentals also prompted management to increase its outlook for the year.Image Source: Lockheed Martin 2nd Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call PresentationLockheed Martin increased its sales, segment operating profit, diluted EPS, and operating cash flow guidance due to its strong business performance, which saw all 4 of the company's business segments post YOY growth.Image Source: Lockheed Martin 2nd Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call Presentation Lockheed Martin's largest segment of Aeronautics posted 4% YOY growth driven by the timing on the F-35 program, and the F-35 program is actually tracking ahead of the year to date plan, as indicated by CFO Ken Possenriede in the company's most recent earnings call.In addition, RMS posted 6% YOY growth that was driven by multiple programs that are IWSS line of business, but were partially offest by Sikorsky primarily due to lower volume.MFC posted an impressive 16% YOY growth, which was driven by ramping up production rates for tactical and strike weapons, in addition to increased sales in new hypersonics and classified programs.Space rounded out the impressive quarter by delivering 11% YOY growth, which was driven by growth in its hypersonics program and volume increases in next-gen OPIR and GPS government satellite programs.In addition to Lockheed Martin's strong operating fundamentals, the company possesses a reasonably strong balance sheet.Image Source: Simply Safe DividendsAs illustrated above, Lockheed Martin's net debt to EBITDA and interest coverage metrics have improved considerably over the past few years while the net debt to capital metric has remained largely unchanged the past few years. Overall, Lockheed Martin's balance sheet is fairly strong, with net debt to EBITDA coming in well below 3, and interest coverage coming in at nearly 12 over the past 12 months.It's for this reason that S&P affirmed its A- rating of Lockheed Martin this May, which is upper medium investment grade.Besides the solid operating fundamentals and firmly investment grade balance sheet of Lockheed Martin, the company also possesses a capable management team.Chairwoman, President and CEO Marillyn Hewson joined Lockheed Martin more than 35 years ago as an industrial engineer, serving in a number of roles prior to being appointed to her current position, including as EVP of Global Sustainment for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, Senior VP of Corporate Shared Services, VP of Global Supply Chain Management, and VP of Corporate Internal Audit. Ms. Hewson also serves on the Board of Directors for Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and previously served on the Board of Directors for DuPont, DowDuPont, and Carpenter Technology.While Kenneth Possenriede is fairly new to the CFO position (having taken over for Bruce Tanner following his recent retirement), Mr. Possenriede has a breadth of experience. Prior to his new role of CFO, Mr. Possenriede served as VP of Finance and Program Management at Aeronautics, and as VP and Treasurer for Lockheed Martin.Ms. Hewson, Mr. Possenriede, and other key executives at Lockheed Martin possess a wealth of experience and many possess decades of industry experience necessary to continue guiding the company in the right direction.Between Lockheed Martin's operating fundamentals, reasonably strong balance sheet, and experienced management team, I believe the company could prove to be a great investment at the right price.Although Lockheed Martin is what I believe to be a high-quality company, that doesn't mean an investment in the company comes without its fair share of risks.The first risk to Lockheed Martin is that the company derived 70% of its 2018 net sales from the U.S. Government (of which, 60% was from the Department of Defense), either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor. Another 28% of Lockheed Martin's 2018 sales were derived from international customers (including foreign military sales contracted through the U.S. Government) and 2% were from U.S. commercial and other customers (page 3 of Lockheed Martin's most recent 10-K).Because Lockheed Martin expects to continue to derive a significant majority of its sales from the U.S. Government, this exposes Lockheed Martin to concentration risk (page 9 of Lockheed Martin's most recent 10-K).Lockheed Martin's contracts are based upon the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations. If we've learned anything about the defense industry in the past, it's that the risk of sequestration budget cuts is one that could lead to bumps in the road for defense contractors, such as Lockheed Martin.Image Source: Simply Safe DividendsTake for instance, that Lockheed Martin's earnings stagnated from 2009 to 2011, before returning to strong growth in 2012, and this point is reinforced. While defense spending is likely to increase in the years ahead, there will undoubtedly be bumps in the road that could negatively impact Lockheed Martin's growth prospects over the short to medium-term.The second risk to Lockheed Martin is that as a defense contractor, the company's long-term success as a business is dependent upon consistently delivering on customer expectations and contract requirements (pages 10-11 of Lockheed Martin's most recent 10-K).Cost overruns or the failure to perform on existing programs could adversely impact the company's ability to retain existing programs and win future contract awards.Adding to the risk toward Lockheed Martin in this respect is the fact that the company is the prime contractor on most of its contracts (page 12 of Lockheed Martin's most recent 10-K). Because Lockheed Martin often works with subcontractors and suppliers on these contracts, there is the risk that a subcontractor or supplier to Lockheed Martin is unable to meet its obligations, which would also have the potential to adversely impact Lockheed Martin's reputation and financial results.Yet another risk to Lockheed Martin is the fact that increased competition and bid protests in a budget-constrained environment could make it difficult for Lockheed Martin to meet its long-term growth targets and maintain customer relationships (pages 11-12 of Lockheed Martin's most recent 10-K).Due to the competitive bidding nature of the defense industry, there is the potential that Lockheed Martin could face pricing pressure and that the company is required to submit multiple bids and proposals, which would negatively impact the company's costs. Following the award of government contracts, Lockheed Martin also faces the risk of significant expenses, delays, contract modifications, or bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards.In the event any of these risks manifest themselves on the numerous programs of Lockheed Martin, this could adversely weigh on the company's financial results.Another notable risk to Lockheed Martin is its international exposure (pages 12-13 of Lockheed Martin's most recent 10-K). In addition to the risk of currency fluctuations that could negatively impact the company's financial results at any given time, there are a number of threats to Lockheed Martin's international operations, which include but aren't limited to tariffs, sanctions, embargoes, other trade restrictions, and unstable political environments.The final notable risk to Lockheed Martin is that as a defense contractor, it is paramount that Lockheed Martin is able to adequately protect its intellectual property, the data of its customers and employees, and other third party data, such as subcontractors, suppliers, and vendors (pages 13-14 of Lockheed Martin's most recent 10-K). Any inability on the part of Lockheed Martin to protect data and intellectual property could result in damage to the company's reputation and lead to potential liabilities related to intellectual property and civil liberties, which may not be fully insured or indemnified.While we have discussed many of what I believe are key risks associated with an investment in Lockheed Martin, I would refer interested readers to pages 9-18 of the company's most recent 10-K for a more complete discussion of the risks facing Lockheed Martin.Now that we have established Lockheed Martin is a high-quality company firing on all cylinders, we will transition into the valuation aspect of an investment in the company.The first valuation metric we'll examine to arrive at a fair value for shares of Lockheed Martin is the 5 year average dividend yield.According to Simply Safe Dividends, Lockheed Martin's dividend yield of 2.49% is 10% below its 5 year average yield of 2.76%.Assuming a reversion to its 5 year average yield of 2.76% and a fair value of $347.83 a share, Lockheed Martin is trading at a 10.7% premium to fair value and poses 9.6% downside from its current price of $384.95 a share (as of October 6, 2019).The next valuation metric we'll use to determine the fair value of shares of Lockheed Martin is the 5 year average forward PE ratio.According to Simply Safe Dividends, Lockheed Martin's forward PE ratio of 16.8 is well below its 5 year average of 18.5.Assuming a reversion to a forward PE ratio of 18.5 and a fair value of $423.90 a share, Lockheed Martin is trading at a 9.2% discount to fair value and offers 10.1% upside from the current price.The final valuation method that we'll use to assign a fair value to shares of Lockheed Martin is the dividend discount model or DDM.Image Source: InvestopediaThe first input into the DDM is the expected dividend per share, which is simply another term for a company's annualized dividend per share. In the case of Lockheed Martin, the current annualized dividend per share is $9.60.The next input into the DDM is the cost of capital equity, which is the rate of return that an investor requires. While this varies by investor, I require a 10% rate of return as I believe that adequately rewards me for the time and effort that I put into researching and monitoring my investments.The third and final input into the DDM is the long-term dividend growth rate or DGR.While the first input can be arrived at within a few seconds and the second input is a matter of investor preference, accurately estimating the long-term DGR is considerably more difficult because it involves a number of factors, including a company's payout ratios, the long-term earnings growth rate that the company is able to achieve, industry fundamentals, and company fundamentals.When we take into consideration that Lockheed Martin's payout ratio is in an ideal range, it's reasonable to conclude that dividend growth will roughly mirror whatever the company is able to achieve in terms of earnings growth over the long-term.Because I believe that the fundamentals of the defense industry remain intact and that Lockheed Martin's balance sheet is fairly strong, I believe a 7.5% long-term DGR is a realistic assumption going forward.Upon plugging the above inputs into the DDM, we arrive at a fair value of $384.00 a share. This implies that shares of Lockheed Martin are trading at a 0.2% premium to fair value and pose 0.2% downside from the current price.When we average the three fair values, we arrive at a fair value of $385.24 a share, which indicates that shares of Lockheed Martin are trading at a 0.1% discount to fair value and pose 0.1% upside from the current price.Lockheed Martin is the preeminent defense contractor and supplier of fighter aircraft in the world. This has allowed the company to deliver 17 consecutive dividend increases. Given that global military spending has been a relative constant since the dawn of time, I don't foresee the dividend increases halting any time soon.Despite the inevitable unpredictability of military spending from year to year, I believe the trend of increased military spending will continue in the years ahead. Lockheed Martin is the leader in an industry with no shortage of demand, in addition to boasting a reasonably strong balance sheet and experienced management team.Adding to the case for an investment in Lockheed Martin is the fact that the company is trading at a price that I believe is well within its fair value range.Sure, the company isn't trading at a bargain. On the other hand, it isn't trading at a premium from my perspective either. I'm content to pay fair value for this high-quality company, which is why I initiated a 1 share starter position in Lockheed Martin at a cost of $375.45.Between Lockheed Martin's 2.5% yield, 7-8% earnings growth, and a static valuation multiple, Lockheed Martin is likely to deliver annual total returns of at least 9.5-10.5% over the next decade. Given the quality of this company and its leadership position in an industry that is likely to see continued growth over the long-term (though, there will almost certainly be significant fluctuations in military spending from year to year depending on a host of variables such as political instability throughout the world and economic conditions), I believe this is an acceptable return for my risk tolerance.As an aside to this article, I would like to conclude by thanking everyone within the Seeking Alpha community that has followed my work over the past number of months. With the publication of this week's articles, we have surpassed 2,000 followers. While I'm still in the early stages of my time here on Seeking Alpha as a contributor, this was a number I never could have imagined reaching when I first began writing last year. I just wanted to acknowledge that I quite literally couldn't have done it without the support of this wonderful community, so for that, I thank each and every one of you."

The company has steady growth and has plenty of cash, which it uses to expand its product line and buy back shares. The company is being reviewed using The Good Business Portfolio guidelines, my IRA portfolio of good business companies that are balanced among all styles of investing. LMT is 0.8% of my portfolio, and the only regret I have is I did not buy a larger starting position.The graphic below shows the F-35, the United States' most advanced fighter.Source: Sky NewsWhen I scanned the five-year chart, Lockheed Martin has a great chart going up and to the right for years 2014 thru 2017. The dip in 2018 created a buying opportunity for this solid growth and income investment as can be seen with the strong upswing in 2019.Data by YChartsFundamentals of Lockheed Martin will be reviewed on the following topics below.I use a set of guidelines that I codified over the last few years to review the companies in The Good Business Portfolio (my portfolio) and other companies that I am taking a look at. For a complete set of the guidelines, please see my article ""The Good Business Portfolio: Update to Guidelines, August 2018."" These guidelines provide me with a balanced portfolio of income, defensive, total return, and growing companies that hopefully keeps me ahead of the Dow average.Lockheed Martin passes 11 of 11 Good Business Portfolio guidelines, a good score (a good score is 10 or 11). These guidelines are only used to filter companies to be considered in the portfolio. Some of the points brought out by the guidelines are shown below.The Good Business Portfolio Guidelines are just a screen to start with and not absolute rules. When I look at a company, the total return is a key parameter to see if it fits the objective of the portfolio. Lockheed Martin beat against the Dow baseline in my 55-month test compared to the Dow average. I chose the 55-month test period (starting January 1, 2015, and ending to date) because it includes the great year of 2017, and other years that had a fair and bad performance. The great total return of 163.14% makes Lockheed Martin a great investment for the total return investor. Lockheed Martin has an above-average dividend yield of 2.5% and has had increases for 17 years, making Lockheed Martin a good choice for the dividend-income investor. The Dividend is estimated to be increased in September 2019 to $2.40/Qtr. or a 9% increase.Dow's 55-Month total return baseline is 51.31%For the last quarter on July 23, 2019, Lockheed Martin reported earnings that beat expectations by $0.28 at $5.00, compared to last year at $4.05. Total revenue was higher at $14.33 billion more than a year ago by 7.7% year over year and beat expected revenue by $260 million. This was a good report with bottom-line beating expectations and the top line increasing with a good increase compared to last year. The next earnings report will be out in October 2019 and is expected to be $4.88 compared to last year at $5.14.The graphic below shows the second-quarter earnings highlights.Source: 2nd quarter earnings call slidesLockheed Martin is the largest manufacturer of military defense systems sold in the United States and foreign countries.As per excerpts from ReutersOverall, Lockheed Martin is a good business with 13% CAGR projected growth as the worldwide economy grows going forward with the increasing demand for LMT's military products. The F-35 program provides a strong base of ongoing sales for the best fighter jet in the world for years and years to come. The good earnings and revenue growth looking forward provides LMT with the capability to continue its growth as the defense business increases, and foreign sales are expanded.The graphic below shows the 2019 sales projection by major product lines.Source: 2nd quarter earnings call slidesThe Fed has kept interest rates low for some years, and on December 19, 2018, they raised the base rate of 0.25%, which was expected. I believe that they will go slow in 2019, which should help keep the economy on a growth path. If infrastructure spending can be increased, this will even increase the United States' growth going forward with better economics for the consumer. At the March 20 meeting, the Fed lowered the United States' GDP projection for 2019 which they said was getting to neutral on the economy, projecting no rate increases for 2019. The Fed meeting Statement was a wait and see and a bit more dovish than the last meeting. At the June 2019 meeting, the Fed suggested that there could be one or two rate cuts this year.From July 23, 2019, earnings release Marillyn Hewson (Chief Executive Officer, President, and Chairman) saidThis shows the feelings of top management for the continued growth of the Lockheed Martin business and shareholder return with an increase in future growth. LMT has good constant growth and will continue as the world military budgets grow.The graphic below shows the 2019 guidance for Lockheed Martin.Source: 2nd quarter earnings call slidesLockheed Martin is a good investment choice for the total return and income investor with its good projected growth as worldwide defense budgets increase, and the company buys back shares. Lockheed Martin is 0.8% of the Good Business Portfolio and will be added too when cash is available. LMT gets a bit of an edge over other defense companies because it has a strong income and better growth prospects. If you want a steady growing total return and income in the growing defense business, LMT may be the right investment for you.I intend to watch the earnings reports for the companies in the portfolio and may finally decide to trim my high flyers that are over 8% of the portfolio so I can invest in good companies on my buy list.The five companies comprising the largest percentage of the portfolio are: Johnson & Johnson at 7.9% of the portfolio, the Eaton Vance Enhanced Equity Income Fund II (EOS) at 8.3% of the portfolio, Home Depot at 9.6% of the portfolio, Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI) at 8.2% of the portfolio, and Boeing (BA) at 13.0% of the portfolio. Therefore, BA, EOS, JNJ, OHI, and HD are now in trim position, but I am letting them run a bit since they are great companies.Boeing is going to be pressed to 15% of the portfolio because of it being cash positive on 787 deferred plane costs at $938 million in the first quarter of 2019, an increase from the fourth quarter. The second quarter 2018 earnings beat expectations by $0.06 at $3.33, but a good report was hurt by a write-off expense on the KC-46, which has started delivery in 2019. Thirteen KC-46A tankers have been delivered YTD for 2019. Boeing has dropped in the last 4 months because of the second 737 Max crash, and I look at this as an opportunity to buy BA at a reasonable price. This is just my opinion. An FAA representative said on May 23 that the 737 Max could be flying again by late June. The latest news has the 737-Max flying by October; it's taking much too long. On July 19th BA said that it expects to have the 737 Max flying by the early fourth quarter and BA went up $16. The second-quarter earnings report was real bad, and BA lost $20 over two days.JNJ will be pressed to 9% of the portfolio because of its defensive nature in this post-BREXIT world. Earnings in the last quarter beat on the top and bottom line, and Mr. Market did nothing. JNJ in April 2019 increased the dividend to $0.95/Qtr., which is 57 years in a row of increases. JNJ is not a trading stock but a hold forever; it is now a strong buy as the healthcare sector remains under pressure.The total return for the Good Business Portfolio is ahead of the Dow average YTD by 3.82%, which is a nice gain above the market for the portfolio with BA a strong drag. Each quarter after the earnings season, I write an article giving a complete portfolio list and performance, the latest article is titled “The Good Business Portfolio: 2019 1st Quarter Earnings and Performance Review.” Become a real-time follower, and you will get each quarter's performance after this earnings season is over."
4293562,59781,2019-09-25T16:49:36-04:00,Lockheed Martin has been increasing its dividend annually for 16 years.The company has been doing well for years and continues the trend this year.Solid fundamentals set the stage for another stellar dividend hike this year.,"With all the uncertainty and negativity around, it's a nice consolation to know that you can at least make some money off of all this. And a relatively simple way to do so is to own stocks of Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). If shit hits the fan in terms of geopolitical risk and potential conflicts, the resulting increase in arms sales will fatten the purse of loyal shareholders of Lockheed Martin. Data by YChartsOver the last five years the stock is up 114% -- before dividends. Factoring in around a 2% dividend yield, the annual total return is more than 18%. Yes, we've been in a bull market, but getting a return like this in a relatively smooth fashion from a stable defence company is by all respects really good. Even though it's by no means a dividend king, Lockheed Martin has been paying dividends for a considerable number of years. It has been irregular for much of the time, though. It started paying a dividend back in 1995, but it only started increasing regularly in 2003. Since then, it's been committed to annual increases. If it keeps this up, it's not going to be too long before it's labeled a dividend aristocrat. Ten years ago the quarterly dividend per share was $0.57. The current dividend is $2.20 for a total increase of 3.9x or an annual average increase of 14.5%. This is a growth rate that is not sustainable over the long term and the growth rate has indeed been coming down recently.Data by YChartsAs can be seen in the chart, the dividend has been rising steadily over the last five years. If there is one thing we can call the Board of Lockheed Martin, it is that it is consistent. The last four dividend increases have been of exactly 10% each. Before that it was 13% and six years ago it was 16%.The payout-ratio is another story. It's been around the 50% mark for the most time but has now and then veered off to 42% on the downside and around 105% on the upside. This, of course, is because of volatility of earnings. In 2017, the EPS came in quite a bit lower than in previous years. Luckily, earnings were back up last year and it seems it will continue up this year. Consequently, I am not too worried about the payout ratio as it should land comfortably below 50% on this year's earnings.So as we've seen, this company loves to reward its shareholders with generous dividend increases. Its history was a bit volatile in terms of dividend growth for a number of years, but it has been very consistent for a several years now. The baseline is therefore for the customary 10% dividend hike. On the other hand, if things were going especially good or bad at the company, the Board would have to evaluate whether the situation is a short term deviation from the trend or a real change to the business. If the latter, it would also have to change its dividend growth habits. Well, judging from its latest earnings report, it doesn't look like this company has any problems making ever more money. Earnings for the quarter jumped 23% to $5.00 from $4.05 a year ago and guidance for the full year was raised. The low end of projected EPS for 2019 was raised to $20.85. If the company were to reach this low end it would entail a payout ratio of 42%. Clearly, then, the company does have some leeway to increase the dividend this year.An EPS of $20.85 would mean that the company grows earnings a full 18.5% from the 2018 level of $17.59. There is thus an argument to be made for a pretty substantial dividend hike of nearly 20%. In and of itself there would be nothing wrong with that, but I do not think the Board would go that far. The business this company operates in is not entirely predictable, to say the least, and so it is prudent to use the good years to leave some ammunition for the inevitable rough years coming up.On the low end, the Board could be extra conservative and go for a substantially lower hike than the last couple of years. Then again, as the CEO stated in the earnings report, the company is fully committed to creating long-term value for shareholders. Given the conservative payout ratio there is clearly enough money to invest in profitable projects so the natural way to reward shareholders would be to offer decent dividend growth on the back of strong earnings growth. I therefore see no compelling reason for an unusually low hike this year. My prediction is therefore that the company will land somewhere in the middle, i.e. offer a dividend hike in-line with recent years of 10%. That would mean a new quarterly dividend of $2.42. A major risk for defence contractors is that its customers are few and powerful. If Lockheed Martin screws up its relationship to the U.S. Government, let's just say earnings will take a real hit for a long time! Further, especially in these times, there are shifting friendships and alliances around the world. For instance, NATO-ally Turkey is soon going to activate its Russian missile system. If you can't even sell to your allies anymore, the market situation is getting murkier. Another risk, which admittedly would be good for most of us, is the spreading of peace around the world. If the world becomes more peaceful, defence spending will inevitably come down. Lastly, tighter public budgets around the world will put pressure on defence contractors' revenues.Before getting too enthusiastic about a possible investment, it's always a good idea to consult some key multiples both with respect to the company itself but also some of its competitors. As a peer group I've chosen two close competitors: Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) and Raytheon (RTN). True, the latter is in the process of being acquired by United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) but it's still trading as an independent company and I think it is more directly comparable than United Technologies.Source: MorningstarAll the three companies are trading quite similarly on the Price/Sales ratio with Raytheon coming out narrowly as the most expensive of the three. Narrow is the trading range when it comes to the Price/Earnings ratio too with Northrop Grumman losing while Raytheon is the cheapest one with a multiple of 18.1x.When we come the dividend yield, we finally have some more stretch in the field. Northrop Grumman is unquestionably the most expensive of the three, with Raytheon solidly in the middle whereas Lockheed Martin comes out as the clear winner with its yield of 2.3%.I'm not afraid of the multiple of any of these but if I had to choose one of these, it would have to be Lockheed Martin as it offers a solid yield with a fairly cheap earnings multiple. Over the next five years, analysts expect Lockheed Martin to generate an annual average EPS growth of 14.5%. If we assume no change to the already reasonable multiple and add in the dividend yield of 2.3% we arrive at an expected total shareholder return over the next five years of 16.8%. Such a return is substantially above what the market as a whole offers over time and you will get it from a solid industry leader. This stock fits very well for dividend growth investors -- you'll get a good yield today and in addition you can expect that yield to grow by double digits for many years to come. Dividend growth investors should take note and add at any pullback. Lockheed Martin has been doing a great job of rewarding loyal dividend growth investors with annual hikes for the last 16 years. There is no sign of this trend being broken for the foreseeable future. The company has been growing strongly for many years and this year is no exception. It is therefore very likely investors will be rewarded with yet a double-digit dividend hike this year. Dividend growth investors should utilize any short-term weakness to add this stock to their portfolios."
4274970,59081,2019-07-15T10:38:33-04:00,"LMT shares have increased 40% thus far in 2019 following strong quarterly results and heightened global demand amidst geopolitical tensions.
        A strong financial position bolstered by an advanced product offering have catapulted LMT to the forefront of defense companies looking to win over governments military contracts and awards.
        Mideast tensions and the Pentagon's interest in hypersonic technology present a lucrative business opportunity that LMT understands and is capable of delivering given its dominant position in the industry.","OverviewLockheed Martin’s (NYSE: LMT) growth story in 2019 has been quite impressive thus far. Shares have rallied almost 40% in 2019 following strong first-quarter results. LMT has risen with other defense stocks amidst heightened global tensions while demand for LMT F-35 fighter jets and missiles continues to award the company with military contracts. Is it too late to buy LMT shares? Shareholders can expect LMT to continue outperforming the market due to three key factors. One, the company continues to improve profitability and cash flow, eventually leading to significant capital returns to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Second, the company’s strong product portfolio headlined by the F-35 continues to be complemented by a rise in demand in LMT’s missile, helicopter, and satellite systems. Finally, international tensions backed by a domestic agenda supporting higher defense spending will continue to propel revenue and earnings thanks to heightened interest in hypersonic technology. Analysts indicate that LMT is set to increase profits by at least 14% annually over the next five years which translates to a forward PEG ratio at less than 1, therefore representing a great buying opportunity below $370 per share. Expect LMT shares to reach the $390 to $400 range by year-end 2019.Source: Yahoo Finance.LMT has greatly outperformed the 6.89% YTD return of the S&P 500 in 2019. So far in 2019, LMT shares have increased as earnings continue to outperform bolstered by heightened growth prospects. The biggest rise came in April following an outstanding first quarter:A key feature included the fact that every one of LMT’s business units surpassed revenue expectations. Of course as the bread and butter of the company, growing F-35 volumes propelled the company’s aeronautics division $659 million from the prior year. The defense contractor was able to win over a multitude of Department of Defense contracts and proved their position as the Pentagon’s military equipment contractor of choice.What’s more interesting is the developments that occurred following the Q1 earnings report. Since then, LMT has locked in $10 billion worth of additional orders thanks to its strong product portfolio. Furthermore, a $945 million down payment for a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile system headed to Saudi Arabia was awarded to LMT in an effort to ease Mideast tensions. Since then, the company has been awarded a myriad of new defense contracts as demand from the Pentagon continues to increase.LMT continues to demonstrate it’s firm grasp and superior management of its financial position and cash flow relative to other companies in the defense sector. The company has successfully expanded its revenue base by effectively forecasting areas of high demand. As a result, LMT’s consolidated operating margin increased 14.8% YoY to 15.9% in Q1 2019. The company’s expanding profitability helped propel operating cash flow $630 million annually to $1.7 billion. Additionally, its backlog of over $130 billion in the American military’s most important program put the company on a strong trajectory to deliver over-performing sales and revenue growth in the near-term.Source: YCharts.In the first quarter, the company’s strong cash position helped deliver over $900 million to shareholders in both share repurchases and dividends. At 2.48%, the company boasts the highest dividend yield relative to other defense companies including Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC), Raytheon (NYSE: RTN), General Dynamics (NYSE: GD), Boeing (NYSE: BA), and Huntington Ingalls (NYSE: HII). LMT’s dividend returns and high yield are indeed a key selling point for investors looking to decrease portfolio risk, identify tax advantages, and of course improve stock investing profits. The company’s historical ability in delivering returns for shareholders will continue to attract investors looking to profit from safe-haven assets in the form of defense stocks amidst global tensions in the Mideast region which will lead to further revenue growth for LMT.LMT also boasts an exceptional and growing product portfolio. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is at the forefront of it all. Most recently, the company’s aeronautics business division won a modification contract in supporting the initial production of F-35 Lighting II Aircraft’s 12th Lot with most work being done in Fort Worth, Texas, and El Segundo, California. The $348.2 million contract involving the production of non-recurring, special tooling and special test equipment for F-35 jets demonstrates the company’s versatility in delivering upon a multitude of needs requested by major military programs. In addition to the F-35 and its corresponding components, which make up about 30% of the company’s revenue, LMT has invested heavily in the development of the Aegis missile system, its Sikorsky helicopters, and their missiles, rockets, ancillary products and hypersonic technology.Source: Lockheed Martin Earnings Report.LMT’s strong suite of products led to an increase in sales across all divisions. Missile revenue, strengthened by renowned Pentagon demand, fuelled a 40% increase while its aeronautics division experienced 27% growth. Furthermore, its rotary and mission systems and space divisions both saw growth of greater than 10%. This contributed to LMT’s generation of $1.38 billion in FCF in Q1 2019. It’s clear that geopolitical risks have benefitted LMT significantly and with a strong backlog and expressed military interest for future defense contracts, LMT’s wide range of products will continue to win over contracts thanks to the company’s world-class product quality and time-efficient delivery capabilities.Perhaps the most promising pillar of potential growth is the race in hypersonic technology. After China and Russia both demonstrated their military might with the announcement of new hypersonic weapons, the Pentagon has taken a sharp interest in bolstering the United States’ defense capabilities by awarding lucrative contracts to defense contracts capable of fulfilling this need. Hypersonic technology describes weapons and interceptors being able to travel at least five times the speed of sound. LMT is a clear leader in the race for hypersonic technology as evidenced by its track record of government contracts in this discipline. LMT has consistently beat out Boeing, Raytheon, and Northrop Grumman for key contracts included a recent $480 million contract for the development of a hypersonic air-launched rapid response system. Assuming LMT can move into low-rate initial production, the award itself is estimated to be worth as much as $780 million over five years. LMT also succeeded in defeating competition to win a $928 million award in 2018 in the development of a hypersonic conventional strike weapon. The company has also announced plans in conjunction with NASA to produce a hypersonic version of the SR-72 spy plan along with a high-speed commercial prototype, representing approximately $892 million in award value.Contracts for hypersonic technology are indeed in the early stages of their respective life cycle. Heightened global tensions led to an upward $20 billion revision in spending backed by Congress for defense spending with hypersonic research and development featured as a key component. Mideast tensions, instability in Iran-US tensions, and an arms race between Russia and China will only continue to play an increasingly prominent role in America’s national interests going forward. As Pentagon interest for hypersonic technology increases, budgets for defense spending highlighted by hypersonic research and development will only continue to open up, and you can bet that LMT will be the frontrunners in defeating competition for these awards.Source: Lockheed Martin.LMT’s near-term risks come in the form of cancelled orders including the situation involving Turkey reneging on F-35 contracts and the possibility of a government shutdown or return to sequestration. Countries such as Turkey have hinted at reneging on previous contracts awarded to LMT as pressure from Russia and China mounts in buying missile defense systems from them rather than the United States. A government shutdown or sequestration has also increasingly garnered more attention given the House’s increasing divisiveness and subsequent indecisiveness. Despite this, LMT’s backlog and continuning influx of new orders have not slowed down, indicating revenue and earnings have a high probability of continuing in the near future.LMT is a clear leader across a spectrum of areas including defense contracts and awards, financial management, revenue generation, product offering, and order fulfillment. This makes the company the most attractive in the defense sector amidst an arena that is well aware of the lucrative potential this industry awards to successful players. Cleary the company is doing something right considering their dominance in the industry through advanced product development and demand forecasting allowing it to continue winning over government contracts and awards. The company’s plethora of growth prospects will send shares over the next 3 to 6 months to $390 to $400 by year-end 2019, and buying in below $370 is a great opportunity for investors looking for a high-performing dominant company with an exceptional business model.Source: The Motley Fool."
4276333,21798,2019-07-22T02:39:51-04:00,Lockheed Martin has the advantage of having the highest earnings growth among the large defense companies.The company is poised to get lucrative contracts on a regular basis as the military needs to maintain the latest technology for a competitive edge.Higher earnings growth through 2020 might help Lockheed's stock outperform their competitors.,"On this past Independence Day, I analyzed Lockheed Martin and the defense industry. These are the companies that produce the defense technology that enables the military to operate at peak performance to help to preserve our freedom.I compared Lockheed Martin (LMT) to the other major U.S. defense companies in terms of valuation and fundamental growth. I chose to leave out Boeing (BA) since they derive most of their revenue from commercial airplanes. Although valuation is similar among these companies, Lockheed Martin stands out with significantly higher returns on equity [ROE], returns on invested capital [ROIC] and higher earnings growth.Lockheed Martin and the other defense companies are likely to get ongoing contracts for their defense products/systems as more advanced technology is needed to remain a step ahead of our potential enemies. Lockheed's above-average earnings growth might drive the stock to outperform their competitors and the broader market through 2020.Here's a snapshot comparing the major defense companies:Source: Seeking Alpha, Yahoo! FinanceA few things jump out from this table. Lockheed Martin's significantly higher returns on equity and investment as compared to their competitors is one key highlight. These high returns help drive Lockheed's earnings growth. Those high returns also demonstrate management's effectiveness.That brings us to the other highlight from the chart: Lockheed's strong expected earnings growth for 2019 and 2020. Lockheed Martin is able to achieve this even after starting with a lower gross margin than their competitors.The triple-digit ROE looks like an anomaly. However, Lockheed maintained an ROE over the triple-digit threshold for 7 out of the last 8 years. The company achieves these high ROEs through leverage. The debt to equity ratio is over 5.A general rule of thumb is that the debt to equity ratio should not exceed 2. However, Lockheed's business requires a lot of capital and the company manages it effectively. So, higher than average leverage has been sustainable for many years.The high debt to equity ratio does put the company at risk if the business declined as a result of lower defense spending. It is possible that the company could have trouble paying off its debt if revenue significantly declined. So, this is something that investors should keep in mind.The good news is that Lockheed has a consistent growing business as defense systems need to be updated to the latest technology. That will help the company get an ongoing stream of new contracts over time. Therefore, if defense spending remains strong, Lockheed will benefit from their high leverage. Source: airshowstuff.com - the F-35 Lightning IIThe United States and the nations that we sell defense systems to don't want to be left with outdated technology to protect their citizens. They want the latest defense technology for optimal protection.Lockheed Martin recently received a contract for $562 million for Army tactical guided missiles for the U.S. Army and overseas military customers. The contract includes sensor technology that enables 'height-of-burst' capabilities (one of the key parts in guided missiles). The new feature helps soldiers address area targets.The company's Sikorsky business recently received a $1.13 billion contract from the U.S. Navy to build 12 CH-53 heavy-lift helicopters. This advanced helicopter can lift up to 36,000 lbs. and is the most powerful heavy-lift helicopter ever built in the United States.These are great examples of how Lockheed is getting contracts for newer technology. Of course, the company's F-35 fighter jet drives a lot of the company's revenue as it comprised 27% of net sales in 2018.As of the end of Q1 2019, Lockheed's total backlog was $133.5 billion - that was 27% higher than the end of Q1 2018. The company expects to recognize 37% of the backlog within the next year and 65% of it over the next 2 years. With the backlog increasing, future revenue is also poised to increase.While the company has been performing well, the stock is now pulling back from a recent overbought level as indicated by the RSI dropping from over 70 to about 64. Money flow reached a high point and appears to be pulling back a bit. So, the stock price could be in the middle of a larger correction or pullback on profit taking.Since the company requires significant capital intensity to build expensive F-35s and other defense products, Lockheed does take on a lot of debt. The balance sheet has $13.9 billion in total debt with $991 million in total cash.The high debt is not currently an issue with the backlog increasing. However, it does present a risk if defense spending decreased. If the company experienced significant year-over-year declines in revenue, they might be challenged to pay off their debt. Since the major countries of the world are interested in maintaining the latest defense technology - the backlog could continue to grow from here.There are about 1.2x more current assets than current liabilities on the balance sheet. So, the company is in good shape to handle short-term obligations.There are about 1.06x more total assets than total liabilities on the balance sheet. With strong cash flow, Lockheed is in great shape handling their long-term debt obligations.For the past twelve months, the company produced $4.17 billion in operating cash flow. From there, they repaid $950 million in total debt, $1.35 billion in capex, repurchased $1.47 billion of stock, paid $2.4 billion in dividends, and had $3.71 billion in levered free cash flow. It is important to note that they issued $600 million in new short-term debt and $600 million in new long-term debt during the past twelve-month period.Over the long term, Lockheed Martin could see continued strong increases in defense contracts from the U.S. and allied countries. Each country has a lot to protect. So, they are likely to ensure that they are upgrading and maintaining the latest defense systems and technology.One of the risks for the company's outlook are significant changes in defense spending from the United States government or other countries. Defense spending could be reduced, which could negatively affect Lockheed's revenue and earnings. Changes in political parties and how government funds are spent could lead to reduced defense spending.Even if reductions in defense spending are made, they probably won't occur over long periods of time. As technology advances, the U.S. and other countries will probably want to have the latest defense systems in place. So, while slowdowns in defense spending could take place, I don't think it would be sustainable over many years.The global economic situation is another factor to watch. A recession in the U.S. and/or globally would likely have a negative effect on the stock. Lockheed's stock declined 44% during the 2008 financial crisis. It is possible that we could see a recession within the next few years as the economy is in a mature phase and new home sales, existing home sales, and vehicle sales might have peaked for this cycle.While a recession would likely cause significant declines in the stock price, it could also create a good long-term buying opportunity. So, Lockheed Martin's stock is one to place on a watch list if it is not already owned."

Moreover, the company saw double-digit growth across the board in terms of sales and operating profit by segment:Sales by SegmentSource: Lockheed Martin Corporation 1st Quarter 2019Operating Profit by SegmentSource: Lockheed Martin Corporation 1st Quarter 2019The company reports that they expect the overall sales outlook to increase by $1 billion, with the operating profit outlook set to rise by $100 million. Moreover, the company has continued to generate a healthy level of free cash flow, with 70% of this returned as dividends and 30% used for share repurchases:Source: Lockheed Martin Corporation 1st Quarter 2019Due to geopolitical tensions, the upward movement in Lockheed Martin's stock price was particularly buoyant from 2015-17. While the stock has stagnated since 2018, I anticipate that demand is still set to be strong going forward.While there has been concern that the F-35 will see less demand in Europe due to competition from the Eurofighter Typhoon model, sales continue to perform strongly in the United States and the company is on track to cut the cost of the model to $80 million by next year - significantly increasing its competitiveness. Moreover, the model is still actively considered in Europe, with the Finnish government considering the F-35 as one of five potential models for upgrading its fleet. With countries such as Poland and Switzerland also evaluating the model, it is estimated that 500 F-35 Lightning II stealth fighters will be deployed in Europe - which is more than the number of Eurofighter Typhoons currently in operation globally.Moreover, with Lockheed Martin just having been awarded a $561.8 million contract for ATACMS Missiles by the U.S. Army, I estimate that the strong growth we have been seeing in the Missiles and Fire Control segment will continue going forward. Moreover, the growth we have been seeing in this segment is of particular advantage to Lockheed Martin, as it reduces the company's dependence on performance in the Aeronautics segment alone, which has traditionally accounted for a significant part of the company's revenue.My conclusion - Lockheed Martin appears cheaper on key earnings and free cash flow metrics. Moreover, the company continues to see strong growth across its business lines. I am bullish on this stock."
4273254,50452,2019-07-03T05:34:57-04:00,"Lockheed Martin has enjoyed a strong 2019 thus far and raised full-year guidance in April.The company's F-35 program will fuel years of growth, and the company is poised to continue growing its dividend payout.The stock has become expensive with US political tension looming in November 2020. We recommend that new money seeks a pullback before considering the defense company.","There are a handful of social ""sins"" that produce very lucrative investment sectors. These include smoking, drinking, and unhealthy foods among others. Today we look at mankind's affinity for war by touching on Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT). Lockheed is one of the world's largest defense companies with a market cap of $102 billion. The company is currently firing on all cylinders with growth across all of its business segments, highlighted by the company's massive F-35 program. While the company will continue to grow in the years to come, the stock's recent six-month run has begun to outrun the actual business. With a looming presidential election next year, we expect a buying opportunity to present itself in the months ahead. We look at what Lockheed Martin has going for it, and where we hope to see shares priced.Since the market last saw a notable correction at the very end of the 2018 year, Lockheed Martin's shares have shot upward like a missile, appreciating a staggering 40% in just six months.Source: YChartsThis isn't for no reason, the business is currently firing on all cylinders. The company's last earnings report in April provided strong results and increased fiscal-year guidance. The company's two largest growth areas (its Aeronautics and Missile/Fire Control segments) house important projects such as the F-35 program and strong attention to missile offense/defense technologies. The company now holds a record size backlog of $133.5 billion. The US government is the company's largest customer by a large margin. Military spending has continued to grow under President Trump with a 2019 DoD budget of $685 billion. The proposed 2020 budget for the DoD is a whopping $718 billion. The 2020 proposal includes approximately $11 billion set aside to purchase 78 F-35 joint strike fighters, a reminder of how lucrative this program will be for Lockheed for decades to come.Source: Lockheed Martin Corporation 2018 Annual ReportManagement felt comfortable enough with the beginning of 2019 that full-year forecasts were bumped across the board.Source: Lockheed Martin Corporation FY2019 Q1 PresentationOne of the best aspects of an investment in Lockheed Martin is how much cash the company sends back to shareholders. The company routinely spends on buying back stock which helps fuel earnings per share growth. Over the past five years, the share count has been reduced from approximately 322 million to 282 million.Source: YChartsAdditionally, Lockheed Martin is an underrated dividend growth stock. The company has raised its dividend payout for each of the past 16 years. That dividend currently totals an annual sum of $8.80 per share, resulting in a dividend yield of 2.43%. That is more than what investors can get from 10-year US treasuries.Source: YChartsThe dividend is well-funded, consuming just 43% of earnings. We typically look at the payout ratio based on cash flow, but the business requires volatile investments to research and develop projects with high costs that can skew FCF figures. The dividend has also grown immensely, at a CAGR of 16.2% over the past decade. Had you made an investment 10 years ago and reinvested the dividend, it would have boosted your annual returns from 17.82% to 20.15%. That difference in return rate may seem small, but it's the same as investing $10,000 and having it grow to $62K rather than $51K over a 10-year period.In the years ahead, we expect the F-35 program to continue to expand. CEO Marillyn Hewson recently projected that Lockheed Martin will sell in the neighborhood of 4,600 F-35 jets over the life of the program. This will obviously stem from the US government, as well as numerous US allies that are influenced into business dealings with US defense companies. Lockheed Martin is also doing its best to deter negative publicity by cutting the unit cost of the F-35 to $80 million (each budget year shines a light on the government's high military expenditures).While those program projection numbers are certainly ambitious, we are excited about the recurring revenue that will arise from servicing the F-35 fleet as it ages. Service revenues represented just 14% of Lockheed's Aeronautics business in 2018, but we suspect that ratio will grow as more and more units gain time in the field.It's important not to forget that while the F-35 program is being established, much of Lockheed's other business ventures also rely heavily on the US government.Source: YChartsWhen government defense spending is curbed, it does have a direct (and sizable) impact on Lockheed's revenues. With a rapidly expanding debt load on the country's balance sheet, a democratic result come November 2020 could see the defense budget as a target of spending cuts - especially as potential welfare programs (such as Medicare-For-All) will require hefty funding. This is a risk that needs to be weighed by investors looking to buy shares.This note brings us to valuation as it stands today. Shares of Lockheed Martin are currently trading at all-time highs of more than $365 per share. Using management's revised 2019 forecast of EPS $20.20 (midpoint), we arrive at an earnings multiple of 18.11X. This is a 24% premium to the company's 10-year median PE ratio of 14.5X. This shouldn't be a surprise considering the stock's massive leg higher over the past six months.Dividend investors should note that Lockheed's current yield of 2.43% is 17% lower than its 10-year median of 2.92%. This also implies an overvaluation of shares - despite the current yield coming in above 10-year treasuries.When we look at valuation as a function of FCF, the current FCF yield is near decade lows. This is partially skewed by the volatility of Lockheed's free cash flow, but share price and FCF yield have been trending in opposite directions for some time now.Source: YChartsIt can be difficult to look at a stock that is flying higher and raising guidance, and say ""we should really be using caution here"" - but here we are. We feel that the degree to how much Lockheed has overrun its historical norms is an indicator that these positive developments are now ""baked"" into the share price. We want to see shares breathe after such a strong run, and would revisit the stock after reaching a multiple of 16X earnings, or $323 per share.The position that the US occupies atop the modern world requires that companies such as Lockheed Martin continually support the government with cutting edge (and lucrative) technologies. It's this hard to break cycle that will continue to make Lockheed Martin a great long-term holding. However, in the near term, investors should pump the brakes and realize that much of the short-term momentum has likely already passed.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."

        But LMT's space business has some problems - lack of revenue growth is the key indicator.
        LMT ceded potential leadership in mid-market space hardware and services to Northrop Grumman, when NOC bought Orbital in 2018.
        We believe the correct move for LMT now is to acquire a number of low-cost Space 2.0 vendors, so that it can occupy the fastest-growth section of the space market.","DISCLAIMER: This article is not directed at, nor intended to be relied upon by any UK recipients.

Any opinions or probabilities expressed in this report are those of the author as of the article date of publication and are subject to change without notice.Here we initiate on Lockheed Martin (LMT) at Neutral.The company appears to be well managed, is growing earnings and revenues, the F-35 fighter program appears to be about to deliver on its promises, and despite being pretty much at its 52-week high, the stock’s fundamental valuation looks acceptable at sub 2x TTM revenue, 13.5x TTM EBITDA and 15.8x TTM EBIT. If you think F-35 will hit its cost targets and therefore volume targets, there are likely gains ahead for the stock. All good so far.Our focus here though is not the headlines around LMT, which are for good reason mainly F-35 related right now. No, as befits our space-sector focus, our analysis here centers on LMT’s space business, a $10bn revenue, $1bn segment operating profit behemoth.We think it has some challenges ahead.We operate a pure-play space-sector equity research service. This means that although space isn't its largest division, LMT is a key company to us. In our coverage universe, it has the second-largest space division by reported revenue at c.$10bn in FY12/18.Source: Company SEC filingsLMT’s space division in large part reflects the merger with Martin-Marietta Corporation. LMT completed the merger with Martin Marietta in 1995, valuing the combined group at approximately $10bn (source; Lockheed and Martin Marietta Set to Merge in $10 Billion Deal) . The combined Lockheed Martin business then rationalized its portfolio, spinning off the relevant defense products into what was to become L-3 Technologies (LLL) and the materials division into what is now Martin Marietta Materials (MLM).The LMT-acquired Martin-Marietta Corporation was at the forefront of the original space industry. It built Titan ICBMs and then repurposed them as spacecraft launch vehicles – lifting all ten of the Gemini missions successfully in the space of just two years and paving the way for the Apollo mission series. It acquired General Dynamics’ (GD) space business, bringing into the family the Atlas line of rockets, descendants of which are still used today. And it built a number of key spacecraft which cemented the US as the lead spacefaring nation – including the Magellan Venus probe, and the Viking Mars probes. Today LMT’s space-sector products include the upcoming new Orion spacecraft, and LMT holds a 50% stake in United Launch Alliance, its JV with Boeing which builds and operates rockets for (inter alia) US government resupply missions to the International Space Station.But we think LMT has a problem. It is one of only two major companies in the space business where its space division revenues are flat – the other being Aerojet Rocketdyne. Everywhere we look we see evidence of growth in space exploration and space exploitation. Northrop Grumman (NOC)’s space division grew revenues at +17% p.a. in 2018; the space division of Moog Inc (MOG.A) at +10% in 2018; Boeing (BA) at +13% in 2018.Why is this? We think that LMT has lost impetus in the space business. It has – so far – missed the generation shift in the space-sector cost base. It’s not alone – we think the same has happened at Boeing >> Seattle, We Have A Problem - Initiating Coverage On The Boeing Company.In a way, this is as unsurprising at LMT as it is at BA. BA’s business is critically-dependent upon success in civilian aircraft. And LMT’s short- and medium-term future is dependent on success in military aircraft – specifically its F-35 Lightning II fighter aircraft project. This project kicked off in 2001 and the first airplanes were delivered recently. Production models (which carry full margin) are expected to be delivered in 2019/2020. Getting this right – meaning airplanes accepted and used by customer organizations, produced in a way that generates sufficient margins for LMT, followed up by long-term service contracts to support and upgrade those airplanes – is company-defining and LMT cannot get it wrong. LMT is working hard to deliver the airplane for less than $80m/unit in order to access a larger market.This last 3-4 years have been a critical phase in the F35-II project and we would expect that the CEO’s in-tray usually has F-35 matters at the top of the pile, since the F-35 program alone accounted for some 27% of revenue in 2018 (source- LMT 10-K for 2018) . It’s a key single point of failure risk within LMT and that means it will be top priority.But in these last few years, the space industry has quietly changed a great deal. You can read up on our thesis here >> Introduction To Investing In The New Space Race - in essence, that the falling costs in the space business are leading to a profusion of customers and vendors and with those, a new and growing market segment. This has arisen for many reasons but a key factor was the 2011 cancellation of the Shuttle program and the prior 2008/9 cancellation of its replacement (the Constellation program). This created a period during which NASA was somewhat in limbo and other customers – satellite operators principally – became more important and looked to commercial vendors such as SpaceX to fulfil their needs.We think the market for traditional, government-driven, huge budget ‘Space 1.0’ matters such as reconnaissance satellites or planetary exploration hardware and services is going to continue – grow, even, as global risks rise and richer nations turn once again to space as a theater of power, pushing the US to spend more to keep pace. LMT and BA in their individual space divisions, and together in ULA, will benefit from this trend. LMT’s space focus lies in segments where the US government is the only truly viable customer, costs are high, production rate low, and organizational complexity vast amongst buyers and suppliers alike. Its new products are all oriented toward these monolithic heavyweight missions. The Orion spacecraft, the relevant sections of the SLS rocket, the Mars Insight lander – these are all exciting products but they are all in the image of Space 1.0 – procured by government and flown by government, with huge procurement budgets and usually long-delayed timelines.When industries go through tectonic shifts like this, usually the vendor landscape changes dramatically. Few incumbents make the move successfully.We believe the poster child for an incumbent’s navigation of these changes in the space industry is Northrop Grumman (NOC). As time goes by, NOC’s $10bn acquisition of Orbital ATK in 2017 (it closed in 2018) is looking like a better and better strategic decision (see our note here >> Deep Space Acquisition - Initiating Coverage On Northrop Grumman). As we have already reported, Orbital was acquired at a good price for NOC – it was and is growing faster than NOC’s existing business, and NOC paid a lower multiple of earnings for it than NOC’s shares themselves traded at. When we spoke to NOC recently they commented that in addition to the financial logic, they felt well positioned for the New Space Race because the Orbital deal took them further down the cost curve – ie. in addition to NOC’s existing high end military-grade space products, Orbital gave them lower-cost vehicles and other products with which to serve the growing space market. We don’t think Orbital is a whole answer to the New Space Race for NOC – the group still lacks true low-end products such as smallsats and small launch vehicles, and we see this as a weakness for the company that they ought to address.We think LMT has to date not positioned itself well to prosper from the increasingly low-cost, non-government space segment. We believe that LMT missed out by not acquiring Orbital. Orbital would have given them renewed growth and vigor in the space market in the same way that merging with Martin Marietta did in the 1990s. Perhaps LMT considered the opportunity and decided it would be blocked on antitrust grounds – certainly the combination would have heavy market share in the government launch business – we don’t know. But we think LMT should now look for another ‘Martin Moment’ – a defining transaction that could deliver the next generation of growth in the space industry. We don’t think this will be through organic growth – new products take too long to design, certify, procure and so forth. We think LMT’s space business would be best served through an acquisition once again.We applaud the ‘Lockheed Ventures’ approach.We think that assigning some capital to the New Space segment is a great idea – it gives you visibility into the new market segments and should enable you to judge when theses segments are ready for prime time.Indeed we’ve urged Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD) to do the same thing – they have the same problem of over-concentration in Space 1.0 and consequent flat revenue.But we hope you do in fact treat your ventures fund as an M&A pipeline – the rhetoric we’ve seen (e.g. Lockheed Martin sees an appetite for startup investments ) is all about how you don’t plan to buy the companies in the Ventures portfolio but instead to hope they become independent businesses which fit into the LMT ecosystem as a supplier. We hope this is corporate-speak for “we do intend to acquire some, but we think it will alienate some potential investees if we out-and-out say that”. As former venture investors ourselves we can tell you – every one of your actual and potential portfolio companies sees you as a possible acquiror and treats you as such. So as long as you don’t believe or act according to the rhetoric, it won’t disadvantage you!Martin-Marietta was a transformative deal - don’t be afraid to think big again when it comes to M&A in the space sector.We think it was a miss not buying Orbital, and if we had just joined your board of directors, we would want you to see this too. We’d show you the growth that Orbital was delivering to NOC and say – this was a cheap deal despite the big absolute price tag. (We haven’t done the math but we suspect that was true of your own deal with Martin Marietta too). Maybe antitrust made it impossible. In any event, there isn’t really another Orbital around right now but we would be keeping a very close eye on the low-cost launch providers such as Rocket Lab and on the small-satellite fleet operators such as Spire Global. These types of companies would probably demand high multiples of revenue as a purchase price, but the overall sum would be modest vs. LMT’s balance sheet – and owning these kinds of companies would leapfrog LMT directly into the fastest-growing, lowest-cost segment of the space business, putting LMT out front and ahead of BA and NOC in the segment. We think that leapfrogging NOC into low-cost space is the way to deal with NOC’s Orbital acquisition.Get ready for some project delay risk in your existing space business portfolio.This risk won’t be of your making – it will be to do with the funding of NASA’s current programs – but it is likely to hurt you. SLS looks to be running very late and the implementation of Space Policy Directive 1 is about to hit some appropriations issues – NASA Administrator Bridenstine is indicating an additional $20-30bn will be required to deliver on the ‘Artemis’ moon missions that will use SLS and Orion, and that is going to take some time to get through Congress. (See NASA administrator says it will cost an extra $20 to $30 billion to send astronauts back to the Moon).Be ready for prior government allegiances to change on you – at short notice.The old-line aerospace & defense companies on which the US government has relied since the beginning of the original Space Race in the 1950s – those which, like LMT, helped to deliver the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo projects – are just beginning to feel the burn as NASA and other US government agencies turn to the new generation of space vendors. SpaceX and Blue Origin have found great favor in Washington of late. Indeed to our eyes it seems that Elon Musk’s true calling is, rather surprisingly, as a federal-sector salesman. Huge quantities of federal appropriations have landed in SpaceX’s coffers over the years, and the courtship between Musk and Bridenstine appears to be intensifying. We anticipate that the cost issues above will lead to NASA and other agencies moving to favor lower-cost vendors – see for instance the award to Maxar Technologies (MAXR) for the propulsion element of v1.0 of NASA’s lunar gateway, seemingly on very-low-cost grounds. If this trend continues, SpaceX will likely gain share with Blue Origin not too far behind, and LMT’s market share will experience some compression.We will continue to report on LMT, with a focus on its space business unit.Cestrian Capital Research, Inc – 15 June 2019"

Due to the ongoing United States-China trade war, China has recently been subtly threatening to restrict their exports of rare earths to the United States. These are widely used throughout many modern high-tech products, which unfortunately includes Lockheed Martin’s flagship program, the F-35 stealth fighter jet. Given the attention this has received from the financial media, I’m rather surprised it hasn’t yet materially impacted their share price.On the surface it would initially seem that Lockheed Martin is quite well insulated from the United States-China trade war given a massive 70% of their total revenue is derived from sales to the United States government. This standpoint has recently shifted following China’s subtle threats to restrict their market dominating exports of rare earths to the United States. A single one of Lockheed Martin’s F-35 stealth fighter jets requires 920lb of rare earths, with various other military programs ranging from lasers to the warship also requiring these same elements. I’m rather surprised China seems to be considering this path as I believe it won’t provide them with any long-term benefit and at absolute best would be a parasitic victory. Similar to how OPEC’s 1973 Oil Embargo led to a greater focus on fuel efficiency and alternative fuels as well as finding new sources of oil supply, all of which undermined their interests in the following decades.Whether China actually follows through on these threats and restricts exports to the United States remains unknown, however, considering they chose this course of action in 2010 against Japan it certainly remains a possibility. I’ve included a chart below that provides an overview of the current production and reserve landscape for the rare earths industry.Image Source: Statista.Accessing the potential impact to Lockheed Martin’s earnings is unfortunately difficult to exactly estimate as there are many uncertainties, however, broad estimates indicate it could be quite significant. The uncertainties range from determining exactly which rare earths are restricted, the extent to which they’re restricted and the actions taken by their management and the United States government to mitigate the situation.During the last year the F-35 program accounted for 27% of their total revenue and 68% of their aeronautics business segment revenue. If the most extreme scenario eventuated, whereby they were forced to temporarily halt their production completely, their business segment operating profit would decrease by approximately $1.54B or 27% assuming their aeronautics margins remained static. This is unlikely as there would certainly be various fixed costs that would remain changed, thus leading to margin compression and hence even lower earnings.Although this estimate may sound too extreme it’s important to remember that in the short to medium-term sourcing or replacing these rare earths elsewhere could be very difficult and costly if at all possible. Furthermore, they are also widely used throughout their various other military programs and thus even if the impact to the F-35 program is minimized, it’s likely to impact their other programs as well and thus further hurting their earnings.Implementing this risk into my original valuation is also quite difficult as it depends a binary outcome and thus the intrinsic valuation will either remain unchanged or drop significantly. My original article estimated the intrinsic value for shares to be $360.16 to $398.65, which I continue to support providing China doesn’t restrict rare earth exports. Due to the aforementioned uncertainties it’s impractical to determine an estimated intrinsic valuation for the alternative scenario, however, it’s safe to say it would certainly be under $300 per share.When I first published my valuation their share price was $301.50 and has since rallied steadily to $349.08 at the time of writing. The investment decision moving forward will depend on an investor’s belief regarding the outcome of these trade tensions. If it’s believed that China will restrict rare earth exports they should consider selling or at least reducing the size of their investment. On the contrary if the opposite outcome is believed, they should consider continuing to hold as the current market price no longer provides as significant upside as earlier this year to justify buying more shares.Even though I don’t wish to derail my topic, I would like to mention that I believe the West should actually be thankful for China threatening to restrict rare earth exports now rather than in the future. It’s considerably more convenient for this risk to be brought to the forefront during times of peace between the world’s major militaries.Whilst I cannot and don’t wish to forecast whether a future military conflict between the United States and China, Russia or North Korea will occur, it’s an undeniable long-term risk. If the previous situation of blindly relying on China were to continue and a military conflict were to occur in the future, it would be the worst possible time for the United States to suddenly lose it’s vital rare earth supply. Losing this supply would impede their ability to rapidly increase production of high-tech military equipment when it’s urgently required. By this risk being brought to the forefront now, it provides the West time to lower their reliance on China regardless of what the future may bring.Finally, I personally feel that by merely threatening to restrict rare earth supply to the United States, China has shown short-term thinking and is effectively shooting themselves in the foot in the long-term. Even if they reverse course and cease threatening to restrict rare earth exports, I believe it’s too late as the West will continue seeking to reduce its reliance on China, both at the corporate and government level. This applies to the allies of the United States, with the Australian Defense Minister stating this has become an issue of strategic importance for Australia and the other Pacific allies of South Korea and Japan.Although the prospects of China restricting their rare earth exports to the United States would certainly cause a significant disruption to Lockheed Martin in the short to medium-term, I believe it wouldn’t prove to be a permanent problem. Eventually the supply deficit will prompt new supply outside of China as well as research into alternative minerals. Granted the short to medium-term impact would still hammer their share price and thus investors should consider reducing their investments if they believe such an outcome will eventuate.Notes: Unless specified otherwise, all figures in this article were taken from Lockheed Martin’s 2018 Annual Report, all calculated figures were performed by the author."
4271672,98446,2019-06-23T15:25:53-04:00,"Lockheed Martin closed the most recent trading session at its all-time high.The company's first quarter saw growth in all areas.Lockheed Martin has increased its dividend for more than a decade and has a very low payout ratio.I find that the stock is just slightly overvalued today, making it eligible for purchase under my investment rules.","Shares of Lockheed Martin (LMT) closed at an all-time high of $362.80 on Thursday, June 20th. The stock has returned 38.6% year-to-date, easily outpacing the 24.9% return for the Aerospace & Defense Sector (ITA) and 17.8% gain for the S&P 500.After such an incredible gain in such a short time, is Lockheed Martin a good purchase today? This article will review the company’s most recent earnings results, analyze the dividend and determine a price target using my system for valuing stocks.But first, let’s consider the company’s background. With annual sales totaling nearly $54 billion, Lockheed Martin is the world’s largest defense contractor. The company receives ~80% of revenues from the U.S. Department of Defense and other agencies, with 20% of sales coming from international customers.The company consists of four business divisions: Aeronautics, which produces fighter aircraft like the F-35, F-22 and C-130; Rotary & Mission Systems, which produces combat ship and helicopters such as the Sikorsky Aircraft; Missiles & Fire Control, which creates missile defense systems; and Space Systems, which produces satellites. Lockheed Martin has a current market capitalization of nearly $103 billion.Lockheed Martin released first quarter earnings results on April 23rd, 2019.Source: Lockheed Martin’s First Quarter Results Presentation, slide 3.Lockheed Martin earned $5.99 per share, which topped estimates by $1.65 and was a 49% improvement year-over-year. Revenue grew 23.2% to $14.3 billion. This was $1.8 billion above the average analysts’ estimate.Sales grew across the company’s divisions. Source: Lockheed Martin’s First Quarter Results Presentation, slide 5.Aeronautics grew 27% due to higher volumes and sustainment for the F-35 program. The F-22 program also saw an increase in sales due to higher volumes on modernization and sustainment programs. Missiles & Fire Control grew 40% primarily due to an increase in the tactical and strike missiles programs. Sales were especially strong for the precision fires, classified programs and new hypersonic missile programs. Contract mix and increased volumes for the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) and Patriot missile system also aided results. Revenues for the Rotary & Mission Systems were higher by 17% as integrated warfare systems and sensors saw improved demand. Radar Surveillance Systems and Multi Mission Surface Combatant programs were highlighted as areas of strength in the quarter. Sikorsky helicopter sales grew due to higher volumes.The Space segment had growth of 13% in the quarter as the company saw higher volumes for its government satellite program. This segment had been the lone weak spot for Lockheed Martin in the first half of 2018, but returned to growth in the second half of last year.Overall, Lockheed Martin’s segment operating profit increased 31% to $1.7 billion in the quarter. The company ended the first quarter with a record backlog of $133.5 billion and returned $919 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.The company also raised its guidance for the remainder of the year. Lockheed Martin expects earnings-per-share in a range of $20.05 to $20.35 up from $19.15 to $19.45, previously. The midpoint of this guidance would represent almost 15% growth from 2018. The upward revision in guidance is due primarily to improved operational performance, higher sales volumes and a lower expected tax rate.Revenue is expected to range from $56.75 billion to $58.25 billion, up from $55.75 billion to $57.25 billion, previously.Lockheed Martin’s first quarter showed that the company continues to perform at a very high level. Producing growth in all divisions of its business while at the same time raising top and bottom line estimates should make investors bullish about the company.Equally important to income investors is the dividend and the company's ability to continue to pay and raise it.Lockheed Martin has increased its dividend for the past 16 years, qualifying the company as a Dividend Achievers. Dividend Achievers are companies with at least 10 years of dividend growth.According to the U.S. Dividend Champions list, the company has increased its dividend:Most recently, Lockheed Martin increased its dividend by 10% for the payment made December 28th, 2018. This increase is very much in line with the company’s average increase in recent years.The company should pay out at least $8.80 in dividends-per-share in 2019. Using the midpoint for earnings-per-share for the year, this equates to a payout ratio of 44%.Many investors prefer to use free cash flow instead of earnings to determine the safety of the dividend. Lockheed Martin generated $1.66 billion of cash from operating activities in the first quarter of 2019 and spent $280 million on capital expenditures for free cash flow of $1.38 billion. The company distributed $640 million of dividends in the quarter for a payout ratio of 46%.Over the past 12 months, Lockheed Martin generated $4.17 billion of cash from operating activities and spent $1.35 billion on capital expenditures for free cash flow of $2.82 billion. The company distributed $2.4 billion of dividends during this time for a payout ratio of 85%.It should be noted that Lockheed Martin made a large contribution to its pension fund in the second quarter of last year, which skewed its cash from operations. Without this, the payout ratio for the last 12 months would be much closer to the company’s first quarter result.Lockheed Martin’s dividend appears well-covered and not at risk for a dividend cut when using either earnings-per-share or free cash flow. With a low payout ratio and higher expectations for growth, I anticipate that the company will be able to continue to grow its dividend going forward.Shares of the company currently yield 2.4%. The current yield is well below the stock’s 10-year average yield of 3.4%, but above the average 1.9% yield of the S&P 500.With the company showing growth in the most recent quarter, guiding towards growth in the future and the dividend appearing very safe, Lockheed Martin appears to be an attractive business. All that is left is to determine a good price point. To see how I value stocks, click here.Prior to making an investing decision, I use Value Line’s ratings for safety and financial strength. I am looking for at least a 2 for safety and a B++ for financial strength. These ratings show that the company’s financials are on solid ground.Value Line awards Lockheed Martin a 1 for safety and an A++ for financial strength. These are the highest rankings for either safety or financial strength.Using the current share price and the company’s midpoint for earnings-per-share guidance of $20.20 for 2019, the stock has a price-to-earnings ratio of 18. This matches the stock’s five-year average P/E ratio of 18.CFRA has a one-year price target of $400. This means that Lockheed has the potential to return 10.3% from current levels. CFRA’s fair value is $250.97, showing that shares trade at a 30.8% premium to this estimate.Morningstar estimates fair value at $328, placing shares at 9.6% overvalued at the moment.Value Engine has a one-year price target of $365.43, which is 0.7% above the current price. Their fair value for the stock is $388.52, which would make shares 7.1% undervalued.Average these numbers out and I find fair value for shares of Lockheed Martin to be at $349. The stock currently trades at a 4.4% premium to my estimate.I am willing to overpay by 5% on what I feel is fair value for a company with at least a decade of dividend growth. Lockheed Martin trades within this range, making the stock eligible for purchase under my system for valuing stocks.Lockheed Martin is now trading at its all-time high. Reviewing the company helps to explain why. The company showed growth in all areas of its business in the most recent quarter and raised its guidance for the current year.The stock also sports an above market average yield, and the dividend appears very safe using either earnings or free cash flow.Even after returning almost 39% in the first half of 2019, I find that shares of Lockheed Martin are just slightly overvalued. We added to our position on January 30th of this year at $291.99, but I would be willing to buy more of the stock at some point this year given the quality of the company’s business."
4256003,23452,2019-04-23T14:19:19-04:00,Quantitative Analysis of Lockheed Martin shares using the power of free cash flow.Analysis of Lockheed Martin from a Main Street vs. Wall Street perspective.Shows the reader how to do a similar analysis on their own portfolio holdings.,"On April 23, 2019, SA Editor Carl Surran reported the following Lockheed Martin +6% after strong earnings beat, upsized guidance. The earnings report surprised a lot of investors and analysts, as the company beat on earnings and revenues and, more importantly, guided higher going forward. It was an amazing report from any angle. Here are some of Carl’s bullet points from his news report, which will prove to you just how amazing Lockheed Martin’s (NYSE:LMT) report was.In this article, I will not discuss the various operations of Lockheed Martin and how each is doing, as you can read many such articles on Seeking Alpha, both pro and con. What I will simply do is a quantitative analysis of Lockheed Martin’s results on Main Street and then relate them to what an investor should do on Wall Street, using zero emotion.Let us now go and analyze Lockheed Martin and find out what our Friedrich algorithm has to say about all this.In analyzing Lockheed Martin, we will present some unique ratios that our Friedrich Investing System uses and will present a real-time quantitative analysis that will demonstrate the power of free cash flow in the investment process. In doing so, we will also teach everyone how to analyze one's portfolio holdings on Main Street vs. Wall Street. At the same time, we will explain how the methodology involved in this analysis came about.Main Street is where Lockheed Martin operates, and Wall Street is where its shares trade. The Lockheed Martin shares that one can purchase on Wall Street are traded publicly on exchanges, and the company has little control over how each share will trade. Lockheed Martin is required to release its earnings reports each quarter and, from time to time, it also provides press releases to its shareholders (and the general public) giving updates on how its operations are doing on Main Street.Main Street is where Lockheed Martin invests in its own operations and sells to its customers. How well the CEO of Lockheed Martin and its management do in selling those products determines how profitable the company will be. Wall Street then reacts based on the success or failure of management to meet its goals. Main Street and Wall Street are thus interlinked, but because anyone with a computer (or even just a smartphone), an internet connection, and a brokerage account can buy or sell any stock at any time, expertise is not a requirement in order to invest on Wall Street.This results in Wall Street being a very dangerous place to operate as many investors tend to invest through emotion or follow the herd in and out of stocks. During bull markets, investors feel like they can do no wrong as ""the rising tide lifts all boats."" But when a bear market suddenly shows up, these same investors tend to panic and, like lemmings, stampede over the cliff. Thus, we have the classic case of ""greed vs. panic.""Having noticed this problem some 35 years ago, I spent the last three decades building an algorithm called Friedrich. Our algorithm was designed to assist all investors (both Pro and Novice alike) and give them the ability to quickly compare a company's Main Street operations, to its Wall Street valuation (Overbought or Oversold condition). Friedrich can do this on an individual company basis or assist users in analyzing an entire index like the S&P 500, an ETF, Mutual Fund, or individual portfolio with the use of our Portfolio Analyzer.Many years ago, while reading Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A) (BRK.B) 1986 letter to shareholders, I discovered a ratio, which Mr. Buffett called ""Owner Earnings,"" or what we may consider to be Mr. Buffett's version of FCF, or ""Free Cash Flow."" To my amazement, in that little footnote, Mr. Buffett explained how to use it and basically states that it is one of the key ratios that he and Charlie Munger used in analyzing stocks. In that article, he defined the term ""owner earnings"" as the cash that is generated by the company's business operations.I have used the free cash flow ratio for decades, using data from the Value Line Investment Survey, whose founder was Arnold Bernhard. Mr. Bernhard was a big fan of free cash flow and probably introduced it sooner than Mr. Buffett did. I know this as I was able to calculate the FCF ratio using old Value Line sheets for my 60-year backtest of the DJIA from 1950 to 2009.The backtest mentioned above demonstrated that if one can purchase a company whose shares are selling for 15 (or less) times its Price to Free Cash Flow Ratio, that the probability of success will dramatically increase in most cases. I have renamed the ratio the Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow ratio in honor of both men. The following is how that ratio is calculated.Price to Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio = Sherlock Debt Divisor / [(net income per share + depreciation per share) - (capital spending per diluted share)]Sherlock Debt Divisor = Market Price Per Share - ((Working Capital - Long-Term Debt)/Diluted Shares Outstanding))The above are the ratios I use when analyzing a stock on Wall Street, and below are the ratios I use when analyzing a stock on Main Street.FROIC means ""Free Cash Flow Return on Invested Capital""Forward Free Cash Flow = [((Net Income + Depreciation) (1+ % Revenue Growth rate)) - (Capital Spending)]FROIC = (Forward Free Cash Flow)/(Long-Term Debt + Shareholders' Equity)The FROIC ratio tells us how much forward free cash flow we can expect the company to generate on Main Street relative to how much total capital it has employed. So, if a company invests $100 in total capital on Main Street and generates $20 in forward free cash flow it, therefore, has a FROIC of 20%, which we consider excellent. This is just one of the key ratios (66 in total) that we use to identify how a company is performing on Main Street, as it is our belief that if a company is making a killing on Main Street, Wall Street will eventually take notice.So, let us begin our analysis and at the same time try to teach everyone how to do a similar analysis on one's own portfolio. In analyzing Lockheed Martin’s Price to Bernhard Buffett FCF ratio, we must first adjust Lockheed Martin’s Wall Street Price to account for its debt using our Sherlock Debt Divisor. Below is a detailed definition of that ratio and how we use it.A major concern that I have these days in analyzing companies is the debt burden relative to its operations and whether management is abusing this situation by taking on more debt than it requires. Debt, when used wisely, allows for what is called leverage, and leverage can be extremely beneficial within certain parameters. On the other side of the coin, the use of debt can also be excessive and put a company's future in jeopardy. So, what I have done to determine if a company's debt policy is beneficial or abusive is to create the Sherlock Debt Divisor.What the Divisor does is punish companies that use debt unwisely and rewards those who successfully use debt as leverage. How do I do this? Well, I take a company's working capital and subtract its long-term debt. If a company has a lot more working capital than long-term debt, I reward it but punish those whose long-term debt exceeds its working capital. So, if this result is higher than the current stock market price, then leverage is being used and the more leveraged a company is, the worse the results of this ratio will be and the less attractive its stock will be as an investment.Thus, having successfully defined the Sherlock Debt Divisor, we need the following four bits of financial data in order to calculate it for Lockheed Martin’s TTM (trailing twelve months) is as close to real-time data as we can get, based on when each company reports. The current analysis is taken from the Lockheed Martin’s December 31, 2018, filing with the SEC (except the Market Price per share).Market Price Per Share = $334.17Working Capital = Total Current Assets - Total Current LiabilitiesTotal Current Assets = $16,103,000,000Total Current Liabilities = $14,398,000,000Working Capital = $1,705,000,000Long-Term Debt = $12,604,000,000Diluted Shares Outstanding = 285,600,000Sherlock Debt Divisor = Market Price Per Share - ((Working Capital - Long-Term Debt)/(Diluted Shares Outstanding))Sherlock Debt Divisor = $334.17 - ((1,705,000,000 - $12,604,000,000)/285,600,000))Sherlock Debt Divisor = $334.17 - ($-38.16) = $372.33Since Lockheed Martin has more Long-Term Debt vs. Working Capital, we, therefore, must punish it and use the new $372.33 as our new numerator in all our calculations.Price to Bernhard Buffett FCF Ratio = Sherlock Debt Divisor/[(net income per share + depreciation per share) - (capital spending per diluted share)]Sherlock Debt Divisor = $372.33Net Income per diluted share = $5,046,000,000/285,600,000 = $17.67Depreciation per diluted share = $1,161,000,000/285,600,000 = $4.07Capital Spending per diluted share = $1,278,000,000/285,600,000 = $4.48$17.67 + $4.07 - $4.48 = $17.26Price to Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio = $372.33/$17.26 = 21.57Now, if one goes to our FRIEDRICH LEGEND (on what is considered a good or bad result), you will notice that our result of 21.57 is considered average, while anything under 15 is considered excellent, while 30 is bad.We last ran our data file for Lockheed Martin on April 23, 2019, and our Friedrich Algorithm gave a recommendation to our subscribers that Lockheed Martin is a “Strong Hold” as our Friedrich Data File and Chart below shows. There you will also find the last ten years of Lockheed Martin’s Price to Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow results. In the chart, you will also see that Lockheed Martin did actually break below our bargain price in 2018 and was a strong buy then at $264.73.Now that we have taught everyone how to calculate our Price to Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow ratio, let us now move on and teach everyone how to calculate our FROIC ratio.This is how we calculate it:FROIC means ""Free Cash Flow Return on Invested Capital""Forward Free Cash Flow = [((Net Income + Depreciation) (1+ % Revenue Growth rate)) - (Capital Spending)]FROIC = (Forward Free Cash Flow)/(Long-Term Debt + Shareholders' Equity)Net Income per diluted share = $5,046,000,000/285,600,000 = $17.67Depreciation per diluted share = $1,161,000,000/285,600,000 = $4.07Capital Spending per diluted share = $1,278,000,000/285,600,000 = $4.48$17.67 + $4.07 - $4.48 = $17.26Now, since TTM and the fiscal year end are the same as we are using December 31, 2018, data, we will use our 2018 results to calculate the Revenue Growth Rate for Lockheed Martin.Revenue Growth Rate 2018 = 8%[(($17.67 + $4.07) (108%)) – $4.48 = $18.99]Long-Term Debt = $12,604,000,000Shareholders' Equity = $1,394,000,000Diluted Shares Outstanding = 285,600,000FROIC = (Forward Free Cash Flow)/ (Long-Term Debt + Shareholders' Equity)$18.99/$49.01 = 38.75%FROIC = 39%Now, if one goes to my FRIEDRICH LEGEND again (on what is considered a good or bad result), you will notice that our result of 39% is considered excellent and tells good us that Lockheed Martin produces $39 in forward free cash flow for every $100 it invests in total capital employed on Main Street.On Main Street, Lockheed Martin is doing great, while on Wall Street, it is considered a Strong Hold.Going forward, Friedrich looks for companies to invest in for the Long Term (5 to 10 years), and Lockheed Martin clearly fits that pattern. Lockheed Martin has been a key component in most of our Friedrich Model Portfolios and, since the end of December 2018, has really rocketed forward in price appreciation, being up 28.5% so far in 2019.In conclusion, it is my belief that free cash flow analysis is the ultimate tool when analyzing companies, and my hope is that you may add these ratios to your own investor toolbox in order to help you in your own due diligence.

The majority of Lockheed Martin's business is with the U.S. Department of Defense and other U.S. federal government agencies. Lockheed also owns Sikorsky, which sells helicopters and rotary-wing aircraft. The remaining portion of Lockheed Martin's business is comprised of missiles and fire control systems, as well as space launches and satellite systems.Last year, Lockheed Martin paid out $2.3 billion in the form of dividends and made $1.5 billion in share repurchases, including increased buying in the fourth quarter, when the market dropped. Lockheed essentially bought twice as much in the holiday quarter as it averaged during the first three quarters.They continued to distribute cash and repurchase shares and last quarter too. Moreover, the dividend is less than half current free cash flow, and the dividend plus the repurchase plan combine to equal about two-thirds of free cash flow. This means Lockheed has a strong likelihood of being able to pay the dividend, and also continue to increase it.(Source Lockheed Martin Q1 earnings presentation)Lockheed Martin increased its dividend in each of the last 16 years. Due to the sizable share repurchasing in 2018, it is likely that Lockheed Martin can increase its dividend by over ten percent and still cover the dividend with less than half the company's free cash flow. This is also because the company is doing well, with increasing earnings and increased estimates.Last quarter, Lockheed Martin had double digit profit increases in all four of its segments. (Source Lockheed Martin Q1 earnings presentation)Lockheed Martin also increased its sales outlook for three of its four core segments, for a total estimated increase to revenue of approximately $1 billion. (Source Lockheed Martin Q1 earnings presentation)The company also increased its profit expectations by $100 million when it updated its outlook. (Source Lockheed Martin Q1 earnings presentation)Lockheed delivered 91 F-35 aircraft to the USA and international customers in 2018 and hopes to deliver 130 F-35s in 2019, with further production increases taking LMT's F-35 capacity to 160 by 2021. These aircraft had sticker prices of 94 million (F-35A) an $122 million (F-35B) a piece, and it should be expected that operational efficiencies make increased productivity come with higher margins.These aircraft also require servicing, modifications, retrofitting and related maintenance. This increase to production and delivery also helps develop this secondary revenue source. The aircraft are expected to remain in use for around 15 years, so long these relationships are very long term. At the same time, LMT’s older F-16 fighter program continues to be a source of revenue through both new sales and needed upgrading. These aircraft are being bought and upgraded internationally, such as a recent program to upgrade Greece’s 85 F-16s to a more advanced system. Also, Slovakia recently bought some of the F-16V configuration. Bahrain similarly bought the F-16V last year. Lockheed simply continues to make hay.Germany decided to not buy the F-35. That decision was likely solely because they want to support the European effort to produce a new Eurofighter, which is to be designed by Airbus (OTCPK:EADSY) and Dassault (OTCPK:DASTY) project. This significantly reduces the likelihood of new contracts with certain European nations and also could develop into competitive threat in other markets. Nonetheless, that is unlikely to be a near term concern and it possible the whole project will languish in bureaucracy. There is also some concern that the Russian S-400 air defense system might be a superior or at least comparable missile system to Lockheed's THAAD, but at a much cheaper price. The S-400 could be a double whammy in that it not only competes with the THAAD system, but it may also complicate jet fighter sales. Essentially, there are concerns about allowing certain nations to have access to both F-35 fighter jets and S-400 defense system in fear that the two will be used to test the jets for exploitable weaknesses. This issue was a raised issue when Turkey announced it would buy the S-400 system.I believe the F-35 will have sufficient domestic support to keep it a success, but also plenty of international support. A good amount of the financing and component manufacturing of the F-35 project is international. Moreover, operational efficiencies may make the F-35A cost similar to the F-16V, which should keep it competitive. Lockheed Martin is in some really interesting lines of business. Beyond those F-16 and F-35 jets, and the missiles and choppers, they make some even more high tech stuff, such as being the prime contractor building NASA's Orion spacecraft, which is designed for long-duration, human deep space exploration.Lockheed Martin is likely to be a major player in space activities for decades to come. Lockheed already does and will continue to provide systems for governments and corporations to manage space assets, including battle management with debris. Many such systems will be needed perpetually.Several opportunities within space exploration and protection have the potential to become larger businesses than terrestrial aerospace and defense. Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor building NASA's Orion, the only spacecraft designed for long-duration, human deep space exploration.Orion is just a single part of a larger program that will be deployed over the next decade. As Lockheed Martin explains on its website :(Source: Lockheed Martin Corporation website)Lockheed Martin is performing very well, including recently increasing earnings estimates and accelerating its share repurchasing during the fourth quarter of 2018. Lockheed has a strong dividend that is well covered by free cash flow and which is likely to grow for the next several years. The company is just beginning to ramp up F-35 production, which should remain in strong demand for the next decade, and the company is well positioned to become a major competitor in space exploration. Lockheed Martin is a strong company that is likely to outperform over the long term."
4240334,104097,2019-02-12T16:35:44-05:00,"Following the large broad-based market selloff late last year, Lockheed Martin's share price has rallied quite strongly.Despite this rally, their shares still offer long-term investors attractive value.Based on a discounted free cash flow analysis, I believe the intrinsic value of their shares is between approximately $360 and $400.","Since plunging to $241.18 in late December last year, Lockheed Martin's (LMT) share price has subsequently rallied quite strongly to around $300. On the surface, some investors may feel as though they have missed an opportunity to purchase attractively priced shares in a world-leading company, however, this isn't necessarily the case. Despite this strong share price rally, there is still ample value remaining for long-term investors.Data by YChartsMy preferred approach to valuing a company is to utilize either a discounted dividend or discounted free cash flow analysis, depending on their payout ratio. Since Lockheed Martin's payout ratio is quite low, I'll be utilizing a discounted free cash flow analysis, as focusing solely on their dividends would ignore the intrinsic value of their remaining free cash flow and thus materially undervalue their shares.When Lockheed Martin's management presented their guidance for this year, they forecast operating cash flow will be at least $7.4B and capital expenditure will be $1.6B to $1.7B. If the median point of $1.65B is assumed for their capital expenditure, this implies their free cash flow will be approximately $5.75B.When combining this free cash flow with Lockheed Martin's current outstanding share count of 282,562,534, their forward free cash flow per share is $20.35 per share. This clearly exceeds their current dividend per share of $8.80 by well over 100% and thus highlights the importance of not solely focusing on their dividends when valuing their shares.I'll also provide three different valuation factors, with the first being the rate of return Lockheed Martin shares provide at their current price of $301.50. This factor is provided as there are numerous methods to calculate an investor's required rate of return and this allows readers to simply compare their required rate of return to those offered by their shares. The second factor provided is an example required rate of return based on the capital asset pricing model, with the third being valuations for their shares based on this model.Since any valuation is highly dependent on Lockheed Martin's future growth rate, I've provided three scenarios, all of which are quite conservative estimates based off their historical free cash flow per share growth rate. Following the merger in 1995 that created Lockheed Martin, their free cash flow per share has increased 917.6% until the end of 2017, this very impressive growth rate is the equivalent of a compounded annual growth rate of 10.61%. Their free cash flow from 2018 was ignored as it was significantly distorted by their abnormally large pension payments.Data by YChartsEven though I'm very bullish on Lockheed Martin, I'm still skeptical this extremely high growth rate can continue indefinitely into the future and thus, to also provide a margin of safety, I slashed this growth rate considerably lower. The first scenario assumes their free cash flow per share growth rate is only one-third of their historical average at 3.54%, whilst the remaining two scenarios assume it's even lower at one quarter and one fifth, which are 2.65% and 2.12% respectively. Based on these growth assumptions and their trailing annual dividend of $8.80 per share, I calculated the rates of return their shares offer as follows.$301.50/share @ 3.54% growth = 10.53%$301.50/share @ 2.65% growth = 9.58%$301.50/share @ 2.12% growth = 9.01%These rates of return are quite high, especially considering the quite conservative growth rate assumptions and thus, this indicates Lockheed Martin's shares present attractive long-term value. If they are capable of producing future free cash flow per share growth rates anywhere near their historical average of 10.61%, the rate of return would be insanely high at 18.08%.To provide context and a reference point for an investor's required rate of return, I'll provide an example using the capital asset pricing model. Although this model is far from perfect, it still provides a beneficial starting point investors can utilize to help inform their decisions. I calculated a required rate of return of 7.89% using this model with the following inputs, risk free of 2.634% (10-year U.S. Treasury), beta of 0.98 (CNBC), and an expected market return of 8%. The estimated intrinsic values for their shares using this required rate of return are as follows.3.54% growth = $484.382.65% growth = $398.652.12% growth = $360.16These results indicate Lockheed Martin's shares have an intrinsic value between $360.16 and $484.38, which is between 19.46% and 60.66% higher than their current share price. It's important to remember these intrinsic value estimates are provided as ""food for thought"" since there aren't any perfect valuation models. Even though it's easy to materially change the intrinsic value through different future assumptions, I feel a sensible investment is one that can be justified with quite conservative assumptions.Admittedly, the top estimate of $484.38 is rather high and thus, I believe the other two estimates are more realistic and accurate. Whilst a share price of approximately $400 may still sound rather high, it's worthwhile remembering this would still only represent a forward free cash flow yield of approximately 5%. During 2017 and early 2018, Lockheed Martin's shares traded around this same valuation, and given the attractive qualitative characteristics of their company, as discussed later, I feel this valuation is quite realistic.Data by YChartsSince an over-leveraged financial position is a common source of shareholder value destruction, it's very important to consider Lockheed Martin's financial position. Although their net debt increased considerably as a result of their Sikorsky acquisition and is currently sitting at $13.33B, it's still very manageable and thus doesn't endanger the company. During the last year, their EBITDA was $7.67B and thus, their net debt to EBITDA ratio is an easily manageable 1.74. Their interest coverage of 9.74 further supports the notion their debt is easily serviceable and a current ratio of 1.12 indicates their liquidity is strong.Data by YChartsOne aspect that may alarm some investors is their very high debt to equity ratio of 29.97, however, despite sounding concerning on the surface, there is little reason to be concerned. Although it's important to monitor this metric, their ability to service their financial interest-bearing debt is considerably more important. Providing their financial interest-bearing debt remains manageable, they should be able to retain the flexibility to access debt markets to fund any other liabilities if required. These other liabilities, such as unfunded pensions, only become a serious problem when the company's financial interest-bearing debt is too high.These values are derived by complicated accounting policies and don't necessarily reflect the true economic value of their assets. To provide an example, their property, plant, and equipment is recorded at cost minus accumulated depreciation, however, their intrinsic economic value is considerably higher when considering the vast profits these assets are capable of producing.The main force that drives companies into bankruptcy or destroying shareholder value is insufficient liquidity to meet maturing liabilities, which thankfully is not an issue for Lockheed Martin. Provided their financial debt remains manageable and they continue producing strong free cash flow, which is likely given their guidance and history, then there are currently no reasons to be concerned.Although their financial position remains solid, if a company's free cash flow is insufficient to cover their dividend, it puts their payment at great risk of eventually being reduced. Their quite low dividend payout ratio was previously discussed and thus, by extension so was their dividend coverage, which clearly remains very strong. Since merging together in 1995, Lockheed Martin's strong free cash flow generation has virtually always been sufficient to cover their dividend payments, evidenced by their free cash flow yield normally exceeding their dividend yield. When assessing dividend coverage, I prefer to forgo using earnings per share and use free cash flow instead since dividends are paid from cash not ""earnings"".Data by YChartsDuring the last year, Lockheed Martin produced $3.138B of operating cash flow and after paying $1.278B of capital expenditure, they were left with $1.86B of free cash flow. Whilst technically this was insufficient to cover their dividend payments totaling $2.347B, this was solely the result of their abnormally large pension payments and thus this was only a temporary situation.Looking ahead into this year using the guidance previously discussed, Lockheed Martin has effectively guided for approximately $5.75B in free cash flow. Since their current annual dividend of $8.80 per share costs slightly under $2.5b with their current outstanding share count, this leaves ample free cash flow to support buybacks.Aside from having undervalued shares, Lockheed Martin also presents several attractive qualitative characteristics and I believe their near-impenetrable moat to entry sits atop the list. Even though new entrants can still nibble around the edges, figuratively speaking, by taking the occasional small contracts, they stand zero chance of competing for large core programs. Even if their proposed design was suitable and they received the necessary clearance for classified information, it's laughable to believe the Pentagon would entrust a small unproven company to handle a double or triple digit billion dollar program that is central to national defense. Although Lockheed Martin still has large well-established competitors, such as Boeing (BA) and Northrop Grumman (NOC), their numbers are quite low and unlikely to increase in the future.The economic resilience of Lockheed Martin's earnings is also very desirable as the stability it provides helps their management create long-term value for shareholders. This was displayed during the 2008 financial crisis, even though the world's economies were in turmoil it barely registered on their financial performance with their earnings holding strong throughout. The confidence provided by this outstanding performance allowed their dividend to be increased by a huge 35.71%, with subsequent increases following every year since.Image Source: Lockheed Martin Annual Report 2009.This economic resilience directly stems from their primary customer being the United States government, whose defense spending is planned ahead of time and allocated through long-term contracts. Whilst defense spending obviously changes each year, it doesn't necessarily correlate with economic growth in the short to medium-term. Although a long-lasting economic crisis could theoretically result in defense spending being reduced, virtually all other companies would also be suffering and thus investors would have few places left to take cover.I believe this aspect is particularly desirable at the moment given the financial news headlines are dominated by stories regarding the United States-China trade war and slowing global economic growth. Although many industrial companies, such as Boeing, are at the forefront of the trade war with their vast international sales, there are very few industrial companies with less exposure than Lockheed Martin. Although tariffs can be levied against their imports, such as steel and aluminium, this is less of a risk than the potential negative implications other companies face from retaliatory tariffs against their products or from deteriorating economic growth.Even though Lockheed Martin's earnings have little exposure to economic growth and global trade conditions, the specter of decreased United States defense spending constantly lingers in the background. Even though military spending could be reduced in the years ahead, this doesn't appear likely whilst President Trump occupies the White House. Whether he remains President after the 2020 elections is unknown, however, even if the Democrats retake the White House, I doubt military spending will be reduced significantly enough to materially affect Lockheed Martin in the long-term. Although the left and right political spectrum often struggle to find common ground, countering China's rising military power seems to be receiving increasing bipartisan support. Considering Lockheed Martin's programs span land, sea, air and space, they're well positioned to support the United States military across all arenas and minimize the risk of budget changes.Data by YChartsWhilst the increase in United States defense spending this century has been quite large, Lockheed Martin has produced returns that are many magnitudes larger. This indicates their management has been effective at creating significant value for their shareholders and thus hasn't relied on increased defense spending to drive their returns. Although this doesn't necessarily remove the risk posed by decreased defense spending, it does help counteract and lessen the risk. If defense spending decreases at some point in the future, it's reasonable to believe they can still continue producing strong returns for their shareholders in the long-term.Data by YChartsOne of the most impressive aspects of Lockheed Martin's fourth quarter results was their record backlog that slightly exceeded $130b, which is a staggering increase of almost $25b year on year. To be more exact, this represents an increase of 23.70% year on year and is the largest annual increase since 2001 if the Sikorsky acquisition is ignored. This has pushed their backlog to revenue ratio to the highest level since around 2003 and thus highlights their ability to continuously develop the equipment required by the Pentagon, which is instrumental to ensuring their long-term success.Image Source: Author.Regardless of the value offered, investing in defense contractors may not necessarily suit all investors, primarily due to the ethical considerations involved with effectively profiting from conflicts and wars. At the end of the day this is a personal choice and thus I'm not going to attempt to sway anyone into changing their stance on this potentially sensitive topic. Although I can appreciate countering points of view, my investing decisions are based on pragmatic expectations for the future, regardless if these necessarily align with the future I wish to see eventuate.A final and rather interesting aspect that is unique to investing in defense contractors is the classified nature of several of their projects. This creates a situation where investors cannot be informed of all aspects on their operations and thus this creates a degree of opaqueness when considering a prospective investment. Since absolutely nothing can be done to alter or mitigate this dynamic, investors have no choice other than to trust management's judgement whilst being left to ponder what interesting projects they're developing. Since their 10-K filings state that the risks ""associated with classified contracts historically have not differed materially from those of our other U.S. Government contracts"", it implies this dynamic shouldn't materially alter an investor's decision.It's understandable that on the surface, Lockheed Martin shares may not seem too enticing when sporting a dividend yield of only 2.92%, however, this ignores the value of their free cash flow and the many desirable qualitative characteristics. Therefore, despite posting a strong rally during the last month, I believe Lockheed Martin's shares still offer investors attractive long-term value. The only reason that I'm not currently purchasing their shares is because my existing investment already forms quite a large portion of my portfolio.Notes: Unless specified otherwise, all figures in this article were taken from Lockheed Martin's Annual Reports, all calculated figures were performed by the author."
4240699,104122,2019-02-13T15:22:34-05:00,Lockheed Martin exhibits strong competitive advantages.The stock offers significant shareholder rewards.Lockheed Martin demonstrates a great short- and long-term outlook and the stock remains a good buy.,"Source: Lockheed MartinFrom an overarching perspective, Lockheed (LMT) appears to be an incredibly well-positioned company awash with strong competitive advantages. As the largest military defensive contractor in the world, LMT exhibits unwavering competitive advantages ranging from a monopoly on government defense spending, inseparable lobbying and congressional ties, an immunity from market forces, as well as unparalleled technology and human capital. Such venerable business characteristics and sustained operational outperformance have not gone unnoticed. Over the past five years, LMT has experienced market-beating capital appreciation of 17% a year. This article delineates my bullish investment thesis on LMT discussing business strengths, growth vectors, and the stock's current valuation. LMT is a stock that unequivocally meets Warren Buffet's investment criteria as a stock to hold forever. LMT displays innumerable business advantages that reinforce a highly stable business largely unaffected by free-market forces. With $54 billion in annual revenues, LMT is one of the largest players in the aerospace, defense, security, and advanced technologies space. The company operates in an oligopoly market with few competing firms that rival the LMT's scale of operations and extensive clientele base. LMT has forged longstanding and inseparable relationships with governments and private security firms who are driven by the need for continuity of service, equipment, and operational stability (ex. LMT has worked for the U.S government for decades upon decades). LMT boasts unparalleled intellectual, monetary, and product capital, allowing the company to disqualify various competitors who are simply unable to compete and perform on LMT's level. From a revenue perspective, LMT's operations are centralized around inelastic demand for global security and military defense needs. Given that security and defense solutions are subject to unwavering demand, defense enterprises such as LMT benefit from consistent revenue expansion, allowing the company to reliably sustain and increase revenues in spite of market vagaries. Also, mankind's unwavering inclination for conflict assures continued preventative and corrective defense expenditures in both peaceful and tumultuous geopolitical environments alike.LMT receives an astronomical portion of its revenues from the U.S government, with government-related sales accounting for 69% of total revenues. Although some may interpret LMT's significant revenue concentration as disadvantageous, in reality, it reinforces the reliability and predictability of the company's revenues. With defense budgetary allocations close to $700 billion a year, the United States military budget prevails as the largest in the world, eclipsing the next six largest foreign budgets combined. An inclination for formidable military spending in addition to LMT's extensive lobbying presence in Washington, assures strategic support (from a policy perspective) for the company's interests. LMT has a prominent corporate lobbying presence, pouring over $13 million a year into Washington to sway political influence. Additionally, LMT's more than 100,000 employees distributed throughout the 50 states ensure favorable political contingencies given the company's substantial employment presence. The lack of competitive alternatives provides LMT with pricing autonomy allowing the company to raise prices with impunity. Additionally, LMT's revenues are derived from multiple operating segments ranging from aerospace and defense, information technology, and space/emerging technologies, assuring a diverse product portfolio that caters to multiple governmental initiatives. In terms of revenue prospects, LMT's positioning is secure on both a short and long-term basis. The current political landscape provides a favorable operating environment for LMT. The House approved $684 billion in appropriations for military and defense spending for fiscal year 2019, up about 15% since 2017's $590 billion in appropriations. Furthermore, LMT's long-term growth prospects are stable given the company's $110 billion in backlog orders, LMT's 400 billion dollar F-35 development program, and the company's new nuclear fusion technologies. LMT's F-35 plane program is one of the most ambitious and expensive military programs ever created; the company's objective to build 3,000 military aircraft will prove an enduring tailwind for decades. Additionally, LMT's compact nuclear fusion system promises to deliver significant monetary rewards. The company is in the process of developing a portable nuclear-fusion power generation unit that has the ability to power 100,000 homes. Data by YChartsFrom an investment returns perspective, LMT elicits strong appeal. The company has delivered market-crushing returns. From a total price returns perspective, LMT has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 benchmark index. In addition to formidable capital appreciation, LMT boasts a pristine dividend track record; the company has consistently increased its dividend for the past 16 years and the current yield situated at 2.91% is very attractive. In spite of a high dividend, LMT exhibits only a moderate payout ratio of 51%, reinforcing a stable dividend growth trajectory. Overall, LMT's sustained track record of share price performance coupled with consistently increasing dividends, reinforces a promising return on invested capital. At present levels, LMT remains an attractive buy. Based on a discounted cash flow valuation, the company is fairly valued as the current share price of $300 is only slightly above the future cash flow value of $292. LMT definitely commands a much higher premium than its current valuation, enabling good short-term upside potential. Data by YChartsLMT is an amazing investment that will offer shareholders significant monetary rewards over the long-run. The company's unparalleled competitive advantages and stable underlying business illuminate a very compelling life-long investment holding. Over the short-term, I anticipate positive share price movement due to LMT's fair valuation, steady and defensive business, and the company's encouraging future prospects.

4240655,52502,2019-02-13T13:58:26-05:00,"German decision to scrap purchase of F-35's as a replacement for aging fleet, highlights greater EU emphasis on domestic arms development support.Countries like Turkey, India and others may potentially be excluding themselves from being able to buy F-35's as they opt for attractive Russian S-400 air defense system.Last resort buyer, the US military may be looking at cutting back as well, since it does not have unlimited resources either, therefore things may get tough going forward.","While Lockheed Martin (LMT) is known for many weapons systems, including aircraft of various designs and capabilities, as well as missiles, anti aircraft systems, by far its most important project at the moment is the on-going F-35 stealth fighter portfolio. It is expected that thousands of units will be delivered to the US military, as well as to a number of eligible customers around the world. At an average price per unit of about $85 million, it is going to be worth hundreds of billions of dollars in revenues for Lockheed Martin, even in a worst-case scenario, while in a best-case scenario it may be worth almost $2 trillion in revenues for the duration of the project. Recent developments are putting a question mark on whether the project is still worth trillions of dollars. The latest news should have been expected, given rhetoric we had coming out from a number of EU elites. I am referring to Germany's decision to drop the F-35 as an option to replace its aging fleet of fighter jets. It may be a sign of things to come for the F-35 in the EU and perhaps beyond.The reason why Germany opted not to buy the F-35 is because it would make it harder for the French-German joint effort to produce a new Euro-Fighter project to come to life. Only a few days after Germany passed on the F-35, an announcement was made for the beginning of a new fighter jet program which will be a joint Airbus (OTCPK:EADSY), Dassault (OTCPK:DASTY) project. It is expected that other EU countries will most likely join in this project. It remains to be seen how many will, but Spain is seemingly already on board, while Britain may join in as well, merging their own separate project with the EU project, despite the Brexit issue. The smaller EU states will most likely want to participate in order to get some development and manufacturing contracts.Not long ago, France's president Emmanuel Macron declared that while Europe looks to meet its NATO spending obligations, thus ushering in an era of European re-arming, the US should not assume that it will mean new contracts for its weapons producers. He wants to bolster France's own weapons sales in the EU, given that it is one of the leading producers of weapons on the continent. It goes without saying that most other countries also wish to increase their domestic weapons industries, thus they will try to buy European-made in order to increase their own chances of selling to other EU countries. Hungary for instance recently bought German tanks and French helicopters. It probably hopes to at the very least sell these countries some small arms in return, while also expanding cooperation on parts manufacturing for such products. While there are still some countries like Poland and Romania, which view their US partnership as being indispensable therefore are likely to continue to rely heavily on US weapons, there is definitely a sense that the EU is likely to shrink its overall US weapons demand, replacing it with its own domestic industry. In effect, the EU commitment to increase its own military capabilities, with the dual objective of meeting its NATO obligations, as well as work towards a joint EU military force is doing much the same that America's own robust military expenditures program is doing for the US weapons industry. It is spurring on a revival of Europe's own domestic weapons industry, having the opposite effect of what investors thought it will have on the likes of Lockheed Martin, as well as other American weapons producers. After all, we don't see much in the way of America importing European weapons systems either. The US military prefers to be dependent on its own domestic industry.It is thought that the Russian-made S-400 air defense system might be one of the most advanced, if not the most advanced system in the world today. To make matters worse, it sells at a fraction of the price that Lockheed's own arguably comparable system, the THAAD sells for. Even the aging Patriot system made by Raytheon (RTN) sells for double, while its overall capabilities seem to be greatly outmatched comparatively speaking. While this by itself may be troubling in regards to Lockheed's air defense systems sale, the bigger problem arises from a growing number of countries buying the S-400 system, which will then potentially disqualify them from also purchasing the F-35 fighter jet.Some of the countries which already bought the S-400 system include China, India and Turkey. While there was never a chance that China will buy F-35 fighter jets, Turkey was part of the development program, while India could have been a potential customer. As things stand right now, Turkey may be excluded from the F-35 project, because it is thought that the S-400 could be used to study the vulnerabilities of the F-35 if its military were to have both systems. A number of other countries are considering the S-400 system, including Iraq, Qatar and Egypt, all of which could also be potential future customers for the F-35. Even Saudi Arabia, which has been a major customer for the US arms industry is apparently keen on buying the S-400 system.One major takeaway from recent developments is that the period of US arms sales exclusivity may have come to an end. There are three major competitors on the scene, namely Russia, China and perhaps a resurgent EU arms industry. Traditional buyers of almost exclusively US weapons, such as Saudi Arabia, will from now on demand the right to shop around, meaning that aside from when they buy from the EU, similar issues to the S-400 problem will likely come up. It may seem hard to imagine right now, within the context of the Ukraine crisis, but it may be that EU-Russian arms industry ties and collaboration will see some strengthening next decade, with trade and technological collaboration in the field being seen as a natural win-win for both sides. For Lockheed Martin, which is in the middle of executing arguably the most important arms project within the US and NATO alliance, it effectively means that the world that existed when the project was conceived, is starting to show signs of coming apart. With that, so will the opportunity for the project to reach its maximum commercial potential. If by any chance the US Air Force decides to cut back on its own purchase of the plane, as it has been rumored to be currently considered, Lockheed's longer term prospects in regards to this project as well as future ones may be greatly diminished.While I personally think that Lockheed is facing major headwinds due to the changing global economic and geopolitical dynamics, general investor consensus on this stock is mostly positive. Reason for it has to do with the fact that current results are in fact making the case for the bulls. In the fourth quarter of 2018 revenues were up 5% compared with the same quarter of 2017, while net earnings came in at $1.25 billion, versus a $744 million loss in the fourth quarter of 2017.Source: Lockheed Martin.The full year results paint a more accurate picture in regards to both sales and profits. Comparing the full year results, with quarterly results however also suggests that there may be some early signs of there being some reason to worry. For instance sales increased 8% in 2018 compared with 2017, while in the fourth quarter we only saw a gain of 5%. It would take a few more quarters to confirm a structural slowdown, rather than perhaps just a quarterly fluke. I personally think that we will not see that confirmation just yet.There is the matter of the 400 F-35 order backlog, which suggests that Lockheed Martin will only see a decline in revenues in coming quarters if it fails to execute, not so much due to any immediate demand issues. The first signs of demand issues arising from what seems to be a narrowing field of potential customers may only come into play in a year or later. The first sign that it is happening is likely to be a decline in the orders backlog, without an associated increase in deliveries. When that will start to happen, it will be a good early indication for investors that it is time to stop looking for an entry point and for those who own this stock, it will be a good time to start planning an exit strategy.

4242401,104996,2019-02-20T08:43:26-05:00,Aeronautics and Missiles and Fire Control segments are expected to post high single-digit growth in the coming quarter.F-35 and F-16 continue to gain momentum from international communities. Missiles and Fire Control secured PAC-3 award to deliver 450 interceptors.The budgetary environment is less likely to adversely impact Lockheed given the current political climate.Financial analysis shows little variability in profitability and steadily growing revenue.,"Lockheed Martin’s (LMT) earnings guidance for 2019 is driven by Aeronautics and Missiles and Fire Control segment. The latter is its fastest growing business area with around 10% expected growth over 2018 while its largest segment Aeronautics is expected to grow in the high single-digit level. Although RMS (Rotary and Missile systems) is LMT’s second largest segment, growth in RMS is expected to have slight increases over their 2018 results, but it shouldn’t outweigh the expected positive growth from the other two segments, at least that’s what I sensed after analyzing the firm.The Aeronautics segment is on fire, really. The last quarter showed strong momentum as indicated by increased backlog and continued interest from international communities (as I’ll discuss later). On the other hand, Missile and Fire Control has received large orders for interceptors. If you don’t want to miss the opportunities in the defense sector then Lockheed Martin should be a top consideration for your portfolio, but don’t buy Lockheed if you have a short-term orientation.Image from ForbesIn its last quarter, F-35 aircraft backlog had grown to nearly 400 planes, a level which exceeds the total of 35 deliveries Lockheed Martin made, signaling a strong momentum in the segment. The firm is working with the F-35 joint program office to finalize the full order of lots 12, 13 and 14, which once completed will represent a total of 478 aircraft. F-35's cost continues to go down while orders go up, benefiting Lockheed Martin tremendously in its glorious journey.On the other hand, the Legacy F-16 fighter program is drawing interest from international communities, for both upgrades and new production units of its Viper Aircraft configuration. LMT’s aeronautics team closed on an opportunity with Greece to modernize 85 of their current F-16 fleet to this advanced platform, continuing the partnership with the Greek military that has spanned more than 70 years. The Bulgarian Ministry of Defense announced their intent to procure eight new jets if the contract is finalized and definitive. Bulgaria will join Bahrain and Slovakia as new F-16 customers, extending Lockheed’s backlog of Fighting Falcons well into the mid-2020s. According to Reuters, the deal would be worth around 1.8 billion levs ($1.1 billion), Bulgaria’s biggest military procurement since the fall of Communist rule some 30 years ago.Data from StatistaTrump is more than happy to work with the Bulgarian Government, as reflected in his statement:Now, let’s shift our focus to the RMS (Rotary and Missile systems) segment. The segment won a competitive award from the Missile Defense Agency to design and develop a second homeland defense radar system and provide installation services for its solution in Hawaii. On the other hand, the Missiles and Fire Control team secured a PAC-3 Award to deliver over 450 interceptors, launcher modification kits, and associated equipment to the U.S. Army and foreign military sales customers.Lockheed Martin describes the PAC-3 Missile as a high-velocity interceptor that is capable to defeat incoming targets by a direct, body-to-body impact. When deployed in a Patriot battery, the missiles significantly increase the Patriot system’s firepower, since 16 PAC-3s load-out on a Patriot launcher, compared with four Patriot PAC-2 missiles.The DOD is operating under the 2019 fiscal year Appropriations Act which became law last year. The Appropriations Act fully funded the Defense Department, providing approximately $617 billion of base budget funding for the nation's security and defense programs. I am expecting the coming budget to be in alignment with the National Defense strategy's focus on missile defense, nuclear, space, cyber, joint lethality and intelligence capabilities.Given these priorities, Lockheed should have minimal adverse impact. Earlier in January, an agreement was reached to temporarily open, through February 15th, the federal agencies that were affected by the recent partial shutdown of the government. The previous closure of these agencies did not have a significant impact on this year's anticipated financial metrics, as a vast majority of its business is currently funded through the DOD's FY19 Appropriations Bill. Given the political climate worldwide, the budget shouldn’t disfavor Lockheed Martin, at least not in the medium/long run.Lockheed’s revenues are steadily growing with 8.12% average in profit margin. Profit margin showed 2.27% in standard deviation, which is not very volatile. Free cash flow margin averaged 8.13% with only 2.35% in standard deviation. The reason behind 2017’s abnormal EPS was due to a net one-time tax charge of $1.9 billion which was related to the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Lockheed expects this year’s EPS from continuing operations to be in the $19.15 to $19.45 range, nearly 10% higher than its results in 2018. The firm expects cash from operations will be equal to or greater than $7.4 billion, recognizing both the invoices that are carried over into 2019 from 2018 and an improved outlook from the business areas for the year.Data from StockrowLockheed Martin thrives on an innovation-driven culture. The firm has an outstandingly successful portfolio and invaluable relationships with the U.S. and Global Governments. Especially, its Aeronautics and Missiles and Fire Control segments are leaders in their own fields. Although the other two segments are expected to post lower growth, these two sectors (Aeronautics and Missiles and Fire Control) demonstrate significant potential given the ongoing support from international communities. The financials look good, revenue continues to grow steadily and profitability shows comparatively lower variability. Long-term investors should definitely consider Lockheed Martin."
4240298,103862,2019-02-12T15:58:06-05:00,"The EPS in 2019 is expected to fall between the range of $19.15 and $19.45.In 2018, Lockheed Martin bought back 4.7 million shares for $1.5 billion.In 2018, Lockheed Martin marked its 16th consecutive year of rising dividend rates and that too by a double-digit percentage.The F-35’s backlog has risen to nearly 400 fighter jets.Interest rate risk poses a major threat to the firm’s future price performance and earnings.","In my last article on January 21st, I had looked at the fundamental news affecting the defense sector in 2019. However, in this article, I shall solely focus on Lockheed Martin (LMT) as I believe the stock is at a crossroad where there exists the possibility of an upside or downside move. Nevertheless, I am leaning towards the bulls winning the race as the odds seems to be stacked in their favor. Hence, to establish the most likely scenario, I shall look at the fundamentals of the stock, whilst also analyzing the charts using technical analysis tools.Future earnings:One of the factors that I believe will slightly neutralize the bullish sentiment present in the equity is the recently released earnings report. The results were largely positive; however, the outlook for 2019 will surely dampen investor sentiment. CEO Marillyn Hewitt stated that she expects the EPS in 2019 to fall between the range of $19.15 and $19.45. Hence, I expect this to dampen investor sentiment as the analyst forecast for the EPS is $19.55.Excellent order book:Lockheed Martin has mastered the art of securing large contracts from the Pentagon, which has helped the firm offer investors a stellar price performance over the past few years. I chose to highlight this as I expect the trend to continue in 2019. The firm in the fourth quarter clinched several large deals. An example of this is the $22.7 billion modification contract Lockheed Martin secured for 225 F-35 aircraft. Thus, I believe such significant contract wins will help the firm’s earnings remain positive in the quarters to come.Excellent Cash Flow:One of the reasons I am positive on Lockheed Martin weathering any storm is due to its cash flow position. Lockheed Martin is a strong cash generator which has helped the firm make some savvy cash deployment decisions. In 2018, Lockheed Martin bought back 4.7 million shares for $1.5 billion. Additionally, the firm also increased its share repurchase account by $1 billion which brought the total value of the account to a whopping $3.7 billion. Thus, all this will ensure that investors keep investing in Lockheed Martin’s share and this is all thanks to the excellent cash flow position.Dividend growth:Lockheed Martin may not be a dividend guru compared to other market giants. But I believe the firm is steadily building up its dividend profile which shall help the firm’s share price to rise in the long run. In 2018, Lockheed Martin marked its 16th consecutive year of rising dividend rates and that too by a double-digit percentage. This is as the firm in the third quarter of 2018 increased its quarterly dividend rate by 10%, to $2.20 per share. Hence, considering the past trend, I believe Lockheed Martin shall reward investors in 2019 with a similar dividend hike. This in turn shall ensure that investors looking out for dividend stocks will invest in the equity. Lastly, the firm paid out dividends worth $2.3 billion in 2018.F-35 – An excellent growth driver:Lockheed Martin’s F-35 is finally reaching its maturity phase and is on the way to becoming the firm’s trillion-dollar flagship. The aircraft’s backlog has risen to nearly 400 fighter jets which is a clear sign of the program’s momentum not slowing down anytime soon. Another reason, I am positive about this being a growth driver is due to the U.S. government’s inventory target of 2,456 aircraft for the Marine Corps, Navy and the Air Force. Thus, due to this, I expect Lockheed Martin to lock in more orders for its F-35 aircraft. This in turn shall bolster the firm’s top line.Sikorsky Products:One of the reasons I believe Lockheed Martin will not have a bearish 2019 is due to the firm's Sikorsky business line. Some of the division’s products such as the Black Hawk Helicopter have helped the firm to solidify its position in the military helicopter market. Moreover, in the fourth quarter of 2018, the division’s positive cost performance enabled the segment to add $70 million worth of operating profit into the firm’s RMS unit. Thus, I expect this trend to continue in the future. In 2019, the management plans to conduct a restructuring process aimed at cost reduction. Hence, I believe this shall further boost the operating profit of the segment in the coming quarters.Interest rate risk:Interest rate risk is one of the factors that has the potential of hampering Lockheed Martin’s future price performance. In December 2018, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates for the ninth time. Thus, the material rise in the long-term interest rates poses a major risk to Lockheed Martin. This is as it relies heavily on the capital markets for funds. I chose to highlight this as the U.S. Federal Reserve is in favor of raising interest rates further, which will make the credit market more unfavorable for Lockheed Martin. Moreover, the firm’s interest expense rose by 2.6% in 2018 to $668 million. Hence, I believe investors ought to keep an eye on this aspect of the firm in the future.Weekly Chart:The weekly chart indicates to investors that the near-term outlook of the stock is questionable. The stock is presently attempting to make a crossover above the 20-day moving average which is an excellent sign for bullish investors. However, the bearish tinkle existent here is that the 50-day moving average is presently acting as a resistance line. Nevertheless, I am leaning towards the bulls winning the war as the short-term exponential moving averages are about to do a crossover over the long-term exponential moving averages. Therefore, if this does occur, then I am certain that the stock will have a strong bullish ascent. Lastly, the other reason I believe the bulls will win the war against the bears is due to the Ichimoku cloud pattern. The stock’s lagging line is steadily heading towards the cloud pattern which indicates to investors that a bullish ascent is on the cards. However, I wouldn’t be surprised to see some sideways movement before the stock has a bullish move.On the price target front, I shall highlight the upside and downside potential of the stock as it is at a crossroad. The downside potential of the stock presently seems to be lower as explained above. However, if a bearish reversal were to occur, then I would expect the share price to fall till the 50% Fibonacci support level at $276.11. Moreover, if a breakout below this level were to occur, then the share price would fall till the 100% Fibonacci support level at $253.58. However, I believe the possibility of such a steep fall occurring is extremely low. On the other hand, an upside move in the share price seems to be the more likely scenario. If the stock were to have a bullish continuation, then I believe the stock price will rise till the range between the 161.8% and 200% Fibonacci resistance levels. The 161.8% Fibonacci resistance level is at $306.70, while the 200% Fibonacci resistance level is at $318.60.Overall, I expect 2019 to be a good year for Lockheed Martin as the firm has certain positive facets that will help it ride out any uncertainty that comes it way. However, I would like to state that Lockheed Martin is in an odd position where there is more clarity about the firm’s longer-term outlook than its near-term prospects. Thus, I believe this is a great buy for investors who have a tolerance for mild short-term risk. Nevertheless, before trading, do ensure that you utilize a trailing stop loss so that you are around for the next trade as capital protection is key.Good luck trading."
4236051,89625,2019-01-28T14:23:36-05:00,"Major defense and aircraft makers step into the spotlight this week as Lockheed Martin reports Tuesday and Boeing reports Wednesday.Whether it’s fair or not, shares of a few major U.S. multinational companies are often seen as bellwethers for the progress of U.S./China trade negotiations.Like BA, LMT is a major multinational doing business around the globe.","Whether it’s fair or not, shares of a few major U.S. multinational companies are often seen as bellwethers for the progress of U.S./China trade negotiations. Boeing (BA) — which reports Q4 earnings before the market open on Wednesday and counts China among its major customers — is arguably one of them.Before BA reports, its defense industry competitor, Lockheed Martin (LMT), is scheduled to release Q4 earnings Tuesday, ahead of the open. Like BA, LMT is a major multinational doing business around the globe.BA’s commercial aircraft business has been facing some questions amid signs of slowing global economic growth, while both companies wrestle with how their defense businesses might be affected by a change in political power in Washington, D.C., after Democrats won back the House.Another potentially looming issue investors might want to get clarity on is executives’ thoughts on how their business might be affected if trade talks with China don’t progress. That outcome might bring increased tariffs on the steel and aluminum both companies depend on to build their products.In addition, the recent shutdown of parts of the U.S. government ground some gears to a halt, and though the shutdown has been temporarily halted, a deal on border security has yet to be agreed upon. While the Department of Defense is fully funded for the year, it’s possible it might have to stretch some of its resources if any currently earmarked funds are shifted from the Pentagon to the border. Whether this would have any impact on BA and LMT is unclear.When BA releases results, it's expected to report adjusted EPS of $4.58, down from $4.80 in the prior-year quarter, on revenue of $26.95 billion, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. Revenue is expected to grow about 6.2% year-over-year.BA had a solid Q3, helped by a strong defense business and efficiencies in its commercial airliner production. Earlier this month, the company reported record-setting commercial jet deliveries in Q4. BA said it has continued to see “strong demand for air travel across the globe."" The company — which typically reports deliveries and orders ahead of earnings — said it delivered a record 806 planes in 2018, surpassing its previous record of 763 deliveries in 2017.BA has continued to build the 787 Dreamliner at the highest production rate for a twin-aisle airplane to support high demand. The Dreamliner program finished with 145 deliveries for the year, BA said.BA said it received 287 orders for its aircraft during the final quarter of the year, up from 189 during Q3. The 737 and the 787 made up a bulk of the new demand, with customers placing orders for 248 of the former and 25 of the latter.While the delivery figures might provide investors some insight into the business, final prices can vary widely from one plane to the next. In Q3 2018, BA reported that the commercial airplane division generated $15.28 billion in revenue from 190 deliveries.The Wall Street Journal reported last week that U.S. domestic flights were 83.5% full in November, down from a record 86.3% in July. Some carriers also have pushed back delivery dates for jets ordered from Boeing and other aircraft companies because they have enough capacity, the paper reported.So far this quarter, there have been some surprisingly positive earnings and optimism from major airlines. In their earnings calls, none of the airlines have been mentioning any worries about tariffs or crude oil prices.Looking beyond the commercial airplane business, the two other Boeing business segments are defense, space and security, and global services. Both of these divisions have been growing at a double-digit pace in recent quarters. In Q3 2018, defense, space and security revenue increased 13% year-over-year to $5.73 billion. And global services revenue increased 14% to $4.09 billion.Options traders have priced in an approximately 3.6% (about $12.98) stock move in either direction around the upcoming earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim platform from TD Ameritrade. Implied volatility was at the 36th percentile as of this morning. Weekly call options have been active at the 370 and 375 strikes, and put activity has been concentrated at the 350 and 360 strikes.Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time.

Data source: S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.Lockheed Martin is expected to report adjusted EPS of $4.40, up from a loss of $2.25 in the prior-year quarter, on revenue of $13.72 billion, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. Analysts have indicated that they expect revenue to be down about 9.3% year-over-year.The company’s shares had a tough 2018, falling 18%. A lot of the slide happened in Q4 along with the rest of the market, but LMT faced issues beyond the general collapse that quarter. The November election brought a change in control as Democrats won the House of Representatives to take power there for the first time in eight years. That has perhaps raised some questions about whether LMT could count on a rapidly-growing U.S. defense budget in the next few years.One potential concern is that with a divided U.S. government, compromises might be made that could bring back spending caps to the Defense budget, as seen earlier this decade. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set limits on defense spending as part of a plan to keep budget deficits under control. The idea then was to reduce annual budget deficits by at least $2.1 trillion over 10 years, with approximately half of the savings coming from defense. Both parties in Washington have called over the years for the Defense Department to find ways to save money.Options traders have priced in an approximately 3.3% ($9.52) stock move in either direction around the coming earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim platform.

4235434,104579,2019-01-24T16:45:44-05:00,"Lockheed Martin is trading off of its highs but has rebounded from recent lows.The company pays an attractive and growing dividend and continues to be a beneficiary of increased defense spending.For investors with a long term horizon, Lockheed Martin may be worth adding to the portfolio.","Photo SourceLockheed Martin (LMT) has been a beneficiary of the growing defense budgets of countries around the world. Being a premier manufacturer of planes, helicopters, missiles, and more, the company continues to see revenue rise in almost any economic environment. Due to defense being necessary and technology always evolving, the company has a stream of revenue that is as close to guaranteed as you can get. With shares trading off their highs, they have popped on to my radar. I have long waited to initiate a position in the company and would wait until the recent run up has a pullback again to begin. However, the shares are beginning to look enticing with a 3%+ yield.In the third quarter earnings report, Lockheed reported earnings that beat on both the top and bottom lines.Source: Seeking AlphaThe company saw revenue grow 16% and earnings grow 54.8%. This was due in part to tax reform along with the help from the top line growth. The company also raised its forecast for earnings per share of approximately $17.50 (from $16.75–$17.05), on net sales of about $53B up from $51.6B.-$53.1B. Cash from operations in the third quarter of 2018 was $361 million after pension contributions of $1.5 billion, compared to cash from operations of $1.8 billion in the third quarter of 2017, with no pension contributions. Seeing the pension being funded is always a positive as it prevents a future overhang of liability from becoming a problem.The company continued to grow its backlog to a now astounding $109 billion. Of course this could change, but given the non-cyclical nature of the business it is probably safe to say that the company has two years worth of revenue already in the pipeline. With continued growth in every division we can see why Lockheed shares continue to trade at a higher P/E multiple than other defense sector companies.Source: 10QStrong growth in every division should give investors confidence that the company is firing on all cylinders. It is not always the case that every division within a company will see harmonious growth, so seeing this is great. The space division should continue to see growth as the expansion of private sector space exploration and development will cause the need for manufactured components. Also the potential for a future military division for space ventures could help immensely.The company continues to improve its balance sheet as well.Source: 10QThe company reduced pension liabilities by about 1/3 in the last year, which is a huge improvement. While debt only saw a slight decline, it is not overwhelming considering the steady stream of cash Lockheed generates. As we saw earlier the company generated $361 million in cash for the quarter even after funding pension liabilities. This amount of cash generation and a stronger balance sheet will continue to let the company focus on future opportunities. With technological advances and competition continuing to heat up, the company needs to ensure it has premier products to win contracts with or else their R&D spend is a loss.The company expects there to be significant increases in its CH-53K deliveries in the coming years.Source: Investor PresentationThis will be a boost to future revenues and the potential for international sales will further more add to the demand.Perhaps the most exciting part about Lockheed's future is the growing need for replacement aircraft.Source: Investor PresentationWith many of the aircraft aging quickly and the needs from the military changing, the demand for new machines will only pick up. This is a positive long term trend for Lockheed Martin and inevitably its stock.Additionally, not only is offensive military spend important, a growing need for defensive equipment has become important.Source: Investor PresentationLockheed has no shortage of equipment and brilliantly as it continues to develop new offensive equipment capabilities it increased demand for defense. Lockheed has been working on laser technology, bringing what was long fiction to reality. As this happens, it by nature creates the need for defense systems that can withstand laser attacks. This will only continue to develop their portfolio of options and the need for defense against one more possible attack method.Knowing the growth for revenue is strong, it is only a matter of paying a fair price for the stock. While such tailwinds create a higher growth rate and thus higher valuation metrics, every now and then the market offers an opportunity that shouldn't be overlooked.Looking at valuation versus peers we see the following.Data by YChartsLockheed trades at the highest forward P/E ratio, but it is lower than the overall market multiple despite higher expected growth. The shares also offer the highest TTM yield and lowest PEG ratio. This means investors probably are getting a fair deal considering the better than expected growth but small premium assigned to future earnings.Looking at valuation metrics for the last 5 years we can see where shares should generally trade.Source: MorningstarThe shares trade slightly below their 5 year average P/S ratio but trade above their P/E ratio. Going forward it trades quite a bit below the average forward P/E and at a lower PEG ratio than we have seen. Given all the above information, it is safe to say that the stock isn't overvalued but isn't undervalued by much either. However, getting shares at such a low forward multiple now with guidance just raised may be a good deal. Investors can take advantage of the share price now and if it should pull back again maybe increase their position.Looking at historical yield to see if it is above average or below is one of my favorite methods to see if a stock is undervalued.Source: YieldChartThe average yield for LMT is 2.3%, with shares currently yielding 3.1% it is safe to say that shares represent a good value. In the last 24 years shares have only yielded above 3% about 28% of the time. The spike in the yield was during the last government administration when defense spending was due to be cut. However, that has since been increased and the government is pro defense. Additionally, the company has been raising its dividend for 17 years, with a recent increase of 10% to $2.20 per quarter or $8.80 annually. Continuing to grow the dividend in the future is a focus for management and there is plenty of room to do so with a payout ratio of less than 50%.Lockheed Martin offers investors the chance to benefit off the growing demand for defense needs by countries around the world. A growing population and new technologies will continue to grow the demand for a variety of products. Additionally, aging machines in the defense fleets around the world will create a need for continued replacement along with additions. This will benefit Lockheed Martin for many years to come and is evident by the large backlog already present. With the shares trading at a lower forward P/E than normal and yielding above average, now may be the time to start a position. The company faces little risk other than a lower defense budget from the United States, its largest customer, but it will be very hard to do this with nations around the world ramping up. If the shares pull back again from here, I will be starting a position. I am waiting due to the quick run back up from the market overall recently."
4228987,23998,2018-12-18T13:37:59-05:00,"Seeking Alpha contributor Paul Franke recently offered a bearish case against LMT, arguing it was overpriced, over-leveraged, and facing the possible headwind of declining military spending.In light of his warning, I present two ways bullish LMT longs can limit their risk while staying long.I also explain why I'm currently neutral on the stock.","The keel-laying ceremony for Littoral Combat Ship 19 (image via Lockheed Martin tweet.). That was the question Seeking Alpha contributor Paul Franke asked in a recent article about Lockheed Martin (LMT). His answer was, essentially, yes. It's worth reading his article in full, but, in a nutshell, Franke argued that LMT was overpriced, over-leveraged, and facing the possible headwind of declining military spending. Franke also pointed to the stock's poor momentum characteristics (though poor momentum characteristics have been fairly common in this market). If you're long Lockheed Martin, and still bullish on it, but want to limit your risk in the event Paul Franke's warning comes to pass, below, I present a couple of ways of doing that. Remember though: If you're bearish after reading Franke's article, you should sell your LMT shares. Hedging isn't for bears, but for cautious bulls. For these two examples, I'm going to assume you have 400 shares of LMT and are willing to tolerate a drawdown of as much as 20% over the next several months, but not one larger than that. The screen captures below are via the Portfolio Armor iPhone app. Uncapped Upside, Positive CostAs of Monday's close, these were the optimal or least expensive put options to protect 400 shares of LMT against a greater-than-20% drop by late June. The cost of this protection, as you can see above, was $2,480, or 2.22% of position value. Bear in mind that cost was calculated conservatively, using the ask price of the puts. In practice, you can often buy and sell options at some price between the bid and ask. Capped Upside, Negative CostIf you were willing to cap your possible upside at 14% over the same time frame, you could have the optimal collar below to protect against the same, greater-than-20% decline as with the previous hedge. In this case, the put leg uses the same strike as the first hedge, so the cost is the same $2,480, or 2.22% of position value, calculated at the ask. That cost is offset by the income generated from selling the call leg of $2,560, or 2.29% of position value (calculated conservatively, at the bid). So the net cost of this hedge was negative, meaning you would have collected a net credit of $80 when opening this hedge, assuming you placed both trades at the worst ends of their respective spreads. You may have noticed Seeking Alpha's new policy where contributors indicate whether they are very bullish, bullish, neutral, bearish, or very bearish on a focus stock. I have indicated that I'm neutral on Lockheed Martin, and here I'll explain why. Lockheed Martin passes my site's two screens to avoid bad investments, but it only barely passes the first of those two screens, as you can see in the image below. Screen capture via Portfolio Armor.The first of the two screens is for the mean of the most recent six-month return and the average six-month return over the last 10 years to be positive. That mean figure is shown in the ""6m Exp Return"" column, and as you can see, it's positive, but fractional. The second screen is that it be possible to hedge the security against a >9% decline over approximately the next six months with an optimal collar. LMT is hedgeable that way - in fact, it's also hedgeable against a >9% decline with optimal puts as well, which is only true of about 20% of the names that pass the first two screens. That said, the site estimates a potential return of less than 1% for LMT over the next six months. Based on that, my sentiment on the stock is neutral."

These guidelines are only used to filter companies to be considered in the portfolio. Some of the points brought out by the guidelines are shown below.The Good Business Portfolio Guidelines are just a screen to start with and not absolute rules. When I look at a company, the total return is a key parameter to see if it fits the objective of the portfolio. Lockheed Martin beat against the Dow baseline in my 60.0-month test compared to the Dow average. I chose the 60.0 month test period (starting January 1, 2014, and ending to date) because it includes the great year of 2017, and other years that had fair and bad performance. The great total return of 167.20% makes Lockheed Martin a great investment for the total return investor. Lockheed Martin has an above average dividend yield of 3.3% and has had increases for 17 years, making Lockheed Martin a good choice for the dividend income investor.

The good earnings and revenue growth looking forward provides LMT with the capability to continue its growth as the defense business increases, and foreign sales are expanded.The graphic below shows the 2018 sales projection by major product lines.Source: Earnings call slidesThe Fed has kept interest rates low for some years, and on December 19, 2018, they raised the base rate 0.25%, which was expected. I believe that they will go slow next year, which should help keep the economy on a growth path. If infrastructure spending can be increased, this will even increase the United States growth going forward with better economics for the consumer. The Fed lowered GDP projection for next year which may mean they are getting to neutral on the economy, projecting two rate increases for 2019. The recent volatility may keep the Fed on hold. Recently, the Fed Chairman made a statement which was dovish and the market went up strongly.From October 23, 2018, earnings release Marillyn Hewson (Chief Executive Officer, President, and Chairman) said:This shows the feelings of top management for the continued growth of the Lockheed Martin business and shareholder return with an increase in future growth. LMT has good constant growth and will continue as the world military budgets grow.The graphic below shows the 2018 guidance for Lockheed Martin.Source: Earnings call slidesLockheed Martin is a good investment choice for the total return and income investor with its good projected growth as worldwide defense budgets increase and the company buys back shares. Lockheed Martin will be considered for The Good Business Portfolio to increase the group of growth companies. LMT gets a bit of an edge over other defense companies because it has a strong income and better growth prospects. If you want a steady growing total return and income, in the growing defense business LMT may be the right investment for you.I intend to watch the earnings reports for the companies in the portfolio and may finally decide to trim my high flyers that are over 8% of the portfolio so I can invest in good companies on my buy list.The Good Business Portfolio trims a position when it gets above 8% of the portfolio. The four top companies in the portfolio are Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is 8.8% of the portfolio, Omega Health Investors is 8.7% of the portfolio, Home Depot is 8.9% of the portfolio, and Boeing (NYSE:BA) is 13.2% of the portfolio. Therefore BA, OHI, JNJ, and HD are now in trim position, but I am letting them run a bit since they are great companies.Boeing is going to be pressed to 14% of the portfolio because of it being cash positive on 787 deferred plane costs at $316 Million in the first quarter of 2017, an increase from the fourth quarter. The second quarter saw deferred costs on the 787 go down $530 Million a big jump from the first quarter. The second quarter of 2017 earnings was fantastic with Boeing beating the estimate by $0.25 at $2.55. The third quarter of 2017 earnings were $2.72 beating the expected by$0.06 with revenue increasing 1.7% over last year, another good report. The first quarter earnings for 2018 were unbelievable at $3.64 compared too expected at $2.64. Farnborough Air Show sales in dollar value just beat out Airbus (OTCPK:EADSY) by about $6 Billion, and both companies had a great number of orders. The second quarter earnings beat expectations by $0.06 at $3.33, but a good report was hurt by a write off expense on the KC-46 which should start delivery in 2019. Boeing received an order for 18 more KC-46A planes. As a result of the good third-quarter earnings, S&P CFRA raised the one-year price target to $ 450 for a possible 37% upside potential.JNJ will be pressed to 9% of the portfolio because it's so defensive in this post-BREXIT world. Earnings in the last quarter beat on the top and bottom line and Mr. Market did like it. JNJ has announced a dividend increase to $0.90/Qtr, which is 56 years in a row of increases. JNJ is not a trading stock but a hold forever; it is now a strong buy as the healthcare sector remains under pressure.For the total Good Business Portfolio, please see my article on The Good Business Portfolio: 2018 3rd Quarter Earnings and Performance Review for the complete portfolio list and performance.

U.S. defense spending reached $590 billion in fiscal year 2017 and grew to $686 billion in fiscal year 2018. In late September, Congress passed and the president signed a Defense Budget of $716 billion for fiscal year 2019.In addition to higher capital allocations on defense, the world is far from a safe place. While President Trump has stated on occasion that North Korea is no longer a nuclear threat, U.S. intelligence believes that the country has expanded its long-range missile bases. U.S. intelligence also believes that ISIS remains a threat in Syria. These types of “hot spots,” along with others around the world, mean that defense spending is likely to increase in the coming years.One of our favorite names in the defense sector and a company we feel that is poised to capitalize on increased defense spending is Lockheed Martin (LMT).Lockheed Martin formed when Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta merged in 1995. Today, the company is the largest defense company in the world. Lockheed Martin receives 60% of revenues from the U.S. Department. The remainder of the company’s revenues are split almost equally between other U.S. government agencies and international clients.Lockheed Martin is composed of four divisions: Aeronautics, which produces fighter aircraft such as the F-35; Rotary & Mission Systems, which produces combat ships, naval electronics and Sikorsky helicopters; Missiles & Fire Control, which houses missile defense systemsl; and Space Systems, which produces satellites.Lockheed Martin reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 on January 29th.Source: Lockheed Martin’s 4th Quarter and Full Year 2018 Presentation, page 6.Lockheed Martin’s earnings-per-share, or EPS, for the fourth quarter totaled $4.39, which was $0.01 above consensus estimates and a 2% improvement from the previous year. Revenue increased more than 4% to $14.4 billion, beating estimates by $670 million. For the year, EPS was $17.59, $0.09 above Lockheed Martin’s midpoint for guidance. This result was a 32% increase from 2017. Revenue grew 6% year-over-year to $54 billion. Lockheed Martin finished the year with a backlog of $130.5 billion, a 24% improvement from 2017.Lockheed Martin generated $3.1 billion in cash from operations. This is after the company made a $5 billion pension contribution. The company returned $3.8 billion to shareholders during 2018 in the form of dividends ($2.3 billion) and share repurchases ($1.5 billion). Share repurchase accelerated during the fourth quarter as the company took advantage of a decrease in share price. More than 40% of total share repurchases for 2018 occurred during the fourth quarter of the year.Sales for Lockheed Martin’s Aeronautics division grew 4% in the fourth quarter and 9% for the full year. Much of this growth was due to increased demand for the company’s F-35 program. The company delivered 91 F-35 aircraft in 2018, 25 more than in 2017. 30% of deliveries were made to U.S. allies. Lockheed Martin has a backlog of nearly 400 F-35s as several large orders were placed during the quarter. Updates for the F-16 program also contributed to sales growth.Missiles & Fire Control revenues improved 22% for the quarter and 16% for 2018. This segment of Lockheed Martin posted the highest growth rate in the company. The company saw higher sales volumes for its tactical and strike missiles and sensors programs. Orders for the PAC-3 interceptor totaled more than 450 due to separate orders from the U.S. army and foreign allied nations.Sales for Rotary & Mission Systems were lower by 4% for the quarter, but up 4% for the year. Integrated warfare systems and sensors were the primary driver of growth in this division. The Sikorsky program also experienced higher demand. The Royal Canadian Navy selected Lockheed Martin to begin design work for the future fleet of combat ships.Space revenues increased 2% for both the quarter and year. Demand for commercial and government satellites increased during the second half of 2018. The company’s InSight Mars Lander touched down on Mars on November 26th and will study the interior of the planet as it tries to gain a better understanding of the planet’s geologic evolution.Lockheed Martin provided its initial guidance for 2019 on the conference call.Source: Lockheed Martin’s 4th Quarter and Full Year 2018 Presentation, page 9.The company has a midpoint for EPS of $19.30 for the current year. Revenue is expected to be $56.5 billion. If achieved in 2019, these midpoints would represent growth of 9.7% for EPS and 4.6% for revenue.Lockheed Martin has grown EPS at a rate of 5.4% over the past decade. We feel that the company is likely to outperform this growth rate over the next five years as defense spending is on the rise. We target an EPS growth rate of 6% through 2024.Lockheed Martin has increased its dividend for the past 16 years. As a result, Lockheed Martin is a Dividend Achiever.The company has raised its dividend:The company recently raised its dividend by 10% for the payment made to shareholders in late December. Investors have been able to count on double digit dividend increases in recent years. Shares currently yield 3%, which is well above the 2% yield of the S&P 500.While the growth rates have declined slightly over time, increases will likely continue to occur as Lockheed Martin has a very low payout ratio. The company paid out $8.20 in dividends for 2018. Based off of the company’s full year EPS result, the payout ratio was just 46.6% for 2018.Lockheed Martin will likely pay at least $8.80 dividends-per-share in 2019. I say ""at least"" because the company usually raises its dividend for the final payment of the calendar year. Based off of forward guidance of $19.30, the dividend payout ratio is just 45.6%. For reference, Lockheed Martin has a five and 10-year average payout ratio of 53.3% and 44.7%, respectively. So both 2018 and 2019’s payout ratios are near the low end of the company’s historical averages.Shares of Lockheed Martin closed on Friday at a price of $291. Using the company’s forward guidance for 2019, the stock has a price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E, of 15.1. While the stock has a 10-year average P/E of 15, we have a target valuation of 16x earnings due to the increase in defense spending that is taking place in the U.S. and around the world. If shares were to expand to our target P/E by 2024, shareholders of Lockheed Martin would see an additional 1.7% added to total returns per year.We expect Lockheed Martin to offer a total annual return of 10.7% through 2024. We arrive at this estimate by combing expected earnings growth of 6%, dividend yield of 3% and multiple expansion of 1.7%.Increases in defense spending means that companies in the defense sector will likely see growth. As the world’s largest defense contractor, Lockheed Martin is likely to see solid growth in the coming years.Lockheed Martin has given investors robust dividend growth over the past decade. With higher expected revenues and earnings, investors can likely expect more of the same.The company’s recent results show that products and services are in high demand in both the U.S. and around the world. We feel that Lockheed Martin offers a solid combination of earnings growth, dividend yield and multiple expansion."
4235548,104543,2019-01-25T03:53:07-05:00,"Share price has a CAGR of 15% since 1980.Operates in a ""stable"" industry with less disruptive forces than other industries, typical of ""sin"" stocks.Socially responsible investments (SRI) are rising, which might lower the valuation multiples.But all in all I expect a long-term return close to the historical 15%.","My investment horizon is at least a decade, preferably as a forever investment. Hence, my analysis is based on this view and I focus on its moat, not for example how many F-35 it can sell the next quarter or year(s).Lockheed Martin (LMT) has been a terrific investment with 15% CAGR since 1980 and has never showed a negative 10-year rolling return. It's a ""sin"" stock and operates in a stable industry and has a wide moat.The dividend is safe and has room to grow, but the balance sheet is close to max at 1.9x EBITDA.All in all, I think Lockheed Martin is a good long-term investment below a share price of $300.Let’s start with some background on the company and its business:Lockheed Martin is the world’s biggest defense contractor, and has four business divisions:In 2017, the sales and operating profit were like this:Source: Note 5 of the annual report of 2017.Clearly, The Rotary Division is the most capital-intensive and least profitable in terms of margins.Almost 70% of the sales come from the US Government, and the rest is international sales (just a small fraction comes from US commercial and other). So far it seems management has overdelivered on international sales. Just 5 years ago, only 17% of revenue was outside the US and the goal was 25% within 2017.I assume we can safely put Lockheed Martin in the “sin” category of the stock market. Tobacco, alcohol, gambling, adult entertainment, arm producers and defense contractors are labelled as “sin.” Historically, this group has massively outperformed the overall market, as explained in this report from Credit Suisse (CS).Socially Responsible Investments (SRI) are on the rise and “sin” stocks are vulnerable for investment exclusions, including Lockheed Martin. For example, The Government Pension Fund of Norway (900 billion in AUM) has decided to exclude Lockheed Martin from investments because of its nuclear weapons production. (But apparently this does not apply to Norway's Ministry of Defence, which has ordered 52 F-35 from this “unethical” business.) Disclosure: I'm a citizen of Norway.The long-term chart of LMT clearly shows it has created an enormous wealth for the shareholders (1980-today):Source: Yahoo Finance!, including dividends. Logarithmic scale is used to show percentage moves.10 000 invested in January 1993 would have been worth 338 000 at the end of 2018, compared to 97 000 for SPY. 10 000 invested in 1980 is now worth 2.1 million.Over a ten-year period since 1980 it has never produced negative returns. The lowest annual ten-year return was 4% in May 2012 (May 2002 to May 2012). In May 2012, Lockheed Martin was priced at its lowest valuation for decades, and this was the bottom of a massive move until 2018.Even a shorter rolling five-year return is rarely negative:Source: My own calculations.Lockheed Martin has been a very good buy on “dips.” The scatter plot below indicates the pretty strong inverse relationship between a five-year performance and the next five-year performance:Source: My own calculations.The line in the graph is a simplistic “best fit” regression. As we can see, low five-year returns on the x-axis are followed by much higher five-year returns on the y-axis (and vice versa). Current five-year performance is about 115%, and the best fit regression indicates we can expect about the same return the next five years, which equals its historical performance of 15% per year.Both EPS and cash flow have risen, which of course is to be expected with such a rise in the share price:Source: Morningstar and annual reports.Cash conversion ratio stands at 8% (from every dollar in sales eight cents end up as free cash flow). CAPEX to sales is a low 2%. In addition to CAPEX, the company has huge investments into R&D which is booked as an expense (cost of sales), according to note 1 in the annual report. But in reality R&D is a form of CAPEX. R&D for 2017 was $1.2 billion and $1 billion in 2016, more or less the same amount as CAPEX. Based on this, we can argue capital intensity is medium.Since 2008 the backlog has risen from $80.9 billion to $109 billion at the end of 3rd quarter 2018. Relative to revenue the backlog has increased somewhat:Source: My own calculations using data from annual reports.Looking at the monthly returns during a year (12 observations), correlation with S&P 500 is on average 0.31 since 1993. That is lower than the average stock, and indicates it may serve as a little bit of diversification, albeit small.Is Lockheed Martin a recession-proof stock? In both 2001 and 2002 the share price went up, although EPS in 2001 was a negative 2.42. In 2002 EPS was 1.11. At the end of September 2008 the share price was at $110, but a low of 58 in March 2009 meant a drop of 47%, more or less in line with S&P 500. However, both EPS and cash flow increased in 2008, but went down in 2009.Worth noting is that defense spending seems little correlated with the overall economy, both in the US and worldwide. Numbers from Stockholm International Peace Research Institute indicates US spending increased in both recessions in 2001/2002 and 2008/2009:Source: Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.U.S. military expenditures dwarf all others, and are roughly the size of the next six largest military budgets around the world, combined. Even the revenue of Lockheed Martin is bigger than the defense budget of France, and the cash returned to shareholders in 2017 is 85% of the defense budget of Norway.As the defense market very much works as an oligopoly, it might be interesting to know if Lockheed Martin is taking a bigger or smaller piece of the pie. By looking at the revenue and comparing it to the overall US defense spending, we get this graph (international sales are not excluded):Source: My own calculations.It has been quite steady between 8.6% and the latest 9.9%.Lockheed Martin's terrific historical returns are no coincidence. The share price will of course move a lot due to short-term noise, but over the long term, its wide moat makes it very likely a terrific long-term investment:As with any investment there are a lot of potential risks. I will briefly comment what I believe to be the biggest:A low oil price is bad. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states are one of the biggest international customers, and their budget is of course heavily dependent on the price of oil. International sales has grown from 17% in 2014 to 30% in 2017.Most of the contracts with any government are fixed. Any overruns have to be covered by the contractor, thus affecting earnings. For example, at the end of the 1990’s Lockheed had several problems, as can be seen from the EPS. The stock went from a high of 58 in February 1998 to a bottom of 16.5 in March 2000, a spectacular 71% decline. The dividend was cut in half in 2000 (see more below) when cash flow suffered after satellite foul-ups and failure to land big contracts. At about the same time the proposed merger with Northrop Grumman (NOC) was put to rest after the Government objected.And of course the much debated US budget deficit is a cause for concern. Mandatory social security spending is 62% and is next to impossible to cut. Interest to serve the debt is 8% and can’t be cut, unless the US want to default and that’s not going to happen. The so-called “discretionary spending” is 30%, and defense spending is within this group, representing a solid 70% of this group. Thus any significant cuts in federal spending could well happen in the defense sector.The defense industry is heavily influenced by politics, and seemingly small incidents can escalate. For example, the killing of journalist and activist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul in October 2018, which created (and still does) strain on diplomatic relationships. The arms industry has always been a bit ""dirty.""Another issue is pension liabilities. According to Forbes, Lockheed Martin has underfunded this with 17.7 billion. If this is correct, this will for some years ahead put a strain on their profitability, but in my opinion not alter the long-term prospects.Historically, defense contractors have operated in a stable business environment. But with the growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI), governments might shift to smaller or other nontraditional suppliers.Lockheed Martin is a very shareholder-friendly company as it returns most of its free cash flow. At present, the dividend yield is about 2.85%.Source: Lockheed Martins’s website.The dividend was lowered in 2000 and kept at the same level until 2003. Since 2003 CAGR has been 19%. This growth is of course not sustainable forever as growth is higher than growth in earnings and cash flow. We can expect growth to fall closer to 8-12%, in my opinion. Payout has gradually increased, but well below any alarming levels:Source: Morningstar.Over the last ten years management has spent more on buybacks than dividends:Source: Morningstar.Outstanding shares have dropped from 409 million in 2008 to 288 million today, a 30% drop.There is currently ample funds to continue buybacks, deleverage or increase the dividend:Source: Morningstar.The company has a rather weak balance sheet. Long-term debt has increased significantly since 2008: from 3.5 billion to 14 billion, and shareholder’s equity has been hovering around zero since 2012.The company has always financed operations with long-term debt:Source: Morningstar and annual reports.At the end of the 90s, the debt ratio was higher than now.Current long-term debt to EBITDA is around 1.9. That is not alarming, but my personal preference is less than 2x, depending on the underlying business. Lockheed Martin has no problem serving the debt, but financial flexibility decreases above 2x. The spike in 2015 is because of the Sikorsky deal, mainly financed by debt.Lockheed's operations, which require a great deal of long-term development and R&D (sometimes for many years, even decades, like F-35 for example), mean high debt could be a potential problem if not addressed. Look what happened in 1998-2000. If they run into problems in any future developments, they would need more money. In all likelihood that means borrowing. Thus, personally I would prefer they deleveraged a little and cut back on buybacks.As of September 2018 goodwill was 10.8 billion, almost 24% of the assets. Goodwill is very often a questionable asset, in my opinion.Last guidance back in October 2018 was a full year EPS of $17.5, a P/E of about 16 at today's price. That is not excessive by any means, but still a bit on the high side historically:LMT EV to EBITDA (TTM) data by YChartsThe EV/EBITDA ratio has been below 12 for the most part.As briefly mentioned earlier in the article, it is likely that socially responsible investments continue to increase, which might lead to a lower valuation. However, a lower valuation is not necessarily bad as they can retire more shares.Based on the historical valuation I would not pay more than the current price of 280-290. But again, if your holding period is at least a decade, I would not worry so much about the purchase price.(Lockheed Martin reports earnings on 29th of January before market open.)Let me summarize:Pros:Cons:All in all, I believe the wide moat and its stable industry make sure it will be a highly profitable company in the future. As always, disruptive forces can make an impact, but I believe less so compared to other industries outside the ""sin"" sphere. I expect 12-15% CAGR on my investment. However, I'm reluctant to add to my holdings if the price goes above $300."
4228825,56142,2018-12-17T17:34:27-05:00,"U.S. military spending growth may have reached a high point.Price and volume momentum trading trends in November-December point to extended Lockheed underperformance of the market for 2019.The stock valuation is quite stretched using simple historical ratio analysis.The company holds excessive financial leverage, much greater than just before the last recession.","Lockheed Martin (LMT) is richly priced, overleveraged, and could be on the verge of witnessing a large drop in government outlays for military equipment. The maker of fighter jets, ships, helicopters, drones, satellites, missiles and more has skidded into a rough patch on Wall Street this year. Over the last six weeks of trading, Lockheed’s 200-day moving average has turned down for the first time since the 2011 U.S. government budget battle/agreement holding military spending in check for years. Investors should be concerned about the Lockheed Martin long-term ownership thesis. I personally shorted shares last week.Lockheed Martin has been one of the weakest stock performers in the defense related manufacturing industry during 2018. Below are some relative performance charts versus large capitalization peers Boeing (BA), Honeywell (HON), Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raytheon (RTN), General Dynamics(GD) and the overall market S&P 500 index the last several years.Defense spending may be about to reverse its high growth rate the first two years of the Trump administration. Trump mentioned in a Tweet on December 3rd, U.S. defense spending of better than $700 billion annually was “crazy” high, inferring he would look to cut spending in coming years.Then add to the equation, anti-war spending Democrats will take over the House of Representatives in a few days on January 3, 2019. The Constitutionally empowered House is directly responsible for government spending and budgeting. They may join forces with President Trump to roll back defense dollars and help reduce our chronic sovereign deficit problem. Lacking agreement in 2019 to cut social program spending and large outlays for the military, the U.S. is likely headed for another credit agency downgrade of Treasury debt similar to the 2011 Standard & Poor’s cut from AAA to AA+.If the economy slows in the first half of 2019 from higher interest rates during 2018 and boiling over trade frictions with China and Europe, the U.S. fiscal deficit may balloon out of control soon, no matter how Washington decides to change spending. Well beyond the rosy 2018 Congressional Budget Office [CBO] forecasts for future years, a recession in 2019 or 2020 could prove a death blow for those wanting to continue Keynesian fiscal “spending” our way to prosperity. For the first time since the early 1930s Depression years, the credible threat of Treasury debt downgrades could force Uncle Sam to slash spending and raise taxes DURING a recession!The CBO’s April 2018 forecasts have already proven overly optimistic in the second half of the year, as monthly stats on the deficit have steadily grown past expectations. Here’s an excerpt from the April forecast, which is looking like a best-case scenario today,If operating business sales, margins, earnings and cash flows peak in 2019, what is the valuation backstop for Lockheed? Well, not good, if you take a long-term view of things. A 10-year cyclically adjusted [CAPE] breakdown of the stock price vs. underlying business results screams investors should avoid this equity. With a 10-year average stock quote to trailing sales per share of 1.0x, today’s 1.6x number is stubbornly high. Comparing this number to the 2009-2012 Great Recession and U.S. budget restraint period valuation of 0.5 to 0.7x sales, Lockheed’s price looks to have considerable downside if military spending turns lower in coming years.The past decade's average price to cash flow number is just over 10x. Today’s nearly 14x reading is nicely above its long-term average, and significantly greater than the low of 6x during 2010-11. The price to earnings ratio is also stretched. The current 17x price on earnings per share is above the 10-year average of 14x, and about double the 8x number of 2011.The most worrisome part of the Lockheed Martin investment proposition, in my mind, is its excessive financial leverage and negative tangible book value. You can review the latest quarterly balance sheet, cash flow statement and earnings release filed with the SEC here. With little net equity (book value) and a “negative” tangible book value, the company requires rising orders and revenues yearly to cover ever increasing borrowing costs, pension costs, labor costs, and common stock dividend payouts, before it can substantially REPAY $45 billion in total IOUs, debts and liabilities. In other words, if military spending turns down in the U.S., Lockheed’s financial position could become a huge drag on shareholder worth. In a major recession scenario, a government slash of Lockheed sales could translate into exceptionally problematic cash flows, flat or negative earnings and a huge dividend cut in quick order.Don’t say it cannot happen. I have been writing bearish stories regarding the perils of excessive leverage on General Electric (GE), Kraft Heinz (KHC), International Business Machines (IBM) AT&T (T), Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) and others the past few years on Seeking Alpha. Lockheed Martin may be flying into the same harsh winds of economic change as the biggest Wall Street losers of 2017-18.My Victory Formation computer sorting system has pinpointed weak momentum characteristics in Lockheed Martin since early 2018. It is becoming clearer by the day, U.S. defense spending may peak in calendar 2019, as the political chess pieces move around and the economic outlook weakens. Our precarious deficit and debt problems have not been front and center news for years, but economic realities are about to catch up to America and Wall Street alike, I fear.The company’s debt and leverage position is materially worse than 2007-08, just before the last recession. Back then a solid tangible book value, and total debt one-quarter today’s count per share did not prevent a 50%+ stock drop into 2009. The Lockheed stock price did little positive until 2012.Lockheed is quite overvalued if business prospects slow. All told, I can argue this equity is only worth $150 a share under normal economic circumstances, not the present $288 quote. Given a recession, and major cutbacks in military spending, no logical reason exists for Lockheed to trade above $200 a share. A large dividend cut and asset sales to reduce debt and leverage are real possibilities in late 2019 or 2020. Forward looking investors may be wise to avoid or sell Lockheed shares in December 2018.With weak stock trading momentum, a weakening operating outlook, weak valuation arguments and a weak balance sheet in combination, I have decided to short shares of Lockheed Martin. I strongly suggest investors new to short selling consult an experienced and registered investment advisor.

4226486,104097,2018-12-05T13:38:51-05:00,"General Electric's over-leveraged financial position has already been discussed in detail and is widely acknowledged as a core problem.This serves as a warning sign to investors in other companies also sporting a highly leverage financial position.When examining Lockheed Martin's balance sheet it's clear they're highly leveraged.Whilst on the surface this appears concerning, I believe their financial position is manageable and they will not share the same fate.","Even though there are several factors behind General Electric’s (GE) collapsing share price, their highly leveraged financial position is arguably the most important. Naturally this serves as a warning sign to investors in other companies also sporting this characteristic, and whilst there are several candidates, in this article I will focus on Lockheed Martin (LMT). Although on the surface there appears to be reasons for concern, after comparing their individual situations I believe Lockheed Martin is unlikely to be the next General Electric. Whilst this article focuses on Lockheed Martin, the same principles can be applied to virtually all other companies.Although General Electric is highly leveraged with a debt to equity ratio standing at 5.5, it’s still eclipsed by Lockheed Martin’s massive debt to equity ratio of 44.4. Whilst this indicates Lockheed Martin is technically much higher leveraged than General Electric, it doesn’t assess whether this leverage is manageable or whether they’re heading down the same dangerous path.To assess whether their leverage is manageable it requires a comparison to their earnings - after all, your debt is only sustainable if your earnings are high enough, regardless of whether you’re a household, company or government. This is when it starts becoming clear that Lockheed Martin’s situation is considerably stronger than General Electric's, despite their higher leverage.Currently General Electric’s net debt stands at $85.334b, giving them an uncomfortably high net debt to EBITDA ratio of 5.75, which is more suitable for a non-cyclical pipeline or utility company than a cyclical industrial company. Lockheed Martin’s net debt is currently sitting at $13.829b, giving them a manageable net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.82. When reviewing their interest coverage ratio of 9.76, it’s apparent Lockheed Martin’s debt is considerably easier to service than General Electric’s, whose ratio is sitting at a razor thin 1.26.Whilst these ratios assess their ability to manage their financial interest bearing debt, both companies have other significant liabilities, such as unfunded pensions. Although it’s important to monitor these, their ability to service their financial interest bearing debt is considerably more important. Providing their financial interest bearing debt remains manageable, they should be able to retain the flexibility to access debt markets to fund their other liabilities if required. These other liabilities, such as unfunded pensions, only become a serious problem when the company’s financial interest bearing debt is too high, like General Electric. Imagine if their net debt was a mere fraction of its current level, would their unfunded pension liabilities receive much attention? I highly doubt it. They’re in an undesirable position where they cannot materially increase their financial interest bearing debt, whilst at the same time still having to manage other large liabilities.Even though these quantitative factors analyze their current situation, they say little about the future, which is ultimately more important. After all, if Lockheed Martin’s ability to sustain their leverage hinges on their earnings, if these were to collapse similarly to General Electric, then their leverage would likely be unmanageable as well. Whilst it’s technically possible for this to occur as the future is unknown, there are several reasons why it’s unlikely.General Electric is highly susceptible to changes in global macroeconomic conditions, but the same cannot be said for Lockheed Martin. This difference stems from their products and ultimately their customers. Whilst General Electric has a wide array of mainly corporate customers, the vast majority of Lockheed Martin’s are federal governments, in particular the United States government. This means their sales are almost entirely tied to the United States government’s military spending, which can be independent of the underlying macroeconomic conditions. To provide an example, during the 2008 financial crisis their revenue only declined by the low single digits, see below.LMT Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsEven though military spending could be reduced in the years ahead, this doesn’t appear likely whilst President Trump occupies the White House. Whether he remains President after the 2020 elections is unknown, but even if the Democrats retake the White House, I doubt military spending will be reduced significantly enough to materially affect Lockheed Martin. Although the left and right political spectrums often struggle to find common ground, countering China’s rising military power seems to be receiving increasing bipartisan support. Considering Lockheed Martin’s programs span land, sea, air and space, they’re well positioned to support the United States military across all arenas and minimize the risk of budget changes.Finally, Lockheed Martin has a considerably cleaner and simplified operating structure, whereas GE Capital often seemingly a black box periodically throwing out impairments and so forth. Aside from making it more difficult to value General Electric, it also makes it more difficult for management to execute their strategies and hinders earnings potential.If there is one important lesson and takeaway from this comparison, it’s on the perils of simply comparing financial metrics such as debt to equity ratios without adequately understanding the underlying company. This is the primary reason I seldom use any of the automated investment filters often featured within online brokerage accounts. If an investor were to use these filters without an adequate understanding of the underlying company, they may incorrectly conclude Lockheed Martin is cripplingly over-leveraged.Even though the potential for the United States government to reduce military spending always remains a risk, considering the bipartisan support for countering China’s rapid rise I’m skeptical this will eventuate to a meaningful extent. This indicates their large long-term programs should remain adequately funded well into the future and the breadth of their capabilities provides ample opportunities to continue winning additional contracts. Wrapping this together means their earnings should remain resilient and continue growing, thus easily supporting their financial interest bearing debt as well as various other liabilities. Therefore, despite being technically more leveraged than General Electric, I’m confident they’re not going to share the same fate.Notes: Unless specified otherwise, all figures in this article were taken from Lockheed Martin’s 2018 Q3 10Q report and General Electric’s 2018 Q3 10Q report, all calculated figures were performed by the author."
4227770,50291,2018-12-17T09:17:00-05:00,"Aerospace industry has a long-term focus.Continued trade tension will cool economy at an increasing rate, impacting global trade and travel demand.Aerospace sales could be the solution to decreasing the trade deficit with China.Despite little love, aircraft lessors have appreciable scaling opportunities.","Given concerns about the economy, oil prices and trade war fears, should investors steer clear of the aerospace industry? Or does the business, not only the big players but also smaller ones, present a long-term opportunity? Dhierin-Perkash Bechai has been covering the aerospace industry on Seeking Alpha for well over five years, combining his knowledge about the aerospace industry, which is his field of expertise, with his ability to analyze ""the numbers."" Dhierin's work is a mix of covering news events, earnings reports, product launches and performance comparisons and market outlooks, aiming to provide in-depth coverage of the aerospace industry exclusively on Seeking Alpha, to give readers the tools to better analyze investing opportunities. His articles often are not styled as an ""I would buy this at X and sell at Y,"" but function as puzzle pieces for investors to complete their own ""due diligence jigsaw puzzle"" that create an image with which investors can make proper investment decisions, or at least get a better understanding of the dynamics that are involved. Ultimately, it's his goal to make an incredibly complex and big industry understandable for people who are interested in investing in the industry.(Q): With markets in general displaying a lot of volatility, and given concerns regarding a possible economic slowdown, should investors steer clear of the aviation and aerospace sector? Or is aerospace investing a much longer-term game?(A): I think that the aerospace industry is one of the most rewarding industries to invest in due to its long-term horizon as long as you are able to understand the products and competitive strengths of these companies and distinguish long-term weakness from short-term weakness. Currently, we're seeing a lot of tension that causes volatility, and that's something that can be expected when high-level politics is played with a very binary view. At the same time, markets have done quite well in 2017 and are slightly in the red for 2018. So, it's bumpy right especially in 2018, but the markets aren't tanking as much as media headlines would suggest.Currently, trade and jobs are a hot topic, and that can impact the aerospace industry. The aerospace industry is one with a very long-term view: Product development takes roughly five years, if not more, production lines run for years, if not decades, aircraft stay in service for 25-30 years, and market forecasts are made for 20 years. So, everything about this industry focuses on the long term. That doesn't mean that if the economy slows down that the aerospace industry won't feel the pain, but the long-term view for this industry in combination with the thousands of aircraft in backlog makes the industry more resistant than many others and makes me feel comfortable investing in this industry.(Q): What could go wrong for aviation in 2019 and beyond? The challenges?(A): There are a few things that could go wrong for the aerospace industry. You could bring it down to five main items, namely economic slowdown, low oil prices, budget challenges and inefficient growth in emerging markets.Source: Kelowna Capital NewsEconomic slowdown would likely mean that less goods will be shipped, so that would put pressure on the air cargo market, which is a market that took a long time to recover. On top of that, business-related travel and leisure travel could decrease as well. It will take a lot for the economy to slow down rapidly, but we think one of the dangers is that there's an obsessive focus on bringing jobs to the US and evening trade that the economy could start suffering increasingly from President Trump's mission to bring jobs to the US, or putting it differently: If that focus remains in place at the cost of economic stability, jobs in the US might be eliminated rather than being brought back to the US.Source: oilprice.comLow oil prices are considered to be a good thing by many, including the president. For oil and gas companies they aren't, nor are they for jet makers. At some point, former Boeing (BA) CEO McNerney said that lower oil prices would lead to lower bills for people around the world which they could spend on flying. In that same thought pattern, flying would become cheaper. Reality is that low oil prices haven't resulted in flying becoming cheaper. Airlines have used it to lower their fuel bills and reduce capex, since the core value proposition of new aircraft is fuel efficiency. That fuel efficiency comes at a price, and if fuel prices head lower, the need for replacing new aircraft reduces. At the same time, you can't keep flying planes indefinitely because older planes require more maintenance. We do understand that airlines have reduced capex because the negative consequence of low oil prices is that the premium travel classes that are normally filled by business travelers, including those from the oil and gas industries remain empty, but also recognize that airlines tend to focus more on increasing profits than to make flying more affordable when fuel prices are low.Source: San Diego Regional Economic Development CorporationThe defense industry has enjoyed expanding US defense budgets and continued defense budget expansion. The big question, however, is that if tax rates including corporate taxes have come down, how those budgets can be sustained and grown in the future, especially if there are more and more worries about economic slowdown. On top of that, the Democrats have the upper hand in the House now, and we don't expect them to give President Trump what he wants. So, we have yet to see where the money to expand defense budgets comes from and whether there's enough support for it. Currently, there are big mission readiness problems with the Air Force, and in case defense budgets can't be grown to desired levels, it's likely that the focus will be on supporting current equipment rather than procurement.Source: The Boeing CompanyIndia has a huge population of young people and a growing middle class, and so for airlines, there are huge opportunities there. However, with the hundreds of aircraft on order, we feel like there's a huge battle going on between Indian carriers that focus too much on winning market share rather than translating market opportunity into financial success. What this means is that the financial position of Indian airlines could weaken while they do have orders and financial commitments with lessors and jet makers valued in billions of dollars.(Q): Likewise, what could go right? The opportunities?(A): One of the things that could go wrong is also one of the elements that could unlock a run-up in shares of commercial aircraft manufacturers. China is one of the biggest customers for commercial aircraft, and with trade tensions, there have been suggestions that China would put tariffs on Boeing commercial aircraft. It shouldn't come as surprise that will lead to pressure on Boeing's share prices. We think that China won't be too eager to subject commercial aircraft as a whole to tariffs, since they do need the aircraft and part of the supply chain for aircraft and even assembly is positioned in China. On top of that, if the US and China reach an agreement, the aerospace sector is one where big steps could be made. China needs aircraft, and the US aerospace industry has a trade surplus with China. So, with aircraft costing millions and the current demand profile, the aerospace industry could play a key role in reducing the US-China trade deficit.(Q): What key themes should investors watch among the aviation giants? Is it narrow body vs. wide body? The opportunity presented by discount airlines vs. more traditional airlines? Emerging markets potential vs. more mature markets?(A): I am particularly interested in seeing whether some slow selling widebody aircraft start appealing more. Airbus (OTCPK:EADSF) has been relying on replacement of older Airbus A330 aircraft starting in 2020, and with lead times in mind, it would be interesting to see whether that translates to increased order inflow for the Airbus A330neo and Airbus A350. Currently, Boeing is in a good spot it seems when it comes to wide body aircraft orders, but we'd want to see how their order inflow holds when Airbus also starts booking more successes in the wide body arena because, currently, we have the impression that Boeing is easily booking more orders than Airbus due to a combination of delays on the A320neo/A330neo program and Airbus' crippled sales department, and on top of that comes a thorough management reshuffle for the European jet maker. In the end, narrow body orders are nice, but we want to see whether robust demand exists where Boeing and Airbus both can book a significant number of wide body orders.For the narrow body programs, what we're interested in is the recovery profile and possible further decisions to increase single-aisle production. In 2018, the delivery flow to tier 1 suppliers was choked, resulting in delivery delays to airlines and lessors. In 2019, I hope to see a smooth delivery flow with smooth increases in production as planned. Currently, I'm not anticipating an announcement of new increases in production rate beyond the ones already planned, but if it happens, that would be an incredibly bullish sign.In 2018, we saw Primera Air going bankrupt and financial problems for Indian Jet Airways and Icelandic WOW Air. What we saw is that these airlines depend on external financing, and if there is delay in securing that financing, in combination with an uptick in oil prices, things suddenly start becoming threatening to the existence of these companies. It will be interesting to see how low-cost carriers are dealing with fluctuating business in 2019 and going forward, because the way it's looking now these airlines are looking for a very rapid expansion, and pretty much the same as with the Indian domestic industry which also relies on LCC operations, they forget about translating growth or market share into earnings growth. Boeing and Airbus are both eager to support LCC growth, but they also will be watching with a sense of unease of how these airlines are run and how that could potentially affect their order book.So, summarizing, for 2019, I'd be interested in seeing how wide body sales develop and how LCC are planning on strengthening their business. For narrow body aircraft, we are not interested in orders but in deliveries and more importantly, in the ability to continue increasing production as promised.(Q): Those following aviation know the story - Airbus took a bet on the hub and spoke idea with the A380, while Boeing bet on point-to-point with an airplane like the 787. Is that narrative still in play today?(A): Well, it's still in play in the sense that forecast demand for Very Large Aircraft hasn't materialized. Airbus still says there's a future for the Airbus A380 but production rate decreases on VLA programs such as the Airbus A380 and Boeing 747-8 tell another story... at least for now. We can't look into the future, but it seems that airlines are liking the smaller aircraft fitting the point-to-point network more, which means that Boeing as well as Airbus should be able to increase production on the 787 and the A350. For both programs, we expect increased output in 2019.What's becoming more interesting are the secondary city-pairs. Boeing wants to connect those pairs with the Boeing 797 and thinks it will open a new market, while Airbus wants to focus an Airbus A321XLR which basically is an Airbus A321neo with increased range. While Boeing considers this to be a new market, we haven't seen a lot that points toward either the Boeing 797 or the Airbus A321XLR being a growth opportunity that will not cannibalize sales for existing products.(Q): Let's look beyond Boeing and Airbus. What other investment ideas are out there? How about aircraft leasing and finance, such as AerCap? Smaller aircraft makers such as Bombardier?(A): I'm actually a big fan of leasing companies. Because airlines want some flexibility and aircraft costing anywhere between $40 million and $250 million, there's a need for leasing firms, and it's a business that scales easily. We think that as interest rates rise, leasing will become more attractive. On top of that, leasing is a business that scales easily and lessors such as AerCap (NYSE:AER) and Air Lease Corporation (NYSE:AL) also know when to sell aircraft at profit rather than leasing them out for another long-term lease. For lessors, it's important that the aircraft they buy and lease out retain value, so bubbles are not beneficial to them. Additionally, with stiff Chinese competition, lessors have to stay on top of their game and maintain strong credit rates and attractive redelivery agreements. Currently, lessors aren't getting a lot of attention from Wall Street, but we believe that the lessors that are around and big enough have certain competitive advantages that smaller lessors simply don't have.Source: FortuneLast year, I thought that there were some nice opportunities in the supply chain. Spirit AeroSystems (SPR) was one of the stocks I liked, but it hasn't really paid off due to delivery problems to Boeing. In 2019, there still might be some delays, but as production goes up, and Spirit should be better aligned to support that growth, I do think that share prices could recover. Also, Safran (OTCPK:SAFRY), which produces the CFM LEAP 1A and 1B turbofans used on the Airbus A320neo, seems to be in a good position as it shakes off delivery delays.Another company I like is United Technologies (UTX). The company has a big product portfolio that it expanded with the acquisition of Rockwell Collins (COL). With the acquisition, the company is placed extremely well as a supplier for aerospace platforms, and its sheer size opens up opportunities to make attractive offers to jet makers and be more resistant to pressure on the supply chain.Source: Airline GeeksFor smaller jet makers I am less positive. Embraer (ERJ) is tying knots with Boeing, while Bombardier just sold its Q400 program. Bombardier (OTCQX:BDRAF) had a good product with the C Series and has a strong partnership with Airbus, but its turnaround plan, while promising, seems to have gone wrong and will likely end in Bombardier being forced out of the commercial aircraft industry. The focus should move toward business jets for Bombardier, but it's a market with fast business jets but slow sales. Especially if you are anticipating an economic slowdown, Bombardier might not be the favorite investment. So, the commercial aircraft arms of Bombardier and Embraer are more or less being locked in joint ventures, which makes the smaller jet makers more reliant on business jet, defense and other transportation. It could very well be the case that with these smaller jet makers coming down in size in terms of what's 100% owned, their negotiation position with suppliers also will weaken.On the 6th of December, the Boeing-Embraer joint venture was blocked by a Brazilian judge. The reasons were not fully clear as some media suggested the deal was blocked because Boeing was not giving up anything while other media stated the reason was that the current administration has left a decision to be made by the next Brazilian administration that will take seat at the start of 2019. Embraer successfully appealed to the decision, and the block was lifted on the 10th of December.Source: RaytheonWe think nice opportunities lie in the defense sector despite our concerns that expanding defense budgets might be challenging. While there are significant challenges for the F-35 program, we believe that Lockheed Martin (LMT) is one of the nicest defense companies to have in your portfolio. Raytheon (RTN) is another company I like - shares of the company sold off sharply, but their products and opportunities remain strong.(Q): Could we see more collaborations among aerospace companies, such as with Airbus and Bombardier for the A220? Likewise, could we see M&A activity? Maybe a deal like we saw between Boeing and Embraer?(A): The Embraer-Boeing deal has yet to close and we still expect that to happen in due time. Other than that, I'm not expecting huge M&A activity. We think 2017 was more the year of M&A activity in the aerospace industry with deals closing in 2018. For 2019, I don't see which major acquisition opportunities there are.Boeing has a very active investing arm in the form of HorizonX, but it doesn't focus that much or not at all on taking publicly-traded companies private.(Q): What events, key milestone or developments should investors watch for in 2019?(A): In recent months, Boeing has gone mute on the potential launch of the Boeing 797. A decision should be made this year. We think that a launch would significantly de-risk other future developments.A key event during the year will be the first flight of the Boeing 777X, which is a major milestone in the development process, but we don't expect it to directly result in an uptick in order activity.What we will keep an eye on are oil prices, wide body sales and narrow body production rampups.I also will continue to follow Boeing's investment. In 2018, we saw various investments that should bolster its portfolio and capabilities ranging from small satellites to autonomous vehicles to 3D printing. Those are three key areas where I hope to see Boeing strengthening its business further in 2019 and putting those investments to use.(Q): Your investment theme or approach for 2019? Are you bearish or bullish on the aerospace sector?(A): My approach won't change dramatically. We remain bullish on the long term but hope to see tension decrease significantly in 2019. As mentioned earlier, the aerospace industry is an industry with a very long-term horizon, and if you choose to invest in the industry, I think that's also what you should keep in mind. After Q3, we've seen the market selling off quite a bit while results actually looked good. Boeing is a good example of that, after posting its Q3 earnings share prices have started to head lower partially due to the crash with the Boeing 737 MAX that led to wild speculation, but the in-quarter and in-year performance still look good and the long-term view remains unchanged. I think short-term weakness creates a nice entry point for a long-term investment with value in the commercial aircraft industry where Boeing and Airbus will create a super-duopoly and also in the defense industry, you should find some nice names as a core holding (Lockheed Martin, Raytheon). With rising rates, we think big lessors such as Air Lease and AerCap also should get some love.On airlines, we are less positive compared to a year ago primarily because remaining profitable as fuel prices head higher has proven to be more challenging than earlier anticipated. I am however keeping the Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) shares I am currently holding.What holds for the market and for the aerospace industry as well is that a binary approach to the political game is not going to be beneficial. In 2019, the market would benefit from a resolution in the trade war between the US and China. What should be taken into account as well is that many companies in and outside of the aerospace industry are structured far too globally and have little room to grow in the US to benefit from an anti-globalization policy.In the end, you could say that I still think there are many opportunities, but I'm less bullish than I was a year ago. This however is more driven by uncertainty over trade than by quarterly earnings which are still looking good. Once the dark trade clouds that started packing above the markets are gone, and we still expect that to be more likely than a further eruption in the trade war with China, I think the aerospace industry will continue to be a top performing industry to invest in."
4224630,68315,2018-11-27T08:30:09-05:00,The F-35 program will be a major growth driver over the coming decades.There is a chance for a home run with Lockheed Martin's nuclear fusion technology.Shares look inexpensive and promise attractive total returns over the coming years.,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) is a favorite dividend growth investment for many investors on this site, and rightfully so. At the current price, which is the lowest level Lockheed Martin has traded at throughout the last year, shares provide a dividend yield of 3.0% and ample share price appreciation potential.Through the F-35 program Lockheed Martin will be able to grow considerably over the coming years, and its strong cash flows will allow for increased share repurchases during the coming years.Lockheed Martin is an aerospace/defense company with a weighting towards military aircraft:Source: Lockheed Martin presentationThe company will generate about 40% of its revenues from its aeronautics segment this year, the composition of Lockheed Martin's operating profits is almost identical (39% of operating profits will come from aeronautics according to management's guidance). Aeronautics revenues grew 19% during the most recent quarter, which can be explained by higher revenues for Lockheed Martin's F-35 program.Revenue growth for the F-35 program is driven by higher production volumes and by higher sustainment revenues. The F-35 program will be a tailwind for Lockheed Martin for decades: It is one of the most ambitious as well as most expensive military programs that has ever been executed. Total costs for the program are forecasted at more than $400 billion. It will take several decades for Lockheed Martin to produce and deliver the more than 3,000 aircraft that will be built, the majority of those will be sold to the US military.This provides a very long-term tailwind for Lockheed Martin's revenues in the form of jets that will be built and sold, but maybe the even better part of that program will be the sustainment revenues that go along with it. Combat aircraft need repairs, upgrades, maintenance, etc. consistently, which is why a lot of revenues can be generated by keeping these aircraft in shape. As the amount of F-35 jets that are in use will continue to rise for decades, so will the sustainment revenues that Lockheed Martin will be able to generate.Investors can thus expect a strong revenue stream from the production and sale of new aircraft. That revenue stream will not grow endlessly, though, but rather top out and level off at one point. The sustainment revenues could continue to grow for decades, as the total number of jets that are in use around the world will grow for a very long time.Lockheed Martin will benefit from growth in other segments as well. The company's Space Systems segment, for example, will benefit from rising government spending on space missions. More satellite launches of advanced systems such as the GPS-III satellites will provide a compelling backdrop for Lockheed Martin to grow its Space Systems revenues.Last but not least, Lockheed Martin could be one of the biggest winners in nuclear fusion. The company's Compact Fusion system, developed by Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works team, is not operational yet, and far from being sold to customers. The technology is promising (according to management), and could at one point produce a massive revenue stream for Lockheed Martin. It is not clear whether that will happen at all, and if it happens, at what time. Investors should thus not buy Lockheed Martin for the fusion technology alone, but rather see this as a free out-of-the-money call option:If the technology does not work out and cannot be commercialized, nothing is lost, and Lockheed Martin will be a solid investment thanks to its traditional aerospace/defense prospects. If, on the other hand, the technology can be commercialized at one point in the future, Lockheed Martin would benefit massively from being at the forefront of this potentially world-changing technological revolution.During 2018, Lockheed Martin's cash generation will not be overly high, but that is due to the one-time effect of higher pension contributions.Source: Lockheed Martin 10-Q filingLockheed Martin has produced operating cash flows of just above $900 million during the first nine months of 2018, but the company has made pension contributions of $3.9 billion so far this year already. Adjusted for that, operating cash flows would have totaled $4.8 billion, or $6.4 billion on an annual basis.Lockheed Martin will not make pension contributions at the recent pace in the future, which is why the company expects a steep increase in its cash generation during the coming year:Source: Lockheed Martin presentationOn the back of a mid-single-digits revenue increase, Lockheed Martin forecasts operating cash flows of at least $7 billion during 2019. Relative to the company's current valuation of $84 billion, this means that shares are valued at just 12 times forward cash flows (if cash flows come in at the bottom of the guidance range). Shares thus offer an operating cash flow yield of 8.3% right now. When we factor in capital expenditures of $1.1 billion a year, the free cash flow yield is 7.0% on a forward basis.Lockheed Martin pays a dividend that yields 3.0% right here, which means that the company has a lot of cash that can be used for other purposes, such as paying down debt or repurchasing shares.LMT Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Quarterly) data by YChartsThe company has put a lot of focus on lowering its share count in the past, it is thus likely that share repurchases will be ramped up during the coming years as cash flows are poised to soar. The company could repurchase about 4% of its shares a year on top of paying the current dividend without taking on any additional debt.LMT EPS LT Growth Estimates data by YChartsAnalysts are currently forecasting long-term earnings per share growth of 9.7%. When we assume that 4% of that will come from share repurchases, Lockheed Martin would have to grow its net profits by a mid-single-digits pace only. Due to the ramp-up of the F-35 program, this seems easily achievable.Lockheed Martin is currently forecasting earnings per share of $17.50 for the current fiscal year, which means that shares trade at 16.8 times this year's profits right now.LMT P/E Ratio (3y Median) data by YChartsOver the last three, five, and seven years, Lockheed Martin has been trading at median earnings multiples of more than 17. Shares thus look inexpensive relative to how the company's shares were valued in the past. It is, therefore, I believe, unlikely that Lockheed Martin's valuation will decline to a significant degree going forward. Even without any multiple expansion, shares thus could produce compelling total returns: If the valuation remains unchanged, shares will rise in line with the company's EPS, i.e. by 9-10% a year. Adding in a dividend yield of 3% gets us to a low double-digit annual total return.Lockheed Martin will benefit from the continuing ramp-up of the F-35 program, as well as from growth in other segments, such as the Space Systems business. On top of that, there is a possibility that Lockheed Martin will land a home run with its nuclear fusion business.The company's cash flows will soar during 2019, and Lockheed Martin will likely ramp up its shareholder returns substantially next year.Through a combination of share price gains and dividends, Lockheed Martin should be able to produce total returns in the double-digits range going forward, which makes shares look attractive at the current valuation.Author's note: If you enjoyed this article and would like to read more from me, you can hit the ""Follow"" button to get informed about new articles.

Only Boeing and Northrop Grumman (NOC) have a better five-year return than Lockheed Martin. The S&P 500 is higher by just 52% during this same time period. Anyone holding defense names for this length of time is sitting on excellent returns.Perhaps investors are becoming skittish with the choppiness of the market and looking to lock in gains, which might help explain the decline of Lockheed Martin since the middle of August. I would argue that these investors are thinking too short term. I think the price decline in Lockheed Martin has given investors an opportunity to invest in a quality company. Let's review the company's most recent financial results, dividend history, and my valuation to see why I think Lockheed Martin is a buy right now.Lockheed Martin reported third quarter financial results near the end of October (10/23/2018).Source: Lockheed Martin Third Quarter Results Presentation, slide 3.Lockheed Martin earned $5.14 per share during the third quarter. This was $0.87 ahead of estimates and a nearly 60% improvement from the previous year. An effective tax rate (6.5% compared to 25.8% during the same time last year) is responsible for a portion of this increase. The company generated more than $14.3 billion in sales, beating the average analysts' estimate by $1.2 billion. This was a 16% improvement from the previous year.Aeronautics, which accounted for ~40% of sales during the quarter, continues to show impressive growth. This division saw a 20% increase in revenues year-over-year. The U.S. government has increased defense spending to more than $700 billion for fiscal 2019 and Lockheed Martin has been a beneficiary of higher capital allocation with a higher volume of the company's F-35 fighter planes. Even after the company and the Department of Defense agreed on the lowest price per aircraft in program history (under $90 million per plane), Lockheed Martin was still able to secure an $11.5 billion deal for production and delivery of more than 140 F-35s.Revenues for Rotary & Mission Systems increased 14% due to higher net sales for the company's integrated warfare systems and sensors. Lockheed Martin's $9 billion purchase of Sikorsky Aircraft from United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) in 2015 continues to pay off. Sikorsky saw higher volumes for its CH-53K King Stallion helicopters, though there was lower demand for its Black Hawk helicopters. Rotary & Mission Systems represented a little more than a quarter of all sales during Q3.Missiles & Fire Control sales improved 16% due to higher volumes for tactical and strike missiles programs. Lockheed Martin received $600+ million in combined orders from Japan and the Netherlands for its Hellfire missile systems. The company also saw higher demand for its sensors and global sustainment programs. Missiles & Fire Control contributed 19% to sales during the third quarter.The remainder of Lockheed Martin's revenues came from Space Systems. Space Systems, which had been Lockheed Martin's lone weak spot the past few quarters, saw an 11% revenue increase. Higher volumes in government satellites and strategic and missile defense programs were the main driver of growth during the quarter. The U.S. Air Force awarded Lockheed Martin a nearly $3 billion contract to produce missile warning satellites.After third quarter results, Lockheed Martin provided updated guidance for 2018.Source: Lockheed Martin Third Quarter Results Presentation, slide 6.Lockheed Martin now expects to earn $17.50 per share this year, up from its previous earnings per share guidance of $16.95. Lockheed Martin has now increased its EPS guidance after each quarter in 2018. If this forecast EPS is achieved, it would represent 31% growth from 2017's total. The company also sees revenue near the very top of its guidance from July. Cash flow is also excepted to be slightly higher, which is of vital importance when it comes to paying and raising dividends.When it comes to companies in the Industrial sector, whose earnings can fluctuate year to year due to dependence on the health of the economy, I look for at least ten years of dividend increases. I am also looking for 10%+ in average growth over both five- and ten-year periods of time and a dividend payout ratio below 50%. This leaves the company plenty of room to continue to increase its dividend while offering some protection in the event of a drastic earnings decline that is likely to take place during a recession.Lockheed Martin increased its dividend 10% for the December 2018 payment. It is true that dividend growth has slowed slightly compared to the long-term average. Based off of expected payments for the year ($8.80) and EPS guidance ($17.50), the company has a dividend payout ratio of 50.3%. For context, the average payout ratio over the past five years is almost 53%.Lockheed Martin's five- and ten-year growth rates meet my requirements for purchase. The expected payout ratio also is close enough to my target for industrial companies. With a low payout ratio, Lockheed Martin would likely be able to maintain and raise its dividend even in a recession.Lockheed Martin's stock currently yields 2.66%, easily topping the yield of the S&P 500 (1.91%).If you're not familiar with how I value stocks, I take the current price and compare it to fair values and price targets from a number of different sources. This helps me determine a fair value for a stock. For a Dividend Contender with a strong growth history like Lockheed Martin, I am willing to pay 5% above fair value as I see this slight overpayment as the cost of doing business with an excellent company.Prior to purchasing a stock, I use Value Line's safety and financial strength ratings to help me determine if a company is on solid financial footing. I am looking for at least a 2 for safety and a B++ for strength. Value Line awards Lockheed Martin a 1 for safety and an A++ for financial strength, the top ratings in both categories. These ratings give me confidence that the company has its financial house in order.Based off of Friday's closing price ($301.24) and EPS estimates for 2018 ($17.50), Lockheed Martin's stock trades with a price-to-earnings ratio of 17.2. The stock has traded with an average P/E of 17.1 over the past five years, making shares less than 1% overvalued at the moment.CFRA has a one-year price target of $420, which would offer nearly 40% upside potential from the most recent close. CFRA's current fair value is $198.61, which would make shares 34% overvalued.Morningstar estimates fair value to be $329. This means that shares of Lockheed Martin are trading at a 9.2% discount to their fair value.Value Engine has a one-year price forecast of $299.09, very close to the current price of the stock. Their fair value for Lockheed Martin is $333.74, almost 11% higher than the current share price.Normally, I would average these values out to help me determine fair value, but I am making a slight change in this case. CFRA just recently added a fair value back to Lockheed Martin, but it is so far outside of my other sources that I am excluding it from my calculations. After doing so, I find that Lockheed Martin is 11.6% undervalued presently.My system says fair value for Lockheed Martin is $336. As I said before, I am willing to pay 5% above fair value for companies that have increased their dividends for at least a decade. Therefore, I would consider purchasing additional shares of Lockheed Martin below $354.Lockheed Martin continues to produce strong financial results. The third quarter saw yet another increase in guidance for the year. Even with the company's performance, the stock has declined in value. I feel that the recent drop in price has provided investors with an opportunity to acquire shares of a quality company at a reduced price. Lockheed Martin is one of the more undervalued stocks that I follow and when capital becomes available early next year, the stock will likely be one of our first purchases.What are your thoughts on Lockheed Martin?

4223267,99196,2018-11-19T12:28:26-05:00,"Fair value for the stock is between $360 to $375 per share.The company is benefiting from a strong defense budget and continues to raise revenue and EPS guidance into 2019.With pension contributions finished and F-35 production ramping, the company will increase free cash flows materially from current levels heading into 2019 and 2020.With a 10% dividend raise and increasing buyback, the company remains committed to returning capital to shareholders.","Lockheed Martin (LMT) continues to execute and capture funds from the expanding Department of Defense budget. The company executed an impressive third quarter and a post earnings drop combined with an overall defense sector sell off has created an attractive longer term investment opportunity for patient investors.The business is strong and will remain so until the 2020 presidential elections. The outlook past 2020 is contingent on whether Democrats or Republicans gain control of the government. In the mean time, the company is growing the top line in the mid single digits annually ~5% and continues to guide top and bottom lines higher into 2019. We can expect increasing overall cash returned to shareholders, as the company just increased their annual dividend by $0.80 and added an additional $1 billion buy back authorization.Strength can be seen in executing for the ramp of the F-35, as the US government and member countries increasing the amount of planes produced in 2018 to 130 from a planned 91 earlier this year. F-35 is strategically important to the business model of Lockheed and the company is beginning to experience revenue concentration as sales from the jet will begin surpassing 25% of total sales heading in 2019. The company has reduced the cost of the program and expects to increase sales in the double digit teen range in 2019. The company continues to find ways to lower the final sale price of the planes and expects it to approach $80 million by 2020.Just recently, the company won the bid from Belgium to build 34 F-35's which will begin delivery into 2023. They were also awarded a follow on contract from the Navy valued at $22.7 billion, of which $6 billion will be appropriated to the company while the details are finalized.Missiles and Fire Control is increasing sales in programs of PAC-3, Hellfire and Classified missiles. Production rates are going to reach an 11,000 unit level for Hellfire and 500 per year for PAC-3. The company is getting significant program awards in the area of ""FMS"" Foreign Military Sales and wins for PAC-3 in Sweden and awards on Hellfire missiles from Japan and the Netherlands totaling $630 million in the quarter. The company is investing in its workforce as it expects to hire 1500 employees at MFC Orlando and an additional ~1000 workers at the Aerospace Ft. Worth facility.The defense industry had a favorable political outcome with the Republicans securing a win in the Senate, which will allow previous passed legislation to remain in effect through the next presidential election. It is likely the defense budget will increase further into 2020 as President Trump pushes a narrative of increased defense spending.The company continues to return record amounts of capital to shareholders and has increased the dividend consistently. The recent turn down in share price to the sub $300 levels has caused the valuation to return to historically attractive levels. The industry is growing at a record rate and Lockheed remains positioned as the prime contractor to own.The current valuation environment is depressed across the defense industry and I still believe a 21 times forward earnings is an appropriate metric to use for Lockheed shares.Based on the current market conditions and the defense industries earning multiple retracing towards 19x earnings, I believe an appropriate multiple to use is 21x forward earnings.Some additional metrics supporting my valuation include:Using managements full year 2019 EPS guidance of $17.50, I arrive at a 2019 earnings range of $17.15 to $17.85. When using a 21 times price to earnings multiplied by my earnings range, I get a fair value for the stock between $360 to $375 per share.Since the October selloff, the technical indicators have been recovering and indicate the stock will trade between the $300 ~ $325 pricing range. The share price has been range bound throughout 2018 and trending to the lower support levels in the high 290's and low 300 range. If another sell off occurs, the share-price will likely hold the recently tested $280 level. I believe with the stock trading below $310 a share, investors can enter a longer term investment position. The stock is off about 8% from its 200 day SMA and 7.5% from its 50 day SMA. The $300 pricing level continues to act as a support and if the share price can withstand any further downturns, it acts as a good base to buy into.The payout ratio is 42.4%, as of 3rd quarter 2018. The payout ratio continues to decrease in the face of dividends increase and from 50% levels experienced over the last 12 months. The average payout ratio over the past 5 years has been elevated and often greater than 50% of total earnings, I have have even questioned the company's ability to maintain such a high pay out ratio in previous write ups.This chart shows consistent dividend growth of around 10% annually, it also shows earnings increase proportionally to sustain the dividend payout. Based on an expanding defense budget and managements ability to increase profitability in a variety of economic environments, I see extreme investment value and safety in the company's dividend.The share-price is undervalued based on the revenue and earnings growth the company is experiencing. Based on the current share price, the stock looks attractive to purchase and hold over a longer term investment horizon. The investment will be rewarded with an annual dividend raise and a rising share-repurchase authorization. The company is ramping nearly every segment of the business and with an expanding defense budget into 2019 - 2020, shareholders will be rewarded if they exhibit patience and let the company continue to execute.Copper Canyon LLC is a Registered Investment Advisor in Orlando, Florida.

4216048,104746,2018-10-30T15:41:36-04:00,"The Space Force has been making tons of headlines recently, but none are dedicated to how much of an impact it can have on the market.Boeing and Lockheed Martin are in prime position to skyrocket as a result of the formation of the Space Force.This is a low risk, high reward thesis detailing how both previously mentioned companies can thrive with the Space Force.","An idea proposed by US president Donald Trump has been making headlines, as many people are torn on the idea of having a national Space Force. The Outer Space Treaty (OST) prevents the use of celestial bodies as military outposts or testing centers; governments also may not lay claim to any celestial body. Most importantly is makes it illegal for countries to place weapons of mass destruction in orbit, or space. President Trump has assured people that the Space Force will do nothing to violate the treaty, and will instead serve as a defensive force. Currently, the United States is not capable of launching anything into space on their own rockets because they don’t have any. In order to deploy the Space Force, the US government will likely need to rely on SpaceX (SPACE) or the United Launch Alliance (ULA) equally owned by Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT). Russia is very unlikely to allow the US to use their Soyuz rocket, and America would be very unlikely to want to use it as well. This new Space Force will create a strong competition between Boeing and Lockheed Martin as well as give them free reign to an empty market.When first confronted with the idea of a space force, scenes from Star Wars are the first thing to come to mind. In reality, the Space Force is much different than this fanciful scenario. The actual Space Force is not something that is as far fetched as many make it out to be. It will take on the responsibilities of many currently active branches such as the Air Force Space Command, the Army’s 1st Space Brigade, the Navy’s Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, and the Naval Satellite Operations Center. All of these branches are involved with space, so with the creation of a Space Force, it only makes sense to add those in as well.The United States alone has tens of billions of dollars worth of satellites in space between both government and independent company projects. In addition, many of those satellites are integral to our everyday lives. For example, all GPS information is created with satellites, losing those could disrupt many people’s everyday lives. Mark Albrecht, the executive secretary of the National Space Council from 1989 to 1992, explained the basic principle behind the Space Force, saying that the Space Force would “not [be] materially different from the U.S. Navy, which goes around the Pacific and the Atlantic and the Mediterranean not to create trouble or to cause wars, but to make sure that all the things we enjoy are protected.”The risk of other countries being able to destroy these satellites is becoming very real. Russia and China both had missiles capable of destroying satellites, China even tested their missile on an outdated weather satellite in 2007. This is why the Space Force is very likely to become a reality in the near future.The Space Force’s main functions will be to monitor current satellites, and launch new military satellites when instructed to. If they detect something that doesn’t seem right, they will act in order to protect US satellites. However, the most important idea behind the Space Force, they will never attack other countries’ space property unless it is threatening the US or its space technology.Lots of new technology will need to be developed in order to maximize the capabilities of the Space Force. When the United States Air Force was established in 1947, the idea of a supersonic jet probably wasn’t even considered. However, these jets are now commonplace for US Air Force fleets. This development in technology was crucial for the Air Force to be able to reach its full potential and be as effective as possible. Many similar developments will need to be made for the Space Force. In order to support the Space Force, the US government will launch the Space Development Agency (SDA) to help with the creation of new space technology.The US doesn’t currently have any rockets to launch with, so they will need to utilize other launch vehicles. Rocket boosters could need to carry massive loads, potentially whole space stations. The Air Force has confirmed that they have been in talks with many different rocket companies, most recently SpaceX to discuss the use of their BFR. The BFR is the rocket that will carry the BFS, but has a capability to carry immense loads into space. The ULA will also likely receive many contracts to transport cargo to space. Blue Origin doesn’t yet have near the launch capabilities of SpaceX or the ULA, so they won’t even be able to be considered for many years. Lastly, the Russians are very unlikely to volunteer their Soyuz rocket as a launch vehicle for an American military branch, and the US would likely be too proud to even ask.The Space Force isn’t just some task force, it is a whole new branch of the US military. This means that it will require a lot to keep it running. Much like the Air Force, when it was created many people didn’t think that it would become as large as the other branches. Companies like Lockheed Martin are heavily invested in the US military, with the vast majority of their revenue coming from the US military. Revenue from space made up only 18.1% of Lockheed Martin’s earnings in the second quarter. The rest of their earnings are generated from their aeronautics and other military operations. Currently Lockheed Martin generates the vast majority of their military revenue through contracts with the US Air Force, though they do operate under a few US Navy contracts as well.Boeing’s main source of revenue lies in its commercial jets, but military revenues made up 22.7% of their revenue in the second quarter. In total, they generated $5.729 for military revenue in their second quarter.Lockheed Martin and Boeing will be able to capitalize on the combination of their space and military revenues, with added opportunities. The SDA will likely follow in NASA’s footsteps and outsource the development of new technology to US companies. This is where Boeing and Lockheed Martin will thrive. SpaceX is a huge competitor for rocket boosters, but not military technology, nor do they plan to be. Northrop Grumman (NOC) is the a huge competitor for military contracts, but lacks the drive or experience to deliver to a Space Force. This means that the vast majority of the market, excluding boosters, will be dominated by Boeing and Lockheed Martin.This could lead to a double in all military revenue for both companies. This may seem like a lot, but the Space Force, again, isn’t going to be just a small task force. In addition, Boeing and Lockheed Martin would be controlling the vast majority of the market share as Space Force suppliers. This doubling in revenue would lead to an increase in Boeing’s total EPS by $.431. For Lockheed Martin, their EPS would increase by $3.143. Both EPS increases were calculated by taking military revenue and the total outstanding shares. To give context to the increase in EPS of both companies, Lockheed Martin’s current EPS is $8.95 and Boeing’s is $15.922. The reason that Lockheed Martin would experience a larger gain in their EPS is because they focus primarily on military development, while Boeing’s more lucrative business is the sales of their commercial jets. With all of this information in mind, the Space Force could drive Lockheed Martin stock to $360 per share, and Boeing’s stock to $412 per share.This thesis doesn’t have much risk associated with it. One potential event that would completely derail the thesis is if the Space Force doesn’t even get created. However, this is incredibly unlikely. There have already been reports into what the Space Force would entail, as well as councils formed to help with the creation of the new military branch. In addition, this idea has received support from the public as well. Even renowned astrophysicist Neil Degrasse Tyson supported Trump’s proposal, urging the public to do so as well. Also, as mentioned before, the need for a Space Force is increasing, and the public, as well as the government, is beginning to recognize that this idea may actually be one of the best to come out of the Trump administration. Although an often polarizing figure, Democrats and Republicans have united behind Trump to support this proposal.The other risk that Boeing and Lockheed Martin would face is competition. However, as discussed earlier, competition shouldn’t be much of an issue as the two companies will be the primary suppliers for the Space Force. Even for launch vehicles, although SpaceX currently has the edge both in lift capability and cost, the ULA is working on a reusable rocket as well as an Advanced Cryogenic Evolved Stage (ACES) to help with orbital transportation. The ULA also has a perfect track record with its launches, while SpaceX does not, so the Space Force might opt to launch with the ULA on pricier objects. Boeing is also working on a revolutionary spaceplane with NASA called the Phantom Express which will be able to fly lighter payloads for only $5 million. When this is created, it will most likely be used as the launch vehicle for the Space Force’s lighter packages because it is expected to be able to launch a day after its previous flight.The new Space Force will provide an incredible influx of cash for both companies. This influx will have more of an impact on the Lockheed Martin stock price because of how the company is structured. To clarify, Boeing is more diverse, and they make much more money off of their commercial jets than their military services. However, Lockheed Martin focuses most of their resources on supplying the US military with equipment. Due to their stronger reliance on military contracts, Lockheed Martin is set to benefit more than Boeing will. This doesn't mean that Boeing won't be able to capitalize on the Space Force, just less so than Lockheed Martin.Buy into these two companies before the potential market impact of the Space Force is recognized. By beating the market to this realization, potentially huge returns could be waiting by investing into either company. Both companies will benefit immensely once the Space Force becomes a reality, but it doesn't appear that the market has realized this yet."
4214185,53552,2018-10-25T07:43:53-04:00,"Lockheed Martin reported strong results across all segments that were overlooked by the market.Higher defense spending and strong booking activity should translate to moderate revenue growth over the next several years.Given its focus on defense spending, Lockheed is less exposed to the economic cycle.With gradually rising free cash flow, its current valuation is attractive and points to 8-18% upside.","On Tuesday morning, Lockheed Martin (LMT) reported earnings of $5.14, beating expectations by $0.86 while revenue of $14.32 billion exceeded estimates by over $1 billion. Critically with investors more broadly worried that industrial companies are reporting “as good as it gets” earnings, Lockheed also raised guidance. 2018 EPS will be about $17.50 from a previous $16.90 midpoint on revenue of $53 billion, about $700 million ahead of its July guidance.Given these numbers, I anticipated a strong day for the stock, and in fact, shares opened about 3% higher before weakening during the day to decline 1.67% towards $321. Looking through the results, this decline does not appear justified; perhaps, broader market volatility overshadowed results. In fact, these earnings increased my optimism in the company as a long-term investment. Shares may also be attractive to investors worried about China or the broader economy, given the company’s lower correlation to the overall business cycle.Not only did Lockheed report company-wide results that were well ahead of expectations, but this strength was also broad-based with each of Lockheed’s four units: aeronautics, missiles & fire controls, rotary & mission systems, and space reporting double-digit revenue and operating profit growth. Aeronautics, Lockheed’s largest unit at nearly 40% of revenue, continues to benefit from the scaling up of its F-35 program. With deliveries set to rise in coming quarters, Lockheed should increasingly benefit from economies of scale as it builds out this business, which should result in improving profit margins.Of course, investors are focused more on the future than the past, and while higher 2018 guidance is obviously a positive, markets will be increasingly focused on 2019 and beyond. Details from this quarter leave me encouraged. The US government is Lockheed’s primary customer, and we have the benefit of very transparent demand from this customer since Congress appropriates funds.This year, Congress agreed to $80 billion in increased defense spending over two years, and President Trump recently signed a $716 billion budget for the Department of Defense in accordance with this. The Administration has prioritized increasing defense spending, which should benefit broadly all the defense contractors.In this way, unlike other industrial companies, Lockheed is not directly exposed to the economic cycle, rather it is exposed to the defense spending cycle. Now, the economy can impact defense spending because during downturns when tax revenue falls, governments can look to curtail spending. However, after years of pressure on Pentagon spending, it appears defense spending is enjoying an upturn.Moreover, European nations are starting to increase defense spending, which should provide some lift to Lockheed. One could argue that if the US-China trade spat worsens and becomes more confrontational, the result may be increased defense spending. While few if any are rooting for this, the fact remains that having defense exposure can be beneficial in a portfolio during periods of rising geopolitical tensions.Now while I think the broader defense environment looks positive, we have to be sure Lockheed itself is benefitting from it. One metric to focus on is how many contracts a defense contractor wins. Well, in this quarter, Lockheed added $18 billion to its backlog, $4 billion more than its revenue in the quarter. As such, its backlog grew to a record $109 billion, or two years’ worth of revenue. This strong book to bill ratio of 1.3x indicates Lockheed is winning a solid piece of the growing defense spending pie and should result in continued revenue growth over the next 18 to 24 months.Indeed, management anticipates 5-6% revenue growth in 2019. In 2019-2021, Lockheed should be able to generate over $7 billion in annual operating cash flow despite rising working capital needs. Additionally, with programs like the F-35 reaching scale, cap-ex spending needs should decline from about $1.5 billion in 2019 to $1 billion in 2021, resulting in free cash flow that should rise from $5.5 billion next year to over $6-6.25 billion by 2021.I would note free cash flow will only be $3.4 billion this year because Lockheed has pulled forward pension payments as pension payments made prior to September this year still enjoyed a 35% tax deduction; going forward, they will be deducted at the 21% corporate tax rate. Having put $5 billion into its pension this year, Lockheed will not have to make payments into its plan for two years, and the taxes saved by pulling forward these benefits are about $450 million. So while this decision makes 2018 results look less impressive, the long-term savings to shareholders are clear. These are the types of long-term decisions one wants management to make.Given the headlines around Saudi Arabia, it is worth noting that a decision by the US government to cease arms sales to the Saudis would have a very modest impact on LMT’s financials. As stated on its earnings call, the company has less than $500 million in Saudi exposure in 2019 and $900 million in 2020. Given the underlying momentum in US defense spending, this Saudi exposure is quite manageable. If anything, I would use weakness in Saudi headlines to add to Lockheed shares.Given a positive defense backdrop and strong bookings, Lockheed is well positioned to grow revenue mid-single digits over the next few years. And with cap-ex needs gradually coming down as projects reach scale, free cash flow growth in the mid-to-high single digits should result. LMT trades about 16.6x 2019 estimated free cash flow, for a roughly 6% free cash flow yield. Given potential 5-8% free cash flow growth as the defense cycle progresses, that is an attractive starting effective yield.Lockheed returns about 55-60% of this free cash flow via its dividend, which it recently raised 10% to $2.20 for a 2.74% yield as of Tuesday’s close. On top of this, Lockheed raised its share repurchase program $1 billion to $3.7 billion. Based on its cash flow, I would look for them to buy back about 2% of their shares or $2 billion over the next year. The combination of a falling share count and rising free cash flow should support continued dividend raises in the 5-10% area.All in all, Lockheed strikes me as an attractive investment for long-term investors who will enjoy rising shareholder payouts over time without having to worry as much about broader economic activity or rising US-China trade tensions. With Lockheed reporting strong numbers that lay the groundwork for continued moderate growth through 2021, shares now look to be a good value relative to underlying cash generation. Given good revenue visibility and a less-cyclical customer, I consider LMT more fairly valued at 18-20x free cash flow, or $350-$385, suggesting an 8-18% upside from current levels. I would recommend investors add here."
4222255,52502,2018-11-14T16:01:35-05:00,"Lockheed Martin's financial results, as well as product profile suggest it may be both a growth stock, as well as a defensive stock, which makes it compelling.In recognition of the fact that its business is wholly dependent on government spending domestically and abroad, we have the recognize the risks associated with abrupt policy changes.Despite talk of cold wars, international situation may not be favorable to Lockheed, because confrontations are increasingly economic in nature, with arms mostly employed in proxy wars.","Looking back to the past few economic downturns, there is no evidence that military spending tends to fall in a global recession. This fact may seemingly make Lockheed Martin (LMT) an ideal defensive stock to own in the event that a global economic downturn may be upon us. There may be a number of important factors however which might make this stock a risky bet for those looking to shift into less volatile investments in preparation for a new global economic downturn.I already covered Kraft Heinz (KHC), as well as Procter & Gamble (PG), as I am looking to gradually shift my own portfolio out of more volatile positions, and into stocks which could help preserve the overall value of the stocks I hold, while paying a decent dividend, as I wait for the better times to return. Thus far, both companies seem to be a better, less risky bet compared with Lockheed, even though it may not be so obvious at first sight.Strictly looking at Lockheed's recent financial results, it is understandable why its stock has had such a strong run in the past decade or so. Going back to November, 2008, this stock quadrupled in price in the past 10 years. Its latest results suggest this stock is set to continue soaring. According to its Q3 report, it produced revenue growth of 16% compared with the same quarter from last year. By comparison, both Kraft and Procter have seen no revenue growth over the past year. Lockheed's net earnings increased by over 50%, whereas Kraft has seen its net earnings plunge lately, and Procter managed to carve out an increase of 12% in the same period.This is in effect the profile of a growth stock and a defensive stock at the same time, which at first sight seems like a very enticing potential investment opportunity. Furthermore, it has a share buyback plan, which is also set to add more value to investors. The one thing that it does not have is a very generous dividend. It is currently only 2.9%, while Kraft offers about 4.6%. With a P/E ratio of 27, Lockheed stock is also selling like a growth stock, which means that investors fully expect the growth trajectory to continue in terms of revenues and net earnings.The risk is that there is no guarantee that revenue growth as well as profitability will continue to improve. We need to take a step back and realize that Lockheed is part of an industry that is 100% dependent on government spending in the US and across the world. Furthermore, it is not just a matter of how much governments choose to spend on their military but also a matter of spending choices, which could easily leave a defense company vulnerable. We should recognize that these spending patterns can turn on a dime, in other words, it can be sudden and abrupt. In this regard, there is a much higher degree of risk compared with consumer staple companies I already covered, such as Procter & Gamble or Kraft Heinz.Source: Sipri.As we can see, it is not just that military expenditures world-wide do not tend to decline during a global recession, but it also saw a significant and steady increase in the past two decades or so. The 1990's was a tough time for defense companies, given that military spending world-wide and in the US saw a period of contraction following the end of the cold war. Even before the 9/11 events gave rise to renewed interest in rearming, by the late 1990's the decline in military spending ended and it started expanding once again.Since 9/11 and now more recently, with more and more talk of new ""cold wars"", it may seem that investing in military hardware producers like Lockheed is a sure bet. A number of relatively recent developments however may be reason to question the bullish narrative on this stock. First of all, it seems that global power competition is shifting away from preparing for direct military confrontation and it is being re-focused on economic conflict. We are seeing this confrontation in the form of an increasing list of sanctioned countries, such as Russia, Iran and so on, mostly by Western powers. There is also the more recent trend of tariffs being imposed.Military confrontation between the great global as well as regional powers seems to be more limited to proxy conflicts. Syria is the ideal example in this regard, where a number of actors are facing off, but are finding ways to avoid direct confrontation. There is of course always the threat of things getting out of control. It is however more than likely that it will not. In this regard, all that military adversaries need is to have enough of a deterrent force to ensure that any major adversary is looking at significant military as well as non-military losses, which it is unwilling to bear. Russia is of course the ideal example of it, where even though it is militarily much weaker than the US, it does nevertheless pose a formidable threat to US military and economic assets which acts as a deterrent for either side to start an open confrontation.The minimum threshold in this regard seems to be the military deterrence possessed by Iran. It is by no means a formidable military power. It is enough of a threat however to global economic interests, for it could potentially block the Strait of Hormuz for a period of time. It could also potentially inflict enough of a loss on any adversary on the battlefield to make it an unattractive target for an open confrontation. It does not of course mean that it may not be targeted to become yet another proxy war battlefield if Iran gives outsiders the opportunity to steer things in that direction. Economic pressure is merely a tool in applying pressure that may result in such an outcome. It is important for us to recognize and draw the appropriate conclusions from the fact that such pressure is being applied as opposed to military intervention, because such a confrontation is not deemed desirable. It is questionable therefore how much longer demand for the tools of such potential wars will start to shrink, in response to this reality of preferences.The fact that Iran is not being attacked militarily suggests that the minimum level of military deterrence threshold is rather low. More emphasis is therefore needed on shoring up one's own economy from suffering significant blows in the event that an economic war breaks out. Russia is already changing its attitude in this regard, in recognition of the fact that its economic vulnerabilities take precedent over trying to best the rest militarily, which is increasingly irrelevant. It cut its military spending by 20% last year. China, which is increasingly catching up to the US in terms of size of its economy is still spending well below American military spending levels on its own military. It spends 1.9% of its GDP on military expenditures versus the 3.1% level that the US spends. It is clearly not as concerned about challenging the US for military supremacy as it is with challenging it for economic supremacy.It is of course assumed that the US will not cut military spending any time soon. I disagree and I believe that once the tax cuts were passed, it became inevitable. The only question that remains is when it will happen, not if it will happen.Source: CBO.The deficit trajectory is not looking overly healthy as we can see. It is even worse in reality given that the CBO projection does not include an economic downturn in its calculations. While I don't want to try to guess when the next big economic downturn will occur, I think odds of no recession from now till 2028 are somewhere around zero.Once a recession will occur, those projected Trillion dollar + deficits will most likely turn into 2 Trillion dollar deficits, putting the bond markets under pressure, especially if other major bond holders were to sell into an already oversupplied market. I believe the government will have to do something to improve on the deficit outlook, and that thing will not be done on the revenue side. I don't believe that the tax cuts can be touched without serious political repercussions. Similarly, it is very hard from a political standpoint to cut into the social safety net, mostly directed towards the elderly, such as social security or Medicare. Discretionary spending is where the cuts will most likely be steepest. In this regard it is impossible in my view to spare defense spending, given that it makes up roughly half of all discretionary spending according to the CBO.India recently made a $5 billion weapons deal with Russia, while Pakistan announced a deal to buy Chinese drones soon after. I think both of these recent deals are an indication that US military exports to the Asian region may be in for some tough competition, with both Russia and China increasingly muscling in. Europe, which has been a significant export market for US defense products, is also increasingly looking at fostering its own domestic industries, even as it looks to strengthen its military might.Large buyers such as Saudi Arabia may also have to cut back, given that its defense spending as a percentage of GDP is already in the 10% of GDP range. We should keep in mind that a coalition led by Saudi Arabia, which has been the third-largest spender on military in the world lately has been incapable of defeating a poorly-equipped militia in Yemen for some years now. All it managed to do was to create what the UN currently calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis. In effect, Saudi Arabia the UAE and other big spenders in the region are increasingly realizing that they are getting a poor return on a huge investment. Saudi Arabia may cut its overall spending on its military, and it may also decide to spread the wealth, buying more from China and Russia. It may be necessary for the Saudis and the UAE to do so, in order to hedge its geo-strategic bets, as well as make new economic allies. It is reportedly currently looking at buying the Russian S-400 air defense system, to the detriment of a major Lockheed deal right now.To sum it all up, within the context of intensifying economic competition, we may be on the verge of a general world-wide realization that beyond a certain minimum level that should be maintained, based on individual nation-specific needs, investing in military assets above and beyond that can yield greatly diminishing results. Shoring up one's domestic economy, keeping it competitive relative to the rest of the world may become the prevailing issue of national security, with the ability to project military power taking a back seat. This may in fact happen just as we will enter a new global recession, whenever that may happen. As financial and economic pressures will intensify for most global actors, it is possible that most governments will find that it is an increasingly easy partial answer to fiscal problems to gut military budgets. That could spell disaster to Lockheed Martin stock, making it a risky investment option for those who believe that we are approaching the time where defensive stock buying is the appropriate response to current market and economic conditions."
4208590,50291,2018-09-27T11:03:31-04:00,"Boeing, Lockheed, and Leonardo with respective partners are still in the raise to win advanced trainer jet order.Contract value could add up to $16.3B.Not winning the contract would hurt Boeing most.","Probably, the last big contract that will be awarded during this fiscal year for the Department of Defense is the T-X contract. It’s a contract award that is long due, and several important milestones leading up to a final selection have been postponed several times. In this report, we have a look at the role of the T-X, the potential, and value of the contract as well as contenders and its importance.T-38 TalonSource: tallyone.comThe T-X RFP (Request For Proposal) calls contenders to propose a replacement for the aging T-38 fleet. The T-38 is an aircraft used to train fighter jet pilots, but the aircraft itself is quite old, which impacts the availability and reliability of the airframe.The T-38 was produced by Northrop Grumman (NOC) between 1961 and 1972. In total 1,146 units were built, of which 456 are in operation with the US Air Force, 33 with the Turkish Air Force, and 35 with the German Air Force. So, out of the total number that has been built, roughly half are still in service with air forces around the world. To increase reliability and validity of the trainer jets, the jets have been upgraded to maintain an availability of at least 75% and keep the aircraft serviceable beyond 2020. In recent years, that availability has slipped to a level below the target of 75%, which is not weird for an airframe of this age. The harsh reality is that, this year alone, there have been 3 accidents with the T-38.The reliability and availability show that a replacement is required, and that is why the US Air Force will award a contract for 350 replacement aircraft valued at $16.3B, including but not limited to support, spares, and training systems. The number of 350 jets coincides with the number of current trainers multiplied by the desired availability.Demand for trainer aircraft from other countries is not as big as the demand coming from the US, so for any contender that launches a completely new design viability stands or falls with orders from the US, while existing designs need to be based on an already widely successful fighter jet.Previously, there has been as much as 6 contenders, each having possible candidates in various stages of the process. Northrop, Lockheed (NYSE:LMT), and Boeing (BA) with their respective partners were the only companies that had a flying model making a bid more likely.However, Northrop Grumman dropped its plans to bid as well and said the following in a statement:While Northrop Grumman was one of the companies with a flying model, they believed that the program would eat away on the bottom line and cash flow. From this, we can conclude that Northrop Grumman believes that it would have to land money in the program without a big chance of winning the contract or an inability to produce the trainer with profits in case a contract was awarded. I think that the company has acknowledged that its chances to win the contract are slim since it already has won the $80B stealth bomber contract, this put pressure especially on Boeing to come up with a competitive pricing. Having bagged the stealth bomber contract, Northrop simply had no appetite in participating in a pricing race to the bottom.Source: Defense NewsFor Boeing, things are different. Over the past 30 days, the company has won some important Defense orders and, maybe against expectations, got some Super Hornet orders as well as the Trump administration reversed a decision made by the previous administration to stop procuring the Super Hornet, and some foreign military sales were finalized. Seemingly, that puts Boeing in a more comfortable spot than it was years ago when it faced shutdown of its fighter jet business and lost the stealth bomber contract. While Boeing did receive fighter jet sales that keep the line running through 2025, we do think that if Boeing does not win this contract, its capability to design fighter jets might start diminishing. A whole lot of its effort would be and is already being put into upgrading and supporting the existing installed base while Boeing would need some additional foreign military sales, and one could ask for how long the Super Hornet is going to continue bagging orders. Fighter jets that are successful in the marketplace have production runs of 4-5 decades, and Boeing is approaching those production runs with its current fighter jets. Beyond that, it does not have a fighter jet or a fighter jet like aircraft that it can deploy its expertise on. So, with the extreme long term in mind, as well as support that goes with delivered airframes, the T-X program for which the US jet maker partnered with Saab is still an extremely important one for Boeing.Source: PinterestThe second contender is Lockheed Martin. In cooperation with Korean Aerospace Industries Lockheed wants to enter the bid with an upgraded version of the KAI T-50 Golden Eagle, which is built to specification of the South Korean Air Force. Strategic partner Lockheed is important in the bid, since it produces the aircraft that the fighter jets are trained for. On paper, with Lockheed having the contract for the F-35 and having a trainer jet based on an existing design, it should be able to offer the lowest pricing, but it should also be pointed out that with the incredibly big F-35 program in the pocket, it might also not feel obligated to lower pricing.The third contender that is still in the race is Leonardo (OTCPK:FINMY), but with the lack of a US partner, one can question how likely it is that it will be selected to make its T-100 the next trainer jet.Previously, there have been a handful of potential bidders, and some of them didn’t enter in the final bid. Most surprising to us was the fact that Northrop decided not to bid, while Leonardo did bid. For the other contenders that didn’t push through, we correctly predicted their chances of either being selected or continue entering in the bid process even though we did receive a message from a representative of one of the companies who seemed to either suggest that we were not informed about the company and its capabilities while simultaneously suggesting that its designs had been copied by other manufacturers. To clear things up, we proposed an e-mailed interview with the CEO of the company, but it was insisted that we would make a phone call. Since in the same conversation, it was also suggested that the company might in the future miss out on companies investing in the represented company to which my work might be the root cause, we weighed the importance of having the chat with the CEO of the company and came to the conclusion that the message’s main purpose was not to inform us better but letting us know the company is reading it, so I better tone it down a bit. I don’t think that is a constructive way to do things and therefore chose not to contact the CEO, thereby also protecting my objectivity.Who is going to win the T-X contract remains unknown, but we will know in the coming days. We don’t expect a lot from Leonardo, since it really has no US native partners. On paper, Lockheed could offer the lowest pricing, while many of the pilots would be trained to fly on the F-35 platform that is developed by Lockheed Martin. On the other hand, we have Boeing, and despite some recent favorable contract awards, the T-X contract is key to keep alive their aspirations in the fighter jet business for decades to come. With that in mind, they will be likely to be willing to drop pricing. Lockheed likely is very much aware of this and will also price its product in such a way that it might heavily dent Boeing’s fighter jet and trainer business.Eventually, pricing might not be what is going to drive the decision. The USAF benefits from a competitive environment, where contenders can excel either in product capability, project risk and costs. By awarding the contract to Lockheed Martin, the USAF would put all eggs regarding fighter jets and its future in Lockheed's basket, creating an environment with eroding competitivity. Boeing would be left out without a new platform that it could continue building on or allocate engineering resources to, which would mean that, over time, its design capabilities in the fighter jet business could be significantly impacted. The T-X probably is the only 5th generation fighter jet program for years to come, where Boeing can hop in with a big contract and really cement its future in the fighter jet business, thereby also securing its in-house knowledge on the development of such products.Does it mean that Boeing will shut down its fighter jet business if it does not get the T-X contract? No, not directly, but it would mean that Boeing has to win business in the 4th generation fighter jet space for the Super Horner, Growler, and win business with the F-15X as an F-15C/D replacement. It would position Boeing in a way where it depends on 4th generation aircraft in the future.It was brought to my attention that a dispute was filed regarding US presence of Leonardo. While I have not seen the full dispute filing, it seems that the dispute centers on US presence of Leonardo. I hereby want clarify that Leonardo does indeed have presence in the US and I have not claimed otherwise. However, the company that Leonardo partnered with is DRS which to my full understanding is a fully-owned subsidiary of Leonardo S.p.A. based in the US. Given this information of the company status, one can question whether you can really speak about a US partner in the same sense as we were able to do with Boeing and its partner Saab and Lockheed and its partner KAI. Any statement made about the absence of a US partner for Leonardo was made in reference to external partners based in the US that are not owned by another contracting party. - D. Bechai"
4205529,99196,2018-09-11T11:03:33-04:00,"The ishares defense and aerospace ETF ""ITA"" may provide investors higher returns over the rest of 2018 compared to owning Lockheed Martin's stock outright.Lockheed Martin is undervalued by 8% and the core business looks strong, but the opportunities are present across the defense industry.I have illustrated a hypothetical defense investment strategy, whereby you can use the ETF and select the stocks you think will outperform in the sector.","During 2018, the ishares Dow Jones US Defense and Aerospace ETF (ITA) has outperformed Lockheed Martin's stock (LMT) by nearly 8%. The defense industry is benefiting from an expanding defense budget (~$717 billion for 2019) and increasing foreign military sales. After Lockheed Martin's 2nd quarter earnings call, ITA's performance began to diverge from Lockheed Martin stock. The ETF has gained 11.9% on the year compared to 2.7% for Lockheed. The unique portfolio composition combined with near term uncertainties in Lockheed Martin business make ITA a better buy for the rest of 2018.Source: KoyfinI believe the funds smaller defense and industrial holdings give it an advantage to owning Lockheed Martin stock outright. The portfolio is relatively concentrated with only 38 holdings in the Defense and Aerospace sector. The ETF portfolio concentration allows investors to capture the overall move in Defense with less stock specific risk. The ITA has outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by over 183% since inception in 2006 and will likely outperform the broad market with the current geopolitical and economic risks in the market. Most companies in the fund do not have exposure to China tariffs and a insulated to non-US market moves. Source: KoyfinLockheed Martin reported their first quarter earnings on April 24th and the stock reacted negatively. The share price peaked near $360 and the market began fully valuing their company against defense peers. The stock preceded to drop nearly $60 dollars per share, or roughly 20% in a month and Two near term catalysts are 3rd quarter earnings estimated to be the third week in October and the potential award of the Trainer T-X program at the Air Force annual conference held from September 17-19th. Source: KoyfinThe core business is performing brilliantly with F-35 ramping into full production, missiles and fire control growing their broad product line and management raising full year 2018 guidance in the range of $51,600 – $53,100 billion and earnings per share $16.75 – $17.05. The company continues to land contracts with US and foreign militaries across the aeronautics and missiles divisions. The company is doing everything to maintain their leadership in the Defense sector and I can't tie the stock under-performance to any specific factor other than the $32 billion pension obligation.Lockheed has faced some headwinds relating to $32 billion in pension obligations remaining on their now phased out defined benefit plan. The pension narrative has been mentioned since late 2017 and the company guided flat free cash flows for 2018. The flat free cash flows were the result of a $5 billion charge to fund the pension assets. The company made $3.5 billion in contributions during the first half of 2018 and expects to make the last $1.5 billion in the third quarter. The outlook for the pension is positive over the coming years as the company will freeze the contributions through 2019 and 2020. The expected annual contributions moving into 2020 & beyond will be minimal at $100 ~ $200 million and highly dependent on the market return over this period.  Lockheed Martin stock is undervalued on a fundamental basis and I have concluded the share price is worth a minimum $352 per share, which implies an upside potential of 7.3%. However, I believe the ITA and other companies in the industry are a better buy than Lockheed stock because of the the following factors:Source: iShares Fact SheetThere is a lot to like about the holdings in ITA, the top ten holdings account for 5.04% of the total return year to date. The 28 other companies in the portfolio have contributed around 6.4% of the performance and this is due to the market out-performance of the smaller defense and industrial players. Other than 4 companies with negative returns (ARNC), (SPR), (MOG.A) and (TGI), the 28 non top ten holdings are beating the broad market with an averaged return of 23.7%. The top three performers are (AAXN), (AVAV) and (HEI.A) up 171%, 90% and 55% each. The ITA gives investors exposure to under-followed aerospace and defense names and reduces the stock picking component of portfolio selection. Source: KoyfinThe active/passive debate has been raging since the invention of low cost index funds and the publication of return statistics backing low cost index funds that mirror broad market indices. When investors purchase individual stocks it creates the ability for a portfolio to outperform the benchmark index and provides investors a way to generate alpha (The purpose of this website). One overlooked aspect of ETF investing is investors stand to benefit by actively managing their ETF's holdings in tandem with outright stock holding. I am an active portfolio manager for my firm's clients, so I will highlight a unique way you can play ITA ETF with an active component. It involves outright purchasing the ITA ETF and two individual defense stocks to create a tailored defense portfolio. My hypothetical defense portfolio weights the ITA and two defense stocks with an 80/20 split. In my hypothetical portfolio, you can choose the two companies that you believe will outperform in defense. For my portfolio, I chose Raytheon (RTN) and Northrup Grumman (NOC) because I think there is 10+% upside by the end of the year. With a hypothetical $100,000 investment, if you purchased $80,000 of ITA, $10,000 of RTN and $10,000 of NOC your portfolio weighting would look like the chart below.This portfolio realignment does a couple things. It gives you more exposure to the US defense sector by creating additional portfolio concentration in two top defense contractors that have outperformed the ITA over the past 5 years, while still reducing overall portfolio single stock risk. It would also remove Boeing as the top holding and create a portfolio with Northrop and Raytheon as the top weighting. This strategy is perfect to manage the overall risk of a defense allocation, while still providing enough concentration to create upside potential by the end of the year. Under the proposed portfolio, it would have returned 12.8% YTD, which is about ~1% better than the ITA. Disclaimer: Copper Canyon LLC is a Registered Investment Advisor in Orlando, Florida.

4200514,98446,2018-08-20T10:26:08-04:00,"The Aerospace & Defense ETF has easily beaten the S&P 500 over the last five years.Lockheed Martin has outperformed both indexes in that same time period by a wide margin.Recently, Lockheed Martin has trailed both, presenting a possible buying opportunity.Given Lockheed Martin's position as the world's largest defense contractor and dividend history, I find the stock very appealing.","Lockheed Martin (LMT) is the largest defense contractor in the world and my favorite name in the defense sector. I have bought shares of Lockheed Martin for the March to Freedom Fund twice in the last two years. I would very much like to own more of the name. Let's look at the stock's recent performance, business results, dividend history, and my valuation to determine if now is a good time to purchase more shares of Lockheed Martin.Over the past five years, the defense sector, and Lockheed Martin, in particular, has performed very well.Source: YChartsAs you can see, the U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA) has greatly outpaced the S&P 500 in terms of total returns. Lockheed Martin on its own has more than doubled the return of the market index and has outperformed its own sector ETF during this time. But if you zoom in just a little, you'll notice that has changed since the beginning of the year.Source: YChartsYear to date, Lockheed Martin has underperformed both the S&P 500 and the ITA by several percentage points. This has struck me as odd. Congress is expected to pass a fiscal 2019 defense bill that would increase spending $716 billion, which is well above fiscal 2018's levels of $600 billion. Lockheed Martin stands to be a major beneficiary of this spending increase. For fiscal 2018, the spending increase included funding for 20 additional F-35 fighter jets (the most expensive defense budget item), 17 C-130 transport aircraft, and 16 more Blackhawk helicopters, among other products. With additional increases in defense spending, Lockheed Martin is likely to see additional funds awarded to the company as well.Given the positive business environment, it shouldn't surprise investors that Lockheed Martin's business has performed well. Through the first half of 2018, Lockheed Martin has earned a total $8.05 per share, topping estimates by $0.73 and improving 38.2% from the first half of 2017. The company has generated more than $25 billion in revenue, 5.4% higher than the same time last year.Lockheed Martin's business performed quite well during the second quarter as all divisions, outside of Space Systems, saw revenue growth. Aeronautics, which houses the F-35 aircraft, grew sales 8.1%. Missiles & Fire Control, which provides missile defense programs, saw nearly 17% revenue growth as demand drove high volumes for THAAD missile defense system. Sales for Rotary & Mission Systems increased 4%. The Space segment was the lone year-over-year decliner, with revenues dropping just 1%.Lockheed Martin has also raised its guidance after both the first and second quarters.Source: Lockheed Martin 2nd quarter earnings release, page 6.Prior to the start of 2018, Lockheed Martin had expected to earn at its midpoint $15.35 per share. After raising guidance twice this year, the company expects to earn at its midpoint $16.90. Lockheed expects free cash flow of at least $3.3 billion this year, and this is after contributing $5 billion to its pension fund (the company has already added $3.5 billion of this total to its pension fund in the first half of 2018).With results like this, I feel that Lockheed Martin's stock should perform at least in line with its peers. With the business performing at a very high level, let's examine the company's dividend history.I am a dividend growth investor through and through, so I am looking for companies that have a proven dividend track record and offer dividend growth. For industrials, whose earnings can fluctuate year to year due to dependence on the health of the economy, I look for at least ten years of increases and 10%+ in average growth over a five and ten-year period of time. I also would like a dividend payout ratio below 50%. This leaves the company plenty of room to continue to increase its dividend while offering some protection in the event of a drastic earnings decline that is likely to take place during a recession.Source: YChartsLockheed has increased its dividend for the last 15 years. In 2008, the company paid $1.83 in dividends. In 2017, that total had ballooned to $7.46. Over the past ten years, the dividend has been raised at a compound annual growth rate of 15.1%. In 2013, Lockheed paid $4.78 in dividends, which would equate to a five-year annual growth rate of 9.3%. The ten-year CAGR easily passes my requirement for growth, but the five-year CAGR is slightly below what I am looking for in an industrial stock. Lockheed's payout ratio breaks the tie for me. According to Value Line, the average dividend payout ratio is just 44.4%. Based off of expected earnings and dividends ($8.00) per share for 2018, Lockheed has a payout ratio of 47.2%. Shares currently yield 2.46%, higher than that of the S&P 500 (1.8%) but lower than that of the 10-Year Treasury (2.87%).I would feel very comfortable purchasing shares of Lockheed Martin based on both its earnings results and dividend history. Let's see if the stock passes my valuation system as presently priced.If you're not familiar with how I value stocks, I take the current price and compare it to fair values and price targets from a number of different sources. This helps me determine a fair value for a stock.Value Line gives Lockheed Martin a 1 for safety and an A++ for financial strength. These are the highest ratings a company can have. F.A.S.T. Graphs says that the average price to earnings multiple over the past five years is 17.9. At the current P/E of 20.8, shares are almost 14% overvalued. I should note that Lockheed 's current P/E is lower than the S&P 500's multiple of 24.7. CFRA's price target of $420 offers more than 29% of upside based off of the 8/17/2018 closing price of $325.24. Morningstar estimates fair value at $327, which is slightly above the current stock price. Value Engine has a one-year price target of $321.40, which is slightly below the recent close. Value Engine's fair value is $339.31, showing shares to be 4.33% undervalued currently. Averaging all together, I find that shares of Lockheed Martin are 3.78% undervalued.For a Dividend Contender with a strong growth history like Lockheed Martin, I am willing to pay 5% above fair value as I see this slight overpayment as the cost of doing business with an excellent company. Any price under $363 qualifies the stock for purchase.Over the last three years or so, I've tracked Lockheed Martin very closely, and this is the most undervalued that I have found the stock to be. I think that the stock's underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the Aerospace & Defense sector offers investors an excellent opportunity to purchase shares of Lockheed Martin.

I judge growth in this metric to be a better indicator of 1) whether growth is sustainable long-term, and 2) whether this stock is suitable for income-oriented investors.The following are my assumptions:Source: Ycharts.comSource: Author's CalculationsFrom the above, we see that a target price of $437 is yielded, representing roughly 34% upside from the current price, or 39% on a compounded basis.In this regard, I see Lockheed Martin as a great choice from a free cash flow perspective as well, and analyzing free cash flow adds more confidence to my prior assertion that we could see a similar level of upside on an earnings basis.All too often, a company might show great earnings but a poor ability to convert such earnings into free cash flow. Lockheed Martin is clearly quite efficient at doing this, and I would expect sustainable upward growth for this reason. Moreover, the fact that free cash flow has been rising further indicates that this company has the capacity to continue increasing its dividend.To conclude, I continue to remain long Lockheed Martin. This is a company that I believe will continue to do well regardless of the geopolitical environment, as it has continued to demonstrate financial strength over time, and across a wide variety of market conditions. I look forward to further growth from here.Disclaimer: This article is written on an ""as is"" basis and without warranty.

4219087,65113,2018-11-06T21:14:41-05:00,"Lockheed Martin has provided modest returns in the past couple of years relative to its competitors.The stock appears to be overpriced relative to its peers.While Lockheed Martin's returns appear to be the least correlated with the S&P 500, that does not imply that it is ideal from a defensive standpoint.","I have owned Lockheed Martin since 2016, when I got into the stock at a price of $247.A common perception of defense stocks (and indeed the reason I bought Lockheed Martin in the first place), is that these stocks are broadly uncorrelated with the market and an investor can therefore protect against market downturns and achieve a potentially market-beating rate of return with these stocks.Is this true in the case of Lockheed Martin?Firstly, when looking at price alone, there are a few interesting observations to be noted. Let’s compare Lockheed Martin to the following:In the past three years, we see that it is actually Boeing (BA) that has returned over 176% during that time period:Source: investing.comWhen we take a look back to 2009, Lockheed Martin actually showed the lowest return over this period compared to the market and other peers:Source: investing.comThe main period in which we saw high returns from Lockheed Martin was between 2013 and 2015 when the stock returned nearly 150%, owing to surging demand across defense stocks in general (and this is further evidenced by the out-performance of Northrop Grumman returning 190% during this period):Source: investing.comLooking at these trends, there are two questions that need to be asked:To answer this question, I decided to generate a correlation matrix for the most recent 750 days of trading data across Lockheed Martin, its major competitors, and the S&P 500.Source: Author’s CalculationsWith the exception of Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD), we see that Lockheed Martin has the lowest correlation with the S&P 500 at 0.61.Notably, Boeing has had the strongest correlation with the S&P 500, but has seen a much higher return than the market index along with other defense stocks.That said, Lockheed Martin appears to have seen much of its gains during a boom period for defense stocks during 2013 and 2015, but there is no evidence to suggest that the stock is necessarily shielded during broader market downturns.From a business standpoint, Lockheed Martin remains a strong company in its industry. The defense industry in the United States is facing slight uncertainty over the recent incident concerning Saudi Arabia, but indications so far have been that sales will largely remain unaffected.Moreover, Lockheed Martin has continued to beat quarterly earnings, and expects that revenue will rise by 6% in 2019 as a result of increased spending by the U.S. military.However, let’s look at P/E ratio growth for Lockheed Martin and its competitors. We see that this stock has shown the fastest P/E ratio growth over the past five years, indicating that price growth has significantly outstripped growth in earnings:Source: ycharts.comBased on the above, I see myself continuing to hold Lockheed Martin (LMT) but won’t be adding to my position for the foreseeable future. At this point, the company’s competitors appear to provide more value from a price perspective, and may have greater return potential. I may follow up on this in a subsequent article.Disclaimer: This article is written on an ""as is"" basis and without warranty.

4191726,85096,2018-07-29T12:16:14-04:00,"Lockheed Martin's total return overperformed the Dow average for my 54.0-month test period by 88.30% which is great, and the present price presents a fair entry point.Lockheed Martin's dividends are above average at 2.5% and have increased for 16 years in a row, a solid dividend income company.Lockheed Martin's three-year forward CAGR of 13% is great and will give you good steady growth with the increasing worldwide economy and the defense budgets.","Lockheed Martin (LMT), the largest manufacturer of military defense systems and other non-defense government systems, is a buy for the total return growth and income investor. Lockheed Martin has steady growth and has plenty of cash, which it uses to expand its product line and buy back shares. I received a lot of comments from my previous article on Raytheon (RTN) that mentioned LMT, so I decided to take a look and found another great military defense company. The company is being reviewed using The Good Business Portfolio guidelines, my IRA portfolio of good business companies that are balanced among all styles of investing.When I scanned the five-year chart, Lockheed Martin has a great chart going up and to the right for five years. The latest small dip in 2018 has created a buying opportunity for this solid growth investment.LMT data by YChartsFundamentals of Lockheed Martin will be reviewed on the following topics below.I use a set of guidelines that I codified over the last few years to review the companies in The Good Business Portfolio (my portfolio) and other companies that I am reviewing for possible investment. For a complete set of the guidelines, please see my article, ""The Good Business Portfolio: Update To Guidelines and July 2016 Performance Review"". These guidelines provide me with a balanced portfolio of income, defensive, total return and growing companies that hopefully keeps me ahead of the Dow average.Lockheed Martin passes 11 of 11 Good Business Portfolio guidelines, a good score (a good score is 10 or 11). These guidelines are only used to filter companies to be considered in the portfolio. Some of the points brought out by the guidelines are shown below.The Good Business Portfolio Guidelines are just a screen to start with and not absolute rules. When I look at a company, the total return is a key parameter to see if it fits the objective of the portfolio. Lockheed Martin beat against the Dow baseline in my 54.0-month test compared to the Dow average. I chose the 54.0-month test period (starting January 1, 2014, and ending to date) because it includes the great year of 2017, and other years that had fair and bad performance. The great total return of 140.73% makes Lockheed Martin a great investment for the total return investor. Lockheed Martin has an above average dividend yield of 2.5% and has had increases for 16 years, making Lockheed Martin a good choice for the dividend income investor. The dividend is estimated to be increased in September 2018 to $2.20/Qtr. or a 10% increase.DOW's 54.0-Month total return baseline is 52.43%Click to enlargeFor the last quarter on July 24, 2018, Lockheed Martin reported earnings that beat expected by $0.13 at $4.05, compared to last year at $3.23. Total revenue was higher at $13.4 billion more than a year ago by 6.7% year over year and beat expected revenue by $660 million. This was a good report with bottom line beating expected and the top line increasing with a good increase compared to last year. The next earnings report will be out October 2018 and is expected to be $4.17 compared to last year at $3.24, a good increase. The graphic below shows the second-quarter earnings, revenues and cash flow highlights.Source: Earnings call slidesLockheed Martin is the largest manufacturer of military defense systems sold in the United States and foreign countries.As per except from Reuters:Overall, Lockheed Martin is a good business with 13% CAGR projected growth as the worldwide economy grows going forward with the increasing demand for LMT's military products. The F-35 program provides a strong base of ongoing sales for the best fighter jet in the world for years and years to come. The good earnings and revenue growth looking forward provides LMT with the capability to continue its growth as the defense business increases, and foreign sales are expanded.The graphic below shows the sales by major geographic world areas for Q2 and the total for the first half.Source: Earnings call slidesThe Fed has kept interest rates low for some years, and on June 13th, they raised the base rate up 0.25%, which was expected. I believe that they will not raise the rates two more times this year, but will go slow at one for the rest of 2018, which should help keep the economy on a growth path. If infrastructure spending can be increased, this will even increase the United States growth going forward with better economics for the consumer. The recent market volatility may slow down the Fed.From July 24, 2018, earnings release, Marillyn Hewson (Chief Executive Officer, President, and Chairman) said:This shows the feelings of top management for the continued growth of the Lockheed Martin business and shareholder return with an increase in future growth. LMT has good constant growth and will continue as the world military budgets grow. The graphic below shows the 2018 guidance for Lockheed Martin.Source: Earnings call slidesLockheed Martin is a good investment choice for the total return and income investor with its good projected growth as worldwide defense budgets increase and the company buys back shares. Lockheed Martin will be considered for The Good Business Portfolio to increase the group of growth companies. After the review of Raytheon and Lockheed, I give LMT a bit of an edge because it has income and better growth than RTN, but it's alright to own both. If you want a steady growing total return and income, in the growing defense business, LMT may be the right investment for you.The Good Business Portfolio trims a position when it gets above 8% of the portfolio. The four top companies in The Good Business Portfolio are, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) which is 7.5% of the portfolio, Eaton Vance Enhanced Equity Income Fund II which is 8.5% of the portfolio, Home Depot (HD) which is 10.1% of the portfolio and Boeing (NYSE:BA) which is 13.4% of the portfolio, therefore BA, EOS, and Home Depot are now in trim position with JNJ getting close.Boeing is going to be pressed to 14% of the portfolio because of it being cash positive on 787 deferred plane costs at $316 million in the first quarter of 2017, an increase from the fourth quarter. The second quarter saw deferred costs on the 787 go down $530 million, a big jump from the first quarter. The second quarter of 2017 earnings was fantastic, with Boeing beating the estimate by $0.25 at $2.55. The third quarter of 2017 earnings were $2.72, beating the expected by $0.06 with revenue increasing 1.7% year over year, another good report. The first-quarter earnings for 2018 were unbelievable at $3.64 compared to expected at $2.64. Farnborough Air Show sales in dollar value just beat out Airbus (OTCPK:EADSF) (OTCPK:EADSY) by about $6 billion, and both companies had a great number of orders. The second-quarter earnings beat expectations by $0.06 at $3.33, but a good report was spoilt by a write off expense on the KC-45A which should start delivery in October of 2018.JNJ will be pressed to 9% of the portfolio because it's so defensive in this post-BREXIT world. Earnings in the last quarter beat on the top and bottom lines and Mr. Market did like it. JNJ has announced a dividend increase to $0.90/Qtr which is 56 years in a row of increases. JNJ is not a trading stock but a hold forever; it is now a strong buy as the healthcare sector remains under pressure.For the total Good Business Portfolio, please see my article on The Good Business Portfolio: 2018 1st Quarter Earnings and Performance Review for the complete portfolio list and performance.

4191301,99196,2018-07-27T14:07:59-04:00,"Management revised full year guidance upwards, as they typically under-promise and over-deliver.I updated my DCF model to reflect increasing profitability in the Aeronautics and MFC business lines and derived a higher price per share.Turkey's F-35B order is at risk and under review by the Pentagon. Lawmakers temporarily blocked the sale of 100 jets.","Lockheed Martin (LMT) reported 2nd quarter earnings and revised guidance up on both revenue and net income. The company is performing in all business segments and showing strength in aeronautics and missiles and fire control business lines. The record financial results make for an attractive opportunity in Lockheed Martin stock, as management continues to deliver operational excellence and while increasing revenue/earningsThe F-35 program is showing signs of maturation and cost savings, while contributing to roughly 25% of revenues. NATO members are starting to take delivery of the jet and production is increasing rapidly. The program will come into focus throughout the rest of 2018 and influence the company's ability to meet or beat their earnings guidance.F-35 production is ramping, revenue increased $370 million from the levels seen last quarter. Deliveries passed the 300th jet milestone and the total deliveries for 2018 are projected to be 91. The move to full scale production is improving operating margin slightly and economies of scale are beginning to take effect. The aeronautics division brought in $5.3 billion of revenue in Q2, an increase of 21% from the 1st quarter of $4.4 billion. This can be attributed to F-35 deliveries being paused and subsequently recognized under 2nd quarter revenues.During the quarter, the Italian production line delivered its first F-35B. This highlights NATO members' participation in the development and manufacture of the jet. Lockheed has located a F-35B assembly line in Cameri, Italy to support the local economy and reduce supply chain concentration and constraint risk from their Ft. Worth, Texas facility. This facility shows Lockheed's commitment to NATO allies in the participation of development and manufacture of the product. This differs from the F-22, which was restricted to US only use and production.When allies purchase products from Lockheed, they typically negotiate a certain percentage of production be allocated to their country. An example would be a minimum of 25% of components produced for the Italian variant F-35B must be procured from Italy's Cameri assembly line.It's a mutually beneficial business decision and allows the Italian politicians to say the $100 million purchase is benefiting the Italian economy by creating highly specialized and good paying jobs. Relocating a manufacturing facility to another country is an assurance the ally will continue to purchase jets.Turkey's 100 jet order is at risk and a bill passed the Senate and House to pause deliveries of the F-35B to Turkey. The Erdogan regime strengthening ties with Russia and subsequent purchase of S-400 Air to Ground missile defenses is causing the Pentagon to question whether Turkey would share technology with our top foreign adversary.Defense Secretary Mattis has warned the potential ramifications of dropping Turkey from the F-35 program by stating supply chain disruptions and increasing costs as primary concerns.Turkey has already taken delivery of 2 F-35s at the Ft. Worth facility and made payments of $900 million to the company. The jets are still in the US while Turkish pilots undergo training. The Pentagon announced they will do an analysis of US relations with Turkey to determine risks relating to the Turkish F-35B order.Management stated in the Q/A that they will continue delivering F-35s to Turkey, albeit the planes will remain in the US during flight training and will not be shipped overseas unless the US government allows:Bruce Tanner CFO:The biggest risk the Pentagon must asses is if Turkey will share technological secrets of the F-35's advanced stealth capabilities with adversaries. The easiest scenario to predict if this occurred would be the F-35's advanced stealth capabilities becoming immediately obsolete if the technology was shared with Russia or China. Lockheed doesn't expect the US government to drop Turkey from the program and remains committed to performing contractual obligations on the order.Revenues increased from the first quarter by 15% and finished at $13.39 billion. They continue their trend of guiding conservative and beating both analyst and internal expectations. Management revised full year guidance on sales and net income in the range of:Sales: $51,600–$53,100 Earnings Per Share: $16.75–$17.05 The expansion of the 2018 and 2019 defense budget is a $7 billion win for Lockheed. The US government appropriated the funds to build between 12 to 16 additional F-35 jets, up to 14 additional third interceptors, 8 additional C-130J aircraft, 8 to 15 Blackhawk helicopters and 1 to 2 additional Littoral Combat Ships. Source (Company 10-Q).Missiles and Fire Control is sustaining rapid growth and revenues increased to $2.08 billion, a 24% increase over the first quarter. Classified programs are ramping and accounted for $95 million in sales followed by THAAD and Patriot missile programs. Air defense systems are being deployed in Israel and other NATO members due to the need to counter missile threats.Tactical missile programs are another highlight, as volumes and operating margins increased in Q2. The company stated tactical missiles are ramping, with guided multiple launch rocket systems (GMLRS) winning an $820 million order from the Army.Valuation AssumptionsDCF AssumptionsForecasting free cash flows is quite a task for Lockheed. The company is experiencing a $5 billion charge for pension contributions in 2018, which lowers current year free cash flow and management expects no pension contributions to occur in 2019 and 2020.I measured capital expenditures based on percentage of total assets, assuming they will expand fixed assets at a 3% annualized rate. I also used this assumption to forecast depreciation and amortization add back to get my unlevered free cash flows.My long-term growth assumption factors the US government continuing their spending on defense and researching advanced weapon systems. Some risks associated with my model include: inability to project capital expenditures, company risk to capture future government contracts, the dividend continues to grow and isn't subject to cuts or removal.The technical indicators will influence the share price moving forward because of the large pricing swings we have seen throughout 2018. The support and resistance levels are $300 and $360. The share price tested the $360 resistance level on three separate occasions and failed to break through. The share price plummeted after Q1 earnings and held a critical $300 support level.I think the stock is attractively valued at current levels and merits a position in portfolios. The Turkey F-35B news should give investors an opportunity to purchase shares at good levels and hold through the second half of 2018. The company continues delivering record returns for shareholders and will maintain the largest market share in the defense industry.Copper Canyon LLC is a Registered Investment Advisor in Orlando, Florida.

4187653,99196,2018-07-17T04:08:36-04:00,"Defense company earnings multiples are high by historical standards, but these valuations could be the new normal.
        The company had pension obligation problems in the 1st quarter, and this could linger throughout the rest of 2018.
        The pension fund obligations are significant and over $5 billion in contributions expected this year alone.","The defense industry has been in a cyclical upturn and this is the result of a focused effort to increase the defense budget to $665 billion annually. Lockheed Martin (LMT) remains the largest weapons manufacturer because of their operational excellence and consistent revenue/earnings expansion.The major F-35 program has escaped the low rate initial production hell that was plagued by cost overruns, manufacturing delays and a steep learning curve. The company has finally started deliveries to strategic allies Korea, Israel and other NATO partners which participated in the development of the jet. This is strategically important to the company's business model as nearly 25% of revenues are sourced from sales of the jet. They also have increased production volumes on their Missiles and Fire Control business unit. MFC will be growing the fastest through the increasing volumes of PAC-3, THAAD and JASSM programs. The best way to describe the nature of Lockheed’s two critical business units is Aeronautics is the highest gross margin, yet lower volume generator. Whereas MFC is a high volume and high margin profit center that generates significant profits. Both business units are ramping up and will be highlighted in the 2nd quarter conference call.The company continues to return record amounts of capital to shareholders and has increased the dividend consistently. The recent turn down in share price to the $300 levels caused the price to earnings ratio to decline below 20 and create an attractive entry point.  (Chart source koyfin.com)Based on the current market conditions and the defense industries earning multiple retracing towards 19x earnings, I believe an appropriate multiple to use is 21x forward earnings.Management indicated their current annual earnings range of $15.80 to $16.10. Using management assumptions (which have been revised up many times over the past few years) with a 21x multiple, the stock should trade between $331.80 and $338.10 per share.As long as management can sustain the dividend and the defense budget increases, the stock price can hold the $330 pricing level.Some more factors driving the share price over the coming months are:The Lockheed pension was an analyst topic during the 1st quarter conference call due to the company making a $1.5 billion contribution to the pension plan. Heading into the 2nd quarter, this narrative should remain as an additional $3.5 billion is expected to be contributed towards the plan through the 3rd quarter 2018. These contributions are likely to cause negative free cash flow for the rest of 2018 and have the potential to incur additional liabilities for the company heading into 2019. It is a hot topic because the company can't afford to consistently make contributions to pension assets when they pay out such a significant portion of earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. Pension plan assets returned 13% in 2017 and the company is using a 7.5% long term rate assumption moving forward. Management indicated their funding obligations can vary up or down depending on the return of the SP 500 and markets. The company reports their pension holdings annually and it is difficult to know whether their portfolio managers reallocated the $32 billion balance of the pension fund.As of September 30, 2017, the asset allocation for the pension was 26% domestic equity, 22% domestic fixed income, 17% international equity, 10% private equity, 5%-real estate, 3% cash and 15% in alternatives. (Source)This is an aggressive allocation and we know the recent downturn in China (down 20% last month) and US markets will have an impact on whether the fund can meet its 7.5% discount assumption.The US is at the end of an expansionary cycle and the market performance we have seen in years past isn’t likely. The good news is the pension freezes heading into 2020, so the risk to cash flows is a near term problem and shouldn’t last past 2020. Lockheed switched to a defined contribution plan, which should save on expenses and give stability to the share price.Free cash flow is important topic for Lockheed Martin as they return a lot of cash to shareholders and this could cause cash flow problems in future periods.Their payout ratio is 49.5%, as of 1st quarter 2018. This is a decrease from quarters past, as the company received a net benefit on earnings form the tax reform bill. The average payout ratio over the past 5 years has been elevated and often greater than 50% of total earnings. While this payout ratio is sustainable during periods of growth and revenue expansion, any turn down in business will stop share repurchases and halt dividend growth.This chart shows consistent dividend growth of around 10% annually, it also shows earnings increase proportionally to sustain the dividend payout. (Disregard the forward EPS numbers as they aren’t adjusted from the tax act being passed).Most businesses have cyclical downturns at some point and earnings don’t step up consistently. It remains to be seen if the dividend increases every year will be sustained, due to uncertainty in the business cycle and the risk of future pension contributions.Any potential dividend cut could cause a rapid decrease in the share price and this remains a major risk to owning shares at these levels.An additional risk to the share price is the high earnings multiple the company is currently valued at. The price to earnings ratio of 19 is elevated by historical standards. In the past, defense companies would trade towards 10-13 times earnings. A valuation contraction remains a possibility if market conditions deteriorate moving forward. Over the next few years, it is unlikely the SP 500 will return record gains because we are near the end of the second longest expansionary cycle in US history.

4190487,68315,2018-07-26T13:36:55-04:00,"The F-35 program is a growth backbone for Lockheed Martin.Q2 results looked good, and the profit outlook for the remainder of 2018 is strong.Cash flows will rise a lot during 2019, which allows for higher shareholder returns going forward.","Lockheed Martin (LMT) has a strong growth outlook over the near as well as over the long term. The F-35 program will be a major tailwind for years, and rising defense spending around the globe will be a benefit as well.Investors get attractive dividends and can expect share repurchases to assume once pension plan contributions decline in a couple of quarters. The company's strong Q2 results underline that Lockheed Martin is on the right track.The F-35 jet, a multi-purpose stealth aircraft, was derived through the DoD's Joint Strike Fighter program. The jet, which will replace several older models in Western militaries, is one of the biggest developments in defense technology ever.The US military alone will spend more than $400 billion on the acquisition of about 2,500 of these jets, and all of them will be produced and sold by Lockheed Martin. This is the biggest contract the aerospace/defense company has ever gotten, and the program will boost Lockheed Martin's sales for years.The most recent deal for 141 new F-35A jets was struck a couple of days ago. The price per plane for this batch will be $89 million, slightly less than the $94 million from the previous batch. The lower price per unit is not a major headwind for Lockheed Martin, though.Manufacturers that produce complicated high-tech products, such as Lockheed Martin, benefit from strong cost-digression via the so-called learning curve effect. With each aircraft/unit that is produced, employees gain experience and get more efficient at manufacturing future aircraft. The same is true for all the suppliers that sell parts for the F-35 program to Lockheed Martin. The rising efficiency and cost-effectiveness, thanks to gained experience, leads to declining unit costs:Illustration of the learning curve, yourarticlelibrary.comIt is to be expected that manufacturing costs per aircraft will continue to decline, and thus it makes perfect sense that the sales price per aircraft will decline slightly going forward. If costs and sales prices decline in sync, the bottom-line contribution per aircraft would remain the same going forward.Thanks to growing output, Lockheed Martin will be able to grow its profits from this program. Lockheed Martin plans to expand its manufacturing capacity over the coming years, in order to be able to produce 160+ aircraft annually by 2023. Even at that pace, it would take about 15 years until all the aircraft for the US military are produced, which shows that this program will drive profits for a very long time.Since the F-35 is not only sold to the US military, but also to international customers, the actual impact this program will have is even larger. On top of the US, there were 8 other original partner countries. Among others, this group includes Canada, Italy, and the UK. On top of that, Lockheed Martin will sell F-35 jets to at least three other foreign customers: Israel, Japan, and South Korea.On Tuesday morning, Lockheed Martin announced its Q2 earnings results, which included earnings per share of $4.05 (up 23% year over year). The F-35 program was one factor that was responsible for a compelling top line performance. Revenues grew by 7% year over year, but the more important thing was that Lockheed Martin upped its guidance for the current year:Source: Lockheed Martin Q2 resultsLockheed Martin sees revenues coming in higher than previously thought, which will, in turn, boost operating earnings and profits per share. Cash flows will, driven by higher profits, also be higher than previously estimated.Based on the updated midpoint of Lockheed Martin's earnings per share guidance ($16.90), shares are trading at 19 times this year's earnings right now.At first sight, the $3.3 billion in operating cash flows look quite low. After all, Lockheed Martin is valued at ~$92 billion, which would mean a price to cash flow multiple of 28. This year's cash flows will be unusually low, though, the guidance number is not reflective of the company's underlying cash generation.We find the reason for this year's unusually low cash flows in Lockheed Martin's most recent 10-K filing:This year's operating cash flows will be lower due to $5 billion in pension plan payments. In the above snippet from the 10-K, we can also read that no further cash funding will be required through the next couple of years (until 2021). On an adjusted basis, Lockheed Martin would therefore have generated $8.3 billion in operating cash flows during 2018.As no cash pension funding will be required in 2019, investors can expect a significant increase in operating and also free cash flows next year. This, in turn, will allow for a sizeable increase in Lockheed Martin's shareholder returns.Since Lockheed Martin's capital expenditures total about $1 billion annually, we can expect free cash flows of ~$7.5 billion during 2019 (assuming a small increase to adjusted operating cash flows, thanks to profit growth). Since the company's dividend payments total about $2.3 billion annually, more than $5 billion would be available for other purposes. Lockheed Martin could use this cash for debt repayments, for M&A, or to repurchase shares.Since Lockheed Martin is holding a relatively clean balance sheet (net debt totals less than 2 times EBITDA), the most likely scenario is that Lockheed Martin will ramp up its share repurchases in the near future.LMT Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Quarterly) data by YChartsThe company has bought back shares continuously for more than a decade, which is highly beneficial for long-term holders. A declining share count increases each share's portion of the company's earnings and cash flows, and at the same time, a lower share count means that the company saves cash on dividend payments (all else equal).With $5 billion in after-dividend cash flows, Lockheed Martin could repurchase more than 5% of its shares next year, which would drive earnings per share up by a mid-single digit pace without any underlying earnings growth.The F-35 program will be a major growth driver for a long time, and investors should not worry about declining sales prices per aircraft. Thanks to the learning curve effect, production costs will decline, and profits from the program should continue to grow as production is ramped up.Higher defense spending in the US, other NATO countries and from allies around the globe is a tailwind for Lockheed Martin as well, as this should boost its other segments in the coming years.The outlook for the remainder of 2018 is positive, and investors can count on massively growing free cash flows in 2019, which should lead to amped up shareholder returns.Author's note: If you enjoyed this article and would like to read more from me, you can hit the ""Follow"" button to get informed about new articles.

Given that we’re very close to this, is there a case for buying the dip at this point?From a business standpoint, Lockheed Martin has continued to see earnings growth as a result of continued demand for the F-35, along with the company continuing to secure contracts with major customers such as NASA. While there was initial apprehension that Europe would seek to replace the F-35 with a European-made competitor, major European countries such as Germany have continued to see strong demand for the F-35. All in all, Lockheed Martin is continuing to thrive in spite of waning geopolitical tensions.Taking this into account, I chose to run a dividend discount model to determine a target price for Lockheed Martin, and the upside that would exist if an investor were to buy at today’s price.I make the following assumptions:Source: Author’s CalculationsWe see that taking these assumptions into account, a price target of $410 is calculated for Lockheed Martin, which marks a 33% upside from the current price or just under a 7% return per year.Depending on an individual investor’s return objectives, we seem to be approaching the point at which buying Lockheed Martin at this price stands to yield significant upside should current rates of growth continue.Looking forward, should we see significant earnings growth when the same is reported later this month, then my prediction is that we will see the stock start to rise from the current price. Investors care about earnings - not geopolitical tensions - and it’s clear that this company has continued to deliver from that standpoint.To conclude, I believe we are now approaching the price point at which Lockheed Martin is standing out as a buy. The sell-off appears to be overdone, and this company continues to show financially strong performance.Disclaimer: This article is written on an ""as is"" basis and without warranty.

4183778,42381,2018-06-25T13:52:48-04:00,"Lockheed Martin is coming off recent highs and has dropped 16.6% as the company is facing various kinds of pressures. Does this make it the right time to buy?I explore what analysts are estimating for the next few years as well as how the market is currently pricing the stock.Using several valuation models, I find that Lockheed Martin’s stock price is undervalued and provide my fair value estimate of $315.05.","Armed conflict, war or the threat of war is likely always going to be mankind's constant companion. The Bible predicts as such, enemies threaten as much! That would make defense stocks like Lockheed Martin (LMT) one of the best long-term investments. On a more serious note now, LMT has taken off since 2013 as the stock had more than tripled since that time. All systems looked good. And recently, the wings got clipped as a global trade war heats up and tariffs threaten orders. Now that the stock has dropped over 15%, is this the right time to pick up shares of this dividend contender? Let's see what the analysis says.To answer this question, let's look at how the market has historically valued LMT. The current PE is 36.5, which is above both its 5-year average of 20.1 (according to YCharts) and its 10-year history of 14.2 (according to GuruFocus.com). However, if you take into consideration the non-GAAP EPS figure, the EPS returns a 22.7 PE, which still remains above its historical ranges but is not so disproportionate. In comparison, LMT's PE is also above the market's and industry's 24.7x.Source: YChartsFrom another perspective, LMT's dividend yield has just bounced off a multi-year low of 2.33% and now sits at 2.64%, which is where it has generally been around for the past few years on average. The dividend yield is well above the industry's average of 1.72% and the market's average of 1.89%. Estimates suggest that the dividend yield will rise slightly and only cross the 3% mark around 2020. Recent dividend increases have held fairly steady at around 10% per year, which would push the forward yield at current prices to 2.91%.Source: SimplyWall.StThe earnings yield is a quick method to determine the valuation of a stock. You can learn more about it here. A value below 6% means that the stock is considered overvalued. In the case of LMT, the TTM EPS is $13.33, and the current price is $302.86, which equates to an earnings yield of 4.40%, suggesting the stock is overvalued.The infographic below further shows that LMT's PEG ratio is 2.5x, which is considered poor value based on next year's expected growth, and its price to book ratio is negative. TTM total assets are valued at $46.63B while total liabilities are valued at $46.82B. LMT has had more liabilities than assets for the past two years.Source: SimplyWall.StTime to see how LMT compares in relation to its competitors. I have selected Raytheon (RTN), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD). Below is a table that compares these companies using several valuation ratios to determine for which company the market is offering a better value.Source: Old School Value, SimplyWall.St, table created by the authorThis comparison shows that LMT appears to be the most overvalued compared to its peers; however, there are some bright spots where it has the best value among its peers, but even in those cases, LMT is overvalued. One of the cases is P/FCF where a typical fair value threshold is 15.0, but the company's P/FCF is 20.5. In comparison, GD appears to offer the best value among this group.Analysts have rated LMT a hold, which has not changed since November 2017. There are 9 analysts with buy or outperform ratings, 13 with a hold rating, and none with a sell or underperform rating.Putting it all together, LMT appears to be generally overvalued.The infographic below shows what analysts are predicting as LMT's earnings per share over the next few years.Source: SimplyWall.StLike many other companies last year, LMT reported an EPS that is deceptive in its value. The company reported core (non-GAAP) earnings of $13.33 per share; however, GAPP results were $6.64 due to the net tax expense the company paid in Q4 of FY2017 to repatriate overseas cash back to the US. Management in January of this year went on to state that its EPS guidance for FY2018 is significantly higher due to tax reform. Management has guided for an EPS of $15.20-15.50.Looking back, LMT grew earnings by 7.67% in FY2017, and management is projecting growth of 14.03% in FY2018 at the lower end of its range. However, it is interesting that analysts are estimating an EPS of $16.08 this year, which is well outside management's range.Below are the analysts' EPS estimates (with ranges) for 2018 through to 2019 along with the year-over-year growth:Source: Reuters, CNN Money, table created by the authorThe company's estimated 5-year growth rate of 7.30% is slightly below its past 5-year growth rate of 7.70%, which shows that it is considerably below the industry's 5-year long-term growth rate of 11.60%.Using the EPS estimates above, LMT is currently trading at 18.8x FY2018 earnings and 16.5x FY2019 earnings. This suggests that LMT is trading under its 5-year historical PE average for its future earnings. If I use the 5-year PE ratio, based on LMT's EPS estimates, the stock would be trading around $323.21 in FY2018 and $368.03 in FY2019. This suggests that the market is discounting the company's earnings of the next two years by 6.72% to 21.52%.Over the next 12 months, analysts are estimating that LMT's median price estimate will be $370.00, which represents a 23.7% upside from the current price. The range runs from a low of $318.00 (6.3% upside) to a high of $410.00 (37.1% upside). This shows that the risk vs. reward is quite favorable given that analysts believe the company is trading below its low estimates.I used a reverse DCF analysis to determine how much the market expects LMT's growth rate to be. With shares trading at $302.86, the market is pricing in earnings to grow at 7.46%. This is well below analysts and more importantly management's forecast for this year, but we also must remember that this is similar to its estimated 5-year growth rate and that the high growth for this year is a one-time event due to tax reform. If the company grew its earnings by 7.46%, then LMT's FY2018 EPS would be $14.32, below management's lower-end guidance for the year, which suggests that the market is cautious about something; likely the trade war and the impact it will have on military purchases such as the F-35.What is my fair value estimate for LMT? To answer this question, I will present additional information using four valuation models: Discounted Cash Flow, Graham's Formula, EBIT multiples, and Absolute PE.The inputs I used for the DCF were a growth rate of 7.3%, discount rate of 7.14% based on the work of Prof. Damodaran's rates for each industry, a terminal rate of 2%, and a starting free cash flow value of $5.3B. This provided a fair value estimate of $296.33.The inputs I used for the Graham's Formula include a growth rate of 7.3%, an EPS estimate of $15.20, and a 20-year AA corporate bond rate of 3.52%. This provided a fair value estimate of $271.70. Please note that the Graham Formula is not the same as the Graham Number and that the formula has also been modified. The explanations of each can be found here and here respectively.The inputs I used for the EBIT model have a conservative, normal and aggressive case. Based on LMT's past 5-year EV/EBIT history, I chose a multiple of 15.1x for the conservative case, 16.7x for the normal case, and 17.7x for the aggressive case. Revenue estimates were $51.33B in each case. This resulted in fair value estimates of $273.24, $306.89, and $327.31 respectively.The Absolute PE is a new addition on my evaluation list. There is much more behind this valuation model than simply comparing the price to earnings of each company being evaluated. The model derives the intrinsic value of a stock based on the earnings growth rate, dividend yield, business risk, financial risk and earnings visibility. The PE multiple used in the model changes depending on the fundamentals of the company based on those five conditions. A stronger company justifies a higher PE while a weaker company will have a lower PE. A detailed explanation can be found here on the Old School Value site.Now those five conditions are combined into three scores: Business, financial and earnings safety. Each of those risks are scored out of 20. The results show that LMT's business safety score is 13/20, which is considered above average, the financial safety score is 13/20, which is considered above average, and the earnings safety score is 13/20, which is also considered above average. This results in a fair value PE of 39.78 and a fair value of $329.80.The table below provides a summary and calculation of the estimated fair value of LMT.Source: Old School Value, CNNMoney, table and other calculations created by the authorBased on these calculations, the average fair value estimate is $316.32, and the median fair value estimate is $315.05. Based on today's stock price, LMT is currently undervalued by 4.02% to 4.44%. I am concerned however of the influence of the analyst estimates because they deviate so much from other estimates. If the analyst estimates are removed, the average fair value estimate becomes $305.59 and the median fair value becomes $306.89. This represents upside potential of 0.90% to 1.33%. In either case, the margin of safety is not exceptional.Below you will find my risk/reward chart based on the information obtained in this analysis. The red and green lines in the price action chart below represent the trading range of LMT based on that growth rate. Obviously, when the stock is near the top line, it is not the time to buy, and when it is near the bottom line, it is time to consider buying.Source: Freestockcharts (daily view)Source: Freestockcharts (weekly view)As you can see in the daily view chart, LMT is inside the buy price box. The slope I drew using a growth rate of 7.3% did not fit the price action of the stock very well. It created a very large channel with few touching points. This could be its reality going forward. On the other hand, I drew the gray lines that match up more closely with the price action. The slope of those lines suggests an annual growth rate of 17.21%. As much as that is within the range of possibilities for this year, it does not appear to be likely beyond a few years out or based on its past. It will be something to monitor.Lastly, here is a graphic I put together to show various price points representing specific percentages of margins of safety based on the conservative estimated fair value.Source: Chart and data compiled by the authorLMT had risen quite considerably over the past few years and the fears of armed conflict with North Korea, Russia, China and Iran helped push the stock higher. Defense spending in the US appears poised to be front and center again as President Trump seeks to build up the military further. All of this is technically good for LMT, which receives a great deal of its revenues from the US. On the other hand, the US can also weaken LMT by its policies. Orders from American military companies including LMT could be reduced or terminated because of the recent imposition of tariffs or the growing trade war. For example, Canada may make it harder or may be on the verge of canceling its purchase of the F-35 while Congress sought to block the sale of the F-35 to Turkey recently.Another positive for LMT is the President's recent initiative to create a space force which could unlock the next major revenue stream for defense contractors if a space race heats up again.There will be no end of conflict in the world in which we live, which is one reason why I see defense stocks as long-term investments. Although LMT is poised to profit from future conflicts, I see the stock being pressured at the moment as the world considers how it will respond to Trump's policies. I continue to wait for the dust to settle a little and for a greater margin of safety to appear.I hope you enjoyed this article.

4183138,103845,2018-06-21T12:59:07-04:00,"Lockheed Martin's stock has been slammed by back and forth trade war banter.Tariffs would hurt the bottom line, but investor sentiment has caused the stock to become severely oversold.At $300 the stock is a clear contrarian buy; some caution is warranted as trade war talks continue.","Like many of its peers in the aerospace and defense sectors, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has suffering from market unease surrounding the talks between US and China of a trade war. From the plot of stock performance of major US defense contractors over the last two months, it is clear that the more traditional defense contractors (LMT,RTN, NOC) have suffered much more than their aerospace peers (BA, UTX). The talk surrounding the issue of a trade war between the USA and both its allies and international trade partners have continued to fuel market volatility since its beginning with President Trump's tweet on March 1st regarding steel and aluminum tariffs. The continuing tensions have caused many of the stand out defense stocks to suffer in an incommensurate fashion, when compared to the market as a whole.Fig. 1: Plot of the performance of major defense/aerospace contractors over the last two months, percent relative to starting price. Note the correlation between the different defense stocks compared to their aerospace focused peers.When considering Lockheed's position, one might think it worse than it truly is. While the trade war rhetoric remains strong between the US and China, it is clear that geopolitical tension is still high despite the Singapore summit with Trump and Kim Jong Un. This will continue to drive sales of key Lockheed products such as the F-35 production and support programs. Lockheed has also been able to use its excess free cash to increase venture capital funding to $200M in addition to investments into startups focused on advanced manufacturing. The development of President Trump's newly proclaimed ""Space Force"" should also increase revenues and open up new contract opportunities. From all this, it is evident that while some investors may be fazed, it is clear that Lockheed leadership is not. Furthermore, with the next earnings release on July 17th, we should hopefully see a runup disrupting the downward market trend into the next month.Fig. 2: Stock performance, past 3 months. RSI and MACD both confirm that the stock is severely undersold, currently resting on the support line at $300. If the stock breaks through, the next clear support lines are at $285 and $275.Yet some may say, given the current state of the market, there are some warnings to consider with investing in Lockheed Martin. The Senate voted to block F-35 fighter jet sales to Turkey, which would have been up to 100 planes or roughly $10B of revenue due to continuing political tensions and Turkey's shifting international policy. If talks of trade wars continue, it may be prudent to wait out an investment in the defense sector as drawn out discussions of tariffs will continue to hurt industrial stocks across the board. However, if the stock breaks through the $300 support line, the next major support line would be around $285. In this worst case scenario, it is unlikely that the stock will stay oversold for long even in this current market.As the stock has crossed below the 200-day moving average for the second time in two years, it is clear that investor sentiment is not strong with defense stocks currently. Yet for a little risk, LMT at around the $300 is a bargain you may not want to pass up. Those optimistic on the sector as a whole should consider adding to their current positions or continuing to hold. For younger investors, this is a great blue chip stock backed by strong fundamentals on a great sale."

It will then give some recent updates on how Lockheed Martin received some excellent free publicity in April and an update on one of the company's high-profile skunkworks projects. It will then remind investors why Lockheed Martin is a good company for dividend growth and remind current Lockheed Martin shareholders that they should block out the noise and hold onto this company's stock during short-term market volatility.Last quarter, Lockheed Martin returned $900 million to their shareholders. The three-year dividend growth rate is 11.37%, while the five-year rate is 12.70%. A healthy dividend yield of 2.47% will help investors who reinvest dividends to create future share growth.Lockheed Martin raised the outlook for 2018 from $15.20-$15.80 to $15.80-$16.10. Second quarter 2018 saw EPS increase 50% compared to the same quarter last year.(Chart provided by Lockheed Martin)On April 14, 2018, Lockheed Martin gained international attention with a successful product launch, the product being launched was 19 Joint Air to Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSMs). These products were launched at a Syrian Chemical Weapon research facility. Along with 57 Raytheon (RTN) cruise missiles, the JASSMs were part of a joint assault from U.S., French, and U.K. Military forces on the Barzah Research and Development Center located outside Damascus Syria.The missiles used in the attack have a low radar cross-section that makes them difficult to detect and is designed to penetrate more than 500 miles into enemy territory. The missiles use a Global Positioning satellite and an internal navigation system to locate targets before striking them with a 1,000-pound penetrating warhead.The success of the product launch gives Lockheed Martin free publicity and heightens public support of their projects.Satellite photo provided by the (Times of Israel)In 2014, Dr. Thomas McGuire, head of Lockheed Martin's Compact Fusion Project, stated that his goal was to have a working Compact Nuclear Fusion Reactor in five years. The prototype system would be roughly the size of a shipping container and capable of powering a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier.In late March, a patent dated February 15th, 2018, filed by Lockheed Martin was discovered by Stephen Trimble, who is the chief of Flightglobal's America's Bureau. Stephen sent out the below tweet after discovering the patent.To see the actual patent, click here.There have been comments in recent articles about Lockheed Martin and the effect the Government debt will have on the company's long-term sustainability. The U.S. Government contributed 70 percent to Lockheed Martin total revenues in 2017, and the U.S. is roughly 20 trillion in debt.However, the American President and Commander in Chief of the U.S. Military has addressed this concern and should give comfort to investors who may be concerned about the increasing U.S. National Debt.On June 22, 2016, then Presidential Candidate Trump told Norah O'Donnell in an interview that aired on CBS This Morning:Presidential Candidate Trump later explained why he would never default on the U.S. Government national debt.On the CNN show ""New Day"", Trump told Chris Cuomo,A report by Reuters released April 30, 2018, stated that support for the Democratic Party among millennials is decreasing, as this age group increasingly believes Republicans are better stewards of the economy. Millennials are almost evenly split this year over the question of which party has a better plan for the economy. Two years ago, Democrats led this question by a 12-point margin.This is just the latest example of how both political parties need to show they can achieve job creation - especially in this age of automation and outsourcing of American jobs.I have made this point in other articles and will continue to highlight the fact that Lockheed Martin has employees in 590 facilities located every state in America. According to the website careerbliss, the average salary for a job at Lockheed Martin is $71,000, which is 15% higher than the national salary average of $61,000.Government spending budgets for weapons such as the ones Lockheed creates come through Congress, where support is generated and measured in jobs creation for Congressional districts. Throughout the history of Lockheed Martin, they have excelled at gaining Congressional support and creating strategic alliances within the decision-makers of the Department of Defense. By creating high-paying jobs located in multiple congressional districts, Lockheed Martin ensures there will be few politicians willing to vote against funding any Lockheed Martin Project.This interactive map shows the jobs impacted by the F-35 Lightning II Project.The recent price decline in Lockheed Martin stock should be a buying opportunity for long-term focused dividend income investors. Because of current market volatility - I recommend new investors in this company create a plan to average into a position in Lockheed Martin. Current Lockheed Martin shareholders should tune out the noise and sleep well at night knowing they own one of the most secure dividend growth companies in the world. This is one of my favorite companies, and I welcome any comments or questions about Lockheed Martin."
4166875,65113,2018-04-27T12:44:28-04:00,"Lockheed Martin has seen a recent price drop.However, overall earnings have continued to grow.While rapid growth in the defense industry may be waning, Lockheed Martin continues to see client demand grow.In this regard, I remain long this stock and see the recent price drop as a potential buying opportunity.","From a macroeconomic standpoint, one could make the argument that the aerospace and defense industry has reached its peak for the time being.While geopolitical tensions have lifted defense stocks over the past couple of years, this dynamic now seems to be reverting. With talks over nuclear disarmament by North Korea gaining traction, this would - in theory - lead to a retreat for the defense industry.In the case of Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), we see that while the stock had been flirting with highs above $350 recently, the stock has since reverted to a price of $328 at the time of writing:With that being said, Lockheed Martin is a company that will continue to be driven by long-term fundamentals, and in this regard, I continue to remain long this company for the following reasons.Firstly, while there was initial fear that France and Germany would be able to design a formidable competitor to Lockheed Martin’s F-35, the model has still managed to thrive. For instance, the F-35 is still the preferred choice for the German Luftwaffe to replace its Panavia Tornado fleet. This is in spite of objections from Airbus (OTCPK:EADSF) (OTCPK:EADSY), which claim that doing so could potentially endanger military independence that is increasingly being sought by the European Union. However, it is estimated that Airbus would only be able to deliver fifth generation fighter jets by 2030 at the earliest, and while the Eurofighter Typhoon is a contender in this regard, there continues to be clear interest from Germany in securing further F-35 models.Moreover, a common misperception regarding defense stocks in general is that such stocks will only thrive during periods of escalated conflict. This couldn’t be further from the truth. Currently, Lockheed Martin has been awarded a contract from NASA worth $248 million to develop a quieter supersonic jet - the commercial applicability of which could include bringing supersonic flight back to the public as a result of quieter sound emission, which was a key feature that the Concorde supersonic jet lacked. While introduction of this jet commercially is likely far off into the future, the main point is that Lockheed Martin continues to work on contracts that are not directly related to defense, and this has allowed the company to diversify and not make itself overly dependent on demand for strictly defense-based technologies.However, the $31 billion King Stallion helicopter that Lockheed Martin has been contracted to deliver for the Pentagon has been falling behind schedule, and could overshoot the planned deadline by as much as eight months. In this regard, with CH-53K costs up from $95 million to $122 million, significant cost overruns will threaten profitability on the model, and this is a significant risk factor for Lockheed Martin at this time. This has resulted in a slight increase in backlog up to $99.9 billion, up from $96.2 billion at the end of 2016. With this being said, the company has seen an overall positive earnings surprise of 4.62% in Q1 2018, and the recent drop in price could present a buying opportunity in this regard. Should cost overruns not become overly unmanageable, then I see this as a temporary issue that has in any case been known to occur with large projects.Lockheed Martin is what it is - a strong business with an ability to thrive in its industry. While price has dropped, demand for the F-35 remains strong and net sales in Aeronautics, Rotary and Missions Systems, and Missiles and Fire Control are up. While this stock may have dipped, I see the company continuing to perform strongly overall, and the recent price drop represents a potentially good buying opportunity."
4175846,104817,2018-05-21T11:16:11-04:00,Positive start to 2018.F-35 program not at peak yet.Budget Appropriations Can Translate In To Further Growth.,"Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) is a leading company in an attractive market with a capable management team focused on shareholder returns. We were quite surprised by the recent sell-off post the 1Q18 results. We feel that the current market is being tough on prime defense players and tends to favor players at a lower valuation with not-very-attractive end markets. The shares fell as investors were disappointed that LMT did not raise its 2018 cash flow projections even as the U.S. government spends more on defense. Given the clarity on the F-35 program and the incremental gains from the additional spending, we believe this is the right time to BUY the stock and hold it for future gains.Management provided a supportive update on the quarter, full year, and multi-year outlook. They raised revenue guidance to $50.35-51.85B (vs. $50.0-51), on +$150M at Space, +$125M at Aero, and +$75M at MFC, while RMS remained in-line with prior quarters. Regarding the segment operating profit, management raised guidance to $5.315-5.465B (vs. $5.20-5.35B prior), on +$80M at RMS, +$20M at MFC, and +$15M at Aero, while Space remained in-line with prior. And as for EPS, the upper and lower bounds were raised by $0.60 to a range of $15.80-16.10 (vs. $15.20-15.50 prior), with $0.32 attributable to operational performance and $0.28 attributable to tax, the lower rate of which should carry forward. While we note that the cash from operations remain consistent, we can expect a capital raise in the year ahead. LMT's Q1 sales and EPS were well-ahead of the Street and we think that better segment margins ahead led by Rotary and Mission systems will a higher sales baseline ahead.Source: Lockheed Martin Investor PresentationSince Lockheed books revenue on a cost-to-cost basis, we believe this is consistent with management commentary that volumes (i.e. deliveries) will peak in 2023-24. Lockheed also said it expects sustained growth to extend beyond peak production and in addition, the company is set to continue follow-on development, having completed the SDD program. Overall, we do have confidence in the near term F-35 sales growth but there is uncertainty nearer term, as LMT is still working through contentious LRIP 11 negotiations and a cost dispute with DoD. The DoD in early April, stopped accepting delivery of F-35s due to a dispute over the cost of fixing a production error. Friction between DoD and Lockheed is not new but we believe the spat emphasizes DoD's desire to push cost onto Lockheed where it relates to upgrades and fixes for fighter jets that have already been delivered. Lockheed had delivered >250 F-35s as of year-end and many of these jets require upgrades and fixes, including for software, as the program matures. LMT generated $12.9 bn in sales from the F-35 in 2017 though it is unclear how much revenue stems from this work, or the margin, but it is apparent that DoD is seeking to reduce its own exposureAccording to LMT, the 2018 Appropriations Act included about $7B for LMT programs (F-35, C-130J, helicopters, missile production) above the FY18 budget request. However, the firm still hasn't changed its outlook for: (1) 2018's operating cash flow (still $3B+); (2) 2018-20 cumulative OCF (still $17B+); and (3) 2019-20 organic sales growth (still 4-5%). We believe that this incremental $7B would translate into new contracts and therefore, sales. We believe the FY18 budget will prove to be the baseline for future modest increases, leaving room for LMT to see stronger sales/earnings over the next several years. The additional money will help the Navy buy 14 new ships, the Air Force 90 F-35's and the Army will receive dozens of new helicopters, which can be a boon for LMT's Sikorsky program.We derive our price target based on a premium 2018E P/E multiple relative to Defense peers, applying ~21x to 2018E EPS of $16.3. We attribute this to a host of factors including above-average margins, solid growth, and we appreciate the visibility afforded by the F-35 over the coming decade and the utilization of FCF in a shareholder friendly manner. We expect the shares to trade in the range of $350-$360, in the next twelve months.Downside risks include cuts or delays to the F-35 program, lower-than-anticipated C-130 demand, headline risk on major programs, and defense sector under performance."

President Trump's recently signed budget bill includes approximately $700B in funds earmarked for the military.The US government is Lockheed's largest customer - by far - which means a decrease in military spending would pose challenges to the business.With a national debt that is rapidly climbing, a curb on government spending could become a campaign point as the 2018 and 2020 elections approach.With funds needed for deteriorated roads, bridges, and water infrastructure throughout the nation - the amount of military spending that is currently celebrated by the administration could become a target in mid-term elections.","A massive $1.3-trillion dollar budget bill was signed into law by President Trump recently. The bill includes a whopping $700B set aside for military spending. This uptick in defense spending is a boost for defense technology companies such as Lockheed Martin (LMT) which gets a very large portion of its revenues from the United States government. Investors should be cautious, however. The aggressive spending that has carried through the Bush, Obama, and Trump administrations has ballooned national debt to levels that do not seem sustainable over the long term. With the country in a current state of tension and division on many issues, the 2018 and 2020 elections could be hotbeds of political discourse that will likely include discussions on national spending. As a huge part of the budget, the military is an obvious target for spending cuts in the future. Such events would be damaging to Lockheed Martin and its peers.Lockheed Martin has long enjoyed a strong relationship with the US Government. The revenues of Lockheed Martin have largely correlated with US spending because approximately 59% of Lockheed Martin's revenues come from doing business with the US Department of Defense, and another 12% come from aerospace programs such as NASA. This means that 71% of Lockheed Martin's revenues come from the United States government in some form or fashion.Source: Center For American ProgressLMT Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsAs the US continually spends more on these programs, the revenues of Lockheed Martin have followed over the years. The recent signing of a $1.3 trillion dollar budget with a record-setting $700B defense budget will obviously bode well for Lockheed Martin. While competition for those funds is fierce between Lockheed Martin and its small circle of industry peers, (General Dynamics (GD), Raytheon Company (RTN), The Boeing Company (BA)) the moat is virtually impenetrable beyond that point. Only a select few companies have the relationships, security clearance, and resources to provide for the government defense program, and I would wager that the government will always maintain an ""American only"" policy when it comes to procuring its technologies.The long-term issue for Lockheed Martin is how the United States debt problems can impact spending over the long term. These effects on spending would have a direct impact on Lockheed Martin.Source: crfb.orgWhen President Trump took office, the US debt represented the highest percentage of US GDP since Harry Truman was president in 1945. The combination of entitlement programs (Medicare, etc.) and interest expenses on national debt now makes up the largest portion of the US budget, overtaking the spending on the military. This was before the recent $1.3-trillion dollar budget was signed that cranks up defense spending to $700B, the largest budget figure in history. The $700B in defense spending slots the military in at approximately 54% of the new overall federal budget.The boost to military spending feeds into past trends of a US government that continually spends more on defense than any country in the world.Source: CNBCIt is pretty easy to argue that the national debt level is becoming an increasingly larger problem over time. The government's interest expense for its outstanding debt in fiscal 2017 was $458B. Similar to a company or household that overleverages itself, the interest payments will begin to choke the functionality out of the government's operations. You end up with a cash flow problem. Obviously, the government of the United States needs to remain solvent.This is not a political piece, and one could very easily argue that the federally funded entitlement programs such as Medicare, etc. are also very expensive and inefficient. The reason I am focusing on the military is the upcoming elections. This year are the midterm elections, where all 435 Congressional seats and 34 seats in the Senate will be up for grabs. With how widespread the impact of entitlement programs would be felt by the majority of the public, military spending becomes an easier target.The country has been highly divided since the beginning of the Presidential race, and there is a lot at stake for both sides. Currently, Republicans control all branches of government, which is sure to drive strong voter turnout as sensitive topics including taxes, gun control, and immigration have been constantly in the headlines.The US debt will become harder to ""kick the can down the road"" as time passes. Democratic parties could decide to pair the tax reform bill with a fat spending budget and label the current plan of action as being inadequate to deal with debt bubble. Especially since the highly leveraged state of the government leaves it vulnerable to another recession. A pullback in military spending could gain public support during election season. The ratio of spending that the military accounts for compared to other countries makes it an easy target.The call to action could be loud. There are other facets of government spending that will need to be addressed. The state of the country's infrastructure is in pretty bad shape. This adds yet another complication to an issue that revolves around the country that simply spends too much.Lockheed Martin wouldn't feel the full impacts of any spending cuts right away. Contracts are developed and awarded sometimes years in advance. According to Lockheed's fourth-quarter earnings, it currently has a backlog of approximately $100B. A cut in spending would likely impact longer-term shareholders.For example, if we take 2017 revenues (this isn't quite apples to apples because a lot of this is awarded well in advance of the fiscal year, but it allows us to quantify things a little bit), we can deduct based on the revenue mix that approximately $30B of Lockheed's $51B of 2017 revenues came from US Military contracts. If the government cuts 20% of its military budget (would still be the largest in the world by far), Lockheed would stand to take a hit of about $6B assuming Lockheed's share of US Defense business remained constant. This is more than a 10% hit on Lockheed's revenues.Another likely side effect would be a step-up in competition for contracts (which are already insanely competitive among industry peers). Competitive activity is always bad for margins, so Lockheed Martin would stand to see some margin pressures as well. These factors present a bit of risk for a stock that is already trading at 22X this year's earnings, and yielding near its lowest on free cash flow in a decade. As an investor who builds positions in companies with long holding periods in mind, I see a lot of long-term risks here.LMT Free Cash Flow Yield  (TTM) data by YChartsUltimately, it just may be too soon to panic about serious downside to Lockheed Martin. It is a fantastic company, locked into the lucrative business of war. However, smart investing is like playing chess and you need to look two-three moves ahead. The writing is on the wall for a major inflection point with America's debt load.The next couple of years will see what are likely to be tense mid-term elections, and with the recent passage of major tax reform, the status of the economy and the national debt load will likely be a discussion point.For as great as Lockheed Martin is and has been to investors, the company's lack of revenue diversification makes it susceptible to a catastrophic event such as major cutbacks in the US military budget. There is a degree of risk in this scenario, and I don't see a margin of safety built into shares. While I wouldn't pound the table to sell Lockheed Martin today, future developments regarding the US debt load require strong attention to detail."
4174841,103845,2018-05-16T17:17:54-04:00,"Stock remains oversold after recovering from a sharp price drop following the Q1 2018 earnings report.
        High cash flow, coupled with steady growth from the F-35 program and other segments as geopolitical tension internationally remains high points to positive financial health.
        Get in while it's cheap! A promising contrarian investment waits for those who are ready to take a ""risk"" on a established blue-chip defense stock.","I previously covered Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) on December 2017 before Q4 2017 earnings , and after facing a sharp drop-off following a good Q1 2018 earnings report, I think that the stock remains a great buy and undervalued in the long run. Given the stable revenue stream that defense contractors enjoy, the geopolitical tension in the Middle East only serves to grow both domestic and international sales across Lockheed’s product lineup.After a little less than a year and a half under the Trump administration, not much has changed on the outlook for the defense sector. Lockheed Martin maintains strong cash flow and maintains long term growth potential across the different sectors, driven by sales of F-35 and international sales to US allies. Aeronautics sales make up roughly 40% of revenue; much of the growth in this sector is attributed to increased volume since production has begun. Other sales include modernization programs for older aircraft and maintenance. Particularly with increased tensions in the Middle East and North Korea, missile defense system sales are projected to keep growing. The year-on-year increase over Q1 last quarter was 8%; I expect this trend to continue to hold steady or increase.Earnings from United Launch Alliance (ULA) contributed about 32% of profit for the Space sector in Q1 2018. Despite competition from the encroachment of low-cost rival SpaceX, ULA still maintains some economic moat from contracts military payloads and other classified intelligence satellites. ULA’s Delta IV has more capacity than the Falcon 9 and is able to take large satellites as far as high geostationary orbits; the Atlas V which competes with the Falcon 9 also maintains a perfect mission success rate. Capturing the majority of future rounds of military contracts from the Air Force and the National Reconnaissance Office should still be a high priority for ULA. Even if SpaceX receives a few contracts, until the Falcon Heavy is flight-tested and proven, ULA will still be able to corner the launch market for high budget classified projects.The ability to maintain more than $3B in cash from operations after a $5B pension contribution is another indicator of the great cash flow that Lockheed is currently enjoying and should benefit investors with continued dividends and stock buybacks. While the outlook for Q2 is marginally increased from previous guidance, sales outlook has been increased by $350M across the 4 major divisions. The reduced corporate tax rate should continue to allow Lockheed to increase their already high cash flow levels.Future price drops could be precipitated by news of scaling back of the F-35 program and reduced purchase orders. However, under current projections, even as the F-35 program begins to ramp up delivery, there is potential for years of steady demand domestically and healthy demand internationally among NATO allies to counter next-gen fighters out of Russia and China.Regarding the recent price drop after the earnings report, it is clear that the stock has gone through a period of strong selling. At the current point, the RSI indicates that the stock is still oversold; in terms of the price of the stock, it is below the 200-day moving average. This corresponds to the price of the stock back in August; for those investors on the fence who thought the ship had sailed, this is a great contrarian purchase from a solid blue-chip company.Fig.1: A plot of the price over the last 3 months, with the RSI (relative strength index) plotted below. The dark green line at $330 indicates a previous support line; continued growth is contingent on the stock developing momentum to break through (source).In conclusion, I believe Lockheed Martin remains a great purchase; a stable stock with a competitive 2.5% dividend make for a strong argument in a volatile market. High cash flow, with some diverted towards share buybacks and dividends, remains a positive indicator of financial health. In a sector where revenue is synonymous with developing the best products and securing defense contracts, Lockheed Martin continues to succeed. An illogical price drop following a positive earnings report presents investors with an excellent time to add on to an existing position or to retake a position in this stock."
4159874,103360,2018-03-29T09:16:11-04:00,"Lockheed Martin's stock has been rapidly appreciating in the last few years, and that creates a dilemma for investors who try to predict whether Lockheed Martin can continue this strong growth.The Omnibus spending bill, passed into law last week, allotted $144.3 billion for military equipment procurement, and projects developed by Lockheed Martin will get a generous amount of this budget.This company should appeal to dividend growth investors, as they will provide stable dividend growth for many years.","There is no doubt Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has made a lot of shareholders happy in the last few years with its rapid stock appreciation and a healthy dividend payout. This article explores why I think Lockheed Martin will continue to provide value for long-term shareholders, and why this is one of my favorite stocks as a dividend growth investor.The five-year stock chart of Lockheed Martin is more beautiful than the company's new F-35 aircraft. A chart this pretty is an anomaly these days, as many sectors are under pressure from rising interest rates, government over-regulation, and threats from industry disruptors like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).Chart provided by (Morningstar)Last quarter the company took a 1.9 billion one-time charge in 2017 due to charges related to tax reform. The 2017 earnings were $13.33 before the one-time charge for tax reform. Earnings before the one-time tax write-off were $1.16 higher than the EPS in 2016. The tax write-off is the difference between the current P/E ratio of 50.6, rather than the forward P/E of 21.8.I own Lockheed Martin because of their impressive record of dividend growth. The company's 5-year dividend growth rate is 12.98%, and there are multiple reasons I believe this trend will continue.On Friday March 23, President Donald Trump signed the 1.3 trillion Omnibus spending bill. This bill allocated $144.3 billion for military equipment upgrades and procurement. The Pentagon will gain an additional $61 billion in funding over what it received last year. Highlights of the bill that will positively affect Lockheed Martin top line growth will include $10.2 billion for 90 F-35 fighter jets as well as $1.1 billion set for UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters.President Trump had words of praise for the F-35 that will please Lockheed Martin shareholders: ""the most sophisticated aircraft in the world… They're hard to find, they're hard to see, therefore they are hard to beat. It's very tough to beat a plane when you can't see.""Five years ago, international purchases accounted for 17 percent of Lockheed Martin sales. That number rose to 30 percent last year.These numbers are expected to continue growing given the security cooperation agreement signed between the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in May of 2017. This agreement has the potential to produce $28 billion of new sales for Lockheed Martin. Saudi Arabia intends to purchase a wide range of military equipment - including air and missile defense systems, combat ships, helicopters, surveillance systems and tactical aircraft.Most other growth companies must adapt to innovation in order to stay relevant; that is not true for this company. Lockheed Martin currently has a $100 billion backlog of orders that will provide stability to the growing dividend.The growth in military spending will benefit all defense contractors for the next few years, but the defense industry is cyclical, and at some time in the future, there will be discussion about cutting defense budgets. This is the scenario that will make Lockheed Martin happy they decided to invest in this company instead of others within the defense sector.Lockheed Martin is the biggest defense contractor to the US government. The company employs workers in all 50 states. This is not just a trivia fact that the company can brag about on their website, but a powerful wedge for prominence in the spending pie. Government spending budgets for weapons such as the ones Lockheed creates come through Congress, where support is generated and measured via healthy employment rates for Congressional districts.Lockheed Martin has excelled at gaining congressional support and creating strategic alliances within the decision makers of the Department of Defense. I recommend reading the book Prophets of War for more information about how actual spending decisions are created and how most of the deals Lockheed Martin engages in with the Department of Defense result in profits for Lockheed. Even when they fail the company still gets paid.Photo provided by Space Coast Daily at the announcement of 500 jobs in Orlando with an average wage of $87,064 per employee.I believe there are many reasons Lockheed Martin stock can benefit dividend growth investors. For investors trying to determine the best time to buy stock in this company, I would remind them to remember one of the greatest quotes by Warren Buffet - ""It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price."" Lockheed Martin is a wonderful company which will create stable dividend growth far into the future - so the best time to buy is now."
4155656,64423,2018-03-12T14:30:58-04:00,LMT has been one of my longest core holdings.Current metrics indicate LMT has further upside to run.LMT remains the best pick in a tremendous segment.,"I grew up as a kid who was obsessed with aerospace, taking classes in Aeronautical Engineering, infatuated with model and R/C planes, helicopters and rockets, playing with the earliest computer flight simulators, all with the long term goal of one day becoming a Naval Pilot. Years later my eyesight would deter this goal, but nevertheless, my first love was always flight.My second love - as possibly the nerdiest kid in the entire world at the time - was the stock market, and I very much loved to grab the often immediately discarded business section of the Star Tribune off the ground and scan through the markets data pages, looking for the previous day's closing price for the handful of stocks I knew by ticket symbol, reading the news of markets and companies, keeping up to date with the latest trends.Imagine the nerdiness that would ensue the winter of my 8th grade year when our Social Studies Teacher started our class in a state-wide stock market challenge! He had promised this to us at the onset of the school year, but being no more particularly patient then than I am now, I felt like the time would never come. January of 1994 would eventually come and the challenge was upon us! Our class was subdivided into teams of four and we were supposed to work together to come up with stocks to invest in (or short), provide our transactions at the end of the session and wait!I was quite puzzled that my three teammates did not share my lust for the game and mostly spent the time talking about things not stock market related! With annoyance I would fill out our proposed transactions after each team session and this went on for a couple months without much happening - until April 5, 1994 - when it was announced that Grumman had accepted Northrop's merger offer over a lesser offer made by Martin Marietta. Unfortunately 24 years is a long time and I do not remember the exact composition of our portfolio at the time, but I had a combination of short and long positions on Grumman and Northrop at the time, and our team launched into the top 10 of the state overnight. I had basically been playing the entire defense/aerospace sector in various ways under the noses of my teammates, who now, all of a sudden with the focus of attention, each decided to become a great deal more interested in the transactions our team had been making and gone was my unilateral ability to do whatever I wanted with our fake money. Instead of buying and selling and shorting my fake F-14 Tomcats and fake F-16 Fighting Falcons and fake F-15 Strike Eagles we were buying a lot more fake Nike's and fake Coca-Colas and fake Big Macs. We still finished in the Top 20 by the end of the year though, so the Grumman/Northrop deal still sits atop my mantle as the best trade I ever (didn't actually) made - or, more accurately, found myself accidentally on the correct side of somehow.In the winter of 2009-2010, when I began composing my new investment portfolio strategy, Lockheed Martin (LMT) was one of the very first holdings I picked up and has remained one of my favorite core holdings since, being the absolute very last one to be sold when I had to liquidate during Q1 2015, and now appearing as the highest weighted initial holding in my Pretty 30 strategy. Looking at the general Defense Contractor/Aerospace sector as a whole LMT has consistently stayed a step ahead each time I have sat down to compare the metrics, which I will do again now.Comparing Apples to Apples (and Oranges, and Bananas and Pickles) is not an exact science in the sector[s] that LMT and its competitors work within. Nominally each are listed as ""Aerospace/Defense Products & Services"" (except NOC, which is one of 6 in the Aerospace/Defense Major - Diversified subsector), but each are similar to each other in only a limited amount of ways with each having their own specialties and capacities and core product suites. There are 37 companies currently listed in this subsector but I will limit my comparison to those that are most often put side-by-side of LMT:Name/Ticker Dividend Yield Analyst Rec Score PEG RatioLockheed Martin (LMT) 2.35% 2.40 0.56Northrop Grumman (NOC) 1.26% 2.00 2.13Boeing (BA) 1.93% 2.10 1.90Rockwell Collins (COL) 0.96% 3.10 2.45General Dynamics (GD) 1.08% 2.00 1.86Huntington Ingalls (HII) 1.09% 2.60 2.03Raytheon (RTN) 1.49% 1.80 1.28United Technology (UTX) 2.09% 2.30 2.80Out of the above surface metrics I use universally 3 of the 7 (ex-LMT) pass, with those close to the cutoff being on my ""Shuttle Squad"" (stocks that could move into the Pretty 30 depending on future metric shifts).Organizing the list by each of the metrics would put LMT in the top spot for both Dividend Yield and PEG Ratio, and 6 of 8 for ARS (analyst recommendation score). The tradeoff here, by placing LMT ahead of its direct competitors and sector mates, is getting both the advanced dividend yield and benefit of future growth. One of the things that comes up a lot is the $100 Billion backlog for LMT and this is most obviously apparent in the PEG.BacktestI originally purchased LMT in the first two weeks of December 2009, and the below chart shows the period covering December 1, 2009 to present compared to the S&P 500. The below charts do not take into account reinvested dividends.LMT data by YChartsUnfortunately for me my investment in LMT really had just started to run by the time I was forced to sell near the beginning of Q1 2015. Compare this to the rest of those compared above.LMT data by YChartsSecondly, this chart originating from HII's spin-off from NOC in 2011:LMT data by YChartsThe above charts are instructive in that almost every single member of the above class beat the S&P 500 (SPY) over the same term, with BA, NOC, and HII doing better than LMT as well.UTX, on the other hand, lagged the SPY in both time periods by a not-insignificant amount. ROC ended both virtually tied with the SPY. Both have been eliminated via the Metric Screen above, and now backtesting has confirmed that at this time they deserve no further consideration in this analysis.Conclusion of Comparison AnalysisAs previously explained, I have historically been very overweight Defense/Aerospace, and based on the above backtest may have been wrong in focusing 100% of my sector exposure from Q4 2009 - Q1 2015 into LMT. A wider sector exposure including at least NOC, BA, and eventually HII would have been much more profitable over the same time period.All 3, with the addition of GD and RTN, remain within my Coverage Universe and on my ""Shuttle Squad"", meaning each will eventually be given fuller consideration of joining my Top 30 picks for accumulation.LMT is no spring chicken nor is it a wallflower with no attention going its way. On the other hand, LMT is one of the more widely followed stocks on Seeking Alpha and elsewhere, so no lack of coverage or opinions exist. It is not lost on me that most recent coverage going back to Q4 2017 has been to varying degrees cautiously bullish to extremely so, and I feel myself much more toward the extremely bullish side.Forgive my George Clinton & Parliament Funkadelic reference, but it is no secret to anyone what War is really good for. General Smedley Butler (two time Medal of Honor recipient) was possibly further ahead of his time than even he could have imagined more than 80 years ago when he declared ""War is a Racket"".It is interesting to me in backtesting I have found not that I was wrong in my thoughts on the Defense Industry in general, but instead I was merely wrong in focusing so intently on my favorite name in it all. A more spread bet would have paid out much better, as it turns out in retrospect. Past performance does not betray the future, however, and in this instance I am still satisfied with my choice to focus on accumulating shares in LMT now while I wait for a chance to probably do the same with NOC, HII, BA (which I do not really consider a ""defense industry stock"" in the pure sense), GD and RTN. Alongside BA I will eventually be looking at Embraer (ERJ) and AAR (AIR), as I think those are truly similar comps.How different the world (and many of our portfolios) may have ended up looking if the merger between NOC and LMT had gone through in 1998? For me, at least, one less difficult decision to make every so often.As William Stamm recently said, LMT is ""a great total return defense company but quality does not come cheap"". And this is a characteristic shared throughout the comparison class above - no cheap lunches, with LMT (on a PEG scale) possibly the ""best value"" over time.I certainly agree with this assessment that ""Lockheed Martin stock will continue to rise"" as I believe the cliche here: The Sky Is the Limit! Defense Contractors have a whole host of unique challenges in their particular business, and any could present a troublesome bump in the road at any time, but LMT's flagship project - the F-35 - is the connecting glue that will prevent any sort of political unraveling in the near to long term.More to this point as illustrated wonderfully in the above linked article - LMT has almost 100% political cover due to the 50 state saturation of its 100,000 headcount workforce. Cynically (and what could be more cynical than disagreeing with George Clinton?) paraphrasing Milo Minderbinder in Catch-22, ""What's good for the syndicate is good for everyone"". In this case replace ""the syndicate"" with LMT and ""everyone"" with ""politicians"" and you are squarely on target.Damon Verial actually makes the case that not only is LMT a ""Defense Sector"" stock but that the stock itself is quite defensive to downward swings in the market and exhibits under-reaction to negative market news. LMT has shown incredible resilience during broad-market drawdowns.Based on the PEG Ratio I find myself in disagreement with Yanni Lodato's assessment ""...LMT does not offer an enticing value proposition; however, the company's stock price may be depressed further in lieu of recent market fluctuations and provide an enticing buying opportunity"". I do not think the chances for a more advantageous price range to begin accumulating LMT are likely in the short to medium term. Exacerbating that is the just mentioned defensive nature of LMT's share price during market gyrations.LMT remains not only the highest weighted stock in my Pretty 30 portfolio, but a member of a sector that I will be focusing and following far into the foreseeable future. The metric case for LMT remains head and shoulders above its most immediate peers, but whether that will turn into more appreciable gains forward going (as compared to the demonstrated backtest) in comparison to NOC, BA and HII is uncertain.My current 12-month target price for LMT is 401.34, a 15% increase from the most recent closing price of 340.49. Even reaching that price in that time period, with the growth rate estimate staying stable or increasing, should still provide a favorable PEG environment to continue accumulation for some time."
4146426,86786,2018-02-14T04:12:59-05:00,"When you compare LMT to its competitors, you see consistent underreactions to bad news, making it a stable choice in the defense sector during volatile times.
        The recent earnings report implies excess growth for the current quarter.
        LMT is a good choice for growth and consistent dividends if you are looking for something with a bullishly biased risk/reward profile in this sector.","Lockheed Martin (LMT) has been highly volatile lately, suddenly trading in a $40-wide trading region, a significant upgrade to its usual $10-wide region. Investors are skeptical of just how beneficial the surrounding announcements – e.g., the Trump administration’s increase to the defense budget and LMT’s patriot missile sales contracts – will be to the stock. LMT is not without an abundance of catalysts that could swing either positive or negative in the short term – and those swings would have mid-term to long-term consequences. LMT shares could fly – or they could drop.You don’t need to be a prophet to make your decision on LMT, however. Remember: investing is a probability game: We are betting that the stock we buy now will be worth more in the future. But this is not a binary question; a low probability of a rally coupled with a high probability of a fall can still necessitate a buy if we know the potential fall is small compared to the potential rally.As a matter of fact, after Trump’s signing of the new budget, which includes increased defense spending, on February 9, I began looking for good defense stock plays. In my watchlist, which holds my top 30 stocks for the current month, were two defense stocks already – the other was United Technologies (UTX). I compared the two, as I only wish to focus on a single play of this sort, and decided to go with LMT.One of the reasons I like LMT is its safety. I am no smarter than the average investor, so I don’t have any special foresight on whether these budget and contract changes will have a significant impact on LMT’s bottom line. I do, however, have the backtest results that show LMT is pretty bolstered from the bottom, whether it falls or flies high only to fizzle.When you compare LMT to its competitors, you see consistent underreactions to bad news. Case-in-point: the 2007-2008 financial crisis. This situation below, in which the major defense stocks are compared during a market drawdown, is indicative of most quick selloffs in this sector:This shows that LMT is not only a defense stock but also a defensive stock. Your money is protected better by LMT than other defense sector choices and it’s still earning you ROI via dividends because of its proclivity to trend sideways when others are falling. Note the positive Cagr and Sharpe ratio, the only positives in this list.The max drawdown is only 11%, which many would interpret in the bigger picture as a skewed risk/reward profile: LMT’s upside is certainly more than 10% when you include the recent changes in the company’s business opportunities and the economy’s expected growth in the defense sector. At least, LMT has a 1:1 risk/reward (linear). Of course, a linear risk/reward can be modified to a convex risk/reward with the proper options strategy; however, I think the risk/reward is likely already convex, as the recent earnings report implies strong growth.To be more specific, I ran my earnings sentiment algorithm on LMT’s Q4 2017 earnings call to find a highly positive sentiment. LMT showed sentiment 20% higher than the average. For more information on my algorithm’s functionality, read a more in-depth earnings analysis article of mine, such as the recent one on Twitter (TWTR).I will pull a few choice lines, as flagged by my algorithm, which imply excess growth for the current quarter:“ Building on our 2017 record investments in capital expenditures and research and development, we will increase our commitment in these areas by a combined $200 million in 20189 as we continue to invest in the assets required to efficiently execute our business as well as the technologies needed to drive long-term growth.”-Research and development budget increases after previous increases imply both strong cash flow and possible positive ROI from the initial R&D actions. Most R&D lead to sustainable – or at least long-term – growth when enacted during a growth phase. Companies in their growth phase, in which they are increasing investment in themselves, tend to post excess returns versus companies in the balance sheet repair phase.“Projected EPS for 2018 is significantly higher than 2017 due to the lower tax rate, higher segment operating profit and improved FAS/CAS outlook.”-The reasoning behind “significantly higher” EPS meshes with the current developments in the economy and LMT’s deal-making. Thus, the EPS to which LMT was alluding here is actually an underestimation, meaning we should again raise our earnings expectations for 2018. This increase has not fully been priced into the stock, according to the stock’s recent movements (divergent).“Sales exceeded $15 billion in the quarter, rebounding as expected from the lower than planned sales in the third quarter resulting in $51 billion in sales for the year.”-This implies we sit at an actual rebound phase in this metric, sales. The predictions from management, that sales would rebound, proved true, making their other predictions more reliable. Expect both EPS growth and sales growth in 2018.LMT currently offers a 3% yield, which is sustainable and tied to a stock in a growth phase. Still, the stock has not priced in the current events or earnings, implying that LMT still trades at a discount. Because investors see volatility as risk, LMT’s stock is unlikely to quickly converge on its true price, leaving informed investors quite a bit of time to get in before the inevitable rally.Disappointments are possible, such as the sudden contract changes endemic in this industry, but these disappointments will not hurt LMT as hard as they would, say, Boeing (BA). LMT is bolstered as a defensive stock, and even market crashes don’t dent the stock. I imagine the dividend and yield has a part to play here, as LMT has proved its dividend payments are reliable and a consistent source of income for investors, regardless of the economic times.As much as I hate to make long-term purchases, LMT is looking pretty tempting. Chances are the shares will begin leaking volatility soon, and everyone else will pile on. While I’ll hate to see the volatility go, I’ll be happy to be holding LMT before this happens – and you should too.Notes:Note: Get my articles as soon as they are published by clicking the big orange ""follow"" button at the top of this page.

4148211,63883,2018-02-20T05:20:43-05:00,"Boeing and Lockheed Martin have compelling dividend growth records.However, they differ in the dividend growth rate, dividend yield, and payout ratio.The long-term growth outlook and the slightly lower valuation make Boeing look a bit more attractive right here.","The aerospace and defense industry has a lot of attractive companies investors can put their money into. Two of the biggest companies in the industry are Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT).Lockheed Martin is a Dividend Achiever, a group of stocks with 10+ years of consecutive dividend increases. You can see the entire list of all 261 Dividend Achievers here.Both companies are popular among dividend growth investors, although they differ in some ways. In this article, we'll try to examine which is the better choice for different kinds of investors.LMT data by YChartsEven though their share prices are almost the same, Boeing's market capitalization is roughly twice as high as Lockheed Martin's.Lockheed Martin's business is focused on developing and producing weapon systems and related products. This includes aircraft, helicopters, missiles and missile defense systems, and many more.(Source: Lockheed Martin presentation)Lockheed Martin also has a space segment, but that is responsible for less than 20% of its total revenues. The company thus has a clear defense focus, which is a major growth industry.Boeing, on the other hand, generates the majority of its revenues by selling commercial airplanes, whereas only about 25% of the company's revenues are derived from defense, space and security.BA Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsOver the last couple of years, both companies have grown their revenues by a couple of percentage points a year, with revenues being a little bit lumpier at Lockheed Martin.Both companies should be able to produce ample revenue growth going forward, though, as both benefit from positive tailwinds. Boeing, which operates in a duopoly in the commercial aircraft market, is poised to benefit from growing demand for its products around the globe. The company expects that it will be able to sell into a multi-trillion dollar market going forward:(Source: Boeing presentation)A $7.5 trillion market opportunity over the coming decade means that Boeing's total addressable market is about $700-800 billion a year going forward. As the company is currently grossing about $90 billion a year in revenues, the growth potential is immense.Even when we do not factor in the defense & space market and focus on just commercial airplanes and services, we see that a 25% market share would mean about $140 billion in annual sales.This growth in Boeing's key markets is driven by rising passenger numbers around the globe, but especially in Asia. The Chinese market alone will require more than a trillion dollars worth of new airplanes over the coming 20 years, according to Bloomberg.Lockheed Martin does not profit from this mega-trend, but it has other factors working in its favor. This includes the F-35 program, which is currently ramping up and which will be the most expensive weapon system program ever (at a cost of more than $400 billion). As the manufacturer of the F-35 jet, the company is poised to profit from the ramp-up of this program, as well as from the service & parts contracts that will run for decades.Lockheed Martin, along with other defense contractors, is also benefiting from increased defense spending in the US. Defense spending is rising by about ten percent a year in the next couple of years, and as a key supplier, Lockheed Martin is poised to benefit from that.Brewing conflict in the Middle East and on the Korean peninsula also means that other countries, such as South Korea, Japan, Qatar, the UAE and many others, are upgrading or expanding their military equipment. Since these countries are mainly focused on purchasing aircraft, missile systems as well as missile defense systems, Lockheed Martin is able to sell a lot of equipment to them.The growth outlook for both companies thus looks positive, but for Boeing it may be a little bit more foreseeable in the long run. Since Lockheed Martin is heavily dependent on government purchases, it is not so easy to forecast whether sales will be substantially higher in 10 or 20 years. Boeing, on the other hand, will continue to benefit from the fact that the globe is becoming ever more connected, which means rising air travel and thus more demand for new commercial jets.BA Dividend data by YChartsBoth companies have a solid dividend growth record, although the dividend growth story is more consistent at Lockheed Martin. The company has been raising its dividend very consistently, whereas Boeing's dividend growth rate has been fluctuating a lot more.The dividend yields are 1.9% (Boeing) and 2.2% (Lockheed Martin) right now. Boeing's slightly lower dividend yield is compensated for by a substantially higher dividend growth rate, though. When we compare the payout ratios, we get the following picture:BA Total Dividends Paid (TTM) data by YChartsBoeing has paid out 30% of its free cash flows over the last year, whereas the payout ratio at Lockheed Martin is 42%. Due to a substantially lower payout ratio, Boeing is thus able to keep its dividend growth rate at a higher level going forward. If Boeing would pay out 42% of its free cash flows as well, its current dividend yield would be 2.7% - significantly more than that of Lockheed Martin.In the above example, I calculated with a 10% dividend growth rate for Lockheed Martin (in line with the recent history) and with a 15% dividend growth rate for Boeing. Even if Boeing's dividend growth rate comes down substantially from the level it has been at over the last couple of years, its yield on cost would surpass Lockheed Martin's in a couple of years.For dividend growth investors, Boeing thus looks a little bit more promising right here, even though its dividend growth history is not as consistent as Lockheed Martin's.Free cash flows are substantially higher than earnings for both companies. This is at least partially due to the impact the changes in tax legislation had on each company's non-cash items, such as changes in deferred taxes. Since dividends are paid with cash, it makes sense to value each company based on the cash flows they are generating.BA Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YChartsBased on the above numbers, Boeing trades at 18.4 times trailing free cash flows, whereas the multiple is 19.4 for Lockheed Martin. When we take a forward view, the comparison is a bit more in favor of Boeing. Boeing expects 2018's free cash flows to come in at $12.8 billion, which means a forward free cash flow multiple of 16.6.Lockheed Martin's free cash flows, on the other hand, will be lower going forward, as the company will increase its pension distributions. Starting from 2019, its free cash flows are poised to increase again, though, thus investors interested in Lockheed Martin should not worry about that too much.BA EV to EBITDA (TTM) data by YChartsThe enterprise value-to-EBITDA multiple, which accounts for different cash positions and debt levels, is almost exactly the same for the two companies. Overall, it thus looks like Boeing is slightly cheaper (due to lower free cash flow multiples and positive FCF growth in 2018), but not by a wide margin.Both Boeing and Lockheed Martin look like attractive companies. They are both highly profitable dividend stocks in the industrial sector. You can see all 747 dividend-paying industrial stocks here.They both have a strong dividend growth record and a positive long-term outlook, but if I had to pick one I would probably favor Boeing. The company is less dependent on government deals, and thus, its growth is more visible over the coming decades. On top of that, Boeing is slightly cheaper than Lockheed Martin, and its high dividend growth rate (and low payout ratio) should make up for a slightly lower initial dividend yield."
4147860,104122,2018-02-16T17:30:49-05:00,"Lockheed Martin has demonstrated stellar performance over the past couple years.  The company has performed well as a result of good investor relations, strategic initiatives, extensive growth, and steady global demand.Lockheed Martin's government spending dependency, increasing competition, uncompelling value proposition, and adequate balance sheet remain investment reservations.Lockheed Martin's sustained growth and profitability, rising global demand, impeccable track record, and advantageous political environment make it a great defense stock with exceptional growth potential.","Source: Lockheed Martin ImageLockheed Martin (LMT) stands out as a stock to own in 2018. LMT's phenomenal growth, dividend, more advantaged tax position (given the recent corporate tax reduction from 35%-20%), and defensiveness during a market correction make it a very compelling investment opportunity. LMT's stock price performance throughout 2017 was comparable to its performance over the past five years; LMT boasted continued price increases of 24.51% in 2017, 17.93% in 2016, and 12.33% in 2015. Source: Lockheed Stock ChartGrowth/ProfitabilityLMT stands out for its growth and profitability. The company has exemplified outstanding growth with historical EPS growth, projected EPS growth, current cash flow growth, historical cash flow growth, and return on equity that far outpaces peers. LMT continues to be a stable cash generator helping the company in its cash deployments. At the end of 2017, LMT generated cash from operations worth $6.5 billion, a 24.8% year over year increase. The company ended 2017 (on Dec 31, 2017) with $99.9 billion in backlog, up from $96.2 billion as of the end of 2016. Advantageous Political ClimateThe current Republican administration under Donald Trump will prove advantageous for defense stocks due to increased budgetary allocations for defense spending. Senate leaders have reached a two-year deal that would set defense spending at $700 billion for 2018 and $716 billion for 2019.Good Investor RelationsLMT has demonstrated favorable investor relations through dividends and share buybacks. LMT has a dividend yield of 2.31% surpassing the industry average of 1.73%. The company's dividend has been stable and increased over the past 10 years. LMT recently bought back 7.1 million shares for $2 billion. In 2017 alone, LMT offered prodigious ROE of 176.42%. Global Conflict Potential A military altercation with North Korea is increasingly likely given North Korea's emboldened missile launch displays and public boasting of nuclear weapons capabilities. Although a global conflict is undesirable, if a missile is directed at the United States or other impermissible action is taken, a military conflict could ensue. This would be advantageous to LMT as defense spending would increase. Steady Global DemandLMT has witnessed strong global demand for its equipment especially with regard to the company's C-130J aircraft in France/Germany, helicopters in Poland, and defense system demand in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Strategic InitiativesLMT has undertaken a number of strategic initiatives. The defense firm has acquired Sikorsky Aircraft and its Blackhawk helicopter business. During fourth-quarter 2017, LMT experienced a revenue increase of $445 million as a result of increased sales from the Sikorsky Rotary and Mission System segments. Additionally, LMT increased its ownership in AWE management limited, a business that deals with the United Kingdom's nuclear deterrent program. Fundamentals LMT provides an adequate balance sheet and is priced at an expensive valuation.Source: LMT Value ComparisonF-35 Reliance LMT exhibits a weakness in the company's F-35 fighter plane revenue reliance. In 2016, LMT had a 23% revenue weighting in its F-35 series fighter planes, a percentage which will likely increase in the coming years. President Trump previously expressed criticism over the F-35 program due to its exorbitant cost. As a result of this, LMT was forced to reduce the price per plane to $85 million or less by 2019. Although LMT continues to win large government contracts for its F-35 program, depressed plane pricing and increased cost structure may impede the company's profitability.Government Spending DependencyAccording to 2016 figures, LMT derives 70% of its revenue from the U.S government, closing aligning revenues with U.S defense spending. Decreases in defense spending or cost-cutting efforts have the potential to precipitate large headwinds for the company. Increasing CompetitionLMT is facing increased competition from competitors such as SpaceX within the military space sector. Although LMT had previously dominated the space, SpaceX has made significant advances in the space segment, building far more advanced and cheaper rocket technology than LMT. LMT continues to face competition from competitors such as Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) in winning defense contracts and surpassing peers in innovative technologies. Value Proposition/Fundamentals At the current evaluation, even for its given industry, there is no getting around the fact that LMT is expensive. Buying LMT now imposes greater risk as its current evaluation does not confer a margin of safety; however, at the same time, what LMT lacks in value it compensates for in profitability and growth. LMT's offers industry beating return on equity, cash flow growth, and 3-year revenue growth. LMT exemplifies great momentum; the stock has experienced a 12-week price change of 12.64% and higher earnings per share estimated changes over the next 1, 4, and 12 weeks. Beyond LMT's fundamental growth characteristics, even before Congress increased the defense budget, LMT was doing phenomenal. At the end of January, LMT far surpassed analyst earnings projections and offered better than expected earnings guidance for 2018. LMT's attractive momentum and growth proposition is the current basis for investment as the company's capitalization on strategic initiatives, the defense-oriented Republican government, escalation of global conflicts, and steady global demand will continue to push growth for the company. Even though LMT does not offer a great value, it is very appealing to growth investors and will likely provide a buying opportunity in the future for more conservative value-oriented investors as all stocks are subject to short-term dips and fluctuations. Although I had mentioned that LMT's fundamentals are adequate this is not concerning as it falls in line with other companies within the aerospace and defense industry. High debt levels, increased liabilities, and low liquidity is characteristic of defense stocks as vast amounts of capital are utilized in development, material expenditures, inventory, and the human capital required to engineer innovative defense systems and equipment.Government Spending Dependency/ F-35 Concerns/Competition In principle, it is often considered disadvantageous to invest in companies who obtain a large percentage of revenues from any one single source. Given that LMT obtains a significant amount of its revenue from the U.S government, this is not exactly reassuring as it aligns company performance with U.S defense spending. However, investors can take reassurance from the current Republican-dominated administration; defense budgetary allocations have increased by 10% and Republicans are more inclined to be proactive and supportive of defense initiatives. Even despite cost optimization efforts on fighter planes, LMT's extensive lobbying presence in Washington in tandem with supportive congressional sentiments will minimize political resistance and help further growth. LMT is also no stranger to competition, the company has coexisted with peers Boeing, Northrop Grumman, and various others for decades. Continued cost optimization, strategic acquisitions, and innovative technologies will sustain LMT's competitive relevance.Lockheed's sustained growth and profitability, rising global demand, impeccable track record, and the current defense-oriented U.S Republican political climate, make LMT a defense stock worth owning. LMT will sustain increased growth in lieu of strategic global initiatives, stable cash flow deployment, innovative products, and potential global conflict escalation. LMT's adequate fundamentals are not overly concerning as LMT's fundamental position is not uncharacteristic of its given industry. LMT's government spending dependency is not an overwhelming concern as even though there may be slight buying price modifications to LMT's products, increased defense spending, and enthusiastic political defense sentiments will carry to the company's favor. LMT's diversification across a number of sectors ranging from Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control, Rotary and Mission Systems and Space Systems help to alleviate concerns of F-35 headwinds. Presently, LMT does not offer an enticing value proposition; however, the company's stock price may be depressed further in lieu of recent market fluctuations and provide an enticing buying opportunity.

4142116,65113,2018-02-01T09:40:53-05:00,"Lockheed Martin has shown very impressive dividend growth over the past decade.The stock is currently yielding more than some of the existing ""dividend aristocrats"".Moreover, the dividend growth and payout ratio look quite attractive.I am long this stock and will continue to collect the dividend.","I have owned Lockheed Martin (LMT) for 1.5 years now, and the stock has provided me with quite a good return within that time.It is also notable that this stock has crafted a very good reputation for itself as far as dividends are concerned.Currently, the stock pays a yield of 2.41%, with consecutive dividend increases for the last 15 years:Source: dividend.comIn comparison to the industrial goods average yield of 1.04%, this is quite impressive - especially taking Lockheed Martin's significant growth in price over the past couple of years. So, could this stock actually become a ""dividend aristocrat"" in the future, and is it worth holding it long-term for income purposes?To clarify, a dividend aristocrat is one that has raised its dividend for 25 consecutive years or more, so Lockheed Martin is 10 years away from achieving this feat. Another particularly interesting article on Seeking Alpha elaborates on some of the requirements that a dividend investor should look for in a stock before deciding whether to hold it.In particular, the four important characteristics of a solid dividend-oriented stock are as follows:Let's evaluate Lockheed Martin on these characteristics.If you buy Lockheed Martin today, you are getting into the stock at a yield of 2.41%. We can see that this is higher than the yield that its competitors are currently paying:Moreover, if we take a look back over the longer-term, we see that the yield on this stock has sometimes reached nearly as high as 5%.On this front, Lockheed Martin has two things, in particular, going for it. Firstly, we see that the payout ratio has stayed within an acceptable range of below 50% for much of the period from 2000-2017, and this can make investors more confident that Lockheed Martin is reinvesting significantly into the business.Moreover, we see that Lockheed Martin is currently paying a higher yield than several other ""dividend aristocrats"":Lockheed Martin has grown its dividends per share by 73% in the past five years - and while dividend growth has moderated in recent years, we see robust appreciation for the periods 2008 to 2012 and 2013 to 2017:2008 to 20122013 to 2017Lockheed Martin has certainly shown a lot of growth over the past few years. The company is a leader in the defense sector and has gained from favorable trends in the industry over this period. I have already elaborated on many of the drivers behind this growth in previous articles and won't rehash them extensively here, but with the F-35 program continuing to allow this stock to significantly outperform earnings expectations in the previous quarter, I am optimistic on the company's prospects for this year.In terms of whether this stock is affordable right now, let's look at the company's price/earnings and price/free cash flow metrics.We see that while this company is clearly expensive on a price to earnings basis, it is trading significantly below highs on a price to free cash flow basis. Therefore, this stock is still trading at a good price for those who wish to hold for income purposes.Lockheed Martin has shown a high degree of sustainable growth in the past ten years. With the company having shown strong performance, I see it as possible that this stock could well be joining the elite group of ""Dividend Aristocrats"" if it continues on this path. I am long and will continue to collect the dividend regardless of what price does in the near-term."
4141756,68315,2018-01-31T13:39:56-05:00,"Lockheed Martin's F-35 program will be a big cash cow for the company going forward, especially as fighters will be sold to an increasing number of nations around the globe.Increases in the US defense budget, demand for missile defense systems by countries surrounding North Korea, etc., allow for a solid growth outlook.Cash flows are poised to rise to record highs in 2019. Shareholders can thus expect that shareholder returns will remain significant going forward.","Lockheed Martin (LMT) is poised to remain on a growth track, which, combined with strong shareholder returns, makes shares of the company an attractive long-term investment.Lockheed Martin is a prime investment in the defense sector, which is poised to benefit from tailwinds such as US defense budget expansion and tensions in several places around the globe.Lockheed Martin has not shown high revenue growth rates over most of the last decade:From 2008 to 2016 revenues remained relatively flat, but about two years ago things started to change. The biggest factor was the F-35 program which is poised to produce several hundred billions of dollars in revenues for the company in the long run. Lockheed Martin is in no way overly dependent on F-35 revenues though, as all aeronautics revenues (which include sales from the C-130 program and others) make up just 40% of Lockheed Martin's sales.There is a high chance that the company will be able to continue to grow its revenues going forward due to a number of contributing factors:The first one is that total US defense spending will (likely) grow substantially over the coming years - from $634 billion in 2017 to $716 billion in FY 2019 ($668 billion in 2018). This 13% defense budget increase will lead to significantly higher sales for weapon system producers such as Lockheed Martin, as system procurement is where a lot of the additional money will flow to.It is unlikely that the Pentagon will focus on increasing the number of US forces members meaningfully, which means that a higher budget will allow for updates to existing systems as well as the purchase of new systems. This also is what the Pentagon hints at:source: washingtonpost.comAs a tier 1 weapon systems supplier to US forces Lockheed Martin will benefit from increased purchasing activities. Due to the fact that 2019's budget is even higher than 2018's budget there's a good chance of ongoing year-over-year growth for Lockheed Martin's top line.In addition to higher sales to the US government, Lockheed Martin's products also are facing growing demand in other geographic regions around the globe.A pretty clear example is the Korean peninsula, where North Korea's missile ambitions lead to growing demand for defensive missile systems by neighboring countries.One such example is Japan's plan to acquire the Aegis missile defense system (parts of which are supplied by Lockheed Martin), and another one is South Korea's interest in the THAAD missile defense system. Countries around North Korea are not only updating their defensive systems, they also are interested in upgrading or expanding their offensive capabilities.South Korea, for example, plans to purchase another 20 F-35 jets in addition to 40 previously ordered ones, which means higher revenues for Lockheed Martin. Japan also is interested in increasing its strike capabilities and may purchase Lockheed Martin's JASSM-ER missiles in order to be able to strike targets in North Korea if necessary.Around the Persian Gulf (where tensions are high as well) Lockheed Martin's products are finding willing customers, too: Some of the US' partner nations are interested in purchasing F-35 jets. When we add in possible sales of F-35 jets to countries such as Belgium, Germany and many more, the fighter could become a great source of revenues for Lockheed Martin going forward.Lockheed Martin is heavily dependent on its defense operations, but on top of that the company is generating about $9 billion in annual sales with its space business segment and may return to the passenger aircraft market in the future.source: Lockheed Martin's 8-K reportLockheed Martin's cash flows from operations totaled $6.5 billion during 2017, which was a big increase over 2016's $5.2 billion in operating cash flows.The guidance for 2018 calls for just $3 billion in operating cash flows, which sounds pretty bad compared to last year's number, but which is impacted by a one-time item:source: Lockheed Martin investor presentation2018's operating cash flows will be dampened by $5 billion in pension contributions, but in the following years cash generation will reach new record highs.Thanks to the rising cash flows from the F-35 program as well as underlying growth in other segments Lockheed Martin is guiding for $7 billion in cash flows in 2019 as well as in 2020.Lockheed Martin's capital expenditures averaged around $1 billion a year over the last decade. I thus believe that there is a good chance that Lockheed Martin will hit about $6 billion in annual free cash flows beyond 2018.This means that, based on my FCF target for 2019, Lockheed Martin is trading at roughly 17 times next year's free cash flows, which does not sound like an excessive valuation for a high quality company in an industry with secular growth tailwinds.On top of that Lockheed Martin's high cash flows allow for substantial shareholder returns, which were a main factor for the company's strong performance over last year's performance. Let's look at the following chart:We see that Lockheed Martin's market cap has risen by 130% over the last decade (8.6% annual growth rate), but that growth rate was obliterated by the total returns shareholders received over the same time frame (16.4% annual rate).The big discrepancy can be explained by two factors:- Lockheed Martin's dividend, which combines a solid dividend yield (2.3% currently) and a compelling dividend growth rate (12% annually over the last five years). This allowed for a steadily rising share count as long as dividends were reinvested.- Lockheed Martin's share repurchases:Over the last 10 years Lockheed Martin has repurchased a third of its common stock, which has resulted in a significantly higher portion of the company's net worth per each share that remained in investors' hands.With about $6 billion in annual free cash flows from 2019 onwards, Lockheed Martin will very likely continue to reward shareholders substantially via a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Since the dividend costs about $2 billion a year (not factoring in future dividend increases), Lockheed Martin will have sufficient cash flows to repurchase a meaningful amount of shares (about 4%) each year.Lockheed Martin reported strong revenue and earnings growth rates a couple of days ago, but the more important factor is that results will very likely be even better going forward.As the F-35 program ramps up (partially due to sales to partners around the globe) sales and cash flows will grow further, and with conflicts brewing in several areas, the demand for Lockheed Martin's products will likely remain very strong going forward.Shares are trading at roughly 23 times this year's forecasted earnings, which is not a low valuation. But due to the fact that Lockheed Martin is a high quality company with great shareholder returns I believe that this valuation is not too high, either.Long-term focused investors who are paying about 17 times next year's free cash flows should be rewarded plenty in the long run by this premium defense company if they enter or expand a position right here.Author's note: If you enjoyed this article and would like to read more from me, you can hit the ""Follow"" button to get informed about new articles.

The Trump-election hasn’t changed this position. As published on December 14th, 2017:But it is not only the F-16; apparently the C-130 Hercules and helicopters are involved. As published on November 29th, 2017:A large number of F-16 operators in Asia and the Middle East can be maintained, supplied or overhauled in India. These are for example Oman, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Iraq, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore and maybe even Taiwan. The referrals to the “global (…) base” may indicate that all F-16 operators worldwide will be supported from India.Industry cooperation and developing export markets is a strange recommendation for the military to make. Off-shoring (essential) parts of the defense industry is dangerous. When production needs to be scaled up because of war, this is much harder or impossible to do.Production in India may become a liability with the increasing tension with Pakistan. Trump has stopped aid to Pakistan and Pakistan announced that it will return 1.5 million refugees to Afghanistan. This will heat up the already very hot conflict in Afghanistan, where the U.S. commitment is increasing without an end-date.However, for the defense industry this will be very profitable. Wages in India are much lower than wages in the United States. Assembly, production and MRO [maintenance, repair, overhaul] in India will increase profits. Lockheed-Martin is most likely the first to go to India. They will benefit most. After them other companies will follow. Boeing, being the largest defense exporter - as the Lockheed-Martin: India Tailwinds shows – could be a possible second since they are the largest exporter to India.Footnotes1. The Sikorsky S-92 is a development to watch. This is a Chinese-US Joint Venture. Since China and India have long-lasting conflicts with regard to the borders, it is unlikely that they will agree to this."
4132081,24992,2017-12-15T09:29:35-05:00,"Shares are trading at a 10% discount to the overall market.Dividend has grown an average 11% per year over the last five years.If we assume a future dividend growth rate of 9% per year, our growth model shows a 11% total return on the shares to 2021.ChartMasterPro upward target price of $338.00.","Although the shares of Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) are up about 26% over the past twelve months, they still represent good value in my opinion, and investors would be wise to consider buying at these levels. I’ll go through my reasoning below by focusing in on the financial history here, and by making a forecast of future prices based on what I expect from the dividend.Although there is some choppiness in the revenue and net income at Lockheed Martin, it is far from egregious. For example, in spite of some gentle chop, the top line has grown at a CAGR of 3% over the past five years, and net income has grown at a CAGR of about 14% over the same time period. Concurrent to this is the fact that earnings per share from continuing operations, and dividends per share have grown consistently over the past five years, with the former up at a CAGR of 12%, and the latter up at a CAGR of about 11%.The dividends per share rises have been aided by an aggressive share buyback program, as the company has reduced the share count at a CAGR of about 1.6% for the past five years. At the same time, the company has returned about $16.5 billion to shareholders since 2012 ($7.9 billion from buybacks, the remainder from dividends), which I consider to be critical. This is critical in my view because management must be shareholder friendly as the alternative almost guarantees a loss. The good news for shareholders is that management at Lockheed Martin seems to be very shareholder friendly in their orientation.Turning quickly to the balance sheet, there is admittedly a relatively high level of debt present, but I’m less concerned about it than I otherwise might be for a few reasons. First, most of it (~75%) is due in 2023 or later, which is beyond the scope of my forecast horizon. Second, the interest rate is relatively moderate at 4.6%. This is sustainable, and given that the firm earns a higher after tax return than this on their capital, it may not make sense to pay down debt aggressively. Although the financial history here is quite bright in my view, investors are obviously more concerned about the future than the past. It’s with that in mind that I must spend some time forecasting. Whenever I do this, I engage in a ceteris paribus assumption, meaning that I hold all variables constant but one. In this case, I’m going to “move” the dividend, while holding everything else (i.e.yield) constant.Over the past five years, the dividend per share has grown at a CAGR of about 11%. While I consider this to be a reasonable growth rate going forward, especially in light of the low payout ratio of 60%, I prefer to be more conservative in my estimates. For that reason, I’ll forecast a growth rate for the dividend of about 9% from here. When I perform this forecast, I infer a CAGR for the shares of about 11% over the next four years. In my view, this is a very reasonable rate of return given the moderate risks present.As per our ChartMasterPro Daily Trade Model, the trend for LMT would turn bullish with a daily close above $320.00. This would signal a bullish breakout from an Ascending Triangle on the daily charts. From here, we see the shares climbing to the $338.00 level over the next three months.We will buy LMT call options that will provide us with approximately 15x leverage on our long trade on the next daily close above $320.00. Our initial stop-loss exit signal will be a daily close below $315.00.For investors in the shares, we recommend that you hold for three months or $338.00, whichever comes first. For longer-term investors (years, not months), we believe LMT is a solid addition to any dividend growth portfolio over the next four years.In my view, investors should strongly consider buying Lockheed Martin at the moment, while the shares continue to trade at approximately the valuation of the overall market. In my view, this is a company that deserves to trade at a premium, and investors would be wise to buy in before the overall market realises its mistake."
4125939,98446,2017-11-17T12:04:54-05:00,"Lockheed missed EPS and revenue estimates in the third quarter.
        LMT did raise EPS and revenue guidance for the year.
        The company has returned more than 70% of cash from operations to shareholders.
        Lockheed Martin has raised dividends for 15 consecutive years.
        LMT sits just above my desired price target.","Over the last two weeks or so, I’ve spent a lot of time looking at the Aerospace and Defense sector. The sector's gain of 30% in 2017 has almost doubled the S&P 500’s return. While I am bullish on the sector, I felt that Raytheon (RTN) and Northrup Grumman (NOC) are overvalued at current levels. I found General Dynamics (GD), on the other hand, to be undervalued. Which camp does Lockheed Martin (LMT), a name my wife and I own in the March to Freedom Fund, fall into? Defense spending by the United States government is expected to be approximately $600 billion next year. As the world’s largest military weapons manufacturer, Lockheed Martin stands to be a major beneficiary of this spending increase. Let’s examine the company’s third quarter earnings report to find out if the stock is trading at an attractive valuation.LMT reported Q3 earnings numbers on 10/24/2017. Earnings per share were $3.24, a 10% drop from last year’s number. This number also missed analysts’ expectations by 2 cents. EPS were down primarily because the company had a nice gain after taking a controlling stake in the Atomic Weapons Establishment in the United Kingdom last year. Adjusting for this one-time event, earnings per share were down a few pennies on a year over year basis. Revenue came in at $12.17 billion. This was a 5.4% increase from Q2 2016, but still missed estimates by $640 million. Management did mention that the company’s backlog now exceeds $100 billion. Even with the miss on EPS and sales, Lockheed’s management raised their 2017 outlook EPS figure to $12.85-$13.15 from $12.30-$12.60. Revenues expectations were raised to $50 billion - $51.2 billion from $49.9 billion - $51 billion. As you might recall, management had previously raised these figures in the Q2 conference call. Aeronautics drove much of the company’s sales growth. Aeronautics is responsible for making fighter jets and military transport air craft such as the F-35 Lightning II and the C-130J Hercules transport plane. The F-35 was credited as being a major reason this division saw 14% growth year over year. Aeronautics is predicted to generate more than 40% of revenue in 2017. Rotary and Mission Systems, which will likely account for less than a third of 2017 revenues, grew 3% in the quarter. This division houses combat ships and naval electronics as well as Sikorsky’s Black Hawk helicopters. Missiles and Fire Control grew 3% in Q3. Missiles and Fire Control develops and produces a wide range of missile systems, such as the THAAD and JASSM tactile missile programs. Space Systems, which makes satellites and space transportation systems saw a slight decline of 1% from last year’s third quarter. MFC and Space Systems make up the remaining 30% or so of revenues for LMT.During the quarter, the company generated $1.8 billion from operations. LMT returned $1 billion of this to shareholders, split evenly between dividends and buybacks. The following graphic shows the company’s 2017 capital return through the end of the 3 rd quarter. Source: Lockheed Martin’s 2017 Q3 Earnings PresentationYear to date, Lockheed has seen almost $5 billion in cash from operations. The company has returned 72% of this cash to shareholders, almost equally divided between dividends and buybacks. The company expects to make as much cash or more in 2018 as they will in 2017. And that is after you include a $1.6 billion contribution they will make to their pension program. From 2015 to 2017, Lockheed Martin expects to generate $16.5 billion in cash. Even after more than $3 billion in pension fund contributions, LMT is forecasting $16 billion in cash generation from 2017-2019. Lockheed Martin's ability to generate free cash flow is very impressive. From this pile of cash, the company can buy back more stock, make an acquisition or increase the dividend. Lockheed Martin has raised dividends for the past 15 years. Over the past 5 years, the average raise has been almost 16% a year. The most recent raised, announced on 9/28/2017, was for just under 10%. With the company planning to create a lot more cash from operations, the company’s ability to keep raising dividends looks very good. Time to examine the company’s evaluation to see if the stock is worthy of being bought. F.A.S.T. Graphs says the current PE is 24, with the average price to earnings multiple over the past 5 years coming in at 15.6. By this measurement, LMT is 35% overvalued. CFRA recently raised its 1-year price target $30 to $370. Based off the 11/16/2017 closing price of $312.65, shares are trading at a 18.34% discount to target price. CFRA’s fair value is $213.21, a 31.81% premium to the recent closing price. Morningstar recently raised their fair value $5 to $284. Shares are at a 9.16% premium to closing price. Average these numbers out and I find shares to be more than 14% overvalued. I am usually only willing to pay 5% above what I think is fair value. Because I feel that LMT is best of breed in the aerospace and defense sector and that the company will be major benefactor of increased defense spending in the coming years, I think Lockheed Martin is poised for future growth. For LMT, I am willing to ignore the price to earnings multiple. Taking the average of CFRA’s target price and fair value along with Morningstar’s fair value estimate, I find shares to be about 7.5% overvalued. Under $305 and I’ll be adding to our small position in LMT.What are your thoughts on LMT? Is there another stock in this space you prefer? Feel free to leave a comment."

Lockheed Martin is the largest aerospace company in the world. LMT is an investment for the total return investor who also wants some income, which both can grow as the defense budget is increased.When I scanned the five-year chart, Lockheed Martin has a good chart going up and to the right in a good steady slope. In a good economy, LMT really shines like in the year 2013 and 2017. This is the kind of chart I like to see.LMT data by YChartsFundamentals of Lockheed Martin will be reviewed on the following topics below.I use a set of guidelines that I codified over the last few years to review the companies in The Good Business Portfolio (my portfolio) and other companies that I am taking a look at. For a complete set of the guidelines, please see my article "" The Good Business Portfolio: Update To Guidelines and July 2016 Performance Review"". These guidelines provide me with a balanced portfolio of income, defensive, total return and growing companies that hopefully keeps me ahead of the Dow average.Lockheed Martin passes 11 of 11 Good Business Portfolio Guideline, a good score (a good score is 10 or 11). These guidelines are only used to filter companies to be considered in the portfolio. Some of the points brought out by the guidelines are shown below.The Good Business Portfolio Guidelines are just a screen to start with and not absolute rules. When I look at a company, the total return is a key parameter to see if it fits the objective of the Good Business Portfolio. Lockheed Martin passes this total return guideline against the Dow baseline in my 48.0-month test. I chose the 48.0 month test period (starting January 1, 2014, and ending to date) because it includes the great year of 2017, and other years that had fair and bad performance. The great total return of 146.01% makes Lockheed Martin a great investment for the total return investor that also wants a steadily increasing income. LMT has a above average dividend yield of 2.4% and has had increases for 10 of the last ten years with good dividend growth making LMT also a good choice for the dividend investor. The Dividend was increased September 2017 to $2.00/Qtr. from $1.82/ Qtr. or an 10% increase.DOW's 48.0 Month total return baseline is 53.88%Click to enlargeFor the last quarter on October 24, 2017, Lockheed Martin reported earnings that missed expected by $0.02 at $3.24 and compared to last year at $3.61. Total revenue was higher at $12.70 billion up more than a year ago by 5.4% year over year and missed expected revenue by $640 million. This was a fair report with the bottom line decreasing and the top line increasing. The next earnings report will be out late January 2018 and is expected to be $3.56 compared to last year at $3.25 a good increase.Lockheed Martin is one of the largest aerospace companies in the United States and foreign countries.As per ReutersOverall Lockheed Martin is a good business with 13% CAGR projected growth as the United States and foreign economies grow going forward, with the increasing demand for LMT's products. The good dividend income brings you cash as we continue to see further growth as the defense business grows.The FED has keep interest rates low for a number of years and I believe that they will go slow in 2018 which should help keep the economy on a growth path. If infrastructure spending can be increased this will even increase the United States growth going forward.From October 24, 2017, earnings call Marillyn A. Hewson (Chief Executive Officer, Chairman and President) saidThe graphic below shows the F-35 which will bring in good cash flow as production increases.Source: Lockheed Martin Web siteThis shows the feelings of top management for the continued growth of the Lockheed Martin business and shareholder return with an increase in the future growth. LMT has good growth and will continue as the foreign economies grow and demand for America's defense products increase.Lockheed Martin is a great investment choice for the total return investor with its above average dividend yield and high total return. Lockheed Martin will definitely be considered as a buy when a slot opens up in The Good Business Portfolio, but will I do not want to overweight defense since the portfolio has a large percentage in Boeing which is 1/3 defense. If you want a growing dividend income and good total return in the industrial business LMT may be the right investment for you.The Good Business Portfolio trims a position when it gets above 8% of the portfolio. The four top positions in The Good Business Portfolio are, Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) is 8.6% of the portfolio, Altria (MO) is 7.0% of the portfolio, Home Depot (HD) is 9.2% of portfolio and Boeing is 11.6% of the portfolio, therefore BA, JNJ, and Home Depot are now in trim position with Altria getting close.Boeing is going to be pressed to 11% of the portfolio because of it being cash positive on 787 deferred plane costs at $316 million in the first quarter, an increase from the fourth quarter. The second quarter saw deferred costs on the 787 go down $530 million a big jump from the first quarter. The second quarter earnings were fantastic with Boeing beating the estimate by $0.25 at $2.55. The third quarter earnings were $2.72 beating the expected by$0.06 with revenue increasing 1.7% year over year another good report. S&P CFRA raised its one-year target to $272.JNJ will be pressed to 9% of the portfolio because it's so defensive in this post-BREXIT world. Earnings in the last quarter beat on the top and bottom line and Mr. Market did like the growth going forward. JNJ is not a trading stock but a hold forever.For the total Good Business Portfolio, please see my article on The Good Business Portfolio: 2017 3rd Quarter Earnings and Performance Review for the complete portfolio list and performance.

4129775,103845,2017-12-05T13:11:08-05:00,"Lockheed Martin has a great position in missile defense, and the overall financial picture looks good from the perspective of fundamentals.Technical indicators are bearish after last week's dip. It begs the question of what it will take for the stock to recover.Going into Q4 earnings, the health of the stock will largely depend on Lockheed's ability to win back the trust of investors.","Lockheed Martin (LMT) is the largest US defense contractor, with a wide portfolio of products offered. Currently, Lockheed’s Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile is the only US anti-missile defense system that's capable of targeting incoming ICBM warheads upon re-entry. Currently, Lockheed has an ongoing $528M contract for THAAD systems, with has expanded to over $1B between the system costs and the support contract.I believe that missile defense revenue will continue to grow, especially as the US and its allies move away from a boots on the ground to a tactical strike methodology employed by the Obama administration. Additionally, as nations such as Iran and North Korea work on strike capacity, anti-ICBM capability will see strong demand, particularly from US allies in the Middle East and Asia. For example, North Korea’s most recent missile testing has analysts believing that the newest iteration has a potential range of 13,000 km, up from the July test which demonstrated a potential range of 10,000 km. That would give the missile the range to cover most of the continental US, depending on warhead weight, not to mention most of Asia.The ability to combat ICBM strikes puts those in the US defense network at an advantage and gives much needed peace of mind. As the sole provider of anti-ICBM technology in the NATO bloc, the missile defense products that Lockheed offers add to the already substantial economic moat that it maintains. As part of the record $104B backlog that Lockheed reported for Q3, I believe Lockheed will have no problems continuing to grow revenue. Missile defense is simply a much smaller component of the larger, seemingly optimistic picture.Source: LMT Q3 Earnings SlideThe technical analysis of the stock in the near term indicate another story, one of unsteady investor confidence. After last week’s dip, the stock has not quite stabilized. One explanation for the recent sell-off could be profit taking from major institutional holders after receiving the dividend. The RSI and OBV both indicate that the stock is oversold. The ADX is helpful in illustrating that the price has not stabilized into a stronger trend. The stock is dangerously close the previous support line at $310, and it cannot find momentum. I think investor confidence will continue to fall with the stock.Plot of LMT price over one month, with Relative Strength Index (RSI), On Balance Volume (OBV) and Average Directional Index (ADX). Full size available here.As we wait for the Q4 earnings report in late January, I think that the market will recognize the oversold position the stock is in currently and correct in time. However, if the timescale for recovery is large, the stock could continue to slide sideways without much gain. Overall, it remains to be seen how Lockheed’s Q4 report turns out. Under-performing on back-to-back quarters will reflect badly on the company’s current financial health and will push investors to consider other options in the defense sector.After taking a beating last week, the technical indicators are still bearish. Yet, I believe that the company is fully capable of turning things around. In the long term, Lockheed has been able to continue to deliver sustained growth year to year, and the dividend yield of 2.55% is an added bonus. I would recommend investors keep an eye on this stock in the near term leading up to Q4 earnings and to also keep in mind Lockheed’s excellent track record on delivering consistent growth."

Lockheed Martin has excellent fundamentals in a booming Sector.","There are multiple reasons I believe Lockheed Martin (LMT) will continue to create shareholder value. These include political unrest, existing government contracts, and repairs to current airplanes and helicopters. Job creation will be the biggest factor in the favor of Lockheed Martin to continue creating dividend growth. Throughout their long history this company has excelled at gaining Congressional support, and creating strategic alliances within the decision makers of the Department of Defense. The fact that they supply 97,000 jobs located in all 50 American states will allow this company to continue increasing dividends well into the future.This company has solid fundamentals with room for future dividend growth. The 5-year dividend growth rate of 12.44% is impressive for dividend growth investors like myself. A 4-year average payout of 51.06% should be enough to maintain this dividend growth rate far into the future.Chart provided by MorningstarLockheed Martin easily beats the competition in return of equity as Lockheed comes in at 164.3 to the industry average of 28.7. This company achieved these numbers during more challenging times. The military spending budget for 2017 was 543 Billion, while the 2018 National Defense Spending Authorization Act allots 631.5 billion to military spending. I have attached a chart below to give historical perspective going back to 1990.Source: USGovernmentSpending.comVice President Mike Pence is promoting the administration’s agenda of investment into the Space Program- and has even come up with a catchy slogan: “Lead in Space Again.” The top defense companies with large portfolios in the Space sector such as Lockheed Martin are the companies most likely to benefit from this increased government investment into space as space is once again a “contested environment”.I envision a ""space race"" in the new millennium – where Lockheed Martin works alongside the major defense contractors in an all-star atmosphere, in which cooperation is encouraged to meet the shared goal of national preparedness in the new “space race”. Each of the big 3 players will have areas of Specialization and will play a part in developing the new technology that will keep America secure in the face of growing global threats such as Democratic People of North Korea Leader (DPNK), and the constant tension in the Middle East. These big 3 include Lockheed Martin, Boeing (BA) and Northrop Grumman (NOC), with smaller companies like Raytheon (RTN) providing support and guidance. With employees in all 50 U.S.States. I cannot see any scenario where the members of Congress are going to gain any support trying to slow down a job creator like Lockheed Martin. I expect President Trump to fully support Lockheed Martin as he had this to say about outsourcing of American jobs. “We have such amazing people in this country: smart, sharp, energetic, they’re amazing,” Trump said. “We’re gonna get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries.”As the defense budgetary pie keeps growing the companies feasting on that pie are consolidating which will only make the diners who remain more fat, this is why I am so excited to be a Lockheed Martin shareholder. Government spending budgets for weapons such as the ones Lockheed creates come through Congress, where support is generated and measured in jobs creation for Congressional districts. Throughout the history of Lockheed Martin, they have excelled at gaining Congressional support, and creating strategic alliances within the decision makers of the Department of Defense. I recommend reading the book Prophets of War for more information about how actual spending decisions are created, and how most of the deals Lockheed Martin engages in with the Department of Defense results in profits for Lockheed. Even when they fail they still get paid. With the acquisition of Sikorsky by Lockheed Martin they now own the Black Hawk, the most popular military helicopter manufacturer in the world. Two dozen American Allies are currently operating Black Hawk's, along with the United States Air Force, Navy and Coast Guard. The Black Hawk will continue to be the work horse of America and their allies for many years.  Another benefit of owning Lockheed Martin is shareholders could benefit from top-secret skunkworks projects that the Company is now developing. One of these projects that really gets me excited is creating portable nuclear fusion technology. The technology would be able to fit into the back of a truck, and power a city up to 100,000 people. (Puerto Rico needs this from the hurricane!) If successful, this technology would be a game-changer for the entire planet. The elimination of oil rich dictatorships in the Middle East, less pollution and smog in large cities like Los Angeles and New York would be immediate benefits. As long as presidential elections exclude maverick liberal candidates, I cannot see profits falling. The book Prophets of War highlights the cost overruns and scandal of the Lockheed Martin 1971 bailout, the book referenced an independent analysis by the New York Times said that every senator with Lockheed-related plant in his or her state voted for the deal to give Lockheed Martin a 250 million government Bailout. Even die-hard liberal Congress members voted to approve this bailout because they were afraid of losing Lockheed Martin jobs in their Congressional districts. Recently Lockheed Martin has created an interactive map for the F-35 Project that lets viewers click their state, to view the economic impact the F-35 has on that state. (Click here to determine the impact on your state.) This shows Lockheed is already preparing for any political resistance to their shareholder profits.Lockheed Martin should have a large place the portfolio of any dividend growth investor. It is currently my second largest single holding, and I plan to buy more on all price dips. Because this company creates many high-paying American jobs in every state I see no scenario where this company will lose in the long-term. Especially in a future where jobs are being automated and sent overseas America must continue “building the damn weapons” in in this country!"
4114998,103599,2017-10-20T08:44:10-04:00,"Lockheed Martin has been firing higher all year and things should continue from here.The company is one of the most reputable defense companies in the world, which should help propel them higher.With market-wide valuations stretched, is it time to jump aboard this defensive juggernaut?","I have to be honest, I have always known about Lockheed Martin (LMT) to be one of the great American Defense companies of its time, but I never have taken a deep dive until now, and I must say, the company's results are extremely impressive. Driven by a quality management team, the company continues to excel. With current market analysts continuing to fear market valuations are being stretched, is it time to get defensive with LMT? Let's take a look at the company's recent results and their plans to sore higher in the future to determine if an investment in LMT is warranted.Source: LMT Investor RelationsIn this piece, I have taken a look at LMT's recent five-year history, as well as their trailing 12-months data. Since Election Day on November 8th, Lockheed Martin stock has increased approximately 35%. Initial speculation was that the new Trump administration would look to increase the defense spending budget, similar to prior republican administrations. The increase in spending was confirmed when the company finalized negotiations on the sale of its F-35 fighter jet to 11 countries, including the United States, in a deal valued at over $37 billion.During the same time period, other defense stocks such as Raytheon Company (RTN) and General Dynamics Corporation (GD) are up over 30% as well. Boeing (BA), another competitor in the defense aerospace sector, is up over 80% in the same time period. So all in all, defense stocks have performed extremely well since Election Day.Over the past five years, LMT revenues are actually flat since 2012, but increased 17% in 2016 from the prior year. The 2016 year included the first full year of operations from the company's Sikorsky acquisition in late 2015. Though revenues were flat over the five year period, net income increased 93% during the span with operating income increasing 25%. This is a positive sign showing management efficiency while having the same revenue from five years ago. From 2015 to 2016, the company saw net income and operating income increased 47% and 18%, respectively. Looking at the bottom line, EPS has increased 109% since 2012, which is attributable to higher income growth, as stated above, as well as stock buybacks.In terms of efficiency, the company increased return on assets from 7.1% in 2012 to 11.1% in 2016. This is a common metric viewed by investors to determine how profitable company management is relative to total assets. Gross margin and operating margin have increased 180 and 230 basis points since 2012, suggesting management has continued to leverage their pricing power.Turning to the dividend, the company paid out $2 billion in dividends in 2016 and increased the dividend 10%, which marked the 14th consecutive year that the dividend rate has been increased by a double digit percentage. In terms of free cash flow (FCF), which is an important metric to view concerning a company's ability to pay future dividends and increase dividends going forward, the company has increased FCF over 566% since 2012, and flat from 2015 to 2016. The company currently has a payout ratio of about 63%, which is a little high compared to recent years, but nothing that overly concerns me.When thinking in terms of defense stocks, the first couple of things that come to mind are that we have a Republican administration in the White House, who tend to side on higher defense spending, and the threat of North Korea. Defense stocks have seemed to move higher on every major headline out of North Korea as of late. Since North Korea launched their ICBM on the 4th of July, LMT stock has increased over 15%. The fears of a nuclear war drive money into these defense stocks. Is the increase warranted? We will answer this question when we look further into some of the valuation metrics I like to view when determining whether a stock is a buy or not.In terms of growth, the company will continue to benefit from its late 2015 acquisition of Sikorksy, which is known for building the most popular military helicopters in the world. In addition to United States military, US allies also purchase Sikorsky made Black Hawk helicopters, which will be a growth driver going forward. As of Q2 2017, Sikorsky secured a $3.8 billion five year contract to build 257 Black Hawk helicopters for the US Army, as well as the Saudi Arabian National Guard. The contract also includes an option for an additional 103 aircraft, which would bring the total value of the contract over $5 billion. The company also received an order for 74 F-35 jets totaling $5.6 billion. Also, as mentioned above, the company secured the $37 billion contract with the United States government and 11 other countries for the F-35 jet. The significance of this deal shows the company's growing international presence, lessening the reliance on United States government's defense budget rifts.Other positive factors of growth going forward relate to President Trump's request to increase the Department of Defenses' FY18 budget by 10%. LMT also has an agreement from Saudi Arabia to purchase $28 billion worth of LMT products varying from air to missile defense products in order to boost their national security. Overall, from a growth perspective going forward, Lockheed Martin's operations appear to be set up for the foreseeable future.As of the company's Q2 earnings release, management increased 2017 guidance as seen in the chart above. The main driver behind the increase relates to the company's space segment and the higher volume that segment is seeing throughout the year.As the stock has catapulted to $315, is it still worth of a buy? Currently, the stock trades at a P/E multiple of 18.4x, compared to its recent five-year average of 12.7x, which suggests the stock is overvalued. When looking at various analysts stated fair value for the stock, Morningstar suggests a fair value of $279, while CFRA suggests a fair value of just $232, both suggesting the stock to be overvalued at its current price. However, I do not base whether I buy on those reports, but do like to compare as part of my due diligence. Turning to Price to FCF, the stock currently trades at a P/FCF of 22.3x compared to their five-year average of 14.1x, again suggesting the stock is overvalued. One last valuation metric I will leave you with is Price to Sales, currently the stock trades at a P/S of 1.9x compared to their five-year average of 1.1x, again suggesting the stock is overvalued.Source: Created by author from information within company financialsIn conclusion, the macroeconomics appear to be in favor of the company and the growth prospects still remain strong. Lockheed Martin is led by a knowledgeable management team and is a strong company, and from a long-term perspective I see no reason why this stock won't continue to thrive. When comparing LMT's metrics mentioned above to its direct competitors, things do not look as out of whack as one may think we comparing to the company's most recent history. They are one of the best when it comes to defense companies, but with Q3 earnings expected next week, I am going to take the wait and see approach before initiating a position in this fine company."
4116057,22148,2017-10-24T21:32:23-04:00,Lockheed Martin slumps following disappointing Q3 results.The actual growth metrics don't match the stock gains.The dividend yield is at the lowest level in years.,"After reporting Q3 results, Lockheed Martin (LMT) is down $9 in mid-day trading. The defense company has ridden to highs that appear very unsupported by the actual results.The stock still trades above $300 on the dip, which one needs to keep in perspective considering Lockheed Martin traded around $150 back in 2014. My previous investment research recommended that investors continue riding the stock higher, though cognizant that the time to exit Lockheed Martin was on the horizon due to a stretched value.The question with holding onto Lockheed Martin was one regarding momentum, not value. The defense company only forecast earning $12.45 for the year prior to updating 2017 guidance with the Q3 report, yet the stock recently traded at a 52-week high of $322.For Q3, Lockheed Martin only grew sales by a meager 5.4% and actually missed analyst targets along with a $0.02 EPS miss - not the numbers typical of a stock warranting a P/E multiple of 25.The company isn't even generating leverage in the business, with revenues only targeted to grow 7% for the year and updated guidance for EPS to grow a meager 4% this year. A lot of the EPS gain can be attributed to stock buybacks as operating income is actually down for the year so far.The market is buying into the big time growth thesis of the defense sector that doesn't actually exist. Analysts only forecast revenues growing 3% next year and my previous work focused on how non-US NATO spending was only targeted at 4% growth for 2017.Remember that Lockheed Martin expects to cross $50 billion in annual sales this year; so when people talk about billion-dollar deals, the contract hardly impacts the top line. A better way to view the lack of value in the stock are the below charts showcasing how the large amounts of cash returned to shareholders aren't that meaningful anymore.As the company highlights in this slide in the Q3 presentation, capital returned to shareholders YTD tops $3 billion. The company has nearly equally returned cash via dividends and stock buybacks. With the market value topping $90 billion, this amount of cash doesn't go that far anymore.Another way of visualizing the value is the declining dividend yield. The yield is at the five-year lows even with the quarterly hike to $2 per share. The updated dividend yield is only 2.6% after the stock price dip following earnings.LMT Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YChartsThe key investor takeaway is that Lockheed Martin posted another solid quarter. The numbers, though, aren't impressive enough to support the multiple expansion in the stock of the years and the lowest dividend yield in years.The way the stock is trading following earnings after the big run-up during 2017, now appears the time to pull the ripcord."

India is the largest defense importer in the world. As a starter, Lockheed-Martin is the best candidate for the 2018Q1 200 fighter aircraft tender worth $9B as a minimum.2On October 19 when visiting India Secretary of State Tillerson said:In foreign policy India is considered as:Tighter US-Indian economic and defense cooperation will benefit US defense contractors.

Boeing is a surprising third. MBDA is Raytheon's European competitor and is owned by Airbus, BAE Systems and Leonardo (former Finmeccanica)Lockheed-Martin has several opportunities in India.India needs a lot of new fighter aircraft. A large number of old Russian and British fighter/attack aircraft have to replaced. In addition to this India is more than 250 aircraft short in its inventory.India strives to develop their own fighter aircraft, but it is unlikely that they will succeed in the short term. Joint-ventures (at least with assembly in India) are preferred after home-grown aircraft. The 2018 tender will involve 200 aircraft with the final order between governments signed in 2021.The Saab (OTCPK:SAABF) Gripen and Lockheed-Martin F-16 block 70 are the expected candidates for the 200 aircraft tender. Saab AB: Swedish Phoenix Rising shows that the Gripen should not be underestimated.The speech of Secretary of State Tillerson indicate that Lockheed-Martin is the best candidate for the (minimum) $9B order2, which is a very low estimate when compared with similar orders to other countries. This could be much higher with additional components (spare parts, weapons, training etc).Source: Lockheed MartinIndia announced that they want out of a joint fighter program with Russia. Coincidently this is a few days after Tellerson's visit. The fighter program was for a 5th generation aircraft. The F-35 is also a 5th generation aircraft. Technology transfer might be a problem for this.India also has 48 Russian Mi-17 helicopters selected, but not ordered yet. Since Lockheed-Martin bought Sikorsky helicopters, the H60 Black Hawk is an option (although not very likely considering the price difference and large number of Mi-17s already in use).Boeing and Sikorsky are partnering on the Future Vertical Lift program. India might participate in this program.Boeing (BA) is the most successful US exporter. Boeing has sold P-8 patrol aircraft, C-17 transport aircraft and helicopters (AH64 Apache and CH47 Chinook). There seems to be nothing in the pipeline now.The Future Vertical Lift program for helicopters is mentioned above.Although relative small, General Electric (GE) could be a surprise. GE turbine engines have been chosen for Indian Navy ships and the HAL Tejas 2, an Indian developed multi-role fighter that will have its first flight in 2019.When the US-Indian cooperation grows, more Indian-developed ships and aircraft could choose GE turbine engines.Lockheed-Martin has the best opportunities for the short term. The 200 aircraft tender of 2018Q1 is a good fit for the F-16 block 70 aircraft. India will insist on local assembly as a minimum.India participating in the F-35 program is another possibility since India's announcement this week to quit the Russian-Indian 5th generation project.Endnotes1This overview is composed of all delivered and ordered weapon systems.

Ocean also didn’t disclose the amount of the Teledyne investment.The two companies have had a previous relationship, having partnered on a demonstration of unmanned systems at the 2016 Annual Naval Technology Exercise at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center.As Chris Moran, executive director and general manager of Lockheed Martin Ventures, stated in the deal announcement:Lockheed has been a recently active corporate investor in technology startups, investing in venture-backed companies since 2007.The firm invests in early-stage startups and said it ‘refocused in 2016 to long-term, strategic investments in technology innovations that could drive growth in existing and new markets for the company.’Furthermore, Lockheed’s ‘technology priorities include autonomous systems and robotics, cyber security, artificial intelligence, advanced electronics and sensor technologies.’So, its investment in Ocean Aero is directly in line with its stated priorities of autonomous systems and sensor technologies.Competitors are also busy investing or acquiring ocean-going unmanned systems. Boeing (BA) and L3 Technologies (LLL) are two defense contractors that have been ramping up their focus on autonomous maritime systems.Lockheed has a variety of unmanned and autonomous systems in production and development, and the investment in Ocean advances the firm’s focus as the U.S. Navy develops an increasing interest in autonomous ocean sensing systems.I write about M&A deals, public company investments in technology startups, and IPOs.

4103293,101891,2017-08-31T09:00:34-04:00,North Korean sabre-rattling has rallied military stocks like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon.Lockheed Martin stands to gain more than nearly any other defence company from an imminent U.S. military buildup.We provide an updated valuation for Lockheed Martin in light of recent international relations developments.,"By Callum Lo, Integer Investment analystIn an article regarding Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) we published several months ago, we stated that “ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere are likely to provide high demand for key defense and security products provided by Lockheed Martin” and that “there are several strong indicators that the U.S demand for military equipment will grow, notably, the proposed increase in defense spending and the recent [Syrian] airstrike.” Since the time that article was published, Lockheed Martin’s stock has in fact exceeded our expectations, climbing from around $270 to its current price of over $300. It now trades at a P/E ratio of 23.91. We expect it to continue to $330.Lockheed Martin is an aerospace and defense corporation based in the United States. It produces a large range of military transportation and combat vehicles, as well as having interests in space exploration, cyber security and a number of other advanced technology frontiers. It is well known for its military jet aircraft programs the F-35, the F-22 and the F-16. The company is currently engaged in a long term arrangement with the U.S. government for the development and production of the F-35, which represents the major fifth generation combat aircraft that American military forces will use for the coming decades.Lockheed Martin creates military hardware, including the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter:In total, Lockheed Martin reaps the vast majority of its revenue from U.S. government contracts. In 2016, 71% of net sales were to the U.S. government. 59% of sales are from the Department of Defense specifically. Naturally, American involvement in foreign conflicts and international geopolitics are incredibly important for the firm's outlook. Even small shifts in U.S. foreign policy direction can have profound impacts on prospective demand for the firm's products.In our last article, we articulated the important shift in U.S. foreign policy with the incoming administration:None of this has changed since the time of publishing. In fact, Trump has signalled further aggression in his foreign policy stance towards global adversaries. In the particular case of North Korea, Trump has warned that “[Kim] has been very threatening beyond a normal state, and as I said, they will be met with fire and fury, and frankly power the likes of which this world has never seen before.” While this is strong rhetoric, and is certainly a reason to further back military stocks, it should be noted that such a threat is almost certainly not credible. Reports out of the U.S. that the North Korean regime has successfully developed missiles capable of reaching the United States, as well as their ability to miniaturise a nuclear warhead to fit on such a missile, means that their nuclear deterrent is now firmly in place. The Trump administration will have to accept that the window for action against North Korea has closed and that the regime as a nuclear power immune to foreign threats is the new normal.Kim Jong-Un has been aggressive in pursuing nuclear weapons capabilities:In our previous article, we also noted the shift in U.S. foreign policy away from an emphasis on using foreign aid and other diplomatic apparatus in order to purchase influence around the world:Since that time, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has stated as recently as June that the military buildup will begin in the 2019 budget and continue on through to 2023. Mattis stated: ""We didn't get into this situation in one year, and we aren't going to get out of it in one year. We're going to have to have sustained growth in '19 to '23, and this is where you'll see the biggest growth: Army, Air Force and Navy as we're digging us out of a readiness and maintenance hole.""We also provided several key insights regarding important developments with the Islamic State in Iraq:Mosul has now fallen to the Iraqi security services: We ultimately predicted that “Mosul is likely to fall in the coming months.” That prediction has now come true, and we are beginning to see the kind of shift in U.S. military strategy that we thought was likely to occur following this event:In this section, we produce an updated valuation for Lockheed Martin using comparables analysis. Similar companies operating in the industry have been selected to compare, in this case: Boeing Co. (BA), Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), BAE Systems (OTCPK:BAESF), Raytheon Company (NYSE:RTN), Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT). These companies yield the following P/E ratios:We believe that there is further growth potential for Lockheed Martin, especially in the U.S. Budget for 2018 and with ongoing instability in global geopolitics. As a result, we believe that a P/E ratio of around 26 is more appropriate. This is particularly true given that Raytheon is currently trading at a P/E of over 25, and Lockheed Martin has access to a number of valuable contracts that Raytheon is not a part of (such as the F-35 programme, discussed in our previous article). This yields a target value of $330.17.Since the time of our previous analysis, the state of global affairs has only grown more unstable with the looming North Korean threat and ongoing conflict in the Middle East. The Trump administration has furthered its signalling of a large scale military buildup likely to benefit Lockheed Martin more than nearly any other defence firm. We expect large revenues for their missile systems, combat aircraft and other ground-based defence products in the years to come for a sustained period.As always, thank you for reading.

4112905,103735,2017-10-11T10:58:19-04:00,Lockheed offers incredible moat protection. The investment firm MorningStar suggests that the moat on Lockheed is wide.Cost-cutting programs will likely add to Lockheed's efficiency.Lockheed's ROIC/WACC ratio suggests the firm has strong revenue protection.,"Recently, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has come under scrutiny for the extreme costs to the U.S. government for its recent F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter. It is estimated that the price tag on one jet is $94.6 million. President Trump recently said that the price is much too high. According to the Wall Street Journal, the cost-cutting programs are intended to reduce the per unit cost to 80 million by 2020. Through joint programs between Lockheed, its partners and the U.S. government, the firm is working to lowering production costs. These cost reductions will probably come from greater efficiency, not from Lockheed sacrificing margins.That said, in nearly all other cases, investors would run for the hills if they owned a firm that derives 23% of all revenue from a product deemed too expensive by its single largest buyer. Why is Lockheed Martin different?The reason why the market hasn't fretted over Lockheed's need to lower costs is because Lockheed has a strong economic moat protecting its business. The industry uses the term ""economic moat"" when referring to a firm's ability to stave off competition and retain market share. An economic moat by definition, is the ability of a company to retain competitive advantages over its competitors, thus protecting its long-term profits and market share.Lockheed has substantial patents surrounding the F-35 that make it impossible for another firm to come in and replace it. Not only that, Lockheed's buyers would suffer immense switching costs if they attempted to transition to a new product. The cost required to retrain and develop new processes around a new product far outweigh the cost of the current F-35.Another advantage Lockheed has is its impressive network. Most NATO countries use Lockheed jets in their fleets. This further adds to the complications for the U.S. to switch to a new manufacturer.Lockheed Martin is the largest defense contractor in the world. The firm specializes in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services for the aerospace and defense industries.Operating in an intense environment with increasing global security threats, Lockheed has mastered their strategy to be at the forefront of defense and security innovation. The firm serves both the United States and countries abroad. In 2016, domestic sales accounted for 71% of total net sales, 59% of that coming from the Department of Defense alone. International sales accounted for 27% of total sales and 2% of total sales came from U.S. commercial customers.Over the last 5 years, Lockheed has far surpassed the return offered by the broader U.S. equity market. Lockheed has returned over 300% while the S&P 500 over the same period has managed to return 78%.Basic economic theory suggests that the market will eventually eke out all economic profit, or profit above normal costs. This is because when others see a firm realizing economic profit, they are enticed to enter the market. The mounting competition forces firms to compete with price, eventually driving economic profit to 0. In practice, firms obtaining economic profits are those that manage to have a greater ROIC (return on invested capital) compared to their WACC (weighted average cost of capital). In 2016, Lockheed Martin had an average ROIC of 34.03%. Much higher than its WACC which was probably somewhere between 9%-12%.Due to Lockheed's moat protection, government incentives to decrease costs won't come to affect Lockheed's revenue any time soon. This doesn't mean that Lockheed won't have to give up some of their margin, but it is true that the U.S. government can only push so far. For these reasons I remain bullish on Lockheed for the next year, especially as tensions continue to rise around the world."
4104146,102659,2017-09-05T11:20:25-04:00,"LMT has signed a new contract to provide helicopters to the US navy.This could signal an improving future for the company, as more contracts mean guaranteed security for the contractual length.LMT stock stands as below average compared to other military shares, and this puts many valuation figures in perspective.I suggest that LMT is a hold, with the recent warnings of international political disputes.","Lockheed Martin (LMT) secured a new contract to build the CH-53K King Stallion Helicopters to the Naval Air Systems command. This will likely be a great addition to the U.S Marine Corps, however does not come cheap. The contract is worth $303 million which will enable the Marines to have two of the aircraft by 2020 plus logistical support.This aircraft will be able to provide greater efficiency and flexibility within war zones or for those in need of aid.In my previous article on LMT we discussed the digital position of the company, and how dependent that they were on the government and associated contracts and funding. In fact, the ability of LMT to survive was almost purely based on governmental spending on the military. Correspondingly in a separate article the real costs of the jets provided by LMT were dissected in order to find the true value of these aircrafts and associated time that it takes LMT to build and make them operational.Has anything changed for LMT, are they still ever dependent on these contracts from the Government? Can this be understood through the valuation of the stocks, which could potentially be far too high, and if so, will this come crashing down soon enough?The problem with these questions is that in fact LMT has achieved against expectations for some time, so to look into this further could get us some answers. This can help us to determine whether this stock is a buy, sell or a hold.LMT is based in Bethesda, and works as a global security and aerospace company, employing 97,000 people. It engages in research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services.The company has been in some controversial trouble recently with Donald Trump stating online that their jets were overpriced and taking far too long - with few disagreeing with this statement. LMT ended up pulling themselves together and agreeing to step up the progress and decrease the prices, and since then they have been quietly working away. LMT has a market cap of 87.03B.LMT investors haven't changed their feelings about the company, regardless of its reliance on government contracts, with the stock value increasing over time. Currently a share is valued at 302.9 with a dividend yield of 2.41%. The 5-year annual growth rate of dividend is incredibly high at 15.81, against the industry average of 3.26, which shows confidence in growth for the company.The P/E ratio stands at 23.81 compared to the industry 21.69 which is just over average but still makes this an expensive stock. The P/B value also indicates overvalued stock standing at 68.97 compared to an industry 6.43. The price to cash flow ratio is not as bad, standing at 16.95 against industry average of 15.34, however, it seems management is forecasting for growth (according to the dividend growth).Therefore the trailing 12 month EPS shows us the current profit divided by outstanding shares, which is 17.10, this then forecasted at 14.69 according to estimates.To ensure that this is an accurate portrayal, net operating cash flow is 5.19B as of 2016, (obviously outdated) divided by shares outstanding comes to 18.These figures incorporated into the PEG ratio shows 3.11, but we already knew the shares were overvalued historically and revenues are not growing particularly quickly. However, given their leadership position in missile defense, and the current geopolitical environment, they could be in for a windfall from nations looking to modernize their defense capabilities.This shows that according to the ratios LMT is considered overvalued. However, I am a huge believer in looking at the company as a whole, to determine where the future could be - we have already seen that analysts have forecasted LMT and been surprised, so it is very possible this could happen again.There is an expected earnings per share growth over the next 3-5 years of 6.16%, and the company sits within the top 8% of aerospace and defense companies. The second quarter results that were released beat expectations and raised this year's outlook.When looking at the industry analysis comparisons between all sorts of industries could be viable.Below is a table that shows according to the PE ratio, LMT sits in the middle/top of other large military companies, just under RTN.What it also shows is that although there is a higher PE ratio, there is a lower P/S - lower than GD, NOC and RTN. This tells us that according to what we are paying in association with sales, this stock may not be as poorly valued as initially suspected.Trump has also displayed his interest in funding the military more, which would of course pay off for the defense companies if it comes to pass. It is also worth noting that LMT is increasing their own sales to foreign countries, making themselves less reliant on the US government for funding. This is also an indication of a more prosperous future for LMT.I think it is also worth noting that LMT is in the top ten military employers list. In itself this may just be a good thing for technical know-how, however, it is also a way to keep the market. If you have specialized ex-government employees, you are more attractive to sign a government contract with. Particularly if employees know employees.So why do we think that these stocks are so highly priced and valued by the investor?As Trump himself said, military goods are so deeply intertwined with the bureaucracy of this modern world that somehow they are getting away with charging incredibly high prices. This should decrease at some stage, however, with talks of war between Trump and North Korea, LMT has a strong competitive advantage in missile defense and the lowest bidder could turn into who can get it to us the fastest. The time that America will begin to invest more in military materials would be soon, as it would take 5-10 years to build and get the products functional.What we do have here is a company with a good relationship with the government contractors that they are working alongside. They are experienced in what they do and they have ex-government employees. LMT is still winning contracts even as they diversify their market to overseas customers.I believe that these social connections and reputation will keep LMT in the 'game' for the long-term, and even if not they are able to secure contracts from elsewhere. They are able to manage their company well, and remain out of debt with good return on equity (238%).Given the political environment I would hold LMT, however I would not initiate a position until 250 or below given the historical averages of the company.If an investor is looking for a new share in a military stock, there are other options such as Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. (HII) who have a 2.40 dividend (1.10%) and a PE ratio 17.57 which is more reasonable, although the company is newer."

I had previously written about LMT in June (click here to read), and since then there have been several positives that have driven the share price higher than my previous 12 month price target. Business for LMT seems to be doing well as evident from the Q2 results (apart from the Missile and Fire Control segment), and things seem to be looking up for the company. With the raised outlook for the rest of the year ahead, and some significant news items surfacing in favor of LMT, I believe that the stock would be a good addition to your portfolio. Let’s account for some of the huge future contracts that LMT has managed to secure in the past few weeks, which boast nothing but improvements to the company’s top line, bottom line and its free cash flow position (read – better dividends).Earlier in July news of a deal for Black Hawk helicopters surfaced where the US army has ordered 257 units, in a deal that is worth nearly $5.2 billion for LMT’s subsidiary Sikorsky. The helicopter manufacturing subsidiary was a purchase of the defense equipment manufacturer about two years ago. In addition to adding to its portfolio of products, the unit has contributed well to backlogs and orders for the company, and it seems to me that with this new deal in the pocket, the purchase was a good decision on LMT’s part. I expect to see at least some of the impact of this deal reflect itself on LMT’s bottom line this year. I like how LMT is making headway with its Space Systems as the company only recently announced the building of a $350 million facility for manufacturing and testing its satellite products – you can read more about it here. ""We'll be able to build satellites that communicate with front-line troops, explore other planets, and support unique missions,"" Rick Ambrose EVP of LMT Space Systems remarked. I believe that going-forward we, once the facility is complete, it will scale up the potential of LMT’s Space System segment, allowing us to see it contribute more towards the company’s financials. LMT is fairly established in Space Systems already and I believe this move of designing an advanced facility shows that it is determined to do more – and as always is likely to deliver. Hence, the future of this segment, in my opinion, seems to be burning bright in terms of business and financials, which of course is an excellent sign for the stock to do well in the future. There has been some talk about the F-35s facing pressure in the distant future for a number of reasons. While the F-35 is expected to remain in business till 2070 at least, there are some rumors that China and Russia have scaled up their military capabilities to outshine the F-35’s stealth capabilities. The F-35 was specifically designed as a powerhouse offensive aircraft could penetrate through all current defense systems globally. Moreover, its ability to shoot long distances and avoid close-combat also gives it an upper hand against its predecessors. While we are yet to hear more from China and Russia about their newly designed technologies that could render the F-35 stealth capability as mediocre to what we had previously expected, I am concerned (although mildly) about the collaboration between France and Germany to team up and design an another aircraft that is at par, if not better than the F-35. While these two countries have planned to get the ball rolling next year, and considering that it will take a good number of years for something to materialize out of this partnership, I don’t expect any immediate threat to LMT. Maybe a couple of years down the line we might see this newly introduced aircraft has the potential to threaten LMT’s share in Europe, but a lot of this depends on the final product that France and Germany roll out. Hence this news item doesn’t seem to worry me too much, but gives me enough to remain cautious about a new competitor in the market. And I believe the market would agree with my view as well, because unless we see something materialize and brought to surface, I don’t expect the impact of this news to start a bear-run on the stock any time soon. The LMT stock has remained bullish YTD, and has gained 17.25% in value, which is a steep increase. From my analysis in June, the stock has returned 7% to investors in the form of capital gains. I had estimated the share price to cross the $285 mark over a 12 month period, but I’ll gladly admit that I was wrong about this one. Now that the stock trades close to $297 a share, it’s a no-brainer that LMT will soon be crossing the $300 mark. I’ll revise my estimate for the next 12 months to $310/share, but I won’t be surprised if I’m wrong about the upside in my next review for LMT.We will have to wait until next year to hear about the fate of the France-German partnership on designing a new aircraft. For LMT, the scrapping of this deal means booking of new orders, not only by these two partnering countries, but from the Middle East and the rest of the EU. The impact of this directly hits LMT’s top line and coming 2018, we could see either booking of more orders or cancellation of some, depending on whether the creation of the new aircraft is agreed upon (several factors including budgets need to be accounted for by both countries prior to making a decision). It may be too soon to say this, and perhaps I’m a tilting in favor of LMT when I see this, but I foresee more bookings and close to negligible cancellations for the F-35’s by 2018.Other than the recent events, I think the fundamentals are playing out favorably for LMT as a stock as well. The company has great management, produces good products, is sheer in size and also has a very deep footprint at home and across the world. Couple that with the fact that its dividend yield is at 2.4% (above its peer average of 1.7%), I think it makes for a great addition into any portfolio, especially for those that are designed to seek regular streams of dividends.Based on my analysis above, I believe that the capital gain and dividend game is likely to remain strong for this particular stock. It definitely does classify as a good long term investment in my books, and I would definitely recommend re-investing the dividends to maximize your gains from this one. I would still hold firm on my stance and recommend a 5 year investment horizon for LMT. With all that has been going in favor for the company, and assuming that this streak of booking more fruitful contracts will continue on, I foresee that there is a lot more upside to the stock which will be priced into the share value as and when new news items surface in the market. Until then, hold this stock and sit tight, because even if the growth in share value isn’t as enticing at the moment, the consistency and stability of the dividends are good enough reason to be long LMT.Many of you might be skeptical about holding LMT after its recent earnings report. However, I believe that the stock has a pretty good future ahead given how the company seems to have everything on track. Let me know your thoughts about LMT in the comments section."

Since I got into the stock last August at a price of $248, LMT is up 24% to a price of $307.58 at the time of writing:Moreover, while earnings per share (normalised diluted) have continued to climb, the stock’s P/E ratio still remains below the peak of 22 seen in 2016.In spite of defense spending concerns at the onset of the Trump administration, the stock has continued to climb. In particular, escalation of geopolitical tensions in the past year, most recently between the U.S. and North Korea, has led defense stocks higher generally in the past year.For instance, competitors Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Raytheon (RTN) are also up by approximately 25% in the last year.In this regard, it is fair to say that macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns have been fuelling much of the rise in such stocks.However, in spite of the general run-up in the industry, I still see significant growth for Lockheed Martin as a company on its own merits. While geopolitical speculation may fuel movements in price in the short term, it is ultimately a sustained rise in sales and earnings that will do so in the long term, which is ultimately driven by the negotiation and securing of defense contracts with major clients.For instance, according to the company’s Q2 earnings release, Lockheed Martin managed to achieve significant increases in sales, earnings and cash from operations compared to the same quarter last year:SalesSource: 2nd Quarter 2017: Financial Results Conference CallEarningsSource: 2nd Quarter 2017: Financial Results Conference CallCash Flow From OperationsSource: 2nd Quarter 2017: Financial Results Conference CallMoreover, the outlook for sales in 2017 is highly positive, having increased by $300m:Source: 2nd Quarter 2017: Financial Results Conference CallSeveral factors have contributed to strong financial results from Lockheed Martin, including:While geopolitical tensions may be causing a run-up in defense stocks right now, it is important to remember that Lockheed Martin remains a very strong company from a financial perspective.While future sales of the F-35 may be a concern going forward, I do not envisage that this will prove to be a significant threat to the stock in the medium term. The France-Germany offering is still untested, and any speculations regarding the same may be unfounded at this point.Therefore, in spite of how the geopolitical landscape comes to look towards the end of 2017, I still see Lockheed Martin as being in a good position to rise in tandem with the market, while acting as an effective defensive stock (i.e. one not significantly correlated with the market) in the event of a market downturn."

4090593,52502,2017-07-26T08:49:18-04:00,"Things were looking up for Lockheed's F-35 project just a few months ago as Germany expressed interest in the plane.  Recent announcement of Franco-German project reverses that optimism.F-35 project is already troubled by a range of technical and economic issues, therefore a competitor in the same market is the last thing it needs.Whether the new Franco-German project will or will not become reality depend's on a pending final decision next year.  There are reasons to believe it can go either way.","It was just recently announced that Germany is looking at the F-35 option being offered by Lockheed Martin (LMT). It would have been a much-needed boost to this arguably troubled project if Germany would have come in with a sizable order for the fighter jet. Any chance of that happening seems to have been greatly reduced now that France and Germany jointly announced that they intend to develop a new fifth-generation Euro fighter jet. It is not only about Germany, because if a new Euro-fighter is indeed going to be offered, I think there is a strong chance that it may affect Lockheed's chances of new contracts in Europe, and perhaps even in the Middle East. The only way that Germany, as well as a number of other countries in the region that would have potentially considered the F-35 option might do so going forward, is if this new Franco-German project were to fail. Odds of F-35 sale contracts continuing to pour in therefore depends on whether this proposed project has any chance of becoming reality, which is why we need to take a closer look at the proposal and the actors involved in it.A new potential competitor fighting for the same market might be the last thing that the F-35 project needs. There are already a number of significant issues plaguing it. One of the main issues relates to the final cost. In this regard, The project could cost the US as much as $1.2 Trillion over the lifetime use of the jets. Given that the US is set to eventually take possession of 2,443 F-35 planes, the eventual cost per plane could end up being as much as about $492 million. There are some cost estimates out there which put this number even higher. It is true that some F-35's are estimated to remain in service until 2070. In some regards, this may be exactly the problem with the project. Given the speed with which technology changes these days, it is hard to tell whether these planes will be at all effective by the time the last plane will be shipped in 2037, never mind assuming that it will still be a useful plane as far out in time as 2070.Note: For F-16 & F-22 I used latest higher-end total cost estimates based on recent sales contracts or department of defense estimates.As I pointed out in a previous article I wrote on the F-35 project, China is claiming to be able to detect pretty much any stealth plane through quantum radar technology, which if true it could be a devastating blow to the project. It is still an open question in regards to whether this can be a viable detect & target solution, but the fact that there are such alleged advances in the field, while the F-35 are just starting to be delivered in significant volumes, should be reason to worry for both Lockheed and its customers. Russia is claiming to be able to detect and target the F-35 as well, but there may be some doubts in regards to the honesty of those claims. At the same time, we have to remember that a slightly modified Soviet S-125 air defense system managed to detect and shoot down an F-117 over Serbia during NATO's bombing campaign in 1999. The S-125 was first deployed in 1961, meaning that it was not the latest cutting-edge technology by any means, while the F-117 was designed exclusively with stealth in mind. The fact that Serbia, with its limited resources and old Soviet-era technology managed to find a solution to US stealth ( only while the bombing hatch was open), should give everyone reason to pause before claiming that a solution to the F-35's stealth capabilities is not already forthcoming or even perhaps already in place.In the absence of its stealth advantage, the F-35's price tag can hardly be justified. Its dogfighting capabilities are thought to be relatively mediocre, while its range is far below many of its US predecessors, or potential foreign rivals. Having said that, it hardly has any international potential competitors at the moment. Russia and China are both said to be offering rival fifth-generation aircraft options, but it is less than likely that they will compete for the same markets globally, while the capabilities of these alternative may arguably be inferior in some respects. It is thought that with its superior stealth capabilities, the F-35 can simply avoid a dogfight with the enemy, because it will be able to shoot them down before it comes to close-range combat, which is in part what makes it potentially a very formidable piece of military hardware. In theory, it could evade all current anti-aircraft defense systems deployed around the world, making it a great offensive weapon, which could easily penetrate enemy territory, hit targets and still stand a good chance of returning back to base in order to fight another day.Germany and France are however now proposing a Western competitor, which they hope will be a viable alternative to the F-35. The plan is set to be put into motion by the middle of next year. This of course means that financial resources need to be allocated to the project soon. It is due to shorter-term financial constraints and longer-term economic implications that I believe the project is likely to face difficulties in getting off the ground. It is important to understand that it was in fact France's leadership which was the driving force behind the new project, not Germany. It is important to recognize this fact, because it is in fact Germany which can afford such a project from a financial point of view, with recent fiscal surpluses, while France has been unsuccessfully struggling to keep its budget deficits under the 3% threshold for the past decade.Source: EC.Note: More recent estimates for 2017-2018 budget deficits are in fact higher, but this is the outlook on which the new Macron presidency has been basing its decisions on.While recent optimistic forecasts suggested that this will be the year when France will have its first budget deficit which will be below the 3% threshold, unfortunately a recent announcement was made that France still has a significant gap to fill in order to meet the 3% threshold, so 4.5 billion euros in spending cuts were announced just this month. I personally think that even this recent cut in spending will not be enough to go below 3%, while next year's gap will be significantly higher. It is hard to explain then how France will go about starting on such an expensive project next year, while the budget gap it has to deal with is already quite significant.If the fighter jet project is to take off next year, it will mean that some resources will have to be allocated to the project as soon as next year. As we know based on DoD budgets, the costs of developing such a plane start to become significant long before the first plane is delivered. In the case of the F-35, the cost to the US government has been running in the billions of dollars per year range. Initial budgetary pressures stemming from such a project may be relatively small in the first few years, but costs are likely to ramp up as the project moves along. While it is impossible to tell at this point what kind of budgetary pressure such a project would put on France going forward, based on what we know in regards to the F-35 project and its costs, it could easily cost the government of France an average of billions of Euros every year, for decades. For a country which is struggling with high unemployment, low economic growth, and deficits which are in breach of EU rules, it is hard to see how it could possibly consider this project to be a viable path forward. Germany, which could afford such a project, arguably even on its own, with only slight government deficits replacing the current surpluses, was never the country which was the most eager to undertake this project to begin with. Germany seems more eager to develop and maintain its current economic might than it is to cultivate its military strength. They do have until the middle of next year to decide whether to commit to it or not, at which point both initial partners to this proposed venture will be able to go forward given their needs from every perspective.At this point, it is hard to tell whether the joint French-German project has a chance of becoming reality, or whether the financial burden will prove to be just too much, as is the case with France. On one hand, the financial burden would be nothing to be complacent about, given what we now know of the F-35 and other fifth generation fighter jet projects around the world. Such projects take up a lot of resources, with more and more countries seeking multiple partners when deciding to develop and eventually manufacture such planes. On the other hand, I also find it hard to believe that EU members would be willing to give up on being among the few entities capable of building fifth generations fighter jets, leaving it to the US, Russia and China to become sole leaders in this regard. That would in effect leave Europe with only one choice and that is to become junior partners in US-led projects. I don't believe that Europe is ready to allow for this to happen either, for as long as there will still be a European Union.About a year from now, we will find out what the final verdict will be on whether this project will go ahead or not. The implications for Lockheed are significant, because it could mean potentially hundreds of new planes being ordered by many EU countries in coming years, if the proposed Franco-German fifth generation fighter project will not be made reality. As I pointed out and has been widely reported on already, Germany did ask to see the classified specifics of the F-35 project. This could potentially mean a sizable new order as soon as next year.If the Franco-German project will go ahead however, there is a strong possibility that Lockheed might even experience some order cancellations, especially from Europe, as many countries will likely opt to go with the Euro project instead. European countries currently considering the F-35 purchase, which did not sign on as initial development partners, include latest addition Germany, as well as Belgium, Finland, Poland, Romania, Greece and Spain. In the absence of viable alternatives, France will most likely have to come around to purchasing some F-35's as well, because otherwise it will be left being among the few major European countries lacking stealth fighter jet capabilities. Some Middle East countries potentially interested in buying include Saudi Arabia and UAE, both of which tend to spend very generous sums on defense as we well know. If there will be a viable alternative to the F-35, chances are that many of the above-mentioned potential customers will be lost to that alternative.While it is indisputable that Lockheed's fortunes in regards to this project are mainly tied to the contract it has with the US defense department, the potential gain or loss of export contracts, which at this point will depend on whether France and Germany will decide next year to go forward with a competing project, cannot be dismissed as being irrelevant by any means. The sale of each additional F-35 means hundreds of millions of dollars in extra revenue, while the current absence of such a competitor on certain markets means that there is potential for several hundred more units to be sold, which could be worth tens, or even hundreds of billions of dollars in the years and decades to come. It is therefore indisputable at this point that Lockheed has a lot riding on whether the Franco-German project that was recently proposed will get its final green light next year. It is certainly something to keep an eye on for those invested or looking to invest."
4086150,22148,2017-07-06T16:02:26-04:00,Lockheed Martin continues to race towards new highs.Global threats are overblown as somehow new and different this time.The stock is starting to price in growth expectations beyond reality.,"The defense stocks jumped to near all-time highs following news over the July 4th extended weekend. The stocks have seen massive gains over the last five years turning my investment thesis on the sector more neutral to negative in the last year. The big question is whether the recent news surrounding contracts, higher NATO spending and escalating tensions with North Korea warrant an even bigger rally in the likes of Lockheed Martin (LMT). Does one really want to own the stock now with people unanimously bullish on the sector and the stock after this massive five year run?The biggest impetus for the post-July 4 rally is the concerns regarding the firing of a ballistic missile cable of reaching the continental U.S. or an ICBM. The news though doesn't exactly change the thesis for decades that the country is under threat from the likes of Russia, ISIS and now particularly North Korea. The reality is that the defense contractor isn't even listed amongst the group of defense contractors that includes Raytheon (RTN) expected to benefit from a possible increased spending in missile defense systems. On the contract front, Lockheed Martin recently won a big $3.8 billion contract for Sikorsky Aircraft for 257 Black Hawk helicopters. The five-year deal is valued at roughly $750 million per year. While one can speculate on the growth rates and suggest that defense spending is going to surge, the reality is that growth likely isn't about to lunge higher. Lockheed Martin already has $50 billion in annual sales requiring something substantially larger to really move the needle. A key point to remember is that a new contract doesn't necessarily mean growth in bookings. During Q1, the company delivered a total of 32 helicopters to the government. After all, Lockheed Martin actually missed analyst revenue targets during Q1 by only achieving 6.7% growth. Analysts forecast revenue only rising by 3.9% next year. One needs to consider that one of the major catalysts is non-US NATO spending that is only forecast to grow 4.3% in 2017. Even the areas where tailwinds exist, the growth isn't that extraordinary. What is extraordinary is the multiple expansion in the sector highlighted by the massive growth in the PE multiples of Lockheed Martin. LMT PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsThe trailing PE is used in the above chart to highlight the trend since forward PE multiples don't exist beyond one year in the charting tool. So while Lockheed Martin has seen solid earnings growth over these years, the big difference is the change in the investor mindset that supports buying the stock now despite trading at over 22.5x forward EPS estimates. The key investor takeaway is that while the trend in the defense sector and at Lockheed Martin is positive for the company, the stock already accounts for growth in excess of expectations. Most governments around the world including the U.S. just don't have the balance sheets for substantial revenue growth in defense spending. Investors should use any further rallies to look for the exit."
4085908,68315,2017-07-05T16:33:08-04:00,Sikorsky got a big order.Sikorsky is responsible for a big part of Lockheed Martin's backlog.Growth outlook for Sikorsky as well as for Lockheed Martin is positive.,"... because Lockheed Martin (LMT) is building them. A recent big order improves the outlook for Lockheed Martin's Sikorsky unit, which, in turn, strengthens the company's already strong outlook for the future.Source: SikorskyLast week Lockheed Martin announced that its Sikorsky unit got an order for 257 Black Hawk helicopters, which are being sold to Saudi Arabia (which were being ordered U.S. Army though).The contract includes options, which allow for the purchase of up to 103 additional aircraft, which could bring the total value of the deal to $5.2 billion.Sikorsky is a subsidy of Lockheed Martin, since Lockheed Martin purchased Sikorsky in 2015, for a price of $9 billion. That was a price tag of which many at the time thought that it was a bit high for what Lockheed Martin was getting, but deals such as this one could prove that the business Sikorsky is active in can provide a lot of value for Lockheed Martin. Since Lockheed Martin grossed new orders totaling $47 billion in 2016, we can expect that this Black Hawk deal alone equals about 8.5% of this year's total orders, not factoring in the options for additional aircraft that could drive up the value of the order further.Lockheed Martin's Sikorsky unit has a backlog of $15 billion (at the end of last fiscal year), which is equal to about 16% of the company's total backlog ($96 billion at the end of the last fiscal year).Relative to Lockheed Martin's enterprise value of $93 billion, the Sikorsky acquisition looks like a rather cheap way to increase both order inflow as well as Lockheed Martin's backlog: At a little less than 10% of the company's total enterprise value, Sikorsky provides 16 percent of Lockheed Martin's backlog, not even factoring in the most recent order mentioned above.When we calculate with a profit margin of 10.5%, the Black Hawk deal should contribute about $400 million to Lockheed Martin's bottom line this year -- even if this was the only deal for the entire year, the purchase would have already paid off (on an annual basis), as Lockheed Martin financed the acquisition via debt that costs a lot less than $400 million.Calculating with an interest rate of 3.0% and a tax rate of 25%, the $9 billion Lockheed Martin paid for Sikorsky cost about $200 million after tax -- one deal like the one Lockheed Martin announced recently thus is enough to make the Sikorsky acquisition profitable. This does not yet include the additional revenues and earnings Sikorsky is bringing in from the commercial side of its business, which includes the M28, the S-92 and the S-76 lines of helicopters, which are used for very diverse roles, such as passenger, VIP transportation, parachuting, SAR, medical transports, cargo, etc.Over the last one and a half years the price of oil has rebounded substantially, which helps one of the key markets for Sikorsky's commercial business: Helicopters are used to service offshore oil & gas platforms, transporting goods as well as personnel. With increasing oil prices the global offshore activity will grow as well, which poises Sikorsky to see increasing demand for its commercial helicopters.Lockheed Martin's overall position and outlook is very positive: The company's revenues are poised to grow further, as trailing revenues of $49 billion will increase by roughly $3 billion towards $52 billion next year. This also impacts Lockheed Martin's (likely) forward earnings, as Lockheed Martin's forward earnings ratio of 20 and an expected EPS growth rate of six percent annually (over the next five years) showcase a positive growth outlook. Lockheed Martin pays out a little more than half its earnings via dividends, which means a nice dividend yield of 2.6% at today's price. Combined with strong dividend growth rates in the past, and a positive dividend growth outlook this makes Lockheed Martin's shares attractive for income focused investors as well.TakeawayLockheed Martin's takeover of Sikorsky seems to pay off, as big orders for new Black Hawk helicopters, in combination with an improving outlook for Sikorsky's commercial business (due to the rise of the price of oil) allow for ample top and bottom line contributions from the helicopter manufacturer.Lockheed Martin's overall outlook is good as well, with revenues expected to grow further and EPS seen growing for years as well.Author's note: If you enjoyed this article and would like to read more from me, you can hit the ""Follow"" button to get informed about new articles.

4092676,23468,2017-07-31T10:19:09-04:00,A recent article posing the above question between PepsiCo and Coca-Cola drew - among many other comments - the above question. It can be evaluated in the same way.Anticipating earnings reports - and much more - well-informed Market-Making [MM] professionals helping investment organization clients adjust billion-dollar portfolios in these stocks reveal their coming price limit expectations.Both are strong defense stocks - why not make larger capital gains in the better price-positioned one at present? Pictorial details of price range expectations trends follow.,"An SA ""news"" item reader reflects on upcoming earnings reports by two major defense industry companies, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) and Raytheon.Anticipating such reports - and much more - well-informed Market-Making [MM] professionals helping investment organization clients adjust billion-dollar portfolios in these stocks reveal their coming price limit expectations.To protect firm capital temporarily and necessarily put at risk, they engineer hedging deals in leveraged derivative securities. Prices paid and deal structures created tell their implied forecasts. Here is how they see the risk-reward tradeoffs for these and several other aerospace/defense industry stocks:Figure 1(Used with permission)Upside price rewards are from the behavioral analysis (of what to do right, not wrong) of Market-Makers [MMs] protecting themselves from possible damaging future price moves.Their forecasts are measured by the green horizontal scale. The risk dimension is of actual price drawdowns at their most extreme point while being held in previous pursuit of upside rewards similar to the ones currently being seen. They are measured on the vertical red scale.Both scales are of percent change from zero to 25%. Any stock whose present risk exposure exceeds its reward prospect will be above the dotted diagonal line.LMT is at location [4] along with NOC, next to GD and SPDR S&P 500 Index ETF at [13] as a broad market norm. RTN at [9] is directly above LMT, with a similar forecast upside price change potential, but a history of slightly larger price drawdown exposures during similar prior forecast holding periods.LMT may be the stock of most interest among these. Here is how it has been seen during the last six months market days in terms of likely coming price ranges daily.Figure 2(Used with permission)LMT's current implied price range forecast has a downside prospect of $286.92, or only 14% of its full range of up to $311.14. That sets LMT's current Range Index [RI] at 14. The other 86% is a prospective gain from $290.41 of +7.1%.We use the RI to see how well the MMs' prior forecasts have worked out. In the past five years of 1,261 daily implied forecasts, 181 of them have had RIs of ~14. Each of the 181 has been subjected to our standard Time-Efficient Risk Management Discipline [TERMD], which hypothetically buys at a cost of the next market day's closing price and sells at the first end of day price occurring at or above the range forecast top. If that hasn't happened in three months (63 market days), the position is sold at end of day with its liquidated capital available for reinvestment in the best choice of that day's end of market forecasts.The LMT history of 181 RI forecasts at 14 shows that 91 out of every 100 were closed out at a price above its cost. All 181 closeouts averaged net gains of +6.0%, compared to the current upside prospect of +7.1%, giving the forecast a credibility ratio of 0.8, an above-average performance.The average holding period of those 181 prior forecasts was 49 market days or one day short of 10 calendar weeks. Compounding the +6.0% net gains 5+ times in a market-day year (of 252) produces an annual rate of gain [CAGR] of +35%. That's no promise, just a figure to compare against when considering other alternative investment candidates.During those prior holding periods, prices fluctuate, sometimes below cost. Those interim loss-potential exposures are the real measure of risk, since it is at their worst condition where an investor is most likely to fear the present loss will worsen and never recover. For LMT, those experiences have been limited to -2.6%, only a bit more than one third of the forecast gain potential and less than half of the actually achieved net gains of similar prior forecasts.What matters relative to today's investment decision on LMT is what is likely to be experienced during its next three-month holding period. What may have happened to LMT's price in the fourth quarter of 2008 or the first quarter of 2009 is immaterial if no RI forecasts of 14 were encountered there. And, only one day was at an RI of 14 out of that 126 market-day half year.Risk is not static - it depends on price at the time of commitment. The future is what counts, not some unrelated past history, despite the assertions of academics and industry ""consultants"".Now, let's look at alternative choice possibilities, starting with Raytheon (RTN).Figure 3(Used with permission)RTN's current forecast provides a similar upside prospect of some +6.5%, with a larger downside Range Index of 24. But its RI is also extremely low (a plus, usually) in its past five-year array of experiences. That is shown in the small picture of their distribution at the bottom of Figure 3.How well those prior forecasts have turned out leaves its net %payoffs of +3.9% behind LMT's +6.0% and just two-thirds of the forecast upside expectation, with a credibility ratio of only 0.6 compared to LMT's 0.8.The lower net %payoffs are the result of only 74 wins out of each 100. In our experience, that (74) is down at a level where CAGRs start to become non-competitive. RTN's past +21% CAGR is double the market index ETF's accomplishment, but not much above the average of an overall forecast population of over 2,500 stocks and ETFs. And, it is below LMT's +35%.Does that make a preference of LMT over RTN an easy decision? Perhaps. But should you stop there if a capital commitment to an equity position in the aerospace and defense stocks is the resulting action? Why not consider other stocks in the group? And, have a sense of risk-reward proportions outside of the aerospace group?Figure 4 shows the MM community making hedging bets to protect itself in ways that forecast upside price change prospects for a population of over 2,500 issues. Those actions average +7.1% gains, bigger than LMT's +6%.But the forecast population average is without credibility [column (13): -0.1], the result of achieving past actual %payoffs from their various prior RIs (now averaging 30). Those average outcomes of only +2.8% instead of today's suggested 7.1% average come from the market's prior various issue RI forecasts that were the same as today's. The disappointment is due importantly to a win odds history of only 62/100 or just five profitable outcomes out of every eight forecasts.Figure 4Source: blockdesk.comSPDR S&P 500 index ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) as a general market performance index has a smaller current upside forecast of only +5.4%, but a small downside exposure history from RIs like today [50 in column (7)] of only -2.6%.Is the equity market too high and dangerous? The aggregate picture from 2,615 issues may suggest so, with prior downside price change experiences averaging -8.9%. But an aggregate single ETF of ~500 holdings gives a very different perspective. Its current forecast is mid-range (RI of 50) and still has price drawdown experiences of only -2.6%. SPY's three-month win odds are a very reassuring (to those concerned over a market crash in the next three months) 90 out of 100.The plus in knowing SPY's price risk is that LMT's exposure (historically) is individually no worse than SPY's.Another relevant comparison can be made by having a sense of what the best in the forecast population has to offer in these various relevant investment dimensions. A screening of the 2,615 to find their top 1% produces an average of the top 20. The group's superiority comes from high win odds that produce better %payoffs than are being forecast, yet are of past experiences that generate CAGRs in triple-digit outcomes.It all depends on you and your preferences and priorities. Is a smaller-size gain earned more quickly, and reinvested sooner elsewhere, enough more appealing than a larger, less frequent gain with better odds of being profitable, done in LMT?And, it opens the door to comparisons with other stocks that may have a combination of advantages far better than either LMT or RTN. An upcoming SA article comparing NOC with GD may be of interest to you. It is a direct result of the analysis in this article.If we had to bet today and choose only between the two, it would be for LMT, even if RTN's stuff might be able to reliably destroy aberrant North Korean vehicles in space.So, readers, do any of you have more appealing candidates for portfolio wealth-building than are offered by either LMT or RTN?

4082513,65113,2017-06-19T23:52:07-04:00,"Lockheed Martin is up despite concerns about defense spending.The company's F-35 deal is set to provide a significant boost to cash flow outlook.I continue to remain long this company, and see it as a great long-term buy.","The last time I wrote about Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) in January, I expressed the opinion that I felt the stock would remain at current levels given uncertainty surrounding the defense industry, and that waiting for a better entry point might be advised for this stock. Lockheed Martin was trading at just under $250 at the time.However, the stock did the exact opposite of what I was anticipating - shooting up to a level of $281.11 at the time of writing.The main reason I was weary of Lockheed Martin was that there was significant speculation at the time that defense spending would be curtailed under a new Trump administration.Moreover, there are also fears on the part of the defense industry itself that even with the President's subsequent plans to boost military spending by $84 billion, this figure won't be achievable.In any event, Lockheed Martin has gone up - which simply means that it's erroneous to pay too much attention to the news.According to the company's 1st Quarter Financial Results Conference Call, Lockheed Martin has seen significant strength in its cash flow from operations:Source: 1st Quarter 2017: Financial Results Conference CallMoreover, the company is set for a further boost as negotiations finalize on the sale of its F-35 fighter jet to 11 countries including the United States, in a deal valued at over $37 billion. Additionally, the company's growth in cash flow this year has been impressive, considering that there was a slight delay in contractual negotiations for the F-35.The significance of this deal underscores the company's continuing international strength and even with questions on the size of the defense budget for the United States, Lockheed Martin's operations do not appear to be under any significant strain.In this regard, the vibrant growth in cash flow is good news from a dividend standpoint, and having lifted its dividend by 10% earlier this year, the stock shows strong potential from an income standpoint.Moreover, in spite of the rally to above $280, we see that the P/E ratio of 16.38x is still below the peak of 21x in 2016. Moreover, we see that the drop in the P/E ratio has been due to a corresponding increase in EPS (diluted). In this regard, Lockheed Martin still shows value from a fundamental standpoint and there could still be upside from here.In conclusion, macroeconomic variables such as defense spending or political concerns have been shown to be largely academic in the past few months. Lockheed Martin is a strong company, and from a long-term perspective I see no reason why this stock won't continue to thrive."
4075980,102659,2017-05-24T05:21:34-04:00,"LMT has long been in the center of the Jet production program for the US military.With recent issues regarding the costly development programs, it is ever-more vital to break this down to reach a long-term conclusion of where we stand.This will also aid in understanding of assets and liabilities regarding future high-cost endeavors.","This investment thesis is to determine the extent to which the high cost projects upheld by Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) specifically. It would seem that since Donald Trump started to discuss the incredibly costly projects (namely, the F-35) that LMT was contracting the US government into, LMT's CEO Marillyn Hewson was able to lessen the cost slightly, however, are we truly understanding the actual length of time and cost of upkeep of these 'projects', and what sort of practical profit margin would that realistically leave LMT at, should these contracts not be renewed.Below is a table of the segments of business for LMT, their profitability in 2015, and the percentage operating margin, which can indicate effective pricing strategies and general operational management, which is a key figure when assessing competition.IMET, E-IMET, FMS, FMF, DCS, EDA; All of these programs provide an economic infrastructure for companies like LMT to guarantee long-term operations, and contractual 'wins', and they are of course used to the maximum advantage.According to social media sites that are aimed at investors, an unsure collection of articles implies wariness regarding LMT being a 'good' investment choice. This is argued to be due to the Budget Control Act 2011 (sequestration) and the recent election of Donald Trump who is not secretive about his disdain for the budgeting structure. LMT is referred to as a 'wild card'.There are numerous argued methods of determining the cost of the F-22 raptor specifically, which is dependent on the costs that you include in the 'direct costs' for the Raptor. This line is blurred due to the 14-year span of time that this jet has been in development. The author Axe has found that LMT has cost somewhere between $137 million and $678 million per jet, depending on what you include. This is not including the lifecycle costs, which can be seen below.This therefore is dependent on the time that the contract is agreed to gauge the risk for LMT. According to Phillips, who analyses the process of the F-35, there are a few specific problems with the current defense deals being made (which should also be accounted for by LMT in their marketing efforts).This is complex with Jets due to the interrelated costs, such as component parts, LRU's and reliability calculations, use of the craft, flying hours and the pilot training. Reliability can only be known once the pilot craft has been flown for some time; resulting in accepted risk from the government purchaser. Development started for the F-35 in 1996, f-35a CTOL, F-35b STOVL, F-35c CV, and the LRIP 3&4 are now under contract. RDT&E costs have increased by almost 40% between 2001 and 2009, and the average unit production costs have increased by 54% overall between 2003 and 2009. Data for the F-35 can aid in analysis, such as the following;Weights of the F-35 prototypes (Source: Phillips, 2011)Key input data for the F-35 (Source: Phillips, 2011)This is emphasized by an incredibly long production time for the technology, spanning many years, with increasing costs of production as time goes on; incidentally, LMT is very sure not to have to pay many of these costs themselves, by ensuring that the military contractors realize the uncertainty of the market and industry, and invest a certain about beforehand to continue under the premise of 'we have already invested so much, we may as well continue, at risk of losing the initial investment'.Essentially, what it not generally discussed enough it the real time that it takes to not only utilize a Jet, but the immense upkeep in general that is required, as well as long development (plus it is in LMT's interest to continue contracts for as long as possible). One of the main reasons that Trump was forced to discuss these issues with LMT was their lack of transparency - not only with their public-facing elements (see my earlier article on this), but also with their contractual ones.For a company that is basing its contractual agreements on projects that are renowned for being far more expensive than expected, and expanding the time allotted for all types of technological development, should we trust many more of our resources with them, particularly in this time where trusting corporations is becoming paramount to their modern-day success?If a company cannot be transparent with its Government about costing and time-scales, how can we as individuals expect them to be transparent with us as investors?If a company survives off of long-term contracts being renewed with the Government as often as possible, how sustainable is this for the next few years?Food for thought, for the long-term LMT investor."
4083621,103360,2017-06-23T16:37:36-04:00,"Their superior reputation as well as the foothold they already have in the Defense Sector will allow this company to be profitable well into the future.This company does not need to create support from the American Public to continue being successful.Lockheed Martin does not need to waste money to create sleek websites, or developing a large online presence.","In a previous article written by Helena Leathers about Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) it was mentioned that a strong digital marketing presence would greatly benefit the future of the company. I believe the recommendation was made based on the news coverage created by President Trumps tweets regarding the Lockheed Martin alleged cost overruns of the F-35. The bottom line is this is a foolish idea for any defense company, especially one with the pedigree of LMT.Researching the prestigious history of Lockheed Martin was impressive, especially the history of their Skunk Works Projects such as the U-2 which provided some of the most important pieces of intelligence data during the Cold War with the Soviet Union. More information on the original Skunk Works creator Kelly Johnson and the XP-80 fighter plane his team created can be found on the Lockheed Martin website. This Companies most important products are being created at the highest level of national secrecy available there is no need to spend money on a large-scale digital marketing program.Investing in paid media campaign would have the same effect as dropping a LMT Trident Missile on a huge pile of cash- because the American Public has little control how defense budgets are appropriated, and most Americans do not care all that much because they have faith that the United States military leadership can create the most modern weapons, used by the most sophisticated personnel.Historically, budgets for weapons like the ones LMT creates come through Congress where support is generated and measured in jobs creation for Congressional Districts. Throughout the history of Lockheed Martin they have excelled at gaining Congressional Support, and creating strategic alliances within the decision makers of the Department of Defense. I recommend reading the book Prophets of War for more information about how actual spending decisions are created, and how most of the deals Lockheed Martin engage in with the Department of Defense result in profits for Lockheed. Even when they fail - they still get paid. In the past these deals were created even without support of any paid advertising campaigns, so there is no need to start now.There are multiple reasons to believe that LMT will continue to be profitable in the long term. The F-35 program is worth 8.2 billion for the first 90 planes, with the option to order 130 additional planes, and another 10 billion in revenue for LMT. Despite some negative media attention due to Trumps Twitter rants, this project is ""too big to fail"" as it will support 146,000 American jobs across 46 states. With this amount of job creation there will be little opposition by the Government Officials representing these 46 states. Besides the 18.2 billion revenue expected by the American Government, there are commitments from other countries to order these planes, including an order from Israel for 50 planes at a cost of $100 million per plane.With the acquisition of Sikorsky, Lockheed Martin can now profit from the most popular military helicopter in the world. Two dozen American allies are currently operating Black Hawks, along with the United States Air Force, Navy and Coast Guard. The Black Hawk will continue to be the work horse of American Military, along with their allies well into the future. Along with replacement helicopter orders, this will result in a steady stream of revenue to LMT for replacement parts for these Black Hawk helicopter's currently in service.Another LMT product that has recently been in the news, and generating excellent free publicity is the THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) missile system currently being deployed in South Korea. There have been multiple media stories in the media around who will pay for this 1 billion dollar system which is being deployed to help deter the North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un from his illicit intentions. The good news for LMT is that somebody will pay for this system to be deployed. In the process of the payment dispute between America and South Korea, LMT has benefited from the positive publicity for their THAAD missile systems.As an additional bonus, LMT has recently entered a more advanced stage of creating portable nuclear fusion technology. This technology fit's into the back of a truck, and can power a city up to 100,000 people. If successful this technology would be a game-changer for the entire planet! Some effects being the destruction of oil rich dictatorships in the Middle East, and less pollution and smog in large cities like Las Angeles and New York. Besides the positive effects for society, it would potentially provide LMT shareholders huge profits if this ever comes to reality!Along with all of these exciting projects, the fundamentals of LMT are solid. The 164.46% Return on Equity is proof that they really know how to invest and spend wisely to get the best ""bang for their buck"" in return when using their investors money. The end result of all of these positives has been an average dividend increase of 15.22% over a 5 year period that had some serious budgetary challenges to Military spending. With a stable 60M Beta of .74, it offers less volatility than it's closest competitor Boeing (NYSE:BA), which at 1.05 is much more volatile.Chart below shows the decline in Defense spending for the last 7 years while LMT was able to still post excellent profits:In conclusion, as long as LMT keeps going in the same direction they will continue to be successful and highly profitable in the future. With their highly impressive business metrics and fair market valuation, I have shown why LMT is the Best in Breed, and this Yuri Orlov quote from the movie Lord of War reinforces why the Arms Business will always be profitable."
4080244,102331,2017-06-09T07:48:47-04:00,The dividend yield of 2.62% is certainly not something that dividend growth investors should take a pass at.Lockheed Martin repurchased 1.9 million shares during the quarter. I look at this as a move towards continuing to announce strong EPS results going forward.LMT secures a large portion of its revenues from US government contracts. An administration pushing for a boost in defense spending will seemingly pan out well for the company.,"The consistent dividend storyLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has been a regular dividend-paying stock for more than a decade - a criterion that categorizes the company as an investment that offers investors a stable stream of income. Most recently, the company was authorized to pay out a dividend of $1.82 per share for the second quarter of 2017. Shareholders who held the investment before it went ex-dividend would surely have benefited from the generous payout of the company. However, that's not all. Lockheed Martin has shown steady growth in its dividend payouts since 1995, where dividends have witnessed 940% growth till the latest quarterly dividend announcement. The dividend yield of 2.62% is certainly not something that dividend growth investors should take a pass at. But what dividend growth investors should also be interested in is the sustainability of these dividends. In my opinion, the dividends are likely to continue for a number of reasons.Lockheed Martin reported operating profit of $1.1 billion on the back of $11.1 billion quarterly revenues in its quarterly results. Cash generation from operations remained strong at $1.7 billion for the quarter. For me, the cash flow position signifies a security in terms of future dividend payouts and potential shareholder buybacks - both of which are aimed at returning value to shareholders as time progresses. Talking more on the topic of share repurchases, Lockheed Martin repurchased 1.9 million shares during the quarter. I look at this as a move towards continuing to announce strong EPS results going forward. In fact, I do believe the share buybacks will continue in the future if the cash flows permit it (which I think they will), so you are looking at accelerated EPS results as the number of outstanding shares continue to decline in the market.As far as the promise for future dividends from the stock is concerned, I believe Lockheed Martin is positioned well, at least till the time the Trump administration is making the calls. I say this because in my opinion, the Trump Administration seems to be inclined towards boosting defense expenditures - you can read more about it here. Given that Lockheed Martin secures a large portion of its revenues from US government contracts, an administration pushing for a boost in defense spending will seemingly pan out well for the company.The consistency will carry onWhile the financials certainly prove that Lockheed Martin is in a position to continue with its generosity towards its shareholders, I am a bit more interested in what the future holds and what exactly could allow the company to continue pumping out dividends for its shareholders. Digging a bit more into some recent news items surrounding the company, I was able to find a number of positives going on for it that not only have the potential to promise dividends for the future but also have the potential to ensure that the stock price remains bullish in the long run.Reports of Lockheed Martin securing a $28 billion deal with Saudi Arabia surfaced last month. You can read about it in this article. The ambit of this deal covers the company's air and missile defense portfolio, tactical aircraft, combat shops and rotary wing programs (the benefits of having a broad portfolio have done well for Lockheed Martin in this case). This deal could work out incredibly favorably for the company in terms of boosting top lines and strengthening its operating cash flow position, which already seems robust enough. The deal is expected to go up to $350 billion over the next decade. While what is yet to be seen is how much of this would be attributable solely to Lockheed Martin, I do expect to see the company's name popping up more than once as the arms deal expands. Once again, this would mean more support to Lockheed Martin's top lines, eventually trickling down to the bottom and pushing up profits and EPS as well.Lockheed's Aeronautics unit was also recently involved in securing a contract that will allow it to lower its cost for the production of F-35s in the 10th lot. You can read about the deal here. This, coupled with the cost savings initiatives through which Lockheed intends to bring down F-35 costs by nearly 10% a few years down the line, will not only result in the company managing its expense line in a better manner (attributing to higher net profits) but will also be able to secure a more competitive position for government contracts, primarily because it will be able to offer these jets at an overall reduced price. Obviously, better pricing will translate into a good bargain for the US government when they buy from Lockheed Martin, so we may be looking at the defense giant securing more contracts for F-35s in the future, adding to its top and bottom line simultaneously.Lockheed Martin has also been named as a contributing contractor for the production of F-15s for the $21 billion Qatar deal. Other than that, the company has also recently confirmed that the plans for its SR-72 jets will be moving forward after decades of testing. According to the company, these jets are expected to hit the skies by 2030. With these items in the news, it is clear that Lockheed Martin is continuing its effort to be one of the largest contractors for the US government by optimizing its cost of production and pricing, and also by diversifying into various advanced defense products with ambitious timelines to meet. This could bode very well for Lockheed Martin in the long run, provided it is able to deliver, because I can see the potential the company holds in terms of securing newer contracts, boosting revenues and increasing profits.ConclusionYTD Lockheed Martin's stocks have climbed nearly 11% in value. The share price is hovering close to the $277 mark, with a P/E of 16.07, making it quite a good bargain for a company that has the potential to offer its investors a lot more over the next few years. For investors who are interested in cashing regular dividends, I would recommend going long in the stock because, as per my analysis above, the company does have the potential to display consistency in paying out dividends in the future.For investors who are looking for a stock that pays well in terms of capital gains, I think Lockheed Martin should only be your pick if you are interested in investing for a 5-10 year horizon. I am not saying I don't expect share prices to go up in the next year or so. In fact, I am targeting the share price to go over $285/share easily in the next 12 months. What I am saying is that if you are looking to milk more out of your investment from Lockheed Martin, then you'd be in a better position if you hold on to the stock for 5 years or more."

The company is showing decisions that depict movement away from US soil, and desire to expand services away from purely military technology. While this is not considered a bad move as expanding services can result in less risk overall should a market collapse, it does mean that the company must now transition from a Government-supported company (with little customer service, and a functionally-based infrastructure) to a company that is liked by the public and can hold up with business to business funding.Currently LMT has a very poor digital presence, and a lower than average rating regarding their online persona (evidence of which will be provided throughout this article). They are also displaying very poor website functionality. These things not only display inability to succeed in the digital business industry that they so dearly want to enter, but also shows a certain degree of disinterest in the customer that they will certainly need to support should they continue their journey of international expansion.Lockheed Martin is known for being one of the largest defense companies in the USA, providing essential technology in order to defend American land. In 2013, 78% of the revenue from LMT was direct from military funding listing them as the top US contractor in 2015 from the federal government administration. In 2015, there was a reported revenue of US$46.132 billion and 126,000 employees.While there are considerable competitive bodies such as Boeing (NYSE:BA) and SpaceX (Private) who all reside within the Aerospace market, LMT still holds 67.85% of the market today, with revenue growth 10.64% faster than its peers.Although this may seem positive to an investor that is looking for high market share, this also could imply that LMT realizes that they are going to need to expand their horizons dramatically in order to stay current and keep their competitive advantage or to not be so reliant on the military market.This observation is evidenced through their announcement that they wish for the public to know more about their developments into cyber security and data analytics (how well they did so is debatable), and also from their dramatic increase in educational resources for the younger generation.Essentially, LMT is offering a wider than ever service range, and (as seen below) is expanding precisely who it offers those services to. LMT's main industry being military means they must continue to support its customers (the American people) through digital efforts.LMT is doing two things;1. Expanding their services dramatically into things like cyber security and analytics (their Wikipedia page has a full list of their areas; ranging from satellites and storage, to robotics)2. Moving to international marketsTo back up these claims, below is a graph that I formulated from the LMT annual reports indicating a clear pattern of decreasing American funding, and increasing foreign funding (between 2008 and 2016).This is a strategic move, firstly because the change is so gradual that it is hardly noticeable, and secondly because the more international a company is, the less dependent it is on its local currency (and the less likely that it will be demolished in a financial crash-type event).The less positive news is, however, that when a company like LMT focuses so deeply on war, weapons and technology designed for defensive behaviors in general, this makes them closely dependent on internal relationships in their given country, or in short, if they move too far from American soil with their business, the American government is less likely to employ their services in future through concerns of the public feeling unhappy; you can't play both sides.Globalization will happen, but defense should stay as a national business.This links to the concept of effective propaganda, which is not a bad thing necessarily, but LMT is not as effective as it could be (or as it has been in previous years.)Propaganda in business terms in this case would be considered customer relations, and the customer in this case of any project could be considered to be the American public, as the public supports and approves (in general) the movements of the government, which then allocates financial contracts.Through a digital audit, LMT's digital position is incredibly poor, and even the website is created with a number of fatal problems (see below) that must be addressed by a company that is so keen on expanding its services to digital security.Here is what I found from my digital audit;4. LMT is no competition in the aerospace industry.Americans want to know what LMT is doing. American people are following the social media, and they are showing an interest and that is being ignored by the company, which is not sustainable when the company is essentially reliant on how the public feels about the defense contractor. There is no two-way communication which is rule number 1 when it comes to advanced digital marketing.With the recent discussions about the company over charging for jets, what Lockheed Martin really needs to be doing is focusing on the people is it serving, which is deeply ironic, as its tag line is ''We Never Forget Who We Are Working For.'' With such little effort into the resources being provided to the public, this is clearly not on their agenda.Below is an image of the 'meta description' of each page on their website, which may seem like it is pedantic in nature, but for a global giant in digital technologies, this is very basic and must be addressed - this also means, more importantly, that the only people that will see the website would be those typing in 'Lockheed Martin' on a search engine. This indicates little/no effort to reach out to the public to build a relationship.As an alternative, however, one could argue that LMT should be focusing on their product, which is technology, and does not need to be providing the public with communication platforms and up to date information that they can understand. While indeed true and a good point, the concept of digitizing in the modern market does expect all companies of a certain size (particularly those funded by the Government) to employ appropriate communicative resources, and put an effort into online information to stay current in the social-media world that is so prevalent in 2017.With public support comes a consistent positive increase in stock price valuation, and Governmental support, which results, logically, in increased contractual opportunities for the defense giant and increased revenue. To survive in this digital age, and break into the digital industry effectively, LMT needs to focus carefully on its digital marketing efforts, and building up that communication with the public.We need to know the humans behind the company, to build a rapport with the public, is to build a relationship with the customer; the American Government, making it a far better choice for investment.Without these efforts to be open, accessible and transparent to the public, LMT will struggle outside of government contracts, and this should be taken into account when deciding on investing."
4075418,68315,2017-05-22T16:01:13-04:00,Lockheed Martin gets a deal with Saudi Arabia that is worth $28 billion.This boosts LMT's backlog by 30%.LMT has been able to turn small revenue growth into strong earnings growth.,"Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) will be one of the key beneficiaries of one of the biggest arms deals the world has seen so far - a deal that could total up $350 billion over the next decade. Lockheed Martin's portion of the big sale to the Saudi Arabian government will total (at least) $28 billion, which is enough to cover the company's revenues for more than half a year.Lockheed Martin's share price of $273 is just a little more than one percent below the company's all-time high, after the company's shares have been in a very narrow trading range over the last months.The deal, which is equal to about 30% of Lockheed Martin's current backlog of close to $100 billion, covers the sale of basically everything the company offers to its customers:Among others, the deal includes the sale of 150 Black Hawk helicopters - Lockheed Martin is able to sell this helicopter after the company acquired the Black Hawk's original manufacturer Sikorsky in 2015.LMT Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsOver the last decade, Lockheed Martin has been able to turn a 22% revenue increase into a 163% earnings per share increase - the company has proven its ability to turn top line gains into big profitability gains. A focus on cost cutting and high margin sales allows for outsized net income growth, and the company's massive stock buybacks over the years have done their part as well, leading to an EPS growth rate which is almost exactly twice as high as the net income growth rate.LMT Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YChartsWith the company's F35 contracts now running at increasing speed, the company is in a position where it is generating huge cash flows: Cash from operations totaled $5.2 billion over the last year due to low capital expenditures of just a little more than a billion dollars a year. Lockheed Martin's free cash flow has grown to $4.1 billion in the last four quarters - up more than 100% over the last five years, and well above the company's net income number.This is a big plus, as the massive cash flows the company is generating allow for strong shareholder returns via dividends as well as share repurchases. We have seen the impact the latter has on Lockheed Martin's EPS growth earlier, but the company's dividend is very attractive as well:LMT Dividend Growth (Annual) data by YChartsLockheed Martin's dividend has grown each year for more than a decade, but the really great item is that the dividend growth rate has been in the double digits in every one of those years - very few of the common dividend growth stocks have provided such strong and reliable dividend growth over that time frame.With the current yield standing at 2.7%, Lockheed Martin's dividend is well above what investors are getting from the broad market right now (2.0%), and due to the strong dividend growth, in combination with a payout ratio in the 50s, Lockheed Martin's shares look attractive for income investors.LMT Price to Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YChartsWhen we look at Lockheed Martin's valuation, we see that the company's shares are trading at 20 times trailing free cash flows - trading at a free cash flow yield of 5% isn't especially cheap, but it isn't a very high valuation either, especially for a company with good growth prospects, a big backlog, a strong history and big shareholder returns. Based on its price to free cash flow multiple, Lockheed Martin has gotten more expensive over the last year, but the company got less expensive relative to the sales it generates - since revenues are not as fluctuant as cash flows, the second metric may be better to indicate that Lockheed Martin hasn't gotten more expensive over the last year.TakeawayDuring Trump's visit in Saudi Arabia, a very major arms deal has been closed; Lockheed Martin will generate $28 billion in sales from this deal alone, providing the Saudis with everything from ships to aircraft.The company has been able to generate big earnings growth even with small revenue increases; such a big deal could be a huge win for Lockheed Martin's shareholders.Since the company's valuation is not too high, and due to the very strong dividend growth as well as attractive yield, Lockheed Martin looks like a compelling dividend growth investment.Author's note: If you enjoyed this article and would like to read more from me, you can hit the ""Follow"" button to get informed about new articles."
4066653,20173,2017-04-28T09:39:34-04:00,"Our Defense Contractor Plays are up $15,950 (218%) in 4 months.Yesterday's oil and gas futures are up over $2,500 per contract.","Does anything bother investors anymore?To celebrate day 97 in office, President Trump told Reuters ""There is a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea. Absolutely."" Remember, this is the same Donald Trump that said during the campaign ""Why can't we use nuclear weapons"" and, when asked by Chris Matthews why he would say such a thing, Trump replied: ""Then why are we making them? Why do we make them?""As I've noted yesterday, we're long on Oil Futures (/CL) as well as the Oil ETF (NYSEARCA:USO) for both the normal summer bump and also because Bush's misguided wars against Iraq and Afghanistan consumed 1.5M barrels per day for the armed forces operations (tank mileage is measured in gallons per mile) and an escalation of Troops on that end of the World will be just as expensive. Good thing we boosted our military budget by $54Bn - looks like we're going to need it.$54Bn is just a drop in the bucket compared to the $350Bn increase in military spending we had under Bush II but it took Bush 8 years to push $350Bn to his Defense donors and that's only $44Bn a year, Trump is ahead of him already in just 98 days!This wasn't very hard to predict though. Republicans love war and love military spending. Back on Dec 23rd, we decided we couldn't beat them so we may as well join them and our trade ideas were:As you can see from the charts, both stocks have taken off. The LMT $220/260 spread is now $28.50 ($14,250) and the short $200 puts are $6 ($3,000) for a net $11,250 profit, which is already a 250% gain on cash but I see no reason to believe we won't collect our full $20,000, which is still almost a double from here.The Raytheon 2019 $120/145 spread is also well in the money and is now net $19 ($9,500) and the short $120 puts are down to $4 ($2,000) for net $7,500 and that's a $4,700 gain on cash so far (167%) and, like Lockheed, I don't see any reason we won't collect the full $12,500 so this one is actually good for a new trade as you can still make net $7,800 off a $4,700 entry and that's another 165% - only it will take two years vs the 4 months we just did it in for you.Yesterday we nailed the bottom on Oil Futures (/CL) at $48.50 and, this morning, we're already back to $49.50 which is good for a $1,000 per contract gain (you're welcome) but I think we'll do better so I'd take 1/2 off the table and put a stop on the rest at $49.20 (bumping the stop up 0.25 with each 0.25 of progress).USO was $10.12 yesterday when we called the long and our option play is in great shape. Gasoline (/RB) fell a bit below our $1.55 long target but already it's at $1.586 and, at $420 per penny, per contract, that's a $1,512 per contract winner but that one we should take the money and run or for sure cash 1/2 and put a stop at $1.575 on the rest (penny trail) so we lock in $1,250+ gains. Our UGA play should do well for you also - you are very welcome!I reiterate my call to short the Russell Futures (/TF) at 1,420 with tight stops above and we also like the Nasdaq short (/NQ) at the 5,600 line and, so far, we nailed that one, with the Nasdaq already back to 5,587. Our favorite trade idea of the morning is shorting Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), now at $950, by buying the May $900 puts for $5(ish). I think the negative guidance will sober people up once we open and plenty of people will take advantage of the pop to lighten up (we sold the June $900 calls for $50 - so it's a nail-biter for us).GDP came out this morning and it was bad, at 0.7% vs 1.2% expected by leading economorons - but not as bad as the Atlanta Fed's most recent GDP Now forecast, which pegged GDP at 0.2%. Unfortunately, the Atlanta Fed gets their data very early and they tend to be ahead of the curve in their forecasts but, as you can see from the chart - they tend to end up being right as well. This does not bode well for Q2 - especially as consumer spending growth fell 90% from 3.5% to 0.3%. And this is only the first estimate of GDP, it might be revised lower next month.Neither does a Government shutdown, which is looming this weekend and the best we can hope for is that they extend the deadline to next Friday - so we can enjoy the drama all over again.Have a great weekend,- Phil"

Among them might be my child. Or yours. Or you. Or even me."" So proclaims George Monbiot, a renowned environmental writer. Through crop failure and malnutrition, infectious disease spread in developing countries, longer droughts (such as the one in California), stronger natural disasters, and temperature extremes, we're already experiencing climate change's effects. Because of disappearing habitats, changing ecosystems, and acidifying oceans, millions of other species will soon be extinct. In fact, 45.2% of millennials believe climate change and destruction of natural resources are the biggest problems facing the world today.However, even with so much concern, the world, especially our nation, is regressing. Drillers exploit high oil demand, supply, and insignificant OPEC regulation to provide fuel for consumers to burn. President Trump, along with the majority of his cabinet, wants to tear down efforts and regulations such as the Paris Climate Agreement. He's also eliminating 3,000 positions at the Environmental Protection Agency because he believes the ""concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.""Therefore, it is imperative for private companies to step up and stop climate change. Likely leaders for the future include Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), Grid Alternative, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Vestas Wind Systems (OTCPK:VWSYF), and General Electric (NYSE:GE), which already dominate either alternative energy R&D, investing, or sales. For example, Grid Alternative has the highest solar energy conversion rate. Vestas Wind Systems is the largest wind turbine company in the world.Unfortunately, most experts believe that it's too late to stop climate change's effects with current technologies. By the time that these technologies are accessible and efficient enough for the average household, climate change will already have taken its toll on the ecosystem. Besides, the most common alternative energies - solar and wind - will only work in some areas because they depend on the weather, climate, and geography. These technologies might work for the next few decades, but they won't be able to handle our energy needs in the long run.Therefore, nuclear fusion is the way to go. Fusion reactors are safe and compact, can be powered by sea water for millions of years, and emit no radioactive gas or greenhouse gas. JET, a research institute, has already made one, generating 16 megawatts of power in a matter of seconds, enough to power 8,000 homes. These reactors are unaffected by climate, geography, etc., so they are viable to use anywhere. The only issues are that fusion is too expensive, and because of the recent advent of working fusion technology (as opposed to decades worth of solar and wind energy viability), trust in fusion is low and only 0.5% of the world's alternative energy funding is being put into fusion.To combat this issue, we need wealthy companies willing to research and invest in fusion. The Skunk Work group of Lockheed Martin is developing a cold fusion reactor small enough to fit in a truck that can power 80,000 homes, which will be commercially ready in 10 years. It'll be designed to fit on planes to provide unlimited range, cheapen desalination for clean water for the poor, and make space travel to farther planets more likely. Even if its fusion venture were to fail, Lockheed Martin would still prosper. NATO members have increased defense spending to protect their own borders and fight terrorist groups at President Trump's beckoning. There is robust demand for its missiles, F-16, and F-35 worldwide, especially in Asian countries where North Korea is a threat.Lockheed Martin is diverse, selling to 40+ countries with 37.6% of its operations in aeronautics, 28.5% in rotary and mission systems, 19.9% in space systems, and 14% in missiles and fire control. Fundamentally, the company is sound. With a 198.32% ROE, it uses its investors' money well and is the indisputable head of its industry at 30.1 times the industry. Moreover, it has a 19.4% year-over-year revenue growth, 9x higher than industry average. Even though its returns are so high, it's relatively nonvolatile, with a 0.67 beta.We also need even larger corporations to provide capital to alternative energy companies such as Lockheed Martin to continue with this expensive research, and what's larger than Apple? Apple is diverse and has already had a strong record with acquisitions, making at least 17 acquisitions in fields ranging from healthcare to even the alluring, risky, and scarcely touched field of virtual reality. It has already heavily invested in alternative energy, providing capital to First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) to develop solar farms for inefficient factories. Now, Apple is looking for long-term solutions to use 100 percent renewable energy at all its facilities around the world. These facts combined with Apple's high risk tolerance and aspirations make it a likely candidate to be a future fusion investor while it continues its current alternative energy projects.Apple is strong fundamentally as well. It is highly profitable as it has a 38.51% gross margin, has a 44.95% ROIC, and generated plenty of free cash flow over the past four quarters, $50.01 billion. Even though Apple has such a large margin and grown so much, it looks undervalued with 0.91 PEG, half the industry average. It can expand in developing countries such as India where with the introduction of the cheaper iPhone SE, citizens can afford to purchase Apple products. Apple's services business is growing. Last quarter, Apple had a $7.17 billion services revenue, beating the previous quarter's $5.78 billion.Ultimately, you should invest in what you value. Doing this can help the world, provide satisfaction, and make you part of a revolution. Not only would it be socially responsible, but it would also serve you well financially. Investing in what you know helps you produce a high rate of return and doing a little good along the way never hurts!"
4065115,22148,2017-04-25T16:02:12-04:00,Lockheed Martin trades down following Q117 results.The recent stock gains sit squarely on multiple expansion and not exactly value creation by the defense company.The shrinking yields highlight how investors are getting less value for the stock above $270.,"Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is down nearly $8 after a mixed Q117 earnings report. Despite very bullish news for the defense sector over the last few months, my investment thesis hasn't changed much.The stock is trading back down below $270 as the rally to new all-time highs stalls. Is now really the time to chase Lockheed Martin higher?The headline numbers suggest that the defense company missed EPS estimates by a wide $0.18 margin. The reality is that a couple of one-time charges cost Lockheed Martin roughly $0.39 so the real issue is that revenues missed targets by $170 million.Very noteworthy is that the company raised operating cash flows for the year to $6.0 billion, up from $5.7 billion. The lowered EPS guidance was due entirely to the one-time charges that Lockheed Martin doesn't adjust out of the reported numbers.So while the headlines are problematic with the actual reality, the numbers further highlight the extremely stretched valuation. The company raised 2017 revenue guidance that still sits only slightly above 6% growth for the year while the stock trades at an incredible 22x EPS guidance for the year.The reality is that a lot of the stock gains have come from expanded P/E multiples over the last year. If Lockheed Martin traded at the same forward P/E multiple as the start of 2016, the stock would trade closer to $210, not $270.LMT PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsOne of the best ways to highlight this altering of the valuation is via the net payout yield. The yield that combines the net stock buyback yield and the dividend yield is a great indication of how the company views value in the stock.For Q1 alone, Lockheed Martin only repurchased $500 million worth of shares after spending a similar $501 million in the prior period quarter. The amount of shares bought dipped to 1.9 million from 2.4 million last Q1 showing the significant impact from the higher sock prices.In essence, the defense company has no more cash to invest in capital returns, yet the stock is up 30%. The end result is that the net payout yield is down to multi-year lows at roughly 5%.LMT Net Common Payout Yield (TTM) data by YChartsThe key investor takeaway is that Lockheed Martin has rallied since turning sour on the stock. The shrinking yields and rising P/E multiple suggest that investors are taking on more risk and deriving less value from paying up for the stock."
4061065,101891,2017-04-07T10:54:56-04:00,"Today the U.S. initiated air strikes in Syria.Lockheed Martin reaps 71% of its net sales from U.S. government contracts, and is profoundly impacted by geopolitical forces around the world.The Trump Administration plans to rapidly pivot American foreign policy from soft power to military capacity buildup.Ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere are likely to provide high demand for key defence and security products provided by Lockheed Martin.","By Callum Lo IntroductionOver the last few weeks we have begun analyzing the aerospace industry. We started with Boeing (NYSE:BA), Spirit Aerosystems (NYSE:SPR) and today we continue with Lockheed Martin.Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is an aerospace and defense corporation based in the United States. It produces a large range of military transportation and combat vehicles, as well as having interests in space exploration, cyber security and a number of other advanced technology frontiers. It is well known for its military jet aircraft programs the F-35, the F-22 and the F-16. The company is currently engaged in a long term arrangement with the U.S. government for the development and production of the F-35, which represents the major fifth generation combat aircraft that American military forces will use for the coming decades.In total, Lockheed Martin reaps the vast majority of its revenue from U.S. government contracts. In 2016, 71% of net sales were to the U.S. government. 59% of sales are from the Department of Defense specifically. Naturally, American involvement in foreign conflicts and international geopolitics are incredibly important for the firm's outlook. Even small shifts in U.S. foreign policy direction can have profound impacts on prospective demand for the firm's products.U.S. Foreign PolicyThe election of Donald Trump to the White House represents a seismic shift in several areas of America's military strategy and foreign policy. Trump has already outlined plans to significantly increase the federal military budget. The proposed changes involve a hike in military spending of $54 billion, an increase of 10%. The Associated Press has described the move as ""the largest since President Ronald Reagan's Pentagon buildup in the 1980s, promising immediate money for troop readiness, the fight against Islamic State militants and procurement of new ships, fighter jets and other weapons."" This is obviously important as a large portion of the funding will be earmarked towards the purchase and modernization of military vehicles and equipment, much of which will benefit Lockheed Martin. Reuters states that the plan ""earmarks the new funds to accelerate the fight against Islamic State militants, reverse Army troop reductions, build more ships for the Navy and ramp up the Air Force - including by purchasing additional F-35 fighter jets, built by Lockheed Martin…""Perhaps more importantly, it signals a pivot in U.S. foreign policy away from an emphasis on using foreign aid and other diplomatic apparatus in order to purchase influence around the world. Much of the money now being redirected towards the defense budget is being taken from the existing state department and foreign aid budget. In total, the budget for the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development is to fall by 28%. While there has been much debate between military experts and the fresh Trump Administration as to whether this shift from soft power emphasis to military might is an intelligent move, it is certainly promising for Lockheed Martin, who rely on political appetites for large-scale military buildup. That being said, reappropriations from environmental budgets may have a small negative impact on the company's forays into the industries of environmental technologies and green energy.SyriaAmerican involvement in the splintered civil conflict in Syria began with a focus on taking steps to force the removal of Bashar al-Assad from the Syrian presidency, amidst a popular uprising. Even before the 2016 U.S. presidential election, this focus had almost entirely been lost over the years. Russian involvement in backing the Assad regime, their key strategic partner in the Middle East region and American unwillingness to escalate tensions with Russia led to a shift in U.S. foreign policy objectives that now focuses entirely on defeating ISIS. With the election of Trump, this change has been completed, with Trump stating during the campaign that, ""If they ever did overthrow Assad, you might end up with as bad as Assad is, and he's a bad guy. But you may very well end up with worse than Assad.""The U.S. and its allies are now preparing for the imminent offensive on the Islamic State's de facto capital of Raqqa in Northern Syria. The Washington post recently reported that the Pentagon is investigating the possibility of deploying a further 1,000 ground troops to Syria in an effort to defeat ISIS. This plan would double the number of troops in the country, and would signal a significant escalation in America's war effort in the region.The airstrike on a Syrian military airfield in retaliation to a Syrian chemical attack on April 6 is perhaps the strongest signifier yet that Trump intends to follow through on his pro-military rhetoric and escalate U.S military intervention in Syria. 59 tomahawk missiles were launched in the U.S first direct attack since the start of the civil war, an escalation which is bound to be positive for Lockheed Martin.ISIS in IraqThe most important battleground for the U.S.-led coalition and the Islamic State in Iraq is the crucial city of Mosul. This was the site of the mosque in which Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi made the declaration of the Islamic caliphate three years ago. The battle for Mosul has been ongoing for nearly six months now. Reuters reports; ""The battle to recapture Islamic State's last stronghold in Iraq has now entered its sixth month. Iraqi government forces, backed by U.S. advisers, artillery and air support, have cleared the east and half of western Mosul and are now focused on controlling the Old City.""Perhaps just as importantly as territorial changes, ISIS finances are now worsening rapidly. As a caliphate that relies on the proper functioning of a governmental apparatus within its territory, ISIS has relied on revenues from taxes and resources since 2014. Its revenue streams, as a result of lost territory and strategic coalition pressure, has now halved in the last two years. The group also relied heavily on looting and seizing of property taken as part of their offensive. Now that this has stopped, they are struggling to continue seeing the same financial turnover. The eventual fall of Mosul will continue this trend, as has already happened in the retaken parts of the city. However, a study done on the financial situation of ISIS warned that financial setbacks may not be enough to prevent it from posing a serious threat to regional stability. It noted that Al Qaeda operated as a successful terror group with estimates revenues of only between $70 million to $200 million, a fraction of the $1.9 billion that ISIS were receiving in 2014. As a result, Mosul is likely to fall in the coming months.This will likely shift the U.S. military strategy, and as such will change the kind of equipment used. Air strikes will become less common, as ISIS turns to insurgency instead of holding discrete areas of territory in cities. Fortunately for Lockheed Martin, they are well positioned to fill this gap through the provision of unmanned systems, such as drones. The company produces a wide portfolio of these products, which can be used for surveillance work or targeted strikes.NATOLockheed Martin also supplies to other NATO countries, such as the U.K. and Germany. The CEO of Lockheed Martin recently commented that she expects a ""Trump effect"" on NATO member states, as they look to boost defense spending. She said that the world is currently in ""one of the most complex geopolitical volatile environments"" she's ever seen. Trump has held the longstanding position that other NATO members ought to contribute more to global defense spending and recently directly accused Germany of ""owing"" the U.S. billions through NATO. Only five nations currently spend the amount required by the NATO agreement, and Lockheed Martin appears to expect attitudes around this to shortly change.This trend is significant for the company, which currently gains over 40% of its new business from outside of the U.S. All signs appear to point towards an uptick in the defensive spending by Western nations, and Lockheed is well poised to benefit from this.F-35 ProgramThe development of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter has been plagued with problems since its inception, ranging from delays to cost overruns to political interference. It was recently reported that the aircraft might have technical deficiencies, such as being unable to hit moving targets like cars. According to the Pentagon, it may be as late as 2019 when the aircraft is ready for combat testing, due to ongoing issues. The Trump Administration this week appointed a new head at the Pentagon to oversee the program, in a shakeup aimed at getting the project under control.Despite all this, the F-35 is almost certain to be a key source of strong revenue for the company. Nations such as Spain, Belgium and Switzerland are all looking to place orders for the jet in order to replace aging stocks of combat aircrafts in their hangars. The program currently constitutes 20% of the company's revenue, and this figure is likely to grow in the coming years. The CEO has expressed expectations that around half of all orders for the jet will come from international customers during the next half decade. This is a significant amount higher than the original firm goal of having 30% of sales offshore.ValuationIn this section, we produce a valuation for Lockheed Martin using comparables analysis. Similar companies operating in the industry have been selected to compare, in this case:Boeing Co. (BA) Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) BAE Systems (OTCPK:BAESF) Raytheon Company (RTN) Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT)Lockheed Martin continues to have strong revenue prospects and very little chance of losing key contracts into the future. Whilst it is slightly more expensive than its industry peers, it has significantly faster growth and better margins, making this valid. Further, geopolitical trends across the world indicate that defensive spending rises will benefit the company's core business. As such, its multiples are largely in line with industry comparables.As a result of ongoing trends around the world, a P/E ratio of around 21 is appropriate for Lockheed Martin, yielding a valuation of $260.77 per share. We recommend a hold on Lockheed Martin.ConclusionIn conclusion, there are several strong indicators that the U.S demand for military equipment will grow, notably, the proposed increase in defense spending and the recent airstrike. This is likely to flow on and increase demand from other countries as well. With all these strong indicators for the industry, Lockheed Martin is a strong prospect that we recommend holding.As always, thank you for reading.

4054549,98146,2017-03-13T10:05:10-04:00,"Contracts were slow, with only a handful reaching our eight focus companies.Another mostly sideways week for the sector. Coming budget news may change this.We go in depth on recent news concerning THAAD and what this means for Lockheed Martin and investors.As always, be sure to check out the articles at the bottom from other contributors here on Seeking Alpha.","Contracts were surprisingly slow this week, with only a handful shifting the totals of our eight focus companies. Compared to last week, there was basically no movement at all.Significant ContractsEven with the lack of contracts, investors can glean some important information. One of the ""macro"" themes of the future of defense is anti-missile capabilities. I see this as being an important contributor to multiple company's bottom lines as nations big and small gain the ability to fire long-range missiles at each other. Lockheed scored about $100 million in contracts from the Missile Defense Agency this last week to bolster our own missile defense capability.Weekly PerformanceIt was not the best week for the sector, with most of them appearing to have flat-lined into a lack of catalysts to drive them higher or lower.LMT Price data by YChartsHuntington was the worst performer by a healthy margin, but we must remember they have also been the best since the election. The bull case still remains for the name, that being the Trump Administration and the US Navy wishing to drastically increase the number of ships. The 2017 National Defense Authorization Act saw the first increase in funding for this explicit purpose, and an upcoming budget from the administration will certainly shed more light on the immediate future.Lockheed, THAAD, and The Defense EcosystemDespite the relatively calm market the last week was anything but calm on the international stage. Most of the turbulence has one common denominator in North Korea, everybody's favorite failing rogue state.As if the nation wasn't having enough problems with feeding its own people, the country decided it might be a good idea to launch four missiles on March 6th, which landed in the Sea of Japan about 200 miles off the coast of Japan.(Source: CNN)Take note of the location they were fired from. By firing them farthest from Japan, they clearly are trying to demonstrate that they can reach the island and definitely strike Seoul in South Korea.The timing of the missiles being fired is not surprising. The US and South Korea were conducting military exercises and China had just convened an important meeting of their government and North Korea is a little upset with China since they decided to no longer import their coal. These acts of aggression are not unique, are extremely predictable, and can be closely associated with a petulant toddler not getting his way inside of a Toys ""R"" Us.With the launching of these missiles came an increased awareness of the THAAD deployment to South Korea. Much of the media made it appear as if the United States was directly responding to this one act. In fact, both the US and South Korea have been planning this deployment for some time. China, also for some time, has protested the deployment of THAAD to South Korea.So what is THAAD and why is China so opposed? THAAD is a product of Lockheed Martin and stands for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, simply stated it is a missile system meant to kill other missiles really high up. The below infographic from Lockheed sums it up well.The heart of the system, and what has China so worked up, is the ultra-powerful AN/TPY-2 radar made by Raytheon. These systems, deployed in both forward and terminal locations, can detect and identify multiple threats simultaneously from the moment they are launched. China is concerned that having a THAAD battery located so close to its borders will allow the US and South Korea to conduct surveillance on them. They're also worried that THAAD will stifle their ability to respond to threats.These concerns are not entirely unreasonable. What the US and South Korea has done with this technology is declawed every nation that has offensive missiles in the area, China included. An essential aspect of deterrence is the ability to strike your enemy just as hard as they are able to strike you.Lockheed Martin has found the sweet spot with THAAD, especially when you consider that the system can work with other defense systems including the Aegis and Aegis derived systems found on Littoral Combat Ships (also a Lockheed product), which coincidentally works very well with the F-35. Much like what Apple (AAPL) has done and is doing with their products, Lockheed is doing with theirs. They are building an ecosystem that works seamlessly across their multiple platforms. They are turning other contractors into their suppliers, and their major project market share has increased drastically. This is what investors need to focus on.In Other NewsDaesh continues to get pounded in Mosul, Iraq. The campaign has been surprisingly well-run.Turkey's President Erdogan continues to spiral into the authoritarian abyss and is now verbally attacking European allies. This begs the question: If two NATO allies fight each other, who does the US defend?The South China Sea remains a point of contention. This is important because China possesses an incredible Anti-Access/Area Denial asset in their man-made islands in this region.The Defense Department budget is getting some negative attention after the Trump Administration very publicly proposes cutting other programs to boost the Pentagon. Speak softly and carry a big stick, Mr. President.On Seeking AlphaWayne Hylarides throws his hat, and expertise, into the ongoing debate surrounding Transdigm (TDG).Dhierin Bechai points to the turning tide of defense and how it will benefit Boeing.

4060894,23452,2017-04-06T16:12:52-04:00,"Performs a quantitative analysis of Lockheed Martin using some unique free cash flow ratios.President Trump is proposing to ramp up military spending, Lockheed Martin should benefit the most.This defense stock should allow you to practice ""capital appreciation through capital preservation"" while at the same time provide an excellent dividend as well.","Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is one of the major holdings in both our conservative and more aggressive model portfolios that we offer to subscribers of our ""Friedrich Global Research"" offering here on Seeking Alpha's Marketplace, which both Seeking Alpha Contributor Mark Bern and I will be running. Lockheed Martin can be considered both a conservative investment as well as an aggressive one, as it is a perfect balance of a growth and value. Additionally, Lockheed Martin also pays out an excellent dividend (currently at 2.7%) and thus can also be considered a strong dividend play as well. Finding stocks like Lockheed Martin, that meet all the above criteria, is like trying to find a needle in the haystack these days. We are able to do so because we operate our research efforts in all four corners of the globe (North America, South America, Europe and Asia.) We are able to find such needles in the haystack stocks because of Friedrich.Friedrich is the name given to our algorithm for analyzing companies that trade on the global stock markets. In creating Friedrich, we concentrated on analyzing each company's Main Street operations and compared those results to Wall Street's own valuation, as measured by market price. Through our Friedrich algorithm, we can analyze ten years of balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement data for each US company (Five years for those outside the US), all at once, and generate one final result in seconds. Friedrich was designed to be ultra-conservative, and thus, will cut zero slack to any company under analysis and will do so with zero emotion.Lockheed Martin is a company that is often in the news these days as President Trump's first budget, parts of which were introduced on March 16, 2017, has Defense spending increase by about 10% or $54 billion.Despite the occasional negative tweets that the president has made about Lockheed Martin in the past, about cost overruns and how costs need to be cut, he is starting to come around to the realization that Lockheed Martin is the world's premier defense company and that if he wants to fulfill his campaign promises he will have to eventually work with Lockheed Martin and not against it. This is simply because Lockheed Martin is the key market share leader in fighter/attack aircraft by a wide margin, so Trump's options are rather limited as demonstrated below.The reason for the F-35 cost overruns is because the F-35 does not just come in one model, but actually comes in three variants and each serves a different purpose. Therefore, just like when one adds special options to a new car that one is looking to buy, it costs much more to make three separate versions of an aircraft, rather than one. Here are three versions as described by Lockheed Martin:F-35AThe F-35A conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) variant is designed to operate from conventional runways and is the only version to carry an internal cannon. The F-35A will be the most prevalent variant of the F-35. The U.S. Air Force as well as the majority of allied air forces and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Force nations will operate the F-35A, replacing their 3rd and 4th generation aircraft.F-35BThe F-35B model short takeoff/vertical landing (STOVL) variant is designed to operate from austere, short-field bases and a range of air-capable ships operating near front-line combat zones. The F-35B can also take off and land conventionally from longer runways at major bases.F-35CFor the first time in U.S. Naval aviation history, radar-evading stealth capability comes to the carrier deck. The F-35C carrier variant (CV) is the Navy's first stealth fighter and the world's only 5th Generation, long-range stealth strike fighter designed and built explicitly for aircraft carrier operations.Also with President Trump now in command, he has access to the experts who are simply telling him the truth about the F-35 and that it currently has no comparable competition. Here is the most truthful account I have found about the F-35 so far.F-35 pilot: Here's what people don't understand about dogfighting, and how the F-35 excels at it.According to Lt. Col. David ""Chip"" Berke, the only US Marine to fly both the F-22 and the F-35, the public has a lot of learning to do when assessing a jet's capability in warfare.The Pentagon's brass really love the F-35 and how it gives them the advantage with its advanced capabilities, but what about the investor in the company? Do Lockheed Martin's financials give us some insight as to whether the company is a good investment at this time or not? Well, to find out let's ask Friedrich and have our algorithm crunch Lockheed's numbers and show us what is happening on Main Street.In this article, I will present a real-time quantitative analysis of Lockheed Martin employing two unique ratios that will demonstrate the power of free cash flow in the investment process. When analyzing almost any company, concentrate on its free cash flow generation, as that is where the rubber hits the road when it comes to finding out the truth.Here is an introduction to the two ratios that we will be using in our analysis:Many years ago, while reading Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) 1986 letter to shareholders, I discovered a ratio, which Mr. Buffett entitled ""owner earnings,"" or what we may consider to be Mr. Buffett's version of ""Free Cash Flow."" To my amazement, in that little footnote, Mr. Buffett explains how to use it and basically states that it is one of the key ratios that he and Charlie Munger used in analyzing stocks. In that article, he defined the term ""owner earnings"" as the cash that is generated by the company's business operations.[Owner earnings] represent [A] reported earnings plus [B] depreciation, depletion, amortization, and certain other non-cash charges... less [C] the average annual amount of capitalized expenditures for plant and equipment, etc. that the business requires to fully maintain its long-term competitive position and its unit volume.I have used this free cash flow ratio for decades, using data from the Value Line Investment Survey, whose founder was Arnold Bernhard. Mr. Bernhard was a big fan of free cash flow and probably introduced it sooner than Mr. Buffett did. I know this as I was able to calculate the FCF ratio using old Value Line's sheets for my 60-year backtest of the DJIA from 1950 to 2009.In the backtest I mentioned above, I demonstrated that if one can purchase a company whose shares are selling for 15 times or less its price-to-free cash flow ratio, the probability of success will dramatically increase in most cases. I have renamed the ratio the Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio in honor of both men. The following is how each ratio below is calculated:Price-to-Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio = Sherlock Debt Divisor/(net income per share + depreciation per share) + (capital spending per diluted share)Sherlock Debt Divisor = Market Price Per Share - ((Working Capital Long-term Debt)/Diluted Shares Outstanding)Sherlock Debt Divisor. A major concern that I have these days in analyzing companies is the amount of debt each takes on relative to its operations, and whether management is abusing this situation by taking on more debt than it requires. Debt, when used wisely, allows for what is called leverage, and leverage can be extremely beneficial within certain parameters. On the other side of the coin, the use of debt can also be excessive and put a company's future in jeopardy. So, what I have done to determine if a company's debt policy is beneficial or abusive is to create the Sherlock Debt Divisor.What the Divisor does is punish companies that use debt unwisely and reward those that successfully use debt as leverage. How do I do this? Well, I take a company's working capital and subtract its long-term debt. If a company has a lot more working capital than long-term debt, I reward it, and punish those whose long-term debt exceeds its working capital. So, if this result is higher than the current stock market price, then leverage is being used, and the more leveraged a company is, the worse the results of this ratio will be and the less attractive its stock will be as an investment.Price-to-Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio = Sherlock Debt Divisor/ (net income per share + depreciation per share) + (capital spending per diluted share)Sherlock Debt Divisor = Market Price Per Share - ((Working Capital - Long-Term Debt)/Diluted Shares Outstanding)Having successfully given everyone an introduction on how these two key ratios work, let us now analyze Lockheed Martin using each.Lockheed MartinMarket Price Per Share = $267.30Working Capital = Total Current Assets - Total Current LiabilitiesTotal Current Assets = $15,108,000,000Total Current Liabilities = $12,542,000,000Working Capital = $2,566,000,000Long-Term Debt = $14,282,000,000Diluted Shares Outstanding = 303,100,000Sherlock Debt Divisor = Market Price Per Share - ((Working Capital - Long-Term Debt)/Diluted Shares Outstanding)Sherlock Debt Divisor = $267.30 - (($2,566,000,000 - $14,282,000,000)/303,100,000))Sherlock Debt Divisor = $267.30 - ($-38.65) = $305.95Since Lockheed Martin has more Long-Term Debt vs. Working Capital, we, therefore, must punish it and use the $305.95 result as the new numerator in all our calculations.Price-to-Bernhard/Buffett Ratio = Sherlock Debt Divisor/ (net income per share + depreciation per share) + (capital spending per diluted share)Sherlock Debt Divisor = $305.95Net Income per diluted share = $5,198,000,000/303,100,000= $17.15Depreciation per diluted share = $1,215,000,000/303,100,000= $4.00Capital Spending per diluted share = $-1,063,000,000/303,100,000= $-3.50$17.15 + $4.00 + ($-3.50) = $17.65Price-to-Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio = $305.95/$17.65 =17.3317.33 is considered an above average result for this ratio, but had you used our chart below back in 2008 you would have seen your LMT investment go from $84 to $267 in about eight years.The above chart's results are backed up by our Lockheed Martin Datafile and Quantitative Chart below.For those of you who like to go farther back in time when analyzing companies, we have data on most corporate financials going as far back as 1969 (for US companies). As part of our Friedrich Global Research Seeking Alpha marketplace offering we have a special folder named ""Friedrich Historic"" and there our subscribers can find very long-term data on stocks like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as well as Lockheed Martin and each looks something like this:Only our Seeking Alpha premium subscribers will have access to this type of data. The data file and chart above are basically just extensions of our Friedrich Datafile and Friedrich Chart. But the third Datafile is something new and unique in that it shows our ""Bruce Consistency Ratios."" A Bruce Ratio is just the average of all the years under analysis for each of our ratios compared to the most current TTM Data. That way, for example, you can compare the historic average of the FROIC ratio (1992-2017) result of 21% to Lockheed's most recent TTM FROIC ratio of 36% from the current Friedrich Datafile. This tool allows us to see consistency over time by comparing current management's results to those of past management's or the historic average quants to the TTM ones (TTM = Trailing Twelve Months).Here, for example, is a long-term analysis I did for Accenture (NYSE:ACN) that shows how today's Accenture compares to the Accenture of the past. Our goal here at Friedrich Global Research is to give the investor as much data as we can (crunched by our Friedrich Algorithm) in order to give our subscribers the advantage. This research cannot be found or duplicated anywhere in the world, as all our work is proprietary and most importantly original. The system took me 30 years to create and successfully implement, as it takes some 2,600 calculations just to come up with the TTM Main Street price and over 109 million calculations to just analyze all 4,000-plus US stocks every month.In addition to our Friedrich algorithm, we also rely on a tool that I found to be very useful in verifying our work. The Forensic Accounting Stock Tracker (FAST Model) helps identify companies that may be resorting to more financial tricks to make analyst estimates. The model helps pinpoint where management might be aggressive with revenue recognition, cash flows, the balance sheet, and also takes into account valuation and other metrics. Here is the FAST Models result for Lockheed Martin:@DelvecchioJdIn conclusion, it is my belief that free cash flow analysis is the ultimate tool when analyzing companies, and my hope is that you may add these ratios to your own investor tool box in order to help you in your own due diligence.

4073172,102327,2017-05-15T05:55:08-04:00,"LMT has a well-supported growing dividend.LMT did well when defense budgets were under pressure; it should do even better under the new Adminstration.LMT is a buy below $280, so at just over $271, it's time to get some.","Subscribers to ""Engineered Income Investing"" got an early look at this material. Readers can learn more about this income boosting service from this Seeking Alpha Marketplace link.Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is a defense and aerospace contractor that I think will benefit from the plans of the Trump administration to spend more on defense. Its dividend stream makes it a good buy at any price below $280, which is above the current market price.Is LMT a good investment partner?As a dividend growth investor, I want my portfolio to generate a growing stream of dividends that can replace the income from my job without selling shares. In my portfolio, I want the shares of companies that will help me meet this goal. A company is most likely to be a solid long-term contributor to meeting my goals if it has 4 characteristics: a growing market, growing profits, well managed debt and growing dividends. These 4 characteristics make up a checklist that I use to evaluate whether or not I want to consider buying shares in a company and to determine that the company is a good long-term investment partner.While I am willing to look around to find out whether or not a company has the characteristics that I seek, I like it best when the company recognizes that these characteristics are important and that it uses them to sell itself to investors. So the first place I look for this information is the company website, and its annual reports. The first set of slides below come from Lockheed's latest annual report.This first slide addresses both the growing revenue and growing profit characteristics that I want to see. Sales grew each year, profits grew over the whole period and depending on the exact metric used they even grew each year. The net earnings per common share are the most important metric to me, as dividends are paid per share, and that increased each year.On the debt front, I see that Lockheed took on a large amount of new debt in 2015, but began paying that down in 2016. I also like seeing the decline in share count, as management is spending around $500 million to buy back shares.This second slide from the earnings report shows me that Lockheed management considers dividends to be an important part in shareholder return. While total return is not as important to me, it's a good thing that management sees that investors do look for total return. I also like that the comparison isn't made with just the S&P 500 but also with an index of companies in the same business.Looking at charts of revenue, EPS and FCF over the past 10 years, it's clear that LMT isn't a fast growing company. Given the restrictions on defense spending in the US during that time, this isn't surprising. It does however put more importance on the 25 million reductions in share count since 2014. The new Trump administration also seems friendlier to additional defense spending which will also help LMT grow.This chart shows the FCF coverage of the dividend. I like that over time the coverage has improved, mostly by the low end of FCF increasing. I like that the trend of FCF seems to be growing just a bit faster than the dividend. This bodes well for LMT having the ability to continue paying the dividend and to growing it as well.In the YChart® above we can see how Lockheed has done on three measures of general financial health. Operating Margin has a slight uptrend, ROIC is generally flat but is at a reasonable level, and ROE is also improving only slightly, but is also at a pretty healthy 200%+. I don't see any red flags here.Looking at David Fish's CCC List (which contains data on companies that have raised their dividend each year for 5 or more years), I see that LMT has grown its dividend each year for 14 years and has not cut the dividend since 2000. I also see that the lowest DGR value is 10.1% and that its last dividend raise was for 10.3% when the quarterly dividend was raised from $1.65 to $1.82.Also in the CCC List (but originally sourced from finviz.com) is that analysts expect LMT EPS to increase by 8.3% a year over the next 5 years. Given the tight coverage I found between FCF and the dividend, I will use that 8.3% as the growth rate for dividends going forward, rather that one of the higher past dividend growth rates. I believe that is the more prudent prediction.Next I look at how Moody's rates LMT. Baa1, which corresponds to a BBB+ from S&P and Fitch, is a solid investment grade rating. Looking at rating actions in 2015, when LMT took on $9 billion in new debt, I am happy to see that Moody's didn't downgrade them. Coupled with the decrease in debt during 2016, this gives me additional confidence that management is doing a good job of handling the debt.I like what I have seen in the past, so my next question goes to the latest earnings report and what it shows about LMT continuing operations.Looking at past performance can tell us a lot about a company but I also want to look at the latest earnings to see if the past performance is carrying over to more recent activity. On April 25th, LMT released results for Q1 and provided this presentation.The first slide shows the highlights of Q1. It looks like an okay quarter to me. Of most importance here is that it was profitable and LMT bought a significant number of shares back (which helps improve the company's ability to pay a growing dividend).This slide shows sales growth of around 10% over last year. It also shows why EPS was the same as this quarter last year. The C4I contract charge had a big impact this quarter. Lockheed took a charge on this contract because its solution was a lot less ""mature"" than was needed to meet the customer's requirements. In my experience, this tends to happen when the engineers on the sales team think an existing product either does more than it really does, or can be more easily modified to meet the customer's requirements than is actually the case.This often happens with the sales team as they are incentivized to make the sale and so see obstacles as smaller than they really are. I experienced this first hand when my boss promised a feature to a customer so he could make the sale, even though he knew (because he scheduled it so) that that feature in question was on the schedule to be implemented until after the customer's delivery date.Because of how operations and contracts developed during Q1, LMT revised their guidance for the whole year. While sales projections went up $100 million, the mix changed, so profits went down about $30 million. While I'd like it better if profit went up, $30 million isn't that big a change for a company this size. A 10-cent revision when EPS is more than $12 is a small thing. I will be concerned only if the number gets revised downward again next quarter.This slide has more details on why the 2017 EPS outlook was revised downward. Without the charge from the C4I contact, EPS would actually have been revised upwards.Here is additional detail on what caused the revision in the 2017 sales estimate. The whole increase is due to an increase in the Space segment. While that is cool (because I have always been fascinated by anything to do with space), it's not hugely significant.I find it interesting that although the Aeronautics didn't have its sales projections increased, its profit projections did increase. The $25 million increase in profits from the Space segment ties into its $100 million more in sales. Both of those increases were not enough to entirely offset the downward revision of profit for the RMS section.What's a good price?To figure out a good price, I do a DDM calculation using my Excel®-based DDM calculator (pictured below, you can see the web-based calculator I based it on here and read a discussion on how the formulas were developed here).Based on LMT being able to grow its earnings for the next 5 years at a rate of 8.3%, I will assume that they grow dividends in line with that rather than using the faster rates it has grown dividends over the last few years. I will use the currently declared dividend to generate an annual dividend payment of $7.28. To calculate out what I will use for the terminal dividend growth rate, I will subtract the current yield from my discount rate of 6.4% and round to the nearest whole percentage between 0 and 3. That gives me a terminal dividend growth rate of 3%.Using those parameters, I calculate that the NPV of the predicted future dividend payments is $279.35. That sets my buy price at anything under $280. Since LMT is trading for around $271, it is at a good value. Looking at its 4-year average yield of 2.9%, the current yield of 2.66% might indicate that the current price is a bit high. However, I think the current yield is below the 4-year average because LMT was significantly undervalued in the past, particularly in 2013.ConclusionLMT is a defense and aerospace contractor that has a fairly long history of paying an increasing dividend. Sales and profits held up well when defense budgets were under pressure. With the new Trump administration talking about increasing defense spending, I think LMT is in a good position to continue growing.As a dividend growth investor, I focus on the dividends and how a company has grown them in the past. But it is also important to look to the future. LMT has the projected growth in sales and profits to support growing the dividend. While I don't think it will be able to grow dividends as fast as it has in the past, it should have no problems growing them as fast as it grows earnings. Using the forecast of future earnings growth to predict future dividend payments, I think that stream of dividend payments has a present value that exceeds the market price of the stock at this time. That makes LMT a good buy at this time.Note: I hope you all got something out of this article. I do appreciate the time you took reading it.

Totals from last week didn't change much but Lockheed finally crested $15 billion in total awards thanks to three relatively small contracts.Nobody made any big moves although BAE, Raytheon and Northrop were on the winning end of a contract we will discuss below.Significant ContractsThe US Army Space and Missile Defense Command and Army Forces Strategic Command awarded a $3 billion contract to BAE, Kbrwyle Technology Solutions (NYSE:KBR), Northrop, QEK Integrated Solutions (a JV between KBR, Kratos (NASDAQ:KTOS) and Vencore, Raytheon, Science Applications International (SACI) and Teledyne Brown Engineering (NYSE:TDY). Per the contract, the companies above will provide for the ""research and development effort for the design, development, demonstration and integration, domain-one of space/high altitude missile defense hardware and safety solutions."" As I covered last week, missile defense is going to gain visibility with North Korea and Iran testing ICBMs. This is just one small piece to that puzzle and investors should anticipate more movement.Bell Helicopter, a subsidiary of Textron (NYSE:TXT), was awarded a $423 million contract for 25 AH-1Z new build helicopters for the Marine Corps. Bell Helicopter has a great position against Sikorsky, and with the Huey and V-22 I see them doing well in many years to come.Stryker (NYSE:SYK) was awarded a $486 million contract for orthopedic devices for the US military. There isn't much to say about the award, but Stryker is just one of those stalwart companies that year after delivers and has provided incredible stability for investors.While I go through the contract awards I'll search all the companies I am not familiar with. The DoD also puts an asterisk next to what is considered a small business. This can sometimes generate a good investment idea, as it did with CACI (NYSE:CACI) after they were awarded a large $1 billion contract on October 31, 2016. I covered it in one of these installments and look what happened to the share price.CACI data by YChartsThe company went from trading around $97 to going for over $130 in just a couple of weeks. I didn't take my own advice there, which I'm always a victim of, but it convinced me to take closer looks when things look big.The DoD awarded another contract that caught my eye to a company called Mikros Systems (OTCQB:MKRS). The contract is part of the Small Business Innovation Research Phase III program and is for the support of Adaptive Diagnostic Electronic Portable Test Sets used for the maintenance on several different military radar systems. The stock, which trades at $0.32, has already experienced a 28% pop since the contract was disclosed. What is remarkable about this contract is that in 2015 the company had just $7.3 million in revenue. Even after the 28% run the market cap is $11.4 million. The award length goes out five years and the company was given $1 million at the time of the award leaving $34 million on the table. This contract has the potential to provide what was an entire year's revenue for the next five years. The company looks healthy, and could finally have found a catalyst to break out.MKRS data by YChartsThe company has no debt, and this injection of revenue will help stabilize what is otherwise a lumpy figure. They have definitely caught my eye.Weekly PerformanceThe overall indexes had a rather sleepy week despite intra-week volatility and for the most part our focus companies followed along.LMT Price data by YChartsBAE had the big week, finally, and went up five and a quarter. Only GD and Huntington failed to beat the S&P which is okay because they've been huge winners on the year thus far.Brother, Can You Spare a Turbine?In a damning article courtesy of Breaking Defense, it was reported that the Navy and Marine Corps F-18 readiness levels are incredibly low. The Marine Corps alone is suspected of having 74% of its required F-18s unable to fly and the Navy at just 62%. There are multiple factors causing this: fleet age, sequestration hangover, lack of funding, longer depot level maintenance stays and operational demand. But once this sort of things get going, it is incredibly hard to climb out of the hole.The lack of mission-ready strike aircraft for the Navy and Marine Corps leaves a glaring hole in our capability to conduct missions as needed around the world. Should an adversary get a little reckless and attempt to challenge us we will find ourselves in a less than advantageous position. The United States does not like to find itself with their proverbial pants around their proverbial ankles; we have experienced this a few times before and the immediate time afterward was not pleasant and resulted in more death and destruction than would have been the case had we been prepared. So, knowing what we know and not wishing to be caught unprepared, what are we to do?With the logistical challenges that come with maintenance and a finite amount of trained personnel to conduct said maintenance it is easier and faster to buy more of the jets needed. Enter Lockheed Martin and the (in)famous F-35. After finding itself the target of President Trump's tweets the jet now looks positioned to be the hero.Of course the DoD could buy more new Boeing F-18s and we have seen a good amount thrown at the jet so far this FY for sustainment operations but with plans to replace them with the F-35 this option doesn't seem fiscally responsible.Lockheed Martin has a great opportunity to provide the United States with absolutely necessary strike aircraft...if they can only prove that they are ready to fulfill that role. Right now the Marine Corps has one F-35B squadron deployed to Japan on a permanent basis. The squadron, VFMA-121, moved from Yuma Arizona to Japan in January of this year. The Marine Corps has also conducted several close-in ground support training exercises as a proof-of-concept further illustrating the F-35's capabilities as a replacement for three aircraft the Corps currently flies. Since we are talking about the readiness of the US Navy it is also important to point out that the F-35C has conducted several carrier-borne takeoffs and landings and illustrated that it is ready for the more demanding sea-borne missions.Despite what the headlines might say, and what President Trump tweets, it is pretty obvious that the United States needs the F-35, perhaps now more than ever. Lockheed Martin knows this and those on the other side of the negotiating table know this.In Other NewsThe fallout from the ""Yemen Raid"" continues and now Yemen doesn't want US boots on the ground.The Battle For Mosul continues in Iraq and Al Jazeera actually has some pretty great coverage.North Korea forgets they're a poor failed state whose closest ally likely secretly hates them and shoots off a missile.President Trump did some sidestepping and told China he would recognize the ""One China"" policy that has persisted for decades.On Seeking AlphaSure Dividend provides the case for a huge General Dynamics dividend increase.Dhierin Bechai, in his march to Aerospace Sector dominance, provides articles on the T-X contract and the F-35 LRIP 10 contract.The Coming WeekThe Trump Administration is settling in and their policy toward defense posture is becoming clearer.

4048531,21151,2017-02-22T18:29:19-05:00,"Through the purchase of Sikorsky Aircraft, Lockheed Martin has found another growth vector.
        Raytheon bought Websense for nearly $2 billion in 2015, but it did not have the same impact on revenues.
        While both companies are interesting, Lockheed Martin wins over 4 core metrics that I use to analyze companies.","Right after Trump's election, defense company leaders such as Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) saw their price bumped instantly:Source: YchartsThe need for a ""safer"" world has become a big topic of conversation recently with many conflicts across the world and Trump's tweet about LMT F35 costs. I've analyzed both companies in the search for a buying opportunity. In light of the following analysis, I've concluded Lockheed Martin offers the best opportunity in this sector.As a dividend growth investor, my main focus when analyzing companies is around payouts and potential increase. As part of the process, I study three components leading to sustainable payment increase as per the 7 dividend growth investing principles:RevenuesSource : YchartsSince the budget sequestration of 2013, revenue has not been a pure pleasure for the defense sector. As you can see in the revenue graph above, Lockheed Martin even saw its revenue drop all the way down to -17.5%. The impact was less on Raytheon as they quickly purchased Websense, a cybersecurity firm, to open doors for additional growth. The company paid nearly $2 billion in order to boost their revenue. While we see the shock wasn't as bad as it was for LMT, there is an important trend shift recently.Raytheon has a slightly more diversified business model than Lockheed Martin with 31% of international sales.Source: Raytheon Investor Fact SheetLMT shows 20% of international sales on its side. As the U.S. congress has now started giving the green light to international sales (Space Daily), I guess both companies will be able to become less dependent on the U.S. military budget.What has happened is that Lockheed Martin also made an important purchase in 2015, Sikorsky Aircraft, and became the world leader in military helicopter manufacturing at the same time.Source: Mecaer Aviation GroupThis new addition was reflected in 2016 numbers. This is why there is an important increase since then. The fact LMT is already a leader in the aeronautic industry with their fighter aircrafts opening the door to synergy in new contracts as they will be able to offer helicopters at the same time (source Forbes).EarningsSource: ychartsAs far as earnings growth goes, LMT started to beat RTN in 2015. For three consecutive years, the company is showing a stronger trend. While revenues were going down for a few years, LMT concentrated on increasing their earnings. There is a clear synergy going on with the Sikorsky purchase as the company is reporting strong numbers both for revenues and earnings. The recent acquisition has been included in LMT numbers for about year now and further synergies could be seen in the years to come. For this reason, I think LMT has a stronger revenue growth potential then RTN.Source: LMT investors presentationDividend PerspectiveSource: YchartsBoth companies show great dividend payment trends with steady increases year after year. Raytheon shows 12 consecutive years of dividend increases with a dividend growth of 7.65% CAGR. On the other side, LMT shows 14 years of consecutive dividend increases with a dividend growth of 13.34% CAGR (source Ycharts).Raytheon shows a lower payout ratio than Lockheed Martin over the past 5 years, but with the recent earnings going up for LMT, both ratios are brought back to the same level. Shareholders can rest assured their dividend payments are safe with both companies.But since the dividend growth has been consistently stronger on the LMT side, LMT remains as my first choice.ValuationAs my last tool of comparison, I used a double stage dividend discount model. The double stage calculator enables me to use a first dividend growth rate for 10 years and another one for the following years. In order to be fair, I've used the same dividend growth expectations for both (8% and 7%) along with the same discount rate of 10% Here are the results of my calculations:Lockheed Martin: Undervalued by ~8%Source: Dividend Toolkit Excel Valuation SpreadsheetsRaytheon: Over valued by 32%Source: Dividend Toolkit Excel Valuation SpreadsheetsThis is a fairly interesting outcome as LMT shows a stronger dividend perspective over the past 10 years in comparison to RTN. Therefore, I should have used even more generous numbers with the first company. While both companies trade at about the same P/E ratio (20.90 for LMT and 20.14 for RTN), the DDM model shows a clear advantage to LMT.Final ThoughtsOverall, I think both companies will do well since there has been a clear desire expressed by the new administration for a stronger defense. However, in light of my analysis following crucial fundamentals, it seems LMT is one step ahead and still constitute an interesting buy in this relatively expensive market.Disclaimer: I hold LMT in my Dividend Stocks Rock portfolios.The opinions and the strategies of the author are not intended to be a recommendation to buy or sell a security.

4043859,50291,2017-02-08T12:11:29-05:00,Lockheed mentions savings of up $728 million for LRIP-10.Savings exceed expectations.Trump's contribution remains minor.,"In a previous article, I took a look at the possible pricing of Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) F-35 for the LRIP 10 (Low-Rate Initial Production 10) batch and concluded that, based on the existing cost reduction trend, I had no reason to believe that President Trump has been able to reduce the prices for the F-35.Source: www.f35.comTrump claimed he had been able to get prices down by as much as $600 million and that negotiations had been stuck. Early in February, the U.S. Department of Defense and Lockheed Martin reached an agreement for the LRIP 10 batch, making it a nice moment to look at how savings stack up against what I calculated in my previous article about the F-35.PricingBefore commenting on the pricing, there is something I need to clarify about what I stated in the comment section of the previous article on this topic, and that is about the engines. I had given readers the impression that the LRIP 10 contract does not include the engine. The fact is that the LRIP 9 and 10 prices do include engines, but prices have been negotiated separately with the supplier.Figure 1: Cost development F-35A (Source: AeroAnalysis)While the 6%-7% price reductions that Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, director of the F-35 joint program office, was talking about suggest prices for the F-35A will come down to $95-$96 million, the pricing came down even more. The F-35A has a price of $94.6 million in the tenth batch.Table 1: Price improvement LRIP 10Table 1 shows the prices per variant for the tenth batch and their respective cost improvement with respect to the pricing of LRIP 9. What can be seen is that pricing came down in the range of 7-8% instead of the range of 6-7%.LRIP 10The tenth batch consisted of 90 aircraft, with 35 units for foreign countries.Table 2: LRIP prices based on unit pricingWhile savings were previously expected to be in the range of $575 million to $675 million, the savings for the batch, according to my calculations, were close to $700 million. Trump stated that the price would be down by $600 million, which coincides with savings of low 6%. The cost savings as shown in Table 2 are actually bigger than 7%.Since Trump wants to slam prices in the best interest of the American taxpayer, it is worth checking how much of the savings can be attributed to U.S. Services. The U.S. Services combined ordered 55 jets, 44 As, 9 Bs and 2 Cs, resulting in $430 millions in savings.On its dedicated F-35 website, Lockheed Martin stated that the savings for the batch were $728 million, but I am unsure how this was calculated by Lockheed. One of my calculation methods does show a $0.72B difference, but I am currently in touch with Lockheed Martin to verify these figures and discuss the usefulness of the figure. If the figure proves to be correct and useful, I will provide readers with an update on where this figure is coming from.ConclusionIn my previous article, I stated that Trump's contribution to the savings is minor. I think it is fair to attribute the savings outside of the range provided by the JPO to Trump and his administration, which would indicate that Trump saved another $22 million or $31.6 million, depending on which figure you look at. As a percentage of the batch, this is a figure below 1%. As a percentage of savings, Trump's pressure added another 3% to 5% in savings. So over 95% of the pricing was already committed to and Trump's pressure has only been minor, contrary to his belief that he single-handedly saved $600 million on the deal.Join Seeking Alpha's first premium service with a focus on but not limited to the aerospace industry and get access to my exclusive research, trades, aircraft performance tools, databases and more.If you would like to receive updates for my upcoming articles, please click the ""Follow"" text at the top of this page next to my profile."

The 45th president of the United States has repeatedly criticized the Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) F-35 program as well as the potential costs of the new Air Force One with Boeing (NYSE:BA). The goal for Trump is easy, getting the best deal possible on each and every deal that the United States makes.In the latest of these episodes the President has claimed to reduce by $600 million. I think that the President's contributions to cutting costs have been closer to 0 than to 1. In this article, I explain why.PricingSo, the F-35 as many know is not one aircraft, but 3 separate aircraft. Each of these aircraft has different capabilities and a different pricing.Table 1: Pricing LRIP 9 BatchContracts and sales prices are currently being awarded per batch and the LRIP-9 batch represents the ninth batch of low rate initial production. This batch was for 57 aircraft and can be valued at $6.3B. The A unilateral contract basically told Lockheed Martin that no more than $6.1B would be paid for these aircraft. The LRIP-9 contract puts the value per aircraft at $107 million vs. the $110 million that Lockheed would like to have received for the batch on a per unit basis.Cost curve and cost cuttingTrump said the following about the LRIP-10 batch:Figure 1: Unit costs F-35A (Source: AeroAnalysis)Figure 1 clearly shows that with or without Trump's interference the price for the F-35A already has come down quite a bit. The compounded rate signals that the unit costs have come down by roughly 12% each batch. Over the past batches this behavior has become more linear signaling a $6-$7 million decline over each batch. The trendline suggests that the price would come down to $92.1 million.The linear part of the graph, however, is more telling indicating costs to come down to $95-$96 million per aircraft.LRIP 10The LRIP 10 batch will cover 90 aircraft. A quick calculation using the F-35A unit costs shows that if we look at the linear behavior of the costs cutting, the price was already supposed to come down by $450-$540 million. Now, the order mix does not solely consist out of F-35s of the A-variant, but also includes Bs and Cs which are expected to all see a significant cost reduction.Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, director of the F-35 joint program office, said the following about savings in the next batch:If we do the math we obtain the following results:*Dollar value in millions.What you can see here is that the savings of roughly $600 million as Trump stated coincide with the guidance of 6%-7% by Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan.ConclusionTrump has been in contact with Lockheed as the President-Elect in late 2016 and so it is hard to say he has not played a role at all, but I think it is safe to say his impact here has been minor. The unit cost development over the past LRIP batches suggests that LRIP-10 would indeed be cheaper by roughly 6%. So Trump is not responsible for that cut in costs, it was already there and the linear part that we see in Figure 1 for LRIP-5 up to LRIP-9 clearly shows that.I think that there is one thing that Trump is right about and that is there was difficulty and no movement. The previous batch ended in a unilateral contract, which Lockheed Martin was not pleased with and it also shows that negotiations are tough. At those times, a President such as Trump might come in handy to slam down prices.If you would like to receive updates for my upcoming articles, please click the ""Follow"" text at the top of this page next to my profile.Join Seeking Alpha's first premium service with a focus on but not limited to the aerospace industry and get access to my exclusive research, trades, aircraft performance tools and databases and more."
4040440,23757,2017-01-29T11:09:25-05:00,Increased defense spending is part of Trump's platform and something Republicans agree with.We favor companies with a focus on Air Force and Navy contracts.Investors need to understand FAS/CAS pension accounting to evaluate defense contractors' income statements.,"Prior to Donald Trump's inauguration the consensus view seemed to be that once in power Trump would moderate some of his campaign promises. As his first few days in office have shown, we should probably begin to take the things he's said much more seriously. One of his campaign promises was to substantially increase defense spending. It's also an area where Trump and Congressional Republicans largely agree and an area where many Democrats can be expected to go along with the administration's plans.In our opinion it's highly likely that the next four years will see steady increases in defense spending. To help investors we looked through the annual financial reports of most of the major defense contractors and put together some data that show each company's major customers. We are also sharing unique quirks about the defense industry that potential investors should know before buying shares in any defense contractor.For this article we looked at Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), General Dynamics (NYSE:GD), Raytheon (RTN), Huntington Ingalls (NYSE:HII), Boeing (NYSE:BA), Textron (NYSE:TXT), Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK), and Leidos Holdings (NYSE:LDOS).The chart below shows the percentage of each company's revenue that comes from each customer type. Note that any cell in the table that has a white background is from data that is explicitly disclosed in the company's financial statements and any table cell with a grey colored background is based on our estimate. For instance, if you were reading the row for Boeing you would see that the company discloses that 73% of their revenue is from commercial customers and the rest is from defense customers. Boeing is an aerospace company so we know that most of their defense contracts will be through the Air Force, so the next row shows that 17% of its revenue is from the DoD, primarily the Air Force. We can't say all of it because the company does make some products like the AH-64 Apache helicopter that are for the Army.It should also be noted that foreign military sales numbers are presented in different ways by different companies. Some companies break out the number separately and some include them in their sales figures for sales to the Department of Defense since many sales are made through the DoD's Foreign Military Sales Program. Because of this, there may be some discrepancy in companies' reported foreign military sales figures.Given that the US military typically projects power through the Air Force and Navy, we favor contractors that have significant business with those two branches. Indeed the DoD spends about $20B more per year each on the Navy and Air Force versus the Army.There is also one unique quirk about how the defense industry calculates and reports financial results that investors should be aware of. Generally speaking, defense contractors are able to include pension expenses as part of the costs of contracts and have those costs reimbursed by the government. Pension expenses for reimbursement are calculated using Cost Accounting Standards, but defense contractors report financial results using Financial Accounting Standards. Using two different standards causes discrepancies in pension reporting and costs from year to year. We'll let Lockheed Martin explain exactly how this works. The following is taken from page 39 of the company's latest 10-K.Over time FAS and CAS pension expenses will be equal, but in any one time period there can be significant differences. We see that below from looking at Lockheed's 10-K.We can see how in FY2013 they incurred $482M of not yet reimbursed pension costs, while in FY2015 they reported $471M in pension reimbursements above reported costs.Most defense contractors will report FAS/CAS adjustments in adjusted earnings numbers. It's important for investors to adjust companies' reported operating results to reflect the FAS/CAS pension adjustment when doing things like looking at P/E multiples or other GAAP accounting metrics that use line items from the companies' income statement. (This makes at least one case where adjusted earnings represent a more accurate picture of a company's finances!)Our final parting thought for investors is that buying a basket of defense contractors rather than just attempting to pick out the best one might be a good idea. This can help diversify risks when it comes to winning or losing major contracts and help insulate your portfolio from ""Trump tweet risk."" We have seen what can happen in the short term when the president decides to tweet about various companies. He's already picked on Lockheed Martin, so who knows what may come next."
4040050,68315,2017-01-27T06:22:16-05:00,"Revenues are growing and will continue to do so.
        Guidance is a little weak.
        Cash generation and shareholder returns are very attractive.","Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) reported fourth quarter results which beat estimates handily, but which sent the company's shares lower nevertheless. It looks like Lockheed Martin's (conservative) guidance was the reason for the meager share price reaction.Lockheed Martin's shares closed at $251 on Wednesday, which is about $20 below the 52 week high, but also roughly $20 higher than the low formed in October.Lockheed Martin had a successful year, with revenues hitting $47.2 billion (up by 17% year on year) and profits increasing by almost 25% over the same time:The company's F35 program turns out as a major top and bottom line contributor, and Lockheed Martin's shrinking share count allows for additional earnings per share growth.In terms of cash generation 2016 has been a successful year for Lockheed Martin as well, with operating cash flows coming in at $5.2 billion (which means the company trades at just 14.2 times trailing cash flows right now), which was well above the $5 billion goal the company had set earlier.Since the outlook for the current year is good (according to Lockheed Martin's management) the company aims to generate operating cash flows of $5.7 billion or more in 2017, which would mean a 10% cash flow growth rate and which would translate to a $500 million free cash flow increase (as long as capital expenditures remain at the 2016 level).Since Lockheed Martin keeps returning all of its free cash flows to the company's owners via dividends and share repurchases, a $500 million free cash flow increase could provide substantial dividend growth this year:Lockheed Martin is splitting up its free cash flows roughly 50-50 between share repurchases and dividends, a $500 million free cash flow increase would thus mean two things:$2.35 billion in share repurchases for 2017 (which would be enough to retire 3.2% of the share count), and total dividend payments of $2.3 billion, which would translate to a dividend increase of 12% in the current year. Lockheed Martin's last dividend increase was a little above 10%, so we will either see a dividend increase that is a little higher again this year, or Lockheed Martin may shift towards increasing the amount spend on share repurchases and raising the dividend by just 10% again.Over the last 14 years Lockheed Martin's share count has dropped by more than 35%, which would have translated to a 54% earnings per share increase all by itsself, even if net income would have remained flat. As net income has increased over that time frame as well, the lower share count (thanks to Lockheed Martin's share repurchases) has added a lot of EPS growth, which ultimately made each share of the company more valuable. As long as Lockheed Martin continues to reduce the share count by a meaningful amount each year, the same holds true for the future.Lockheed Martin's guidance for 2017 sees revenues of $50 billion (midpoint of guidance), which would represent substantial revenue growth from the current $47 billion level, but unfortunately earnings per share growth will likely be less meaningful this year, the company guides for a very small increase of a couple of cents. This is the reason the company's share price declined by a couple of points after the earnings announcement.Trading at roughly 20 times trailing as well as forward earnings Lockheed Martin's shares are not especially cheap, but not very expensive either (the S&P500 index is trading at more than 25 times trailing earnings). With a dividend yield of 2.9% and a very strong dividend growth history Lockheed Martin is a good choice for income focused investors.TakeawayRevenues and cash flows are growing and will continue to do so in the current year, but unfortunately the company's profits are expected to stall. In the long run Lockheed Martin should be able to increase its profits though, thus earnings being flat this year would only mean a temporary hiccup.With high shareholder returns and a 2.9% yield (versus a 2.0% dividend yield for the S&P500) Lockheed Martin remains an attractive dividend growth pick."
4039244,22148,2017-01-25T06:16:45-05:00,"Lockheed Martin smashed Q4 estimates, but guided towards weak 2017 numbers.The defense company historically smashes estimates, but Trump changes the equation.The stock is wildly expensive either way.","Despite warnings going back to last July, most Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) investors appear caught off guard by the weak stock action following Q4 results. After all, most expected the added benefit of Donald Trump surprisingly winning the U.S. presidential election to benefit the stock even further.For the day, the stock ended down only 1.8% despite weak guidance for 2017. The question remains as to whether the market is too bullish on this defense stock.A few key points exist with Lockheed Martin. The defense company tends to guide low and easily surpass quarterly estimates. The stock remains incredibly expensive while at the same time facing margin pressure questions from the president that was suppose to benefit defense stocks.The first step is the 2017 guidance. The defense company guided to an EPS goal of $12.40 for the year. Analysts were up at $12.87 prior to the report.Speaking of guidance over the last eight quarters or two years of results, Lockheed Martin smashed estimates in all but one quarter. In fact, five of the quarters had quarterly beats of at least $0.19.Source: Seeking Alpha earnings tabThe company originally guided to a 2016 EPS of $11.60 last January 26 long with the Q415 earnings report. Lockheed Martin ended up producing earnings from operations of $12.38 for 2016.As this example proves, investors should take the 2017 guidance with a grain of salt with one big potential hiccup. The Pentagon led by a push by Trump wants the costs of the key F-35 program to drop. The program expects a 6%-7% sequential cost decline and an eventual drop below $85 million per jet, down from the initial goal of dipping below $100 million.If margins are under pressure, the stock shouldn't trade at premium valuation multiples. Even sticking with the high analyst EPS estimates surely set to drop, Lockheed Martin trades at nearly 20x forward EPS estimates.LMT PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsThe key investor takeaway is that despite traditionally easily smashing EPS estimates, the new order with Trump in the White House probably inhibits the company from keeping up the streak. The last thing the CEO wants is to tell the President that getting the F-35 below $100 million per jet is difficult and turnaround with another big quarterly earnings beat.Lockheed Martin is too expensive in normal environments much less the current price pressures. Keep avoiding the stock with downside risk."
4039220,26861,2017-01-25T05:07:29-05:00,"President Trump's focus on Lockheed Martin's F-35 program and cost reductions will remain in the public spotlight for the near-term.Lockheed Martin beat analyst estimates, but provided conservative guidance for the company's bottom line.Additionally the company reported internal weakness on internal controls for the recently acquired Sikorsky operations; updates will be provided for 2016's 10-K and 2017 10-Qs.Despite the noise surrounding Lockheed Martin, the company's dividend will remain strong allowing for opportunistic buys.","Since President Trump's initial election and inauguration this past November and January, plenty has been talked about regarding Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). The focus of conversation has centered around the cost of the company's F-35 program. President Trump has been critical of the program's cost structure and has challenged the company to develop greater efficiencies to produce its F-35 fighter aircraft.On January 24th, Lockheed Martin announced its fourth quarter earnings, beating analyst estimates for both revenue and diluted earnings per share (NYSEARCA:EPS). The company earned $42.7 billion in revenue for 2016, and $12.38 per diluted share, besting last year's numbers by 15 and 26 percent respectively.Additionally, Chief Executive Officer (NYSE:CEO) Marillyn Hewson provided a detailed graphic for analysts to digest regarding the historical declining cost curve for the F-35 program. Today, the F-35 costs around $100 million per unit. The next version is expected to drop below $100 million, leading to a 60 percent reduction cost from the company's first produced F-35 fighter aircraft. This cost is anticipated to further drop to $85 million by 2019.Moving forward, Lockheed Martin is tasked with providing cost-effective defense products to the U.S. government, namely the F-35 program, while at the same time increasing U.S. jobs. For 2017, the company is expecting to deliver 66 F-35 aircraft. Combined with its other products and services, revenues are estimated to increase by six percent at the midpoint of guidance. But diluted EPS are estimated to remain flat.In addition to the lower earnings guidance, management mentioned that a material weakness was identified in the internal control over financial reporting for the Sikorsky operations. To date, no material misstatement has been identified, but further assessment will be undertaken for the segment's consolidated financial statements for the 2016 10-K and 2017 quarterly filings.Management has been prone to provide conservative guidance looking out a year ahead. But as the Department of Defense (NYSEARCA:DOD) is a major customer, Lockheed Martin is rightfully exercising some caution as the company will need to work with its suppliers to maintain gross margins. Lockheed Martin has typically agreed to long-term supplier contracts to limit risk, so margins may feel some pressure in the near-term.Lockheed Martin has been a strong stock performer over the recent years. Since January 2012, the stock price has increased by nearly 280 percent. But many investors have flocked to Lockheed Martin, as well as other defense stocks for the company's consistency in paying dividends. Over this same period, Lockheed Martin has generally paid a dividend with a yield of around three percent.The key point, is that Lockheed Martin has been an extremely shareholder-friendly company as it has typically given back 100 percent of its free cash flow to its shareholders either through share repurchases or dividends.Despite the conservative guidance for diluted EPS, management increased the company's operating cash flow expectations to $5.7 billion, reflecting a 10 percent increase from the $5.2 billion generated in 2016. For investors, this is the key focal point of how the company will continue to sustain its dividend payments.Source: Lockheed Martin financialsOver the previous four consecutive years, Lockheed Martin has generated greater than $3 billion in free cash flow. Capital expenditures have remained steady and operating cash flows have increased from $4.5 to $5.2 billion. As a result, during 2016 the company generated $4.2 billion in free cash flow.Source: Lockheed Martin financialsDuring this same period, Lockheed Martin's dividends paid have increased from $1.5 to $2.1 billion. Dividends per share have correspondingly improved from $4.72 to $7.28 reflecting a 54 percent increase.All in all, Lockheed Martin has paid $16.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases over the previous consecutive four years. These past four years provide investors with the most recent trends, but the company has paid a dividend for 32 consecutive years to boot.Getting back to management's guidance, the company expects to generate $5.7 billion in operating cash flow for 2017. Approximately $700 million of this will be for F-35 aircraft which were not delivered during 2016. Assuming capital expenditures remain around the recent eight percent growth rate, and Lockheed Martin may end up generating $4.6 billion in free cash flow.The company increased its share buyback amount to $4.3 billion in September 2016. Based on the fourth quarter earnings report, this amount is now at approximately $3.5 billion. Assuming a roughly 50 percent split for 2017 between dividends and share repurchases, investors could see a 10 percent increase in dividends paid of around $2.3 billion. This would equate to a dividend per share of around $7.75 keeping the dividend yield near the three percent level.The next few years will likely have some volatile moments for broader markets. President Trump will also remain as a market-mover based on his public statements. Based on these challenges, management will continue to guide the company in a conservative fashion. In the near-term, investors should feel encouraged that Lockheed Martin will be able to not only sustain its dividend payments, but have the capacity to continue to increase the dividend amount paid to shareholders."
4039740,23452,2017-01-26T11:56:52-05:00,"A comparative quantitative analysis using a unique free cash flow ratio.Identifies which company is a better value.Shows how one can become a better investor by practicing ""Capital Appreciation through Capital Preservation"".","On January 25, 2017 Seeking Alpha's News Editor Yoel Minkoff reported the following: More Boeing deliveries expected in 2017Boeing (NYSE:BA) recently released its earnings report and beat Wall Street estimates. This caused its share price to go up $6.83 or +4.25% on the same day. I own Boeing for my clients, so I am not complaining, but that jump in price was quite surprising especially when you view the following results from the Seeking Alpha news release:Revenue by segment: Commercial Airplanes +1%; Military Aircraft -18%; Network & Space Systems -8%; Global Services & Support -8%.Then when one looks at the year on year results below, Boeing also failed to inspire:Thus, I would imagine all the excitement about Boeing shares can probably be attributed to this news item:Commercial Airplanes booked 288 net orders during Q4. Backlog remains strong with more than 5,700 airplanes valued at $416B.With Boeing having a market capitalization of $103 Billion, it's a nice feeling as a shareholder to see that $416 Billion backlog number.Just a day before Boeing reported, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), a major competitor of Boeing, also reported and if we use the same year on year chart for Lockheed Martin that we used for Boeing above, we get this:Lockheed Martin had an amazing earnings report and from the chart above we can clearly see that its year on year results were dramatically better than Boeing's were. Unfortunately Lockheed Martin had to guide lower due to the fact that President Trump is having issues with the price of its F-35 fighter and has complained about it on his Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account. Since I own both stocks for my clients and have full positions in each, I thought it would be interesting to analyze both companies here on Seeking Alpha.In this article, I will present a real-time quantitative analysis of both companies employing a unique ratio that will demonstrate the power of free cash flow in the investment process and then give an opinion on how an investor should act based on our results.When analyzing almost any company, concentrate on its free cash flow generation, as that is where the rubber hits the road when it comes to finding out the truth. Before I show you a long-term Datafile for Boeing, let us first do a TTM (trailing-twelve month) analysis of its Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow and then compare it to its current price.Here are the two ratios that we will be using in our analysis, and for those new to this type of analysis, one can get a good introduction by reading my analysis of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) by clicking here.Price-to-Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio = Sherlock Debt Divisor/ (net income per share + depreciation per share) + (capital spending per diluted share)Sherlock Debt Divisor = Market Price Per Share - ((Working Capital - Long-Term Debt)/Diluted Shares Outstanding)BoeingMarket Price Per Share = $168.37 (at time of analysis)Working Capital = Total Current Assets - Total Current LiabilitiesTotal Current Assets = $62,237,000,000Total Current Liabilities = $48,489,000,000Working Capital = $13,748,000,000Long-Term Debt = $9,824,000,000Diluted Shares Outstanding = 632,700,000Sherlock Debt Divisor = Market Price Per Share - ((Working Capital - Long-Term Debt)/Diluted Shares Outstanding))Sherlock Debt Divisor = $168.37 - (($13,748,000,000 - $9,824,000,000)/632,700,000))Sherlock Debt Divisor = $168.37 - $6.20 = $162.17Since Boeing has less Long-Term Debt vs. Working Capital, we therefore must reward it and use the $162.17 result as the new numerator in all our calculations.Price-to-Bernhard Buffett Ratio = Sherlock Debt Divisor/ (net income per share + depreciation per share) + (capital spending per diluted share)Sherlock Debt Divisor = $162.17Net Income per diluted share = $4,290,000,000/632,700,000= $6.78Depreciation per diluted share = $1,848,000,000/632,700,000= $2.92Capital Spending per diluted share = $-2,637,000,000/632,700,000= $-4.17$6.78 + $2.92 + ($-4.17) = $5.53Price-to-Bernhard/Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio = $162.17/$5.53 = 29.33Now if you go to my Friedrich Legend (on what is considered a good or bad result), you will notice that our result of 29.33 is an average result.We last ran our Datafile for Boeing on January 3, 2017, and our Friedrich Algorithm gave a recommendation to our subscribers to hold it as our Algorithm's sell price is $185.77Here is the chart of our Price-to-Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow ratio results for Boeing:The Price-to-Bernhard Buffett Ratio considers a stock a bargain when it trades under 15 times and overbought when it trades over 30 times. Therefore, from the current results in the chart above, Boeing is closing in on being overbought per our ratio. Its $5.53 TTM result for the Bernhard Buffett ratio (found in the Datafile above) is average and shows that the recent massive run up its shares had, may prove to be short lived.Let us now compare those results to its main competitor Lockheed Martin.Here is our Price-to-Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow Analysis for Lockheed Martin.Lockheed MartinMarket Price Per Share = $250.39Working Capital = Total Current Assets - Total Current LiabilitiesTotal Current Assets = $17,110,000,000Total Current Liabilities = $14,425,000,000Working Capital = $2,685,000,000Long-Term Debt = $14,304,000,000Diluted Shares Outstanding = 302,100,000Sherlock Debt Divisor = Market Price Per Share - ((Working Capital - Long-Term Debt)/Diluted Shares Outstanding)Sherlock Debt Divisor = $250.39 - (($2,685,000,000 - $14,304,000,000)/302,100,000))Sherlock Debt Divisor = $250.39 - ($-38.46) = $288.85Since Lockheed Martin has more Long-Term Debt vs. Working Capital, we therefore must punish it and use the $288.85 result as the new numerator in all our calculations.Price-to-Bernhard/Buffett Ratio = Sherlock Debt Divisor/ (net income per share + depreciation per share) + (capital spending per diluted share)Sherlock Debt Divisor = $288.85Net Income per diluted share = $5,143,000,000/302,100,000= $17.02Depreciation per diluted share = $1,188,000,000/302,100,000= $3.93Capital Spending per diluted share = $-1,066,000,000/302,100,000= $-3.53$17.02 + $3.93 + ($-3.53) = $17.42Price-to-Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio = $288.85/$17.42 =16.5816.58 is considered an above average result for this ratio, but had you used our chart below back in 2008 you would have seen your LMT investment go from $84 to $250 in about 8 years.The above chart's results are backed up by our Lockheed Martin Datafile and Quantitative Chart below.Going forward, using our Friedrich Investing System, Boeing is a ""Weak Hold"" while Lockheed Martin is coming in as a ""Strong Buy"". Lockheed Martin is experiencing what we believe to be a short term problem in relation to President Trump's criticism as here is a recent update on the situation .Lockheed Martin is ""very close to a deal"" with the government for the 10th delivery lot of its F-35 stealth fighter, an aircraft that President Donald Trump has publicly criticized as being too expensive.CEO Marillyn Hewson spoke about the pending deal on the defense contractor's fourth-quarter earnings call Tuesday, calling conversations she's had with the president ""very productive.""""President Trump recognizes that the F-35 is a very large program - the largest program in the Department of Defense,"" Hewson said. ""He wants to make the sure that the American taxpayer is getting the lowest possible cost on the program.""In conclusion, it is my belief that free cash flow analysis is the ultimate tool when analyzing companies, and my hope is that you may add these ratios to your own investor tool box in order to help you in your own due diligence.

4033692,65113,2017-01-01T22:46:00-05:00,"It is unlikely that a Trump administration would curtail defense spending significantly, even in spite of the current rhetoric.However, should foreign markets choose to diversify defense suppliers, then this would have implications for Lockheed Martin's international sales.Hold if you've already bought, wait for a better entry point if you haven't.","Back in August of last year, I made the argument that Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) had been significantly undervalued. The stock has seen its peaks and troughs since then, bottoming out at $235 and then breaking the $265 level before settling out at just under $250:In the past couple of months, we have seen the atmosphere around the defense industry change quite significantly since the presidential elections. Specifically, there has been caution as to whether a Trump administration would seek to curtail defense spending resulting in significant cost cutting and a ""race to the bottom"" in price to sustain demand for contracts, as evidenced by Trump's tweets, including:Therefore, the defense contracting industry in general, could see some consolidation over the next couple of months, depending on how a Trump administration chooses to engage with defense contractors.On the other hand, Trump's negotiation tactics have been seen as implausible by some. For instance, with Trump also tweeting, ""Let it be an arms race. We will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all,"" this will invariably mean that cost cutting is not an option if the aim is to secure cutting edge defense systems. Even in the case of Boeing (NYSE:BA), cost reductions can only be accompanied by compromises on U.S. Air Force requirements. In this regard, while we could see competition among defense contractors intensify, it is difficult to foresee that President Trump would be able to negotiate significantly lower costs if the aim is to significantly upgrade US defense capabilities.As far as the effects on Lockheed Martin go, while short-term uncertainty could weigh in on orders, I am not overly concerned longer term. For one thing, Lockheed Martin and Boeing cater to quite different offerings in the defense industry. Taking the F-35 and F-18 Super Hornet as an example, the F-35 is specifically designed to cater to more advanced combat needs such as stealth combat, whereas the F-18 Super Hornet does not possess this capability. Only the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps currently use the F-18, and thus it would be highly impractical for the Air Force to replace F-35 stealth fighters with the former.Moreover, while Lockheed Martin still relies significantly on US government contracts to boost overall sales, international sales in Gulf countries such as Qatar have been growing. This has been in significant part due to the growth in foreign military sales overall, with the US being on track for a record of foreign weapons sales in dollar terms. Should growth continue in line with current trends, then 2017 would see foreign sales amount to greater than the $68.6 billion in foreign weapons sales seen in 2012.However, the one thing that would cause me concern at this point in time is a Trump administration's approach on foreign sales. Given this is not so clear-cut, this could be an area of uncertainty for Lockheed Martin for the time being. For instance, should Congress end up sanctioning lower levels of foreign defense sales as a result of protectionist policies, then this could have the effect of dampening Lockheed Martin's international sales base.Moreover, with the European Union showing indications of distancing itself from the United States on defense, this could mean that defense sales shift to European contractors such as Airbus (OTCPK:EADSF), Finmeccanica (OTCPK:FINMF), Thales (OTCPK:THLEF), and others. While Trump rhetoric on curbing foreign defense sales may be overblown, this could pose a significant threat if major markets outside the United States choose to diversify their defense suppliers. Additionally, major markets such as India are adopting protectionist defense policies as well, requiring jets to be manufactured in India to be eligible for sale. Should this pattern emerge in other major markets, then a more protectionist defense industry would mean fewer international opportunities for Lockheed Martin.To conclude, the current atmosphere surrounding defense sales is not merely limited to Lockheed Martin, and it could well be that potential concerns are overblown. However, should foreign military sales show signs of dying down in 2017, then it could be an indication that Lockheed Martin is a hold until greater clarity emerges on defense policy in the United States. I still believe the stock is undervalued. If you're a longer-term buyer, then I recommend holding. However, if you're looking to get in at a better entry point, then it's possible we could see more attractive price points while the uncertainty persists."
4032489,23452,2016-12-23T14:02:05-05:00,Explores how a President Elect Trump Twitter Tweets can effect your investments.Explains how the F-35 will never be replaced by the Boeing Super Hornet.Warns investors to be diligent about watching out for Trump's tweets.,"On January 20, 2017, President-Elect Donald Trump will become America's 45th President and from a global stock market point view his first 100 days, as well as the next four years of a Trump administration, should be interesting. Wall Street hates nothing more than uncertainty and surprises and with a Trump administration the markets should get a continuous stream of both that should generate some serious volatility. It seems the President will mostly attempt to govern through his Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) feed because he seems to be addicted to it. You can't blame him for doing so because his Twitter feed helped him to get elected. President Trump is obviously not a big fan of the press and will use his feed to circumvent it and speak directly to the public.A large part of my job these days has been reading Trump's tweets as each one can cause billions of dollars in trading in each direction. The hardest job to have in the Trump administration will go to Sean Spicer, the newly appointed White House Press Secretary.Mr. Spicer went on the usual talk shows after being appointed and right from the start had to try and clarify what President-Elect Trump had just tweeted in regards to Nuclear weapons:Mr. Spicer also had to deal with Trump's comments during an off-air conversation with Mika Brzezinski of MSNBC, the President-elect surprisingly said of nuclear proliferation, ""Let it be an arms race, we will outmatch them at every pass. And outlast them all.""Spicer a half hour later told TODAY's Matt Lauer, "" There is not going to be"" an arms race, forced to clarify Trump's comments that the MSNBC morning show reported on earlier in the day.Obviously with Trump having such a hawkish tone, the smart move for an investor to make is to invest in the Defense industry, because this tone sounds very similar to President Reagan's ""600 Ship Navy"" strategy that boosted military spending by government considerably during his entire term and eventually helped the US win the Cold War.So, if you are going to invest in defense then the smart move is to invest in the most profitable and largest defense contractor Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), which I have done as it is still an amazing bargain based on its strong free cash flow generation as my quantitative chart below shows.If President Trump's objective is to expand the US Nuclear Arsenal, then he must go to Lockheed Martin in order to do so:Lockheed MartinSo, under a Trump administration Lockheed Martin will greatly benefit as will its chief rival Boeing (NYSE:BA). After the news broke that Donald Trump had won the Presidential election both Boeing and Lockheed Martin shares erupted to the upside, as many investors clearly saw what I did, but Lockheed Martin has since retraced a bit due to various Trump Tweets that have surfaced.Then after meeting with the CEO of Lockheed Martin, Marillyn Hewson he then tweeted this:And this all happened on the day that this news was announced by Seeking Alpha:Then in order to attain Donald Trump's goals for a much stronger military we get this news as well:So, it seems that history is repeating itself, but if one wants to increase the size of the nuclear arsenal and increase the size of the military then one has to use Lockheed Martin for all of the above.The reason for the F-35 cost overruns is because the F-35 does not just come in one model, but actually comes in three variants and each serves a different purpose. Therefore, just like when adds special options to a new car that one is looking to buy, it costs much more to make three separate versions of an aircraft, rather than one. Here are three versions as described by Lockheed Martin:F-35AF-35BF-35CThe Boeing Super Hornet that President Elect Trump tweeted about is just one model and is not a pure stealth aircraft and can never do what the F-35 can. Boeing's plan is to take the Super Hornet out of production by 2020, but those plans may have changed now after this latest tweet. So good news for Boeing shareholders.Plane production as we have seen with Boeing's Dreamliner 787, takes more than a decade to go from the drawing board to testing, then production and finally mass production as there are always hiccups along the way. It was that way when the Boeing 747 went into production in the 1960's and will always be that way as fighter jets are highly complex machines and the more bells and whistles you add, the harder it is to get everything working together smoothly. This is because most parts on the F-35 are new and innovative, such as its incredible stealth technology. So, if President Trump wants to build the strongest and most powerful military on earth, then the technology advantage of the F-35 is clear vs. a Boeing Super Hornet. Now if he wants to wait and have Boeing redesign the Hornet to have it do what the F-35 can do now, then he will never see it fly over the next 8 years, (if he were to be re-elected) as it needs to be redesigned.Thus, investors in Lockheed should not worry that much because it is clear from his rhetoric that a President Trump will always be hawkish when it comes to defense and I believe he will always give the military whatever it asks for and the F-35 fighter is the all-out favorite, based on the thousands of orders that were made by the combined branches of the military. No other fighter has ever been built to serve all branches of the military like the F-35 has, thus a replacement would need years to be developed and produced.So, for those who own Lockheed Martin shares, I would not worry too much about President Trump's tweets, as there are only a hand full of defense contractors that can build an F-35 or that are designed to serve the military as a contractor, like Lockheed Martin is.Going forward there has been a massive paradigm shift in the world as a result of the Trump election and going into 2017 and beyond investors must expect to see a great deal of Tweets from a President Trump, as his twitter account is his bully pulpit and there is nothing investors can do to stop him from tweeting. So expect major volatility in any company he decides to tweet about. It is every investors responsibility to track his tweets as you never know when a company you own is going to be in his cross-hairs or not. One day it could be Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or the next day it maybe Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The only way to stop him is through an act of Congress and I don't see that happening anytime soon."
4033770,69675,2017-01-02T09:49:04-05:00,"In this article, I decided to look into the rhetoric of Trump in regards to defense firms over the past couple of weeks.By doing so, I arrive at one of two likely conclusions for the firms operating in this space and what it means for their investors long term.More likely than not, Trump will prove to be bullish for these firms, but he may also be a force for decreasing their profit margins moving forward.Investors should tread carefully due to the uncertainty.","Whether you are a fan of Trump or a dissenter, whether you are elated at the market's takeoff since he won the election in November, or horrified by the events that could befall this nation, no person can deny that his win has had a tremendous and volatile impact on global markets. To do so would be to deny reality.As we watch history unfold around the nation's choice, one area that I've come to be interested in regarding Trump is the role that defense will have moving forward and the question of whether or not the companies in this space will benefit. In what follows, I will take a look at four key players in the defense space, two of which, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) and Boeing (NYSE:BA), he has taken direct aim at, while the other two, Raytheon (RTN) and Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), have so far escaped his wrath. I will give my thoughts on what the future of defense is likely to be under Trump's reign.A look at the rhetoricDuring his Presidential campaign, Trump stated that, ""I'm going to make our military so big, so powerful, so strong, that nobody - absolutely nobody - is gonna mess with us."" While details from his campaign have been near non-existent on many different points, it's certain that military spending would have to grow significantly from current levels which, in the US government's 2017 fiscal year, was estimated to be around $600 billion (this excludes certain ancillary activities such as VA care and the like).Looking at this rhetoric, it may be tempting to say that the market should be optimistic about defense firms like the aforementioned. In fact, as the general market rose, these four firms climbed with it, led by Boeing, whose shares are currently up 9.5% since the election. That's why, though, investors may be so surprised by follow-up comments made by Trump. These include the two tweets below, wherein he threatened to strip firms like Boeing and Lockheed Martin of large, profitable contracts.Given these statements, combined with Trump's goal of building up the military, we can conclude one of two things. The first is that he could be a loose cannon, rattling off lines that sound nice to the ears of certain voters while having no coherent goal himself. In fact, this theory has been championed by Trump's dissenters for over a year now. Under this scenario, we may as well throw darts at a board of options because there's no knowing what the future holds. The second, however, is one in which he truly is dedicated to building up the military but only in a sensible manner, a manner that means defense firms will have higher sales but lower margins (maybe even lower profits as a whole).I'll get to this point in more detail toward the end of this article but, before that, I think it's imperative to look at the financial performance of these four companies to see if the second scenario even makes sense. After all, if a firm is barely making a profit, how much can you expect to squeeze it? Then again, if the opposite is true, then does the second scenario seem logical?BoeingEven though Boeing is the least exposed of the four major firms when it comes to military contracts, I figured I would start off with it because it was the first defense company Trump assailed. In 2015, Boeing had tremendous revenue, compared to its rivals in this piece, of $96.11 billion, a sizable increase over the $68.74 billion seen back in 2011. As you can see in the graph below, however, profits and operating cash flow (especially the latter) have continued to move higher, and with an operating cash flow margin in 2015 of 9.7%, the firm makes a nice chunk of change, though it's hardly what I'd call a cash cow.BA Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsPart of this might be due to its small exposure to government contracts and its large emphasis on commercial operations. Take, for instance, the fact that it received a hefty 62% of its revenue from the Department of Defense (this excludes international contracts that were arranged by the US government and it excludes NASA) for its defense operations. But this set of operations only made up 19.6% of the company's sales for the year. What, then, about a more exposed firm like Lockheed?Lockheed MartinIf Boeing is more of a commercial play, Lockheed is about as close to being its opposite as possible. In 2015, the firm generated 78% of its revenue from contracts with the US government, 58% of which came from the Department of Defense. On top of this, a further 21% of its sales were derived from international contracts, including those arranged by the US government.LMT Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsInterestingly, despite this large exposure to the government, Lockheed's sales haven't really impressed in recent years, staying mostly flat over at least the last half-decade. However, profits over this time frame have risen from $2.66 billion up to $3.61 billion, while operating cash flows have gone from $4.25 billion up to $5.10 billion, all of which can be seen in the graph above. Compared to Boeing's respectable operating cash flow margin, Lockheed's stands at a higher 11.1%, using 2015 data.RaytheonLike Lockheed, Raytheon is also incredibly exposed to the military (though it hasn't been attacked by Trump yet). According to management, 68% of the firm's sales came directly from the US government in 2015, plus the business generated another 12% from foreign nations/militaries that were arranged by the US government itself. This seems to afford the business exposure on par with, or maybe even exceeding (it's hard to tell since their disclosures don't always match up) Lockheed's, and could also bring it into focus in time.RTN Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsThis is especially true when you consider that, also like Lockheed, Raytheon generated an operating cash flow margin that was in excess of 10% in 2015 (it was at 10.1% to be precise). All-in-all, the firm's operating cash flow came out to $2.36 billion compared to the $23.25 billion the business generated in sales for the year. Like Lockheed, Raytheon also has seen its sales stay more or less flat (actually dipping a little bit) over the past five years, so while the business may be generating nice profits, it's not seeing any increase in sales alongside it.Northrop GrummanThe last company I decided to look at here is Northrop. All-in-all, this business is like both Lockheed and Raytheon in terms of exposure, with US government sales coming out to a whopping 83% of the firm's total revenue for 2015. It's also like Raytheon in that the business has seen its sales drop over the past five years, though with a decline of 10.9% since 2011, it's hard to say that the falloff has been anything but meaningful. Sales and other data can be seen in the graph below.NOC Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsAs a result of falling sales, Northrop's operating cash flow has also dipped, but this seems largely confined to 2015 when its profit margin for the year dropped to 9.2% of sales, the lowest point seen since 2011 and well below the 10.8% experienced in 2014. What this means is that, due to its focus on costs and, perhaps, due to how it's pricing its contracts with the government, the firm hasn't been terribly harmed from its lower share relative to its peer group.What does all of this mean?Looking at these four defense plays, and combining it with Trump's words (assuming my first scenario regarding him having no real goals is not true), we can arrive at a couple of possible outcomes. First, these defense plays really are not what I would consider to be cash cows. Now, in all fairness, if they are bloated as a result of large and profitable government contracts, then there could very well be room for improvement here. In essence, this would be true if they feel they don't need to worry too much about the bottom line because the government will always be there with another lucrative contract.Should this case turn out to be true, then pressure from Trump could push down the sales of defense companies (without factoring in the benefit of increased spending associated with future projects), but their bottom lines may actually hold. That said, if the amount of excess among these firms is slim, then it could serve to not only harm their sales but their bottom lines too.Either way, the end result, without factoring in the potential impact of fewer employees at these firms, would be a net benefit to the taxpayer. It would also make liberals happy by removing what is perceived to be a military industrial complex geared toward funneling money to certain millionaires and billionaires, and it would make conservatives happy by reducing what they perceive to be waste while, if new spending is added on top of one of these two outcomes, increasing the size of the military.Knowing which of these two outcomes is correct is impossible right now, but the likely result is somewhere in between; sales will increase but margins will compress. On a net basis, it's hard to tell if the pressure from margins being pushed down during a Trump Presidency will offset the impact from higher sales, but recent share price movements from defense firms suggest that anything bullish coming from Trump's policies will likely outweigh the bearish aspects of his rhetoric.TakeawayIn my articles, I aim to remain as unbiased as possible, especially when it comes to politics. The fact of the matter is that there are some things I agree with liberals on and some things I agree with conservatives on. Keeping this mindset, and if we assume that Trump really does care about keeping costs down on government projects while promoting a larger military, the probable end result will be defense firms that have slightly lower margins but whose sales will rise in the years to come. If the bottom line, on a net basis, does happen to rise (as it probably will), I would perceive this as a positive on the whole, but any other outcome will likely be negative for these firms."
4033264,98146,2016-12-29T12:25:18-05:00,"President-Elect Donald Trump has been upsetting the share prices of several aerospace and defense contractors with Tweets, Lockheed Martin especially.The recent targeting of the F-35 JSF has created a short-term headache for the company and their investors.This manufactured headwind has created an opportunity for long-term investors.At the currently elevated valuations there is still risk at this price.","Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has had a great year, and with the election of Donald Trump to president on November 8 their year got even better with the share price rocketing up to a new 52 week high of $269.90. After coming back to earth shares are hovering around $250 a piece and at 19.5 trailing twelve month earnings the company is approaching ""good company at a fair price"" territory.An Essential CompanyLockheed Martin is one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors in the world. With a $73 billion market cap and $46 billion in sales in 2015 the company has grown to provide everything from fighter jets to combat ships for the United States and it's allies.The company operates four segments; Aeronautics, Missile and Fire Control Systems, Rotary and Mission Systems and Space Systems. In the first three quarters of the year Lockheed has already surpassed last year's twelve months of revenue and is on pace to eclipse $50 billion total on the year.(Source: Lockheed Q3 slideshow)Strong sales are being propelled by the Aeronautics segment and the F-35 program that has been the recipient of several Tweets (NYSE:TWTR) from Mr. Trump. Investors often leave out the company's Sikorsky acquisition in November of 2015 to expand their Rotary Mission Systems segment which has grown to be the second largest contributor overall. The company remains diversified beyond what makes the news but unfortunately is exposed to significant risk with the F-35 and possibly the Littoral Combat Ship program as well.Short Term Pain, Long Term GainThe usually sleepy sector of defense and aerospace has been pretty volatile compared to their previous trading patterns. This volatility, both upside and down, has been courtesy of a handful of Tweets from our soon-to-be President.The Tweet-Storm began on December 6th with the PEOTUS' ire being directed at Boeing (NYSE:BA) and the Air Force One contract. Since then the company has been on the downtrend back to their pre-election levels thanks to a few follow-on Tweets. It seems that investors began to realize that defense contractors weren't going to have a free pass despite Mr. Trump's campaign promises of a larger and better equipped military. Even as Mr. Trump was Tweeting his displeasure, the DoD awarded Lockheed over $3 billion in contracts during the week of December 19-25. Fear not, fellow investors, there is reason to believe all will be okay.A Rising TideThe tide of defense spending is rising, not just in the United States but in NATO allies as well. Another of Mr. Trump's campaign trail promises was to get our NATO allies to contribute more to their collective defense. What he was alluding to was the fact that many NATO allies don't spend the required 2% of GDP on defense. Shortly after being elected, Mr. Trump spoke with Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO Secretary General. The Secretary General Tweeted shortly thereafter.The NATO allies aren't the only countries set to increase their spending on defense, the United States just gave a shot in the arm to the weapons budget.The NATO allies won't be alone in increasing spending, the US has already injected an additional $9 billion in spending via the National Defense Authorization Act that was recently signed by President Obama. Although the President only requested $610 billion for defense for 2017 Congress allocated an additional $5.8 billion for contingency operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and Europe and another $3.2 billion labeled ""Readiness Stabilization Funding"" which is meant to slow the eroding readiness of the United States military after over a dozen years of sustained combat operations. This money will be going to planes, ships, ammunition, personnel and anything else necessary to maintain the military. With General Mattis, General Flynn, and General Kelly all at key cabinet positions we can safely assume the military will get what they need, when they need it which is also good for investors.Not All RosesLockheed Martin isn't without some very serious near-term concerns. The fact that Mr. Trump is taking a special liking to defense contracts and their costs doesn't bode well for the profit margins at Lockheed or others. Lockheed operates at just 11% gross margins as it is, so anything chipped off the block of contracts will materially impact the bottom line. Perhaps overall volume will help as more planes, ships and guns hit the tables of equipment of the military but there isn't much more blood to get out of the stone.As the US Military begins consolidating their platforms, large contracts for weapons programs can also begin to favor fewer companies. The game is quickly approaching zero-sum, like with the JLTV and Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK), the F-35 and Lockheed, and the upcoming $11 billion Air Force trainer program. Other contractors no doubt benefit from these large awards but the reduction of programs will change the ""profit-sharing"" the defense industry currently benefits from.Risky ValuationLockheed is expensive, and there isn't much you can say to argue against that fact.(Source: FAST Graphs)With current estimated earnings in 2017 at $12.70-$12.77 the company is trading at about 20 times forward earnings. For a company that has averaged 15.2 times earnings the last 20 years that is a bit rich. Compared to the broad S&P 500 and their 24.9 P/E ratio as of December 23, Lockheed looks like a fair bet, the 2.9% dividend compared to the S&P 500's 2.07% helps out a bit too.Even with the valuation worries, an investor who buys Lockheed here still buys a high-quality, well-run business with a large moat. Sentiment is pretty positive on the entire defense sector and price seems to have been following the narrative and not the other way around. If the price were to drop meaningfully I have a feeling we would have a change in the narrative where all of a sudden Mr. Trump wasn't good for the defense sector.In ClosingAfter coming down off post-election highs and seeing the stock remain pressured it is hard to think this is not an opportunity. The company continues to execute day to day despite the distractions from the Tweets. So far in this fiscal year they have been awarded over $13.6 billion in DoD contracts, over 18% of their current market cap. This is more in total contracts than Boeing, Raytheon (RTN), Huntington Ingalls (NYSE:HII), General Dynamics (NYSE:GD), BAE Systems (OTCPK:BAESY), United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) and Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) combined.After being on the sidelines writing about the company I figure it is about time I jump in. While there may be some short-term pain the long-term prospects for Lockheed are incredibly bright.I hope you all got something out of this article. I do appreciate the time you took reading it.

4037152,98146,2017-01-16T16:19:00-05:00,"Contracts were slow to come in this week but Raytheon and Lockheed managed to grab my attention.
        Mr. Trump and the CEO of Lockheed met at Trump Tower again and I discuss this new development in the F-35 saga.
        Rocky Brands scores more government contracts and the company seems to be on the right path.","Another slow week in contracts with not much shift in the FY17 awards. For those who many be just finding this weekly series I'll explain the below numbers a bit.Every day at 5 pm EST the Department of Defense releases the contracts that are valued at over $7 million that they awarded for that day. I take these figures and compile them in a spreadsheet for the eight companies below. Why those eight? I feel they give me the most accurate gage on where the defense contracting industry is. They cover everything from ship building to fighter jets to bombs so the gamut of the products needed to defend the nation are well represented. The figures below are what has been awarded for fiscal year 2017 which began on October 1st, 2016. Keep in mind this doesn't include sub-contracts from one contractor to another, for example Lockheed pays Raytheon for some sensors on the F-35. It also doesn't include foreign awards not done through the Foreign Military Sales program. It is still a useful indicator of how each company is doing in their quest to secure government contracts.Taking a look at last week you can see that the awards were pretty slow in coming in. There still some exciting awards worth taking a look at more in depth.Significant ContractsRaytheon got a relatively small $8 million contract through DARPA to work on the Multi-Azimuth Defense Fast Intercept Round Engagement System, or MAD-FIRES for short. This brings the total for the MAD-FIRES contract to $26 million and brings Phase II development to bear. During Phase II Raytheon will be focusing on the projectile development and performance. Just what is MAD-FIRES? According to DARPA the MAD-FIRES program is a defensive program aimed at thwarting threats to our naval surface vessels such as small fast-attack craft, missiles and drones. DARPA envisions the system being able to effectively engage and destroy multiple targets from multiple directions with extreme precision at a lower cost of current systems like the Phalanx Close-In Weapons System. Some of you may be familiar with ""drone swarms"" which are being pushed pretty hard by the Chinese, this appears to be a direct response to that threat. This video here is pretty remarkable, and the defense applications for drone swarms are almost limitless when enough imagination is applied. Protecting multi-billion ships against a couple thousand dollars worth of drones is difficult, this is one step in assuring our assets are defended.Lockheed got another vote of confidence for its CH-53K King Stallion program through a $24 million contract (N00019-06-C-0081) awarded on the 12th. This contract will allow Lockheed to continue testing and development of the Sikorsky helicopter. The King Stallion is the long-awaited replacement for the Marine Corps' CH-53's previous versions and will fulfill the heavy lift role the Marines rely on. The current fleet of CH-53 craft are incredibly exhausted after over a dozen years of sustained combat operations in two very harsh theaters of war so this refresh is much needed. In an expeditionary environment where even vehicles needs to be lifted in, the CH-53K will greatly expand the reach of the Marine Corps and allow ground forces to penetrate deeper into enemy-held territory especially when combined with the V-22 and F-35.Weekly PerformanceThe F-35 was again in the news, this time in a more positive fashion, but that didn't stop Lockheed from having a more volatile week than normal.With the exception of Lockheed and GD the rest of our companies underperformed the S&P 500. Lockheed has been the most interesting to watch so far with the F-35 program under what seems like constant attack. Lockheed and the F-35 aren't going anywhere andThe F-35 Is Here To StayMr. Trump and Ms. Hewson, the CEO of Lockheed, met at Trump Tower on Friday to discuss the F-35. In the lobby following the meeting Ms. Hewson communicated her intent to keep costs down on the F-35 and take a personal interest in the program, even more so than she already has as CEO. This wasn't interpreted by the market as positive with investors likely fearful of margins getting pressured.More informed individuals will point out that the F-35 costs have already come down considerably from the initial orders of 2011. We have to wonder how much of the cost savings for the next 90 jets are going to be from Lockheed further slashing prices, and margins, as a result of Mr. Trump and how much are just a result of the natural economies of scale that the company was already planning on achieving. I'm starting to believe that the cost cuts both Mr. Trump and Ms. Hewson are promising were already baked into the cake so to speak. No real numbers were ever thrown around to give us a benchmark to compare the upcoming contract to, so any reduction in the price compared to the last lot of jets will be praised even though it was already expected. It is a win-win for Mr. Trump and Ms. Hewson and Lockheed investors.It no longer appears that the United States is going to seek out a ""comparable"" alternative to the F-35 at this time either. Several experts and cabinet nominees have stated that the F-35 and F-18 cannot be compared, and in a white paper recently released John McCain is advocating for the planned number of F-35s to remain the same (if not increase in some spots) in addition to more F-18s being procured to temporarily fill the gap from F-35 delays. The importance of the F-35 is recognized at the highest echelons of our government.The F-35 is all but a guarantee at this point, and I don't even expect the margins to get pressured that much either. Lockheed shares seem to be ""unfairly"" punished each time the F-35 hits the headlines. For each delay in the F-35 is seems there is more money being pushed into the F-22, also a Lockheed jet, to keep that program flying until the F-35 issues are ironed out. Unlike the F-22, the F-35 is being sold to our allies as well, which further supports that the F-35 is here to stay.Big BootsA little known small company called Rocky Brands (NASDAQ:RCKY) received about $38 million in orders from the DoD this week to supply combat boots to the United States and Afghanistan. The two orders are significant based on the company's small size with just an $82 million market cap. In 2015 Rocky brought in $269 million in revenue and so far this FY the company has scored over $140 million in DoD awards. The most recent reported quarter only goes up to September of 2016, the quarter with a $101 million order is coming on February 16th though that won't include an additional $101 million in revenue due to the structure of that contract. The company pays a 3.17% dividend and may be worth some further investigation.In Other NewsChina doesn't like that Trump doesn't want to recognize the ""One China"" policy.The Iraqi military continues to gain ground in Mosul.General Mattis was granted a waiver to serve as the Secretary of Defense and he also had his confirmation hearing. He knife-handed those questioning him, but initial reports are that nobody died.The Navy will soon get their fancy new aircraft carrier, the Gerald Ford, after many delays.The Intelligence community gazed into their crystal ball to see what the world would look like in five years.On Seeking AlphaMichael Boyd peeks under the hood at United Tech in a balanced review of the business.William Stamm lays out the case for Raytheon as a great investment based on total returns and future growth prospects.Kumquat Research revisits Orbial ATK giving readers a fair insight into the company.Kal Telage highlights General Dynamics strong positioning in the defense sector.SakonnetInvesting writes on thinly covered National Presto (NYSE:NPK) and provides a great slideshow.Tunga Capital says it is time to sell United Tech.The Coming WeekMr. Trump gets inaugurated this week and who knows what kind of volatility that will bring into the market.

It will be nice to finally see what the first 100 days of his administration will bring and I completely expect defense spending to be increased within those 100 days. China seems to be most concerned with his presidency and this will be worth watching as it relates to the defense industry.I appreciate you reading, please leave your thoughts and questions in the comments.

4032431,102501,2016-12-23T10:20:04-05:00,"Shares of Lockheed Martin are trading close to their all-time high.The company remains attractive to investors due to its stable performance, growth potential resulting from Sikorsky acquisition, anticipated volume increase of its flagship F-35 program and growing dividend payouts.Based on my DCF and trading comparables analyses, I recommend to HOLD shares of Lockheed Martin.","Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is one of the world's leading aerospace and defense players. Over the years the company has been offering attractive returns to investors. Having acquired Sikorsky last year, Lockheed Martin gained scale and unleashed new growth opportunities. Together with anticipated expansion of its F-35 program, the company's prospects are optimistic. Below I will elaborate why you should hold shares of Lockheed Martin, despite they trade close to all-time high (see Picture 1). For this purpose, I will analyze the company's financial position, and then I will estimate the target price of its shares.Picture 1.Source: Yahoo FinanceFinancial Position AnalysisBased on information from Picture 2, we can observe the following:Picture 2.Sources: Lockheed Martin Q3 2016 Report, MorningstarTrading Comparables AnalysisOn picture 3 you can see multiples comparison of Lockheed Martin with the industry average. Valuation based on both EV/EBITDA and EV/EBIT multiples shows that Lockheed Martin is valued higher than its competitors.Picture 3.Sources: Lockheed Martin Financial Reports, Morningstar, DamodaranDCF AnalysisTaking into account Lockheed Martin's performance in the first 9 months of 2016, I expect the company's revenue to increase by 9.7% this year. I factor in a 7% sales growth in 2017, in accordance with the management's statement in the latest quarterly report. The expected increase is driven by the expansion of F-35 production and higher air and missile defense sales. In my view, Lockheed Martin will maintain mid-single digit growth rates by at least 2020.In 2017, management expects operating margin to lie in a range of 10-10.5%, lower than in 2016. It is explained by two reasons. First, ULA, the investee of Lockheed Martin, is expected to generate lower earnings due to the mix and volume of launch vehicles expected in 2017. Second, the F-35 model will be sold at lower margins than the average for the company.The results of my DCF model are presented in Picture 4. The valuation date is the 1st of December 2016, for that reason I include a 1/12 stub of 2016 financials for the first projection year. All the assumptions that I made in my analysis are footnoted in the excel file.My model results in Lockheed Martin's Enterprise Value of $96.9bn. After accounting for net debt and after-tax pension provisions, I derive the equity value of $77.7bn, that implies intrinsic share price of $265.4. With Lockheed Martin's shares currently trading at $252.8, the stock is undervalued by 5%.Picture 4.Sources: Lockheed Martin Annual Report 2015, Morningstar, Model created by authorYou can see the sensitivity table on Picture 5. Applying different values of the company's WACC and terminal EV/EBITDA multiple, I derive that the intrinsic share price of Lockheed Martin lies in a range of $246-286.Picture 5.Source: Model created by authorRecommendationLockheed Martin has historically been offering attractive returns to investors. The reasons to remain optimistic are the company's stable performance, growth potential resulting from Sikorsky acquisition, anticipated volume increase of its flagship F-35 program and growing dividend payouts.I recommend to HOLD shares of Lockheed Martin and expect their price to be in range of $246-286 in the next twelve months."
4032691,98146,2016-12-26T04:23:00-05:00,A flurry of big money contracts propelled Huntington and General Dynamics past a billion dollars in awards for the fiscal year.President Elect Trump continues to disrupt multi-billion dollar companies with 140 characters or less and is now putting the F-18 up against the F-35.With the holidays things are slowing down but the world is still active as ever.,"Another big week for the defense industry. Compared to last week's numbers several companies on our list got a large bump in fiscal year-to-date awards from the Department of Defense.This week's big winner as far as percentage increase is Huntington Ingalls but United Technologies also ramped up a bit. Lockheed tacked on over $3 billion with nearly $2 billion being awarded on the 22nd alone.Significant ContractsIf you recall the NDAA you'll remember it included a significant amount of money to stop the bleeding as it related to readiness and asset posture in the United States Armed Forces. That bill was signed by President Obama on Friday the 23rd and will directly benefit our focus companies.Huntington Ingalls had a big day on the 19th and got another $1.4 billion modification (N00024-16-C-2431) thrown at it for the construction of the USS Fort Lauderdale, the Navy's next Amphibious Transport Dock ship. The ship will be used to land Marines onto foreign shores via LCAC, AAV, and helicopter or Osprey. The NDAA will funnel more funds into Huntington as the Navy hopes to reach 305 total ships.Lockheed had another outstanding week but the 22nd saw them receive more money in contracts than five of the other companies we look at have this entire fiscal year. The largest contract (W31P4Q-17-C-0006 ) that day was for Patriot missile system enhancements in the amount of $1.45 billion. The contract, part of the Foreign Military Sales program, was for the benefit of Saudi Arabia, Republic of Korea, Qatar, Taiwan and the United Arab Emirates. Lockheed will provide spare parts, missile segment enhancements and ground support equipment.Raytheon was awarded 12 contracts this last week for almost $320 million. The contracts were for everything from F-18 repair parts to Seasparrow missiles to TOW missiles for Middle-Eastern countries. As Boeing and Lockheed get beat up on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) by the President-Elect, Raytheon quietly ""nickels and dimes"" its way to profitability. The company doesn't have huge programs like the F-35 or Air Force One but sells parts to just about everybody with a huge program. Of course the company relies on the success of all the others but they aren't likely to be singled out and attacked. For this reason Raytheon is one of my favorite contractors.Weekly PerformanceFor the most part the sector had another week of outperformance with only BAE Systems and Lockheed underperforming.LMT Price data by YChartsLockheed's week would have been materially different had it not been for a certain Tweet we will discuss below. Since the election things have settled down considerably and now it seems like the sector is a bit nervous.LMT data by YChartsThat chart is pretty interesting and not at all what I expected. Northrop, Lockheed and Raytheon have actually underperformed the S&P 500 since the election. Huntington is up an incredible 25% since November 7th and Boeing has increased by nearly 20%! I've been hearing a lot of ""the defense sector has run ahead of itself,"" while that is mostly true, there is still opportunity for the patient.DOGFIGHT!!!Donald Trump is not known for holding back, especially with his thumbs. The President-Elect is a prolific Tweeter and has utilized the platform expertly through his campaign and afterwards.Mr. Trump has sent shockwaves through many companies but has honed in for the time being on aerospace and defense contractors, notably Boeing and Lockheed. After expressing outrage over the cost of a new Air Force One Boeing shares were zapped but have since recovered. Next came Lockheed with the F-35, having similar effect. Up until recently it just seemed like Lockheed would have to come down on the price and possibly eat into their margins but the F-35 was safe.On December 22nd the President-Elect struck again with a Tweet directed at Boeing and Lockheed on December 22nd, a day after meeting with the CEOs of both companies separately.(Source: Twitter)Air Force Lt. Gen. Chris Bogdan already came out in support of the F-35 on the 19th stating that ""The program is not out of control"" while acknowledging the challenges the program has faced. In a not-so-shocking move, the PEOTUS doesn't seem too concerned about what the top military brass has to say, so we shall have a dogfight between Boeing's F-18 and Lockheeds F-35.The most glowing discrepancy between the two jets is that the F-35 is stealth and the F-18 is not. Right off the bat this is huge, especially considering the threat from our potential adversary's anti-aircraft missiles. It isn't likely the F-18 can be made into a stealth aircraft without somehow putting the weapons bay on the inside of the craft.The F-18 requires a long runway, where the ""B"" variant of the F-35 is capable of short vertical take-off and landing or SVTOL, requiring about 500 feet of runway where the F-18 needs about 1,400 feet. This is important for a few reasons: the F-35 can be landed, refueled and rearmed in expeditionary locations before a proper runway can be constructed and also can maximize the space used on a carrier flightdeck or a smaller ship.The F-18 is a twin-engine craft, which makes it potentially more survivable than the F-35 after a hit. The F-18 can fly on just one engine, where if the F-35 loses its engine it becomes a very expensive bomb falling to earth. We need to consider that to hit the F-35 you need to see it before it sees you, but as radar technology leaps ahead stealth is becoming more difficult to obtain and electronic warfare systems can be outfitted to just about any platform giving the F-18 an edge.The F-18 actually beats the F-35 when it comes to range, capable of flying about 2,070 miles before hitting empty compared to the F-35 at just 1,400 miles. Speed is basically a tie with both flying at about 1,200 miles per hour.As for cost, I don't see the big deal here. The F-18 costs about $98 million each, and the F-35 costs $116 million for the F-35C (Carrier) version for the Navy. The more comparable F-35A version costs $98 million, the same as the F-18. The F-35 numbers are for the low-rate initial production where economies of scale don't come into play, once production ramps up the DoD and Lockheed are anticipating a cost of $85 million per jet. You could likely get the F-18 cost down to below $85 million but you're sacrificing some technology as well.Either way, as investors, we should probably start planning on Lockheed's margins getting squeezed and Boeing enjoying some F-18 resurgence. There is a strong case for the number of F-35s being ordered to be cut down, F-18s to regain some prominence and a fifth-generation unmanned strike aircraft being developed. The Navy has mothballed the X-47B from Northrop but the technology is there and I think we are seeing the last manned strike craft in the F-35. What I doubt we've seen the last of is Mr. Trump and his Twitter feed.In Other NewsThe US allowed the UN Security Council to scold Israel over their settlement policy.The Chinese launched some planes from their only carrier in a display of force.Syria claims they own all of Aleppo now.Turkey is transforming under Erdogan and we should probably start paying attention.Japan is increasing their defense spending for the fifth year in a row as they respond to threats from China and North Korea.On Seeking AlphaFriedrich Research goes into what Trumps Tweets mean for all of us.Dmitry Shmetsov explains why Lockheed is a safe investment.L&F Capital Management covers Taser (TASR) and the growing popularity of their products.Stephen Simpson gives the strong case for CAE (NYSE:CAE), a Canadian based contractor that provides a lot of training solutions.Discount Fountain makes amends with their underestimation of Boeing.The Coming WeekWe have a short and likely boring trading week in the markets coming up so I don't expect a whole lot to happen. I'm anxious to see what may come from Mr. Trumps tweets and any others he sends out, but I'm starting to grow skeptical anything will actually change that will impact us as investors besides short term swings. As the Obama Administration winds down it will be interesting to see what other long-lasting actions they take such as the Israeli wrist-slapping and any positioning in the Middle-East. One thing is for sure, Mr. Trump has his work cut out for him.I appreciate you reading, please leave your thoughts and questions in the comments.

4028866,21151,2016-12-07T12:09:26-05:00,,"After an incredible soap opera (I'm talking about the U.S. Election), Trump won. I'm not here to debate whether it's a good thing or a bad thing, I'm here to look at the fact: The next morning, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) soared over 6%. I'm not part of investors who believe that a President has a huge impact on the stock market. However, this is probably the case for a few single stocks. Since Trump wants patriotism back, what could be better than pushing F-35?The World (unfortunately) Needs WarsOne of the reasons LMT is up over 20% this year and more than 240% over 5 years is mainly because the company has been able to show consistent earnings increase:Source: YChartsIt is quite an interesting feat considering LMT is operating with a Damocles sword over its head for many years with the budget sequestration. 80% of LMT revenues comes from the U.S. government. Since the government is expected to stop spending like crazy on military defense, this is nothing to help Lockheed Martin. However, through ingenuity and strong cost control, it has been able to achieve the undoable with limited revenue growth (until now):Source: YChartsThe recent revenue boost comes from the recent integration of its most impressive acquisition, Sikorsky Aircraft helicopter division, making LMT the largest military helicopter manufacturer in the world. If we ignore the recent spike, we can see that revenue growth has been quite an issue for Lockheed Martin over the past 5 years.Therefore, it is even more important for LMT to have been able to increase its earnings during a difficult period. Now that the dust has settled and management made an important acquisition, everything points toward a strong growth in the upcoming years.A Protected Monopoly?One of the reasons why I like LMT so much is that it barely evolves in a monopoly. It has obviously lots of competitors, but LMT has become THE defense company the U.S. government go to when it comes down for airplane firefighters, for example. Lockheed Martin has done what BlackBerry (BBRY) did a few years ago by controlling the market. Fortunately for it, it is a lot harder to copy a F35 than a smartphone!LMT clients are closely bond to it for several reasons. First, the trust between both the client and the company is quite important in this case. We are talking about military defense, you will not change your supplier in a heartbeat! Second, the switching cost for its clients would be incredibly high. Lockheed Martin benefits from several long-term contracts guaranteeing a steady income flow. Those contracts are not easily broken. Plus, LMT owns a unique experience in military defense products and services.It seems LMT is surfing through the perfect storm. As conflicts are rising around the globe, the Congress accepted Lockheed Martin to seek out international opportunities. This means the company could enlarge its international sales by doing business offshore.But Mike, LMT is trading at its 5-year high!?!Many investors will point out that there are no bargain with Lockheed Martin at this price. At the time of writing this article, LMT wasn't trading at its 52-week high… it was trading at its 260-week high.Source: YChartsUp until recently, the P/E ratio was more than generous for a company that couldn't post revenue growth. I must admit that at 22 P/E ratio, it definitely seems high. However, if investors would have looked at LMT in 2014 (like I did), they would have seen this graph:Source: YChartsHum... That's pretty much the same graph, isn't? So I'm asking you; does it matter if LMT is trading at its 5-year time high?… the answer is NOT AT ALL. LMT's stock price worth what is worth, period. You may want to wait to get a bargain, but I think it will continue to be a safe bet for any dividend portfolio even at this price. I guess we will have to discuss this investment in 5 years to see who is right…. I rather be on the shareholder side at the time of comparison, what about you?"

The company has carried out major restructuring over the last year, with the acquisition of Sikorsky and the sale of its Information Systems and Global Solutions (IS&GS) business to Leidos (NYSE:LDOS). The management has stressed its intention to streamline operations and focus on what it does best. Going forward, we expect Lockheed Martin to deliver strong revenue figures. Here's why:In the recent past, customer support and demand for the F-35 has increased tremendously. Key milestones included the rollout of the first F-35 aircraft for the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. At present, the company is on track to provide Japan with 42 aircraft for its national defense requirements. Furthermore, Norway has stated its interest to participate in a multiyear, multinational block-buy of the F-35. In its 2017 budget, the country has outlined a request to buy 12 F-35 fighters and remains on track to purchase a total of 52 aircraft for its national defense needs. In addition, the F-35 program is expected to see a massive boost in cash under the Trump presidency. At present, the Pentagon has expressed its need for 1,763 air combat fighters. This number could easily hit the 2,000 mark given Trump's statements on increasing the overall size of the air force.Over the past two years, Lockheed Martin has worked to try and improve its sales from international customers. The company had previously aimed to expand its focus and footprint overseas in an attempt to achieve 25% of annual sales from international customers. Due to a change in its portfolio content, resulting from the acquisition of Sikorsky and the divesture of IS&GS, the company seems to be on track to exceed the goal later this year. In general, international work across all segments is expanding. The increased sales of F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, missile defense systems, C-130J cargo planes and tactical missiles abroad are a testament to this fact. The ageing equipment in allied countries, coupled with an expanding level of global security needs, are creating significant demand for the vast portfolio of products the company has to provide.As mentioned previously, Lockheed Martin acquired Sikorsky for about $9 billion last November. The latter is a helicopter manufacturer that supplies military-grade rotor aircraft to all five branches of the U.S. military, along with military services and commercial operators in over 40 nations. At the same time, the management decided to also divest the government IT part of its business to Leidos, so as to focus on its core businesses. By swapping its IT services for helicopter manufacturing, Lockheed was eyeing the long term. It seems likely that the company didn't want to shoulder an IT services division in a market with increasing price competition, especially when the company was preparing to increase its F-35's production.Disclosure: No positions"
4026546,98146,2016-11-28T03:21:26-05:00,Lockheed Martin continues to set the pace for the industry and is half a million dollars away from eleven figures in awards from the DoD.Boeing crossed the billion dollar mark and looks well situated to continue profiting off the F-35 delays.NATO Nations may be spending more on defense and our favorite defense contractors should benefit.,"I hope you all had a great Thanksgiving week if you're based in the US. And for my non-US readers, I also hope you had a great regular week. The US Department of Defense was busy in awarding new and modified contracts despite the shorter work week. I wasn't sure if I would have time to get to this update but here we are, so lets take a look at what happened last week.If you take a look at last week's update, you may notice that Lockheed has a few billion more dollars in their total. In addition to a huge contract modification that Lockheed won, there were several other contracts worth discussing in more detail.Significant ContractsAnybody who follows the defense sector, whether as an investor or as a casual observer, knows the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program and the problems it has endured. Some investors have expressed some concern that the program may be cancelled altogether due to the problems. This week they were given almost 7.2 billion reasons to not worry that much. The DoD issued a modification to a previous contract (N00019-15-C-0003) and with that allocated $7.2 billion to the company. This money is for 90 more F-35 aircraft to be tacked onto the Lot 10 order. Seventy-six of those 90 are for the F-35A variant which the US Air Force will get 44, 16 to non-US DoD participants, and 16 to foreign military customers. Nine of the F-35B will go to the US Marine Corps and three more to non-US DoD participants. Two of the F-35C will go the US Navy and nobody else. This brings the cost of each plane down to $79,881,079.36, though each variant will have different costs of course. Lockheed has struck gold with this program and the contracts will keep rolling in for years. The lion's share of the funds goes straight to Lockheed, but many other contractors benefit as well such as United Tech with their Pratt and Whitney engines that power the jet and BAE Systems and Raytheon with components and avionics.The F-35 program is here to stay but Canada doesn't intend to be tied to it. The government recently announced their intention to procure 18 F-18 jets from Boeing to supplement their existing fleet of jets. Though nothing has been announced yet, this is significant for the mere fact that more and more nations, even the US itself, is having to backtrack to existing platforms to maintain their readiness. The promise of the F-35 replacing just about every existing fighter, attack, and electronic warfare jet still exists, but nations can't just sit and wait for it to be fully ready. This has been a boon for Boeing and even Lockheed itself, as they have seen their jets, the F-18 and F-16 respectively, fall back into favor. As investors we need to factor in the fact that each dollar spent on a ""legacy"" platform is one less that is going to be earmarked for the F-35 theoretically.Speaking of Boeing, the Osprey continues to be a great source of revenue for them and Textron (NYSE:TXT), a company I've written on previously. On the 22nd Bell/Boeing was awarded a contract modification (N00019-09-D-0008 ) which adds up to $267 million for the MV-22 and CV-22 Osprey logistics support. I've spoken about this aircraft in previous updates and articles but it deserves as much coverage as it can get. In the age of Anti-Access/Area Denial tactics and strategy and counter-strategy the Osprey delivers an incredible capability which is being realized more and more. Capable of going out 450 nautical miles and carrying more than other vertical take-off and landing ""VTOL"" aircraft this delivers an incredible advantage. The F-35, which is capable of jamming and interrupting air defenses, has a range just a little further than the Osprey. Together the F-35 and Osprey can penetrate deeper into enemy territory and establish a foothold for US Forces. I expect to see the Osprey continue to be a great source of revenue for both companies; so far this year it has seen $307 million in contracts thrown towards the program.The F-35 isn't the only jet Lockheed makes that saw a contract awarded that was north of $1 billion. The juggernaut was also awarded a $1.2 billion contract (FA8615-17-C-6045) to upgrade F-16 jets for the Republic of Korea. This contract will be carried through Nov 2025 and all the work is going to be done in Fort Worth, Texas, the HQ of Lockheed. Not much more can be said about Lockheed, week after week they continue to execute and earn that high valuation.General Dynamics had a pretty good week on the contract front, being awarded nearly $145 million total. The largest of the week was for $65 million for contractor logistics support and training for the M1A1 Abrams tank and the M88A2 recovery vehicle for Iraq. As many know, Iraq is sort of a mess at this point. While all the attention is focused on Mosul at the moment the country is still the victim of deep religious divisions and infighting. Their military has come quite a long way since the end of the US combat mission and the US still strongly supports their progress. There are quite a few US troops still in the country and that number seems to be increasing year over year.Slow WeekThis last week was another outperforming week for our companies in question. The lone underperformer was BAE Systems who is also struggling with some currency issues related to the strong dollar, weak pound and this little thing called Brexit. The strongest performing company was Huntington Ingalls which is still riding the election to some strong gains.LMT data by YChartsThe Thanksgiving holiday slowed things down some, and even the flow of news was slower. The make-up of Mr. Trumps cabinet is still very much in the air.Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Homeland Security, and Secretary of State remain undecided. Last Saturday Mr. Trump met with retired Marine Corps General James ""Mad Dog"" Mattis and was impressed with him. Mitt Romney appears to still be a serious consideration for Secretary of State; other names such as Rudy Guiliani and Newt Gingrich remain at the top of the list as well. The Secretary of Homeland Security spot has a member of Mr. Trumps transition team being considered, even after a photo-op leaked some important details about the spot. Kris Kobach, the Kansas Secretary of State, was photographed with a position paper clearly visible following a meeting with the President-Elect. The Washington Post provides a breakdown of the visible portions. Inauguration day is fast approaching and with that I'm eager to see what Mr. Trump plans to really do in his first 100 days. The repeal of the sequestration should provide quite a bump to the defense sector and by this time next year we could see some meaningful increases in the top and bottom line of many defense contractors. This will be necessary for the sector to grow into their currently stretched valuations.NATO and Defense SpendingA possible international bump to defense spending could be the result of a Trump presidency, and for investors this is great news.Mr. Trump, often brash and abrasive, has been critical of NATO allies and their contributions to the shared defense. At first glance this may appear foolish and insulting to our allies but if we dig deeper it makes some sense.Under the NATO agreement member countries must spend 2% of their GDP on defense and 20% of that going to equipment. Of the 28 members, only the US, the UK, Greece, Estonia and Poland spend the required amount. The US spends the most, at 3.6% of their GDP. The President-Elect is merely requesting the remaining nations uphold their end of the bargain as far as spending. As Russia flexes their muscle in the region this doesn't feel like an outlandish request and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg agrees.(Source: Twitter (NYSE:TWTR))I don't anticipate every participating country will instantly increase their spending to the required threshold, there are some conflicting requirements from the European Union getting in the way, but with the Secretary-General making statements we can expect gradual increases.What this could mean for our investments is anybody's guess, but a rising tide lifts all boats and it would be hard to imagine US based contractors wouldn't somehow benefit. Foreign based companies such as BAE Systems, Elbit Systems (NASDAQ:ESLT), Thales (OTC:THLEY), Leonardo-Finmeccanica (OTCPK:FINMY), Babcock International Group (OTC:BCKIY), and Rolls-Royce (OTCPK:RYCEY) are some potential foreign beneficiaries.In Other NewsThe US Army stood up a new group and is hyper-focused on the threat of Russian cyber shenanigans.The Marine Corps is showing the world what the F-35 can do and why the plane deserves respect.The F-35 can do some incredible stuff, like help an Aegis equipped missile destroyer shoot down an incoming cruise missile with a Raytheon made SM-6 missile. This is remarkable.Iran cozies up to Russia and may, or may not, buy some Russian Sukhoi SU-30 jets.On Seeking AlphaChristopher Magas gives us a deeper dive into Leidos Holding (NYSE:LDOS) which has jumped onto my radar.Casey Hoerth makes a strong case for United Tech under Mr. Trumps administration.David Pinsen offers some much needed skepticism on the recent run Lockheed has been on.Larry Wishnick jumps into Raytheon and gives the bullish case for the well diversified contractor.Accendo Markets covers some foreign contractors who could benefit after TPP.The Coming WeekI expect a little more volatility this week than last for the overall market and this includes our defense sector. Mr. Trump should make some more decisions on his cabinet and we may know more of what we are dealing with. Of course, contracts will keep rolling in, I'll be looking for possible announcements on the Air Force trainer program and also if Boeing can lock down some sales to Qatar and Kuwait for the F-18 and F-15.I appreciate you reading, please leave your thoughts and questions in the comments.

4029937,98146,2016-12-12T11:42:31-05:00,Big moves on the contract front propelled several of our companies over the $1 billion mark and contracts seem to have picked up the pace.The sector was mostly down this week with only one company beating the S&P 500.President-elect Trump sent shivers through the defense sector after threatening to cancel the $4 billion order for a new Air Force One jet.,"Another exciting week in the defense sector but not all the excitement was the desired variety. Before we get started, let's take a look at where our focus companies sit in total Fiscal Year 2017 Department of Defense contract awards. For those who may be new to the series, I compile a spreadsheet with the contracts for the companies below as they are posted to the DoD Contracts website. Last week's totals can be found here.Significant ContractsLeidos (NYSE:LDOS), a company we have discussed in previous updates here and here, won a $350 million contract (FA8730-17-F-0053) to provide Joint Mission Planning System (also read this) engineering and integration services to Australia, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Egypt, France, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Jordan, Korea, Morocco, NATO, the Netherlands, Norway, Oman, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and United Kingdom. The size and time frame out to 2027 of this award is good news for the company, and the expansion to plenty of foreign nations is encouraging.Raytheon won a $102 million contract (N00383-17-D-A001) to provide 10 weapon replaceable assemblies for the AN/ALR-67""V""3 on all versions of the F/A-18 aircraft for the Navy. The system detects radar stations and alerts the pilot of the potential threat. The contract stretches for four years and can end up being for $128 million if options are exercised by the government. The United States and other foreign governments have been spending a considerable amount of money on upgrading and maintaining their fleets of aircraft as they await the F-35. This could be interpreted as another threat to the F-35 program, but I'm still maintaining my opinion that we (the US) are too far into the program to consider backing out; my concerns lie with other nations such as Canada (also read this).Last Week At A GlanceThis last week only Boeing was able to beat the S&P 500, everyone else lagged and several of our companies had negative performances (Please excuse the different chart, YCharts wasn't embedding when I wrote this).(Source: StockCharts)A down week shouldn't come as a surprise, defense stocks have been doing well since the election and you can expect people to want to take some profits from that. Lockheed and Northrop led the charge down thanks to one big day where they gave back some gains but for how much they've gone up we really can't complain.Shots Across the Bow of the Littoral Combat ShipPresident-elect Trump is well known for his use of Twitter, and this last week he sent a shot across the bow of Boeing.(Source: Twitter)That tweet sent shares of Boeing down over 1% in pre-market trading on the 6th, but they quickly recovered and Mr. Trump and Boeing has said they will work together to figure it out. Followers of the defense and aerospace industry quickly understood what this could really mean for the likes of Boeing which operate on large contracts that make for easy criticism.If Mr. Trump revisits current contracts, our favorite firms could see their margins get squeezed or major sources of revenue killed off entirely. Already controversial programs such as the F-35 will most certainly get pressured, but that isn't the only product from Lockheed that I am concerned about.The Littoral Combat Ship, LCS for short, has been the subject of some intense criticism from all angles. Years of cost overruns, missed deadlines, breakdowns and even the US Navy being sued has constantly thrust the LCS into the spotlight and the program has made the F-35 look like a piece of cake. December 8th, the House Oversight and Investigations subcommittee had a spirited debate about the LCS and how it should be acquired, if at all.Currently, Lockheed has 13 of the ships on its books as either launched or awarded and the Navy has 26 sailing or spoken for. Each ship costs about $360 million to build and is being acquired in ""bulk"" where the government agrees to buy a set number of ships up front essentially guaranteeing the program continues. There is a growing movement to buy each ship individually, which would enable the government to negotiate the price of each ship one by one or just drop the program altogether and move on.There are pros and cons to the current acquisition strategy and the proposed changes. Buying ships in bulk allows Lockheed and its partners to achieve the benefits of scale such as buying raw materials in greater quantities at lower costs and keeping trained employees on the job. The problem with buying the ships in bulk is that you could buy 12 ships without knowing if they'll actually work and there isn't much you can do if problems arise, and problems do arise.In the last 12 months, the ships have suffered eight significant problems ranging from seawater causing main engine failure to running into the walls of the Panama Canal. The entire LCS fleet was shut down in July and August as well to allow an engineering standdown to try to address some of the issues. When you have to ""ground"" an entire fleet of brand new ships, eyebrows will be raised.There is little doubt that the Navy needs the ships to free up some of the larger ships and perform the more menial tasks such as sweeping for mines and following submarines around the world. But so far they have just been an asset drain and the perception is that they create more problems than they solve. With Mr. Trump attacking $4 billion contracts, I wouldn't be surprised to see the LCS and its $9 billion price tag get some Tweets thrown at it.In Other NewsGeneral Neller, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, wants warrior geeks to help the Corps keep its edge on the battlefield.As Syria and its Russian allies focus on Aleppo the Islamic State snatched Palmyra back from government forces.Boeing is apparently selling $16.6 billion worth of commercial jets to Iran.The US says 2,000 ISIS fighter have died so far in the battle for Mosul. Add a few zeros and I'll be happy.The president-elect is pushing China's buttons.On Seeking AlphaDmitry Shvetsov says Boeing is overvalued.Dhierin Bechai dives into the Air Force One controversy.The Dividend Guy breaks down Lockheed and why it's a good pick for some safety.The Coming WeekWith the market hitting all-time highs all the time and Mr. Trump's inauguration fast approaching, the defense sector is going to be fun to watch. I still feel that the defense sector has gotten ahead of itself and the down week was a good thing. I don't think the sector will see any significant pullback, but without some strong earnings reports or huge contracts, I don't see much more room for significant price appreciation either. The market has extended quite a bit of rope to these companies, let's hope they don't hang themselves with it.I appreciate you reading, please leave your thoughts and questions in the comments.

4023881,63883,2016-11-16T08:20:07-05:00,,"This post was written by Bob Ciura on November 15, 2016, for Sure DividendLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) stock has a lot to offer investors. It has a 3% dividend yield, which is above-average compared with the S&P 500. In addition, it is a high dividend growth stock. Earlier this year, Lockheed lifted its dividend by 10%. And, it has a strong business model and generates a lot of free cash flow.Lockheed is a Dividend Achiever. It has raised its dividend for 14 years in a row. You can see a list of all 273 Dividend Achievers here. What's more, each of those dividend increases was at least a 10% hike, or greater. Read on to see why Lockheed Martin stock could help bullet-proof your portfolio.Business OverviewLockheed is a global defense company. It is a giant in the defense industry, with an $81 billion market capitalization and $46 billion of annual revenue.It operates in five business segments:Aeronautics includes the manufacture of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft. The aeronautics segment is Lockheed's largest, for a very simple reason. It houses the F-35 program, Lockheed's flagship business. The F-35 program itself makes up 20% of Lockheed's total revenue.The IS & GS segment provides advanced technology systems for civil, defense, intelligence and other government functions. The IS & GS business also helps customers gather and analyze data.The MFC segment provides air and missile defense systems, primarily for the U.S. army but also for other nations. It houses the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) air and missile defense programs.MST designs and manufactures a variety of military and civil helicopters. It also designs ship and submarine mission and combat systems for aircraft, radar systems, and cybersecurity solutions.Lastly, the Space Systems business is engaged in R&D and engineering of satellites, missile systems, and space transportation systems.These five businesses each are highly profitable and generate tremendous cash flow for the company. For example, Lockheed generated $3.8 billion of free cash flow over the first three quarters of 2016.Source: Third-Quarter Earnings Report, page 8Growth ProspectsLockheed has excellent growth prospects. First, it has a strong competitive advantage. Lockheed has proven to be on the precipice of innovation in the global defense industry. It has increased R&D spending for four years in a row.Last year, Lockheed invested $839 million in R&D. This investment has created a sustainable edge over the competition. Another growth catalyst for Lockheed is the simple reality that geopolitical risk is a constant across many parts of the world. As a reflection of this reality, global defense budgets continue to rise. This creates a very steady demand for the defense industry.From 2006-2015, Lockheed increased earnings per share by 8% compounded annually. Lockheed's future growth will be supplemented by its massive project backlog. At the beginning of 2016, Lockheed had $99.6 billion project backlog, which increased 23% over the last five years.In fact, last year Lockheed set a company record for cash flow from operations and order backlog.The company is off to a great start this year. Sales and operating profit rose 15% and 14%, respectively, last quarter.Source: Third-Quarter Earnings Report, page 4A key component of Lockheed's future growth will be through new geographic markets. Last year, Lockheed generated 79% of its annual revenue from the U.S.Lockheed management states it will lower its reliance on the U.S. to 75% of annual revenue going forward. To do this, it is securing significant contracts overseas. For example, last year Lockheed generated a $750 million contract to train Australian Defense Force pilots.The other way Lockheed will expand its presence in the international markets is through acquisitions. Lockheed acquired the Sikorsky business from United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) for $9 billion. Nearly half of Sikorsky's revenue comes from outside the U.S.Dividends and BuybacksLockheed has a very shareholder-friendly management team, which is committed to returning cash to shareholders.Lockheed has such a strong dividend because the company generates a ton of cash. In 2015, Lockheed's operating cash flow of $5.1 billion far exceeded its $939 million of capital expenditures. Free cash flow came to $4.1 billion for 2015.With such strong free cash flow, Lockheed raised its dividend by 10% this year and also approved a $2 billion addition to its share repurchase authorization.Source: Third-Quarter Earnings Report, page 9As you can see, Lockheed has significantly reduced its share count over an extended period.Since it generates billions of dollars each year in free cash flow, it has plenty of room left to continue increasing its dividend. The current $7.28 per share dividend payout represents 60% of Lockheed's expected 2016 earnings per share.A 60% dividend payout ratio is modest and sustainable over the long term.Future Expected ReturnsLockheed Martin's stock is valued very close to its historical average. Since 2000, it has traded for an average price-to-earnings ratio of 14.5. The stock currently trades for a price-to-earnings ratio of 15.Since Lockheed's stock appears to be fairly valued, share repurchases and dividends will be the major drivers of shareholder value creation moving forward.By buying back its own stock, Lockheed helps boost future earnings growth. Fewer shares outstanding means each remaining share receives a greater portion of earnings per share.Going forward, returns will be reliant on earnings per share growth and dividends. Investors can expect earnings per share growth to be comprised of:Cumulatively, this would result in 7%-9% annualized returns. In addition, shareholders will receive Lockheed's 3% current dividend yield. As a result, investors can reasonably expect 10%-12% total returns each year.Final ThoughtsLockheed Martin has virtually everything an income investor would want. The stock offers a 3% dividend yield, which is well ahead of the 2% average yield in the S&P 500. Furthermore, Lockheed stock offers high dividend growth rates from year to year, often in the double digits.Lastly, it has a well-defined plan for future growth. This will be done primarily through growth in new markets, via acquisitions. As a result, Lockheed is a highly attractive Dividend Achiever."
4027495,50452,2016-12-01T05:39:14-05:00,"Lockheed Martin operates in the lucrative, wide moat space of government spending.
        Investors have ridden this defense contractor to market beating returns for two decades.
        Lockheed Martin is busy, and has the ammunition to continue its current pace.
        However, shares have flown much higher in recent times - are they a buy today?","As an investor with a long term approach, I tend to shy away from companies that can be threatened by innovation. A company that provides a product or service born from innovation, must continually reinvent itself to keep up with the very driving force that conceived it. Some companies succeed such as Microsoft (NYSE: MSFT) with its continued push into cloud based services. Other companies are slower to adapt, such as IBM (NYSE: IBM) whose slow reaction to changing markets, has left it scrambling to reinvent itself as its legacy businesses deteriorate. Because of the premium value society places on ""cutting edge"" technology, succeeding to reinvent can prove very lucrative for companies that can do it.The world's largest consumer of ever-improving technology is the United States government, which is serviced by a trio of defense contractors. The largest of which is Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), followed by Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC), and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA). The fabulous aspect of this market, is that government defense is perpetually spending in order to keep defenses on the cutting edge against new threats that are constantly emerging. While competition is fierce between the three, the threat from outsiders joining the mix is quite low. The up front capital investments these projects demand, combined with the relationships these contractors have established over time with the defense sector, make it very tough for an outsider to jump into the mix.The United States currently spends a little more than half of its entire discretionary budget on the military. This figure has continually risen over time.This upward trend continues to feed Lockheed Martin. Of its roughly $50B in annual sales, about 60% comes from the US Department of Defense, another 20% comes from other US departments such as Civil, Intelligence, and NASA. The balance is via international markets.This growing pie of potential revenues, enables Lockheed Martin to continually grow revenues, and earnings per share. This has also allowed Lockheed Martin to grow its dividend at 19% rate over 10 years, while maintaining its payout ratio.What does this sustained increase in earnings equate to? Lockheed Martin averaging robust shareholder returns of 13% over the past two decades, while the market has followed at between 8-9%. The future is set up well for these trends to continue. Lockheed's order backlog ended last year at just under $100B (a record high).It continues to expand international presence with recent orders from Israel, South Korea, Canada, and Denmark among others. Within the next few years, Lockheed should expand its international exposure to 30% of sales according to management.Lockheed Martin continues to progress through testing and production ramp up of the newest iteration of its massive F-35 fighter jet program, with the F-35 Lightning II. By the year 2035, the total units purchased by the United States and allies should total more than 3,000 units. Throughout the decade, the project has been hit with various mechanical issues that have led to higher than anticipated production costs, and delays. However, in early August the United States Air Force declared the F-35 ""ready for war"". With this endorsement, the F-35 program should be moving forward more smoothly. This program will be the company's largest growth opportunity over the next five years. About 50% of units will be sold outside of the United States, helping Lockheed reach that 30% goal of international exposure.In addition to the F-35 program, Lockheed operates five business segments in total:While the Aeronautics division will carry the day due to the F-35 program, the other segments will see continued work as management is confident of bi-partisan support for increased government spending. Although currently reliant on the US Govt., the company's five segments ensure that Lockheed Martin is pretty diversified throughout many departments. As they continue to expand internationally, this will enhance their efforts to spread revenues out further. In addition to safety, this diversification will present growth opportunity as the rest of the world constantly chases the United States' technology curve.Shares have been on a run over the past few years, as the share price has essentially doubled. Does this make shares expensive? Well it depends where you side.On one hand, for a number of years after the financial crisis, shares traded between 9-12X earnings because a sequester scare threatened military spending which would have decimated Lockheed's business. Shares proceeded to recover over the past couple of years, bringing the P/E up to about 19X earnings. Lockheed Martin was swept up in the ongoing ""Trump Rally"" which has further expanded its earnings multiple. The share price has shot up to the $265 neighborhood since the election, a quick 10% gain for a current P/E of almost 22X earnings.On the other hand, Lockheed Martin is forecasting a nice year for 2017, with a planned revenue uptick of 7%. Analysts are bullish as well, with Wells Fargo eying earnings of $20 per share, in the year 2020 (a forward P/E of 13X). To accomplish this, Lockheed would be compounding earnings at 20% over the next four years. For this type of growth, the current stock price isn't a bad shake.I fall somewhat in between. I think 20% earnings growth is very ambitious. I see growth more in the 10-12% range. I think a good price based on where I see earnings growth, would be about 17X earnings. If Lockheed makes between $13-$14 per share in 2017, a target point would be $220-$238.The markets are at all time highs right now, built up upon the euphoria of political catalysts that have not yet materialized. Things in Washington are never smooth sailing, so I expect we will see some political volatility - and a market correction at some point after Mr. Trump is sworn in, and the time comes to walk the walk. Here's hoping for a chance to buy into this defense stalwart.If you liked this article, please find my profile icon at the top of this page, and hit the ""Follow"" button.

4025575,23998,2016-11-22T14:14:01-05:00,"Some analysts may be overoptimistic about the prospects for Lockheed Martin and other defense stocks under President Donald Trump.The history of populism, Trump's statements during his campaign, and his meeting Monday with Tulsi Gabbard suggest he may not be as hawkish as some expect.With that, and Lockheed Martin's recent run-up, in mind, we present two ways of adding downside protection to it.","The Peace Of TrumphaliaTwo days after the election, John Persinos at The Street wrote that shares of Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) had jumped as...Persinos was also bullish on Raytheon (NYSE:RTN), adding that:There were plenty of reasons to doubt that claim at the time, starting with the recollection that Trump defeated Jeb Bush last February by arguing that the Iraq War had been a disaster. President-Elect Trump's meeting with Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (pictured above) on Monday is another reason to doubt it. Gabbard has been a vocal opponent of regime change in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.Some of the confusion here may stem from intimations from scholars such as Billy Joe Armstrong of Green Day that Trump is a fascist; militarism is, of course, closely associated with fascism. But Stanford (and former Harvard) historian Niall Ferguson has argued, fairly convincingly, that Trump more closely resembles a populist than a fascist, and that populists tend not to be militarists. This 20-minute presentation Ferguson gave at Alphabet in September is worth watching for an elaboration on that. Ferguson points out that it wasn't populists but the progressives who came later who led the U.S. into World War I.Consistent with that, in Foreign Policy last week, Harvard professor Stephen M. Walt speculated that Trump might pursue a non-interventionist foreign policy (""Could There Be a Peace of Trumphalia?""). As Walt notes there, this is based on an old idea (his title is a play on the Peace of Westphalia):None of the above is meant to suggest that Lockheed Martin or Raytheon are bad investments. The Portfolio Armor website is currently somewhat bullish on both stocks, estimating potential returns of about 9.5% for LMT and 10.5% for RTN over the next six months (for an explanation of how our site calculates potential returns, see the section titled ""Calculating A Potential Return For Amazon"" in this article). It's meant to suggest that expecting the Trump administration to be the third term of George W. Bush is a) likely to be wrong, and b) not a good reason to own either stock.With LMT up more than 10% since the election as of Monday's close, it's possible some investors have been buying it for the wrong reason. With that in mind, we'll look at a couple of ways of adding downside protection to it below.Downside Protection For Lockheed MartinIf you'd like a refresher on hedging terms first, please see the section titled ""Refresher On Hedging Terms"" in this previous article of ours, Locking In Gold Gains.Hedging LMT With Optimal PutsWe'll use Portfolio Armor's iOS app to find optimal puts and an optimal collar to hedge LMT, but you can find them yourself instead by using the process we outlined in this article if you're willing to do the math. Either way, you'll need to decide the maximum decline you are willing to risk (this field is labeled ""Threshold"" on the app). This will vary depending on your risk tolerance. For the purpose of the examples below, we've used a threshold of 17%. If you are more risk averse, you could use a smaller threshold. And if you are less risk averse, you could use a larger one. All else equal, though, the higher the threshold, the cheaper it will be to hedge.Here are the optimal puts as of Monday's close to hedge 500 shares of LMT against a greater-than-17% drop by mid-June.As you can see at the bottom of the screen capture above, the cost of this protection was $3,750, or 2.85% of position value. A few points about this hedge:Hedging LMT With An Optimal CollarJust as when scanning for optimal puts, you decide the maximum drawdown you're willing to risk (your ""threshold""). But when scanning for an optimal collar, you also need to determine your ""cap,"" which refers to the maximum upside you are willing to limit yourself to if the underlying security appreciates significantly. You don't think the security is going to do better than that anyway, so you're willing to sell someone else the right to call it away if it does better than that.The potential return between now and mid-June implied by the consensus 12-month Wall Street price target for Lockheed Martin (via Nasdaq, below) is about 3.5%.That's a lot lower than the potential return estimate from PortfolioArmor that we mentioned above of about 9.5%. We ended up using 8% as a cap here as it eliminated the positive hedging cost.This was the optimal collar, as of Monday's close, to hedge 500 shares of LMT against a >17% drop by mid-June while not capping an investor's upside at less than 8% by then.As you can see in the first part of the collar above, the cost of the put leg was $2,350, or 1.78% of position value. But as you can see in the second part of the collar below, the income generated from the call leg was $2,600, or 1.97% of position value.So the net cost of this collar was negative, meaning an investor opening it would have collected an amount equal to $250, or 0.19% of position value. A couple of notes about this hedge:"
4025901,87566,2016-11-23T10:56:23-05:00,"Regional tensions likely to rise in wake of Trump TPP decision.Arms manufacturers expected to see a strong 2017.Here we run the rule over four stocks, three Japanese, and one International.","Of late, it seems impossible to separate financial news from U.S. political news. Today is no exception. Trump has confirmed that he is planning to stay the course - full steam ahead - and pull out of the long negotiated TPP (The Trans-Pacific Partnership). Whilst such a decision might raise eyebrows, it certainly puts geopolitical questions back on the table. The United States' potential pivot back home may mean that there is scope for significant returns from an investment in the international defense market, both in terms of the dominant global companies, and regional players. This article will run the rule over four companies: Lockheed (NYSE:LMT), Mitsubishi Heavy (OTCPK:MHVYF), Kawasaki Heavy (OTCPK:KWHIF), and Tamagawa Trading Company (6838:JP).All Considered Stocks. 1 Year Share Price. Source: Bloomberg. As CNBC's Everett Rosenfeld notes 'extensive analysis on the terms of the deal [TPP] had concluded that […] [i]ts economic benefits would likely be meager, [however] proponents of the deal had insisted it was a key component of the American geopolitical ""pivot"" toward the Asia-Pacific region.' The failure of the deal is likely to put several questions back on the table, not least security, with China an ever-present fear in the minds of the Defense Ministers of South-East Asian countries.Matthew Pennington, AP. Source: Japan Today.With it not long since Japan allowed its defense sector to contemplate significant international exports, TPP or not, Japanese defense is a growing sector. Parts producers such as Tamagawa holdings, and larger companies such as Mitsubishi Heavy may be interesting long-term investments. In the long and medium-term alike, the Japanese military industrial complex is likely to grow. Whilst it is true that international sales are relatively low, this is likely to change over the years. Tentative interest in products, such as reconnaissance planes on the part of New Zealand and Britain, suggests arms-importers may be willing to change suppliers should they be made to see the benefits in doing so. Another Japanese arms company, Shinmaywa Industries has, for instance, seen India purchase a dozen of its US-2i amphibious planes. This is the first modern arms deal between Japan and India, and both countries expect more deals to happen in the future.Shinmaywa 1 year share price. Source: Google FinanceWith Japan nervous about growing Chinese power, and other South-East Asian countries similarly worried about the post-Trump security situation, arms exports to the region can be expected to surge over the course of the President-elect's term. It is a reasonable bet, with the final confirmation of Trump's canceling of TPP to come, that the potential for an increasing U.S. isolationism will be seen as boosting the position of Asian national defense hawks. Ethical considerations notwithstanding, this is rather good news for the defense industry.The Four Companies:Tamagawa - 1 Year Share Price. Source: Bloomberg Tamagawa Trading Company has had a steady, if not spectacular year, with its share price rising from 107 yen to 118, with highs of 139. The yearly return to date on holdings stands at 8.86%. Dividends are low at .85%, but should the need for military industrial components rise, this company is in line to benefit. It produces gyres, gears, and materials from difficult to machine materials like titanium, and processes carbon fibre materials often used in high-end manufacture. It's market cap is around 5bn Japanese yen, and its revenue has increased year on year over the last five years. Earnings for 2016 are however somewhat down, as costs rose significantly. In the event of an increase in regional tensions, Tamagawa stands to benefit.Tamagawa - Trading Information. Source: FT Mitsubishi Heavy are one of the big-two of the Japanese defense sector, and they have had a difficult year. The potential for a boost in their earnings however, and in their share-price value, following Trumps final election, remains as true for this company as it does for the Japanese arms sector in general. Further to this, the company's increasing exposure to the international market, with ever-deepening ties with France, through Areva, and its desire to grow its export business, sees it as a potential winner, should tensions trump reason.Mitsubishi Heavy Financials - Source: FT The company's share price has fallen from $5.22 to $4.29, and the yearly return is around -17%. This suggests that there is some value in the company, in the event of a rise in sales. Dividends are at a solid 2.6%, and its market cap is around $14bn.Mitsubishi Heavy - 1 Year Share Price. Source: Bloomberg. Kawasaki Heavy is the other member of Japan's ""big two"", and like Mitsubishi Heavy, it has had a trickier 2016 than it did 2015. As it is across the board in the Japanese arms industry, rising costs have been the prime driver in declining incomes, despite often increasing revenues.Kawasaki Heavy - 1 Year Share Price. Source: Bloomberg Like Mitsubishi Heavy, Kawasaki Heavy's year on year share-prices have declined, so 2017 may see a rally in the company's valuation. The company offers dividends of 1.96% and its market cap is just under $5bn. Valued presently at only $2.95 a share, as against last year's valuation of $4, the company's 5 year high of $5.33 suggests, if it can boost its international sales in the wake of increasing security concerns, that the company's share price valuation has some room to grow.Kawasaki Heavy Financials - Source: FT. Lockheed need no introduction to anyone, and are mentioned here only as a safe bet to increase your exposure to the security industry, should you see issues such as TPP, the Trump factor, rising tensions on Eastern European borders, and other geopolitical concerns as a potential motivator for a 2017 bull market in arms manufacturing. If you do, Lockheed, and of course other major companies such as BAE Systems (OTCPK:BAESY), presents a safe-bet. Additionally, regardless of circumstance, LMT is a great stock to keep in your portfolio.Lockheed - 1 Year Share Price. Source: Bloomberg Shares in the company have to date this year risen by over 20% in value, the company's market cap is $77bn, and its financials are strong. It has revenues of $46bn, and an income of $3.6bn. Lockheed has impressively cut its debt to total capital ratio from 265.2% to 85.4%, and dividends are a healthy 2.73%, making it a solid long-term investment.Lockheed Financials. Source: FT. Ultimately, should you decide that now is the time to increase your holdings in the defense industry, while you might wish you'd taken a position some months earlier, there remain some interesting regional stocks worth further investigation. As a result of a decreasing internationalism, regional markets, particularly in more volatile regions, may inflate the global arms market in 2017. The next 12 months ought to provide plenty of opportunities to profit for those with a trading interest in the sector.(Oisin Breen, Technical Analyst at Accendo Markets)Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4017449,98146,2016-11-01T07:24:45-04:00,"The start of the fiscal year has been slow as it normally is but several large contracts are finding their way to many of the big contractors.
        DARPA and Raytheon are teaming up to make some fast cruise missiles faster.
        Lockheed is far and away the winner with over $1.8 billion in contracts awarded in the 31 days of October thanks to their fighter jet programs.","*Please read my Instablog Introduction on this series of articles right here*The 2017 Fiscal Year began on October 1st and the world's largest defense contractors are busy securing contracts. Contracts got off to a slow start for the year but are now starting to pick up steam and some of the largest and most relevant contractors are getting their piece of the pie. Here is the down and dirty totals for the ones I'm currently tracking:Lockheed is the winner by a large margin but more on them later.Most surprising from this group is BAE Systems. They're a UK based defense contractor that do a lot of work outside the US as well. The number above, just over $700 million, is only what they've won from the US Department of Defense. Perusing the press releases on their website it is clear they do a good amount of business elsewhere in the world especially in NATO countries. At a price to earnings ratio of around 15 they're a little more attractively priced than some of their American counterparts, mostly thanks to the Brexit. Looking at what they offer I can't help but consider them the British Lockeed Martin, and they even have a piece of the F-35 action.(Source: BAE Infographic)Some Notable ContractsThere have been some very large contracts awarded so far this FY. An early one awarded on October 7th to General Dynamics was in the amount of $508 million. This contract (W56HZV-17-D-B020 ) is to upgrade 215 Stryker Combat Vehicles. These upgrades will be mostly to hulls of the vehicle going from flat-bottom to a V-Hull design to better protect occupants against IED blasts. The wording of the actual contract sounds like a Service Life Extension Program, or ""SLEP"" style contract meant to expand the service life of an asset. With purse strings a little tighter this is a pretty economical choice for the US Government and gives us a better equipped Army across a bevy of different scenarios.Circling back to BAE Systems, they were awarded a $618 million contract (N00019017-D-5517) on October 7th to provide a whole mess of Advanced Precision Kill Weapons Systems to a whole mess of countries. The APKWS is a pretty awesome system that turns a standard 2.75 inch dumb rocket into a smart tube of laser-guided destruction. The countries who will continue to enjoy these are the US, Iraq, Lebanon, Netherlands, Jordan and Australia.The last huge contract (N00019-14-C-0002) I want to go over is one in the amount of $743 million and was awarded to Lockheed Martin on October 17th for none other than the F-35. If you follow Lockheed you no doubt have some idea what the F-35 is. Up to this point that plane has been an incredibly profitable headache, and this contract makes it even more profitable. This is the seventh modification of this contract and so far it has brought Lockheed $7.1 billion dollars since 2014.Some Tell-TalesThere were several interesting contracts during the month that can give some clues as to the direction the DoD and military branches are headed. The old saying of ""follow the money"" rings true here.Boeing appears to be making good on their previously mentioned shift out of fighter jet production into fighter jet parts production to keep the Boeing fighter jets fighting. The largest contract they were awarded for the month (SPRPA1-14-D-002U ) was for nearly $200 million in F/A-18 spare parts.Lockheed had three modifications to a contract (FA8611-08-C-2897) concerning F-22 sustainment for over $560 million. My best guess is that with the F-35 considerably delayed the DoD is falling back the F-22 which is proven. The rise of Chinese aggression in the South China Sea and Russian aggression in Syria is brining a focus back to conventional weapons. The plane game is mighty profitable for Lockheed.Raytheon was awarded an interesting $175 million contract (HR0011-17-C-0025) for something called the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept. According to DARPA this weapon concept will allow air-launched cruise missiles to more efficiently and effectively operate at Mach 5-plus speeds. This could do wonders for our offensive penetration capabilities, especially as potential adversaries ramp up their anti-access/area-denial defensive capabilities.Elsewhere In DefenseRussia is sending additional Pantsir air-defense systems to Syria. A no-fly zone seems to be more and more necessary as civilian casualties mount from the air. I expect the US to counter this move with additional troops deployed in NATO states as well as increased capabilities in and around Syria.Turkey is lobbying hard for a Raqqa campaign to begin after Mosul is taken back. Raqqa is the ISIS stronghold inside Syria and a huge thorn in the side of Turkey. Turkey has been a tenuous ally in the area and Raqqa will be no small feat.Turkey also agreed to purchase additional F-35 jets they expect to receive in 2018. This brings the total agreed to 116. The F-35 continues to gain popularity abroad as nations worry they'll be left with inferior capabilities.ConclusionThe defense contractors highlighted above had a pretty good month all things considered.LMT data by YChartsOnly BAE and General Dynamics were outperformed by the S&P 500. Lockheed won the month with an 8.75% gain in share price. I expect them to continue doing well in the coming months.Please stay tuned for the next installment in this ongoing series.

4012199,89346,2016-10-14T14:03:54-04:00,"Lockheed Martin might be at its fair market value right now.Due to market sentiment due to the stock's recent drop it might drop into the $220-$230 per share range, but it will eventually rebound back into the $230s.Ultimately, LMT is a long-term endeavor even though short-term opportunities pop up every now and then.","I believe there's a great deal of injustice going on with Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) stock. It especially doesn't bode well for those who moved into LMT earlier this year with hopes of profiting off of some capital gains. But at the same time, this latest downward trend has revealed an entry position in LMT for those considering the defense contractor's stock as long-term prospective.It all starts with the company's ability to generate revenues. Now without dwelling too deep into the numerous lucrative revenue streams Lockheed Martin has at its disposal, and which numerous authors and analysts have covered, I can reassure you they are more than enough to keep its gears running for decades. It should be noted that historically the company has performed well during times of war and rising hostile sentiments across the world, and uncertain geopolitical conditions prevailing across the world today are only going to benefit a company such as Lockheed Martin even more.A steady revenue stream is crucial for maintaining a healthy free cash flow, which in turn increases a company's ability to return value to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase programs. And through its free cash flow position, Lockheed Martin has been very successful in keeping investors happy. For more than a decade the Bethesda, Maryland-based company has raised dividends by more than 10% per annum, even increasing dividends this year to $1.82 per share for the fourth quarter up from $1.65 per share in the previous quarter.(Source: YChart)A more detailed analysis of the company's financials also reveals that free cash flows have consistently been at ample levels to continue financing this dividend hike each year. With future prospects from various lucrative program, such as the F-35, we should see Lockheed Martin easily maintain, if not improve, its free cash flows. This in turn shows that the company can easily maintain its dividend-increasing capabilities in the next year, and most likely even in the many years to come.However, right now, many investors will look at the last few months and argue against investing in a company which has lost more than 10% of its value in the last two months. I have to counter this argument by letting these investors know that this is precisely the right reason why they should be investing in LMT all along. After careful deliberation and from the information I understand, I believe the company stock is currently trading at its fair market value of approximately $232 per share. Now that doesn't mean the stock might not take a dip in the coming days, especially considering that a quarterly report release is on the horizon, but even if it does go below $230, I believe it will rebound back to above $230.The recent drop has disheartened many investors and that is precisely why the stock might actually dip below the $230 mark. If it does dip below $230 then you might stand a wonderful chance of making some quick gains once the earnings are released later this month on 25th October. What guarantee do you have that the stock might actually rise following the quarterly report release? Well, take a look at this graph.(Source: TradingView.com)In the past four quarters Lockheed Martin has surpassed consensus earnings estimates and LMT climbed in the days that followed. I believe that the company's earnings trend will continue just like its past record, especially considering how little its business structure has changed during this whole time.(Source: YChart)A gander at the 50 and 200-day moving averages indicates that the stock is still in bullish territory and in the coming days will stabilize or rise, floating within the $230-240 per share margin. However, my sincere advice is to consider LMT as a long-term investment. Lockheed Martin stock is tailor-made for those investors who want to buy a stock and sit on it for five to 10 years, because that is where its true potential lies. You might make a quick buck here and there, but you're really missing out on the true benefits of LMT if you don't get into it for the long run."
4008192,52502,2016-09-24T02:52:29-04:00,"A Chinese company claims that it can now use a quantum radar system in order to detect stealth planes.Given the sacrifices made to the F-35 design in order to achieve stealth, if the Chinese claim is true, the plane may not be otherwise very useful.A rough estimate suggests that the project would make up about a quarter of Lockheed Martin revenue on average, until 2040, making it a real blow if project derailed.","If we think about it now, this was not entirely unexpected. The US announced plans for a massive fighter jet program, intending to buy 2,450 jets for somewhere around $400 billion, not including operating costs, which are rumored to be substantial. Many other countries announced plans to buy hundreds of these planes collectively. It is a massive project, which was meant to keep Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) busy for many years to come. Full production is set to commence in 2019-2020, with current production only churning out a small fraction of the total planes by then. The F-35 was projected to play a significant role in the global military landscape for many decades to come. We should have expected therefore that major militaries around the world will not waste time in countering this major military armament project. And it seems that China has already found a credible neutralizing solution to the F-35's main capabilities, even before it entered full production. With the perfection of Quantum radar technology meant to take away the F-35's invisibility, it effectively reduced it to a fighter jet, which is otherwise rather ordinary. Ordinary, but with a very high, unjustifiable price tag.The factor that was supposed to give the F-35 air-superiority over rival planes was its radar invisibility. This in effect reduces the enemy's ability to shoot it down from a distance in air to air combat. With radar-guided missiles rendered more or less ineffective, and with planes these days having flare systems meant to counter heat-seeking missiles, it in theory makes the F-35 almost invincible in air to air combat, because it can shoot down non-stealth planes a long time before these can engage the F-35. It also makes it hard for surface to air systems to bring it down with conventional radar systems. Low band width radars can detect the F-35, but cannot give a precise enough location to guide a missile. There are of course other ways to go about it, such as saturating the area with heat seeking missiles, overwhelming the defense of the F-35, but still, this was supposed to revolutionize ""war in the sky"" as a military analyst put it last year.It remains to be seen to what extent the claimed breakthrough made by Chinese state-owned company; China Electronics Technology Group Corporation can use it in practical applications meant to effectively counter stealth airplanes. But the fact that it can pinpoint aircraft 100 kilometers (62 miles) away, means that it can be incorporated into some sort of anti-aircraft missile guiding system. It remains to be seen to what extent it can be adapted to current technology already on the market, or how it can revolutionize new air defense products. It also remains to be seen to what extent it is likely to proliferate across the world. The simple fact that this breakthrough exists and it was made public, means that others now have the knowledge in regards to which path they need to follow in their own development. I personally don't believe that the Russians will be far behind on this, even if China chooses not to share the breakthrough.While it is still early to get a sense of just how wide the proliferation of this new breakthrough will be, the mere fact that it is out there, it makes it a disincentive to buy the F-35. After taking the radar invisibility factor away, it is not a particularly superior airplane compared with many other options out there, according to some critics such as Joseph Trevithik. In terms of range, it is less than half of what many other current popular fighter jets around the world can achieve. In terms of weapons, it can only carry a light load, compared with most competitors. In terms of dogfight capabilities at close range, it seems that it might be at a disadvantage compared with many competing planes, because of inferior speed and agility. In short, it may be formidable when going up against militaries with limited and outdated capabilities, but may in fact be inferior when going up against some of the more modern and evolving militaries around the world, including some rivals such as Russia, China and even Iran.It will be hard to justify cost if China claim is trueWhen a country like Norway for instance decided to get in on the F-35 project, it most likely had Russian deterrence in mind. The estimated cost of buying and operating each of the 52 planes is $769 million. The total cost is therefore about $40 billion to operate these planes over their lifetime, which is measured in the half a century range. Norway might have of course expected that the plane's superiority will not last half a century. But given the Chinese news, its superiority is no longer guaranteed for the next five years, while Norway is only just starting to receive these planes. Unless the public can be kept in the dark about the facts in regards to the real level of security benefit that this plane will likely deliver, which it seems it will be minimal if the Chinese claims are true, I don't see how Norway or any other government committed to buying F-35 planes so far can justify the cost/benefit of this purchase.Back here in the US, the program has already come under fire, with the likes of Senator John McCain slamming the project's cost, deficiencies and delays. With a total cost of buying and operating the 2,450 planes estimated to be as much as $1.5 Trillion, I would be surprised if there will not be some significant voices calling for the project to be interrupted, given that achieving air superiority through this program can no longer be claimed. This is why it is important to follow the developments in China and elsewhere in the next few months and years, in terms of any announcements of planned deployments of the new radar breakthrough.Lockheed Martin possibly robbed of huge projectJust this week Tod Wolters, the US air commander in Europe was quoted to have said that going up against the F-35 is something like having to get into the ring with an ""Invisible Mohamed Ali"". I doubt that US intelligence has failed to learn of the successful Chinese intercept with their quantum radar technology, which happened a month ago. This tells me that the political will to reconsider this project is not there, even if it turns out that competing technological advancements are likely to completely undermine the cost/benefit ratio of this project. It is in fact not only cost/benefit we are talking here of course, but an actual major diminution of US strategic military capabilities. This is why I do not believe that the US government as well as other participating governments around the world can avoid having this conversation at some point in the next few months or years.For Lockheed Martin this means that it is set to lose the biggest project of the next few decades. Just to put it into perspective, the delivery revenue from the over 3,000 F-35 planes currently on order is going to be somewhere in the $500 billion range, between now and 2040, which does not include other revenue, such as parts supplies, related services and so on. For the 2015-2040 period, this means that the project would be likely to bring in an average of about $14 billion per year. According to its 2015 report, Lockheed Martin had total revenues of $46 billion for the year, which included some revenue from the delivery of 45 F-35's. While the F-35 program was never the only thing this company had going for it, it is by far the most important project going forward.It is still early to put a number on the impact on Lockheed's revenues and profits, because it is not yet clear what reaction if any will come from the clients who already have put in orders for the plane. For many governments, it may be more tempting to deny the vulnerability of the plane to China's new breakthrough, rather than having to face the public and admitting that it was a mistake and it will have to therefore pay the cancellation fees if it wants to back out. One thing that I am reasonably certain of is that there will be no new orders. Countries like Poland, Saudi Arabia, Finland, Belgium and even Romania have expressed interest in the plane, but did not commit to it yet, and I don't believe they will.Here in the US, my guess is that delivery of the plane will go on for the next few years at least. A combination of lack of political will to deal with this huge potential problem with the gigantic F-35 project and perhaps Lockheed's ability to lobby many of the policymakers, will likely keep cancellation of the project at bay for a little while. As China will most likely continue trumpeting its own achievement in countering America's lead in radar invisibility in the air, it will however become more and more obvious to the public that the cost of the project will be far from worth it. An increasing reliance on a plane that comes with many disadvantages, which had to be accepted in order to achieve the low detection features of the plane, may even raise some objections from the US military. I therefore think that it would be a foolish bet at this point to assume that this project will run its full delivery course. It might not even reach full production."

        The stock though failed to reach new highs as capital returns stall.
        When blowout results don't produce new highs, the stock signal is a warning sign.","After another blowout quarter, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has surged back to previous questionable valuation levels. The EPS beat was so big that one needs to delve more into the numbers before reacting.Lockheed Martin now trades at nearly $250 and slightly above my previous investment thesis that the company was sending a negative signal with capital returns. Do the Q3 results alter this opinion?One of the prime reasons for the surging stock price was the proclamation that the defense company beat EPS estimates by a shocking $0.75. In reality, Lockheed Martin had a hidden gain of $0.34 from the consolidation of the AWE Management Limited venture. Without this gain, the company beat analyst estimates by $0.41.So even if one goes with the new EPS target of $12.10 for 2016 including this gain, one has to consider that the stock trades at an P/E multiple of over 20x those estimates.Considering this huge Q3 beat and raise of 2016 EPS estimates, how the company handled the capital returns in the face of this knowledge is crucial. For the quarter, Lockheed Martin repurchased 1.2 million shares for $278 million, down from $823 million last Q3.In this case, the company spent significantly less on stock buybacks this year than last year when the stock traded closer to $200. Now the company will have a 9.4 million share reduction from the exchange offer for the IS&GS deal, but the company didn't technically repurchase those shares.In reality, what matters is the plans going forward now that the exchange offer is out of the way that muddied the picture. Lockheed Martin raised the quarterly dividend by 10% to $1.82 and authorized a new $2.0 billion share buyback.The new dividend yield is a solid 2.9%, but the share buyback again signals the problem. The stock is now worth over $75 billion so the new buyback authorization is a minimal 2.6% of the outstanding shares.The below net payout yield that combines the dividend yield and stock buyback yield continues to sink.LMT data by YChartsThe key takeaway is that investors need to take a note from the stock action. Despite a reported massive beat in the Q3 results, Lockheed Martin trades below the August highs.One has to wonder what more is it going to take to push the stock higher. Especially considering the company itself is saying the same thing by pulling back on stock buybacks."
4009158,69695,2016-09-29T08:29:53-04:00,"During my journey as an investor, I've experienced plenty of ups and downs. Thankfully it has been more ups than downs, but I have made my share of mistakes.As an investor, it helps to have a short-term memory, and to not beat yourself up too much. But there is one stock I sold that I still think about.This is a stock that doubled my money, but after I sold, gained an additional $100 per share, not including dividends.Here is why I still regret selling Lockheed Martin.","I have been investing in individual stocks for almost 10 years now. Along the way, I've had my share of home runs and strikeouts. And while I'm glad to say I've had more hits than misses, there is one stock I still think about.It's a stock that I bought in 2011, held for two years, then sold after doubling my money. The reason I sold the stock was because I had booked a nice gain and didn't want to risk losing it. And, this particular company was shrouded in negative sentiment because of budget cuts in the U.S. that threatened its bread-and-butter business. As a result, very few analysts were recommending buying it at the time, and I didn't want to see my gains on paper disappear.And so, I sold the stock. While I tend not to dwell on the mistakes I have made, I have to admit I still think about what a bad decision it was to sell. That stock has increased $100 in share price since I sold it, not including dividends.That stock is Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), which I still regret selling to this day.Free Cash Flow Takes FlightThe reason why I first took a position in Lockheed was largely because of its hefty free cash flow and rising dividends. Even though the company has had its struggles generating growth in a challenging economic environment over the past five years, one thing it has not struggled to do is generate free cash flow, and that has directly resulted in very strong dividend growth.This speaks to the strength of Lockheed's business model. Thanks in part to the success of the F-35 program, which by itself accounts for 20% of Lockheed's sales, the company generated $4 billion of free cash flow last year, and is on pace to do even better this year. Last quarter alone, Lockheed booked $1.2 billion of free cash. Revenue and earnings per share increased 11% and 13%, respectively, year over year.Going forward, there should be even more growth opportunities up ahead. A compelling future growth catalyst is increasing global defense spending. Defense budgets around the world are still rising, and Lockheed has made international growth a strategic priority. This was one of the reasons why Lockheed bought the Sikorsky business from United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), because Sikorsky generates 48% of its annual sales from international regions.Lockheed generates huge amounts of free cash flow, which it uses to reward shareholders with a balanced capital allocation program. The company evenly splits its free cash flow between dividends and share buybacks.Lockheed has a shareholder-friendly management that is committed to returning lots of cash to shareholders. On Sep. 22, the company announced a 10% dividend increase and also added $2 billion to its share buyback. Lockheed has been one of the most impressive dividend stocks to own. Not only has it consistently offered an above-average dividend yield compared with the broader S&P 500, but it routinely delivers double-digit dividend increases.Lockheed has now come through with at least 10% dividend growth for 14 years in a row. This has made it a dream stock to own not just for current dividend income, but for dividend growth investors as well. Lockheed Martin is a member of the Dividend Achievers list.Click here to view all 274 Dividend Achievers.A Lesson for the FutureTo be sure, I had my reasons for selling Lockheed Martin. It was widely thought that the pending sequestration (remember that?) was going to be a death knell for the U.S. defense industry. When I wrote about Lockheed back then, most commenters contended that I was crazy to even think of buying stock in a defense company.Feeling like the only person on one side of a trade can be a lonely feeling. So I decided to sell. And, it's not like I did poorly in the stock-one can hardly argue with a greater than 100% return in two years' time.But the clear lesson going forward is that at times, it helps to have the courage of conviction. There is an old saying in the sports world that sometimes the best trade is the one you don't make. Going forward, what I learned is that high-quality companies with competitive advantages, leadership positions in their industries, strong cash flows, and steady dividends, should simply be held onto for long periods of time and not messed with. Congratulations to all Lockheed Martin investors who have held on over the past several years.To summarize, the lesson I took from my experience with Lockheed Martin is that if it ain't broke, don't try to fix it.Disclaimer: This article represents the opinion of the author, who is not a licensed financial advisor.

4007649,25228,2016-09-21T15:00:35-04:00,"Lockheed Martin has had an increasing pricing history over the last decade or so.This article provides two hypothetical set of circumstances to choose from.Despite outside or common influences, it can make a good deal of sense to ""root"" for lower prices.","At the end of 2007, shares of Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) were selling around $105. As I write this, the share price is closer to $240 or thereabouts - representing an average compound capital appreciation gain of about 9.9% per annum. In addition to share price appreciation, a long-term investor also would have collected $34 or so in per share dividend payments along the way. Adding in this component bumps the average compound total gain up to 11.6% per annum.Clearly, this has been a fine result for the long-term investor. Now in-between $105 and $240, there was some bouncing about. I'm going to give you two scenarios, and you pick the one that appears more favorable:Granted, I cannot easily poll the reading audience prior to publication, but I would surmise that alternative ""A"" would appeal to at least a portion of the readers. In each and every year, your beginning investment is worth more and more. Further, the growth rate is constant and surely onlookers would praise the security for its lack of volatility.On the other hand, you have option ""B."" Unlike the first alternative, ""B"" may not immediately pique your interest. For one thing, you'd go the first five years - that's half a decade mind you - waking up to a brokerage account with a negative red mark beside it. It wouldn't be until 2013 that the investment recovered to its beginning value and only by 2016 - nearly nine years later - that it would finally reach the mark set by the first alternative.If you were to simply buy and hold over this period - spending all the dividends along the way - the two scenarios are identical, return-wise. (Actually, that's not exactly the case, but we'll get to this shortly.) As long as you held on over the period, your return would have been what I described above ~11.6% per annum. Naturally, alternative ""A"" may have been a bit easier to stomach at the time, but both alternatives would be similar up to this point.This could be the situation for some investors. However, I would contend that a more common occurrence does not follow this path. Instead of investing just once and watching what happens over the next decade, most investors deploy capital consistently and over a good deal of time. In this way, most long-term investors are apt to be long-term net buyers as well.Given this information, it's alternative ""B"" that provides the better results. Let's count the ways.""Fresh"" CapitalInstead of investing just once and seeing what happens, it's conceivable that you would invest many times. So for this example, let's suppose that you invest $1,000 per year into Lockheed Martin at the above pricing.With alternative ""A"", your total investment would be $9,000 over the course of the last nine years. You would start with 9.5 shares and this would grow to 60.5 shares today. In addition, you would receive roughly $1,500 in dividend payments along the way. The total value of that stake, including dividends, would be about $16,000.Now let's look at alternative ""B."" Your total investment would once again be $9,000, and you'd again start with 9.5 shares. However, due to the lower share prices in the interim, you'd be able to purchase more shares along the way.In this case, your share count would grow from 9.5 shares all the way up to 88.75 shares. As a result of the much lower prices during this time, you were able to collect an additional 28.25 shares. This has a real influence in your overall results.You'd go on to collect $2,200 in annual dividend payments ($600 more) and your total stake would now be worth ~$23,500 (~$7,500 more than in the previous example). Clearly, if you're buying shares regularly, it's lower rather than higher prices that provide the ultimate benefit.ReinvestmentIf instead of adding ""fresh"" capital each month, you simply reinvest the dividends, the outcome is the same. In the first scenario, ""A,"" if you invest $1,000 just once to start and reinvest, you begin with 9.5 shares and end with 11.5 shares. The value of this stake would be approximately $2,750.Alternatively, if you were to reinvest in the second scenario, ""B,"" that same starting investment and reinvestment would turn 9.5 shares into 12.5 shares. The value of this stake would be about $3,000, or more accurately roughly the value of one share. Here too it's lower rather than higher prices that benefit your reinvestment program.It turns out that reinvesting at say $70 instead of $140 tends to generate more income in the interim, and allows you to buy a larger percentage of the business. Moreover, the ""snap back"" effect is greater once the price eventually reflects the underlying business results.On Your BehalfSome might say, ""well sure, but I don't plan on adding new capital or reinvesting, so neither of these apply."" That's fine, but you'd still be a net buyer through share repurchases. The company is buying out past partners on your behalf and thus increasing your stake in the business.In the last nine years, Lockheed Martin has spent nearly $20 billion retiring a substantial number of shares on your behalf. Now, we don't need any math for this. As a continuing shareholder, would you prefer for the company to buy out those past partners at an average price of ~$165 (alternative ""A"") or ~$130 (alternative ""B"")?The answer is once again obvious. The shareholders that decide to sell out would prefer a higher price and the long-term owner would prefer for the company to buy out partners at a lower price.By the way, earnings and dividends were marching upwards throughout this period - albeit somewhat unevenly, upward nonetheless.I should reveal, if you haven't already guessed, that ""B"" is what actually occurred and ""A"" was something that I made up - a hypothetical example to demonstrate the point. What's even more interesting, in my view, is that ""A"" is only hypothetical on the selling side, not the buying side.This is something that I believe passes by the causal observer. Even as many people are net buyers (for the reasons detailed above), they are still ""rooting"" for higher share prices. But think about the logic behind that.Shares of Lockheed trade at ~$240 as I write this. And for any number of reasons - say biweekly capital additions, reinvestment or share repurchases - you're going to be buying more. Now, if you truly wanted a higher price - what so many people root for despite buying more - I'm positive that market participants would oblige to your request.Instead of buying at $240, I'm certain that you could instead see a quote for $250 or $300 or hey, even $1,000 and purchase at that price instead. You wouldn't be able to get that price if you were selling. But on the buying side, the sky is the limit. Actually, I'll offer that service to anyone that is interested. If you're going to be buying, but want a higher price at the same time, I'll gladly name you a higher price and supply you with the shares.Of course, this notion is ridiculous. Yet that's the point. When we're a net buyer of groceries we make no such mistakes. If avocados are selling for $1 a piece, we don't go to the cash register and say, ""would you take $1.20?"" The same goes for anything; if you're a net buyer, it's lower rather than higher prices that provide the ultimate benefit.Yet for some illogical reason, many net buyers of securities are simultaneously ""rooting"" for the share prices to increase at the same time. It's analogous to stopping for gas and then rooting for the price to increase before you're done filling up.Now naturally higher prices are eventually going to come about anyway; whether you ""root"" for higher prices or not, a group of profitable businesses tend to increase in profitability over time. And thus the share price generally follows suit over the long term as well.Yet if you're a net buyer, you ought to think about the psychology (and math) appropriately. If you see lower prices and you're buying, that's good news. All too many get consumed with temporary fluctuations of paper wealth - even in times when they are thinking not of selling but instead of buying. Obviously, the 25-year old contributing a portion of each paycheck to their retirement account is a net buyer but even the retiree who is living off dividends is still a net buyer (via share repurchase) - this applies to more investors than you might originally think.The big caveat is that if you were looking to sell in the short or intermediate term, then you could be ""rooting"" for higher prices. Yet if you're happy to hold and going to be investing for years and decades, it makes a whole lot of sense to ""root"" for lower prices. Or if that's still a psychological barrier, at the very least you can logically understand the benefit of lower prices. When these times inevitably happen, don't get discouraged; get enthused."
4005583,59781,2016-09-12T09:59:31-04:00,"13 years of continuous dividend growth is saying something of this company's quality.10% dividend growth last year likely to be repeated this year.Though it sports an impressive history, now is not the time to load up on this one.","Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has been an integral part of the U.S. Military Industrial Complex for decades.The company has been in business since 1912, hard at work supplying modern weapons for the United States and, later, its allies as well.LMT data by YChartsThis company, like most, have had its ups and downs historically but has been on a real tear over the last five years as evidenced by the graph above. Rising from $75 to $239 gives a multiple of 3.2x your investment. That translates into an annual average return of 26% -- without dividends. Not bad for a 100 year old!Historical Dividend GrowthLockheed Martin has paid a quarterly dividend for many years and has been increasing them annually since 2003. That year the dividend was actually hiked twice, right at the start of the year and in September.Over the last ten years the dividend has increased from $0.3 per share per quarter to $1.65 per quarter -- a massive 5.5x or 18.6% annually. If I had only known of this incredible dividend growth to come at the time, I would have loaded up!LMT Dividend data by YChartsThis begs the question, with such an incredible history, can history repeat itself? As is often the case in situations like this: Probably not.Over the last five years dividends have grown at a healthy pace, but the payout ratio has grown together with it. That means less cash available for research and development, acquisitions and other growth initiatives. At some point in time, the payout ratio will have to stop growing, lest it pulls away the entire foundation of future dividend growth.A payout ratio of 55% is not enough to scare me at this time. However, dividend growth will probably be more in line with EPS growth over the coming years as a company operating in this business needs to retain a big chunk of its profit to invest in new weaponry.September Dividend HikeLate September seems to be the preferred date for the Board of this well-performing company to let its shareholders take part of its success. Three years ago they got almost 16%, two years ago they enjoyed a hike of 13% and last year they got 10%.You have probably seen already what I'm hinting at -- dividend growth is high, but falling. Since it started its annual increases, they have always been in the double digits. That streak was barely kept intact last year. Historically the Board has shown solid dedication towards double-digit dividend growth. The question this year is whether the Board is committed enough to continue that streak or if it will be content with merely a single-digit increase.The CEO seemed quite upbeat, judging by his comments in its latest earnings press release. Current guidance for the year is for an EPS range of $12.15 - $12.45. Taking the midpoint of that, $12.3, and applying the current dividend level yields a payout ratio of 54%. Not worrisome. Compared to its EPS of the last fiscal year, it represents a growth rate of 7.3%.Given how committed the Board is to growing the dividend, I think the absolute minimum is that the dividend will grow in line with the EPS, that is for a minimum hike of 7%.On the upside, the CEO's bullishness aside, the numbers don't allow for a massive hike. That said, there is still room to increase the payout ratio slightly. If it were raised by 12%, the new payout ratio would be 60% -- probably too aggressive. A 10% hike, like last year, would give a new dividend of $1.815 and a payout ratio of 59%. That might still be a bit on the uncomfortably high side as far as the payout ratio is concerned, but weighing against that is the Board's streak of more than a decade of double-digit dividend hikes.At the end of the day I think the Board is very reluctant to go below double-digits and will, if at all possible, try to delay such a ""defeat"" until next year. My prediction is therefore for a hike of 10% to $1.82 per share per quarter. The Board has not shown a tendency to go beyond two decimals, hence the $1.82 number as opposed to the mathematically purer $1.815.Risk FactorsA major risk factor for defense stocks is that they have very few customers. The U.S. Army is the absolute behemoth on the customer side. This gives the government huge sway when negotiating contracts. Also it is very exposed to the budget of that large customer. U.S. politicians cutting defense spending means less revenue. Simple as that. Additionally, there are restrictions as to what countries Lockheed can sell to. Selling to Assad in Syria for instance, together with the Russians, just won't do. Increasingly, other countries are developing sophisticated weapons systems, competing against the traditionally world-leading American firms.Current ValuationIt is always nice to conduct a peer group valuation, just to make sure you don't lose sight of the other opportunities out there. As peer group I have chosen Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) and Raytheon (RTN).Source: MorningstarLockheed Martin wins the Price/Sales category quite easily but comes out last in the Price/Earnings bracket with Northrop the winner. That said, they are all trading quite closely on that measure. As for the dividend, Lockheed is the clear winner with 2.7% against Raytheon in second place with a mere 2.0% dividend yield.As a comparison the S&P 500 trades at a Price/Earnings ratio of 19.8x and sports a dividend yield of 2.3%. That means all the companies above trade fairly in-line with the broader market.Of the three companies above I would say Lockheed is the most juicy one with a comparably fat yield, low Price/Sales ratio and Price/Earnings ratio in-line with the others. That said, I don't think any of the companies above look particularly cheap.The average analyst expects Lockheed's annual EPS growth over the next five years to come in at 6%. Adding in the dividend yield of 2.7% gives us an expected annual total shareholder return of 8.7%. That is OK given the defensive nature of this company but not enough for me to justify allocating capital to this stock. I will wait and look elsewhere for better opportunities, alternatively wait for a real correction in the stock. Judging by the market action on Friday, waiting a few weeks might be just the right thing to do.ConclusionLockheed Martin is without a doubt a solid company with an impressive history of dividend growth. Even so, the growth rate has slowed down over the years. It will soon hike its dividend and will probably do so by 10%, but current multiples and future expected growth rates are not conducive to future expected total shareholder returns. This is not the time to add this stock. Wait for a real stock correction before adding."
4008170,22148,2016-09-23T17:39:44-04:00,Lockheed Martin increased the quarterly dividend and added to the stock repurchase plan.The defense company is not aggressively repurchasing shares based on the current valuation and the recent quarterly buybacks.A key to a rally beyond the high around $265 is whether Lockheed Martin can build a case for repurchasing shares at a forward P/E of 20.,"After predicting that Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) was on the verge of topping out back in July, the stock went into tailspin in August. Now the company offers updated capital return plans to warrant a second look at the defense stock.The stock recently rallied to $247 after a dip to $235. The question is whether the data supports a return to previous highs of $260 and above.Lockheed Martin authorized the purchase of an additional $2.0 billion worth of shares. Combined with the existing authorization, the company now has approval for $4.3 billion.At the same time, the company approved a 10% hike to the quarterly dividend to $1.82 for the dividend payable in December. The new annual rate of $7.28 offers a dividend yield of 3.0%.The new dividend offers a solid yield of 3% while the buyback amount sounds more exciting than reality. The stock currently has a market value of $72.1 billion. The total authorized stock buyback equates to only 6.0% of the outstanding stock.According to the quarterly stock buybacks, Lockheed Martin is only spending slightly above the annual rate of $2 billion on repurchasing shares. This annual amount is more crucial than the total authorized amount.To show a better picture, the net payout yield (net stock buyback yield + dividend yield) shows a yield of 6.1%. The yield will rise further due to the dividend hike.The key investor takeaway is that as Lockheed Martin returns to previous highs, the yield pushes back to levels where the stock isn't as attractive. Not to mention, the defense company pulled away from purchasing the stock at fast clips when approaching trading at 20x forward EPS estimates.The suggestion is to not chase the stock beyond the previous highs of $260 and above."

On the other hand, local/regional conflicts mushroomed in multiple countries including Syria, Iraq, Libya and Ukraine, opening the door for targeted equipment-led responses from the U.S.A. The global fight against ISIS has created increased demand for high-tech precision weaponry, while international conflicts and instability have provided U.S. defense companies an opportunity to grow international defense sales. As underlined by Zacks Equity Research:Irrespective of the outcome of the November presidential elections in the U.S.A., the war on terror is unlikely to end anytime soon. Furthermore, both candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, are likely to pursue a Middle East policy that requires higher engagement from the U.S.A. than has been pursued by president Obama, with a real possibility of ground troops. As reported by Politico in March 2016:Likewise, as reported by the Guardian, Hilary Clinton stated in November 2015:From a short term perspective, for the next 18 months, global turmoil is likely to provide additional demand for U.S. defense companies' products. In case the next U.S. president does increase U.S. engagement with the objective of securing 'victory' & restoring global stability, and in case such 'victory' is secured, then any short term surge in defense related demand may prove to be short-lived if global stability is indeed restored. On the other hand, some may also argue that maintaining such stability would require the U.S. to continue beefing up its defense capabilities. As summarized by Morningstar analyst Chris Higgens on CNBC:Given the preceding, at least for the next few years, it does seem that the global environment is quite supportive for defense spending. However, leading defense stocks have already appreciated noticeably; such expectations may already be factored into their current stock prices, and may have rendered valuations too expensive.

We favor buying calls expiring March 17, 2017 with a strike of 265 currently trading for a premium of about 7.20, and corresponding puts with a strike of 230 currently trading for a premium of about 6.90. Again would be inclined to buy two puts for each call, due to elevated valuations. Break-even is about 286 to the upside and 219.5 to the downside.Raytheon CompanyRaytheon shares 10-year price chart - Source: Yahoo FinanceRaytheon Company has appreciated by over 144.5% from 57.56 on 12/31/2012 to 140.76 on 8/5/2016, an average of 40.2% annually on a non-compounded basis (28.2% on a compounded basis). Consensus earnings estimates of $7.41/share for this year and $7.77/share for next year, Raytheon's forward P/E ratios stand at 19.0 and 18.1 respectively. During the last 13 years, Raytheon's P/E ratio has ranged between 7.28 and 22.64, with a median of about 12.09.Raytheon's international business is quite healthy, with substantial order backlog. It is estimated that 42% of Raytheon's order backlog is from international sales. As noted by Zacks Equity Research:Once again, on one hand, Raytheon's prospects look promising due to geopolitical instability, while on the other hand, valuations are quite expensive and may have gone too far. Such divergence could be a recipe for a substantial move in Raytheon's shares to either direction. We favor buying calls expiring February 17, 2017 with a strike of 145 currently trading for a premium of about 4.75, and corresponding puts with a strike of 135 currently trading for a premium of about 5.45. Again would be inclined to buy two puts for each call, due to elevated valuations. Break-even is about 160.65 to the upside and 127.17 to the downside.General DynamicsGeneral Dynamic shares 10-year price chart - Source: Yahoo FinanceGeneral Dynamics has appreciated by over 114.9% from 69.27 on 12/31/2012 to 148.89 on 8/5/2016, an average of about 32% annually on a non-compounded basis (23.7% on a compounded basis). Consensus earnings estimates of $9.71/share for this year and $10.03/share for next year, General Dynamic's forward P/E ratios stand at 15.3 and 14.8 respectively. During the last 13 years, General Dynamic's P/E ratio has ranged between 5.80 and 21.53, with a median of about 14.95.General Dynamics' future business prospects also look very positive if it is able to win additional future defense contracts. As reported by CNBC:Despite General Dynamics shares' substantial appreciation since 2012, valuations are not as elevated as the other leading defense companies. General Dynamics forward P/E ratio is close to its 13-year median. We favor buying calls expiring February 17, 2017 with a strike of 155 currently trading for a premium of about 4.60, and corresponding puts with a strike of 140 currently trading for a premium of about 5.30. Unlike the previous three companies, we would be inclined to buy one put for each call, due to the fact that General Dynamics' valuations are not as elevated as valuations for Raytheon, Northrop and Lockheed Martin. Break-even is about 164.9 to the upside and 130.1 to the downside.ConclusionLeading defense companies General Dynamics, Raytheon, Northrop and Lockheed Martin have appreciated substantially since 2012. The current geopolitical terrain continues to be favorable for domestic and international defense orders and is unlikely to be affected negatively by upcoming U.S. presidential elections. Most likely, defense spending would increase in the intermediate terms under the next U.S. president irrespective of whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump is elected president. Meanwhile, valuations are quite expensive, currently at record levels from a P/E perspective, with the exception of General Dynamics. Investors can potentially benefit from a substantial move in either direction by establishing an options position, as provided above."
4002567,65113,2016-08-28T04:42:33-04:00,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) is highly likely to be undervalued on a free cash flow basis.
        The divesting of the company's government IT business will allow the company to refocus efforts on increasing production volume in more profitable business segments.
        For this reason, I decided to go long the company at a price of $247.","In my previous analysis of Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) on July 29, I argued that in spite of concerns that the stock might be too expensive, there are several things that the company has going for it:- Expected increase in worldwide defense spending- An attractive price to free cash flow valuation relative to peers- Continued acquisition of valuable defense contractsOn the 25th of this month, I decided to go long the stock at a price of $247. At the current price of $244 at the time of writing, the drop in Lockheed Martin's price has been primarily due to concerns over the sale of its government IT business, with the company expected to shrink in size to $40.5 billion in comparison to $46.1 billion with this sector included. Moreover, it is estimated that this divestiture could knock off hundreds of millions of dollars off the company's annual free cash flow figure.However, I do not see this materializing, nor as a valid reason for the price drop and instead see this as a good move for Lockheed Martin long-term. As a leader in the defense industry, one of the company's main advantages has been securing contracts to supply major weaponry to large-key organizations. For instance, the company has recently won another contract to supply the U.S. Navy with engineering services for the Integrated Submarine Imaging Systems program.While the company continues to supply expertise in many of its contracts, supplying of equipment and defense vehicles has remained the company's bread and butter. In this context, redirecting costs towards product development gives the company a great opportunity to recoup lost profits through increased volume. For instance, an interesting article by the Motley Fool touches on the fact that while the F-35 jet has been a high-quality offering by Lockheed Martin to the U.S. Air Force, the primary concern is volume.For instance, the Air Force has stated that a key problem in securing additional aircraft is replacement - which understandably is significantly higher than that of commercial aircraft. While Lockheed Martin will deliver 53 F-35s for a consortium of customers this year, redirecting of its cost base towards greater production volume will allow the company to make greater progress towards a ""60 per year"" target for the air force, while continuing to increase production for other customers.We see that when it comes to sales and operating profits, sectors including Aeronautics and Mission Systems and Training have far outpaced that of Information Systems & Global Solutions:Source: Lockheed Martin - Second Quarter 2016 ResultsMoreover, for all the talk about Lockheed Martin being expensive at the current price, we see that on a five-year historical basis, free cash flow continues to increase and the price to free cash flow ratio continues to touch among lows seen in the past five years:In this regard, it is a mistake to look at price and conclude that Lockheed Martin is expensive. Look at value - and based on free cash flow - there is lots of it.Given the valuation and the company's aforementioned strengths, I am now long Lockheed Martin and have no intentions of selling any time soon."
4003496,68315,2016-09-01T00:57:04-04:00,"Lockheed Martin's second quarter was pretty good.
        The dividend will be increased this month.
        Recent sell-off provides nice buying opportunity.","Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is one of the biggest aeronautics / defense companies in the world. Due to a great dividend growth history the company has a huge number of followers among retail investors. The recent price drop provides a compelling entry point for shares of Lockheed Martin.Lockheed Martin has been a great performer operationally over the last years, which is clear when we look at a couple of key metrics of the company:The company grew revenues by 26%, net income by 53% and earnings per share by 115% over the last then years. This was possible due to margin increases (which allowed for high earnings growth relative to the revenue growth rate) and due to a vastly declining share count -- the result of Lockheed Martin's share repurchases, which allowed for high earnings per share growth relative to the earnings growth rate.The company's Q2 was another quarter where Lockheed Martin performed very well:The company grew its revenues by 11% yoy to $12.9 billion, which was based on growing aeronautics sales (up to $4.4 billion from $4.1 billion) as well as on significantly higher Mission Systems and Training revenues (up 50% yoy, from $2.2 billion to $3.3 billion). Mission Systems and Training has been a great performer in the first quarter as well, and will likely continue to impress. Lockheed Martin's net income grew from $930 million to $1020 million in the second quarter, which means a strong 10% increase over the prior year's level. Due to a lower share count (down 3% yoy, from 316 million to 307 million shares) Lockheed Martin's earnings per share growth rate has been even better: EPS of $3.32 for the second quarter meant an increase of 13% over 2015's Q2 number of $2.94.Last but not least, we see that Lockheed Martin's cash flows grew by 17% to $1.46 billion, which means high shareholder returns (in addition to the capital expenditures that are required to keep Lockheed Martin's operations running smoothly) can be expected in the future as well. Those shareholder returns are made up by share repurchases ($501 million in Q2), which have lead to a share count decline of 29% over the last ten years, as well as by Lockheed Martin's dividend:Right now the quarterly payout stands at $1.65 per share, which equals a dividend yield of 2.8% at the current price. Lockheed Martin's next dividend increase is due with the next dividend announcement, which will likely happen in the last week of September. Last Tuesday was the ex-dividend date for the last payment of $1.65. Over the last five years Lockheed Martin has raised its dividend by 17% annually, but even another 10% increase (like the one we have seen in 2015) would bring Lockheed Martin's dividend yield to 3.0% again -- this would be a great yield in today's low interest environment, with the 30 year treasuries yielding just 2.3% and the S&P 500 index yielding an even lower 2.2% right now.Over the last weeks Lockheed Martin's shares have lost roughly ten percent of their value (from the all time high, though, on a yoy basis the company's shares still performed very well), which seems unjustified when we look a the reason for that sell-off: On the day following the spin-off of Lockheed Martin's IT business the company's shares lost 3.7%, after Lockheed Martin announced that the shares repurchased through a Reverse Morris Trust totaled just 9.4 million instead of 10 million. A 0.6 million difference in the company's share count (planned reduction versus actual reduction) means EPS will be lower by 0.2% versus guidance (0.6 million shares is a 0.2% portion of the company's share count of roughly 300 million). A 0.2% change in the company's forward estimated EPS does not justify a fall of almost 4% in one day, and it doesn't justify a 10% sell-off over two weeks either. I thus believe that this sell-off provides a good entry point for those interested in owning Lockheed Martin and its attractive dividend (that will very likely yield 3.0% or more after the next dividend increase at the end of the current month).TakeawayLockheed Martin has performed very well over the last years, and continued to do so in the last quarter. With growing cash flows investors can count on continuing high shareholder returns.Due to its high dividend yield and upcoming dividend hike Lockheed Martin is attractive for dividend growth investors, especially after the company's shares dropped ten percent for a news item that was not significant for the company's long term prospects."
4007333,25228,2016-09-20T12:22:52-04:00,"An analyst recently suggested that Lockheed Martin could earn $20 per share by 2020.
        This assumption, if it comes to fruition, could imply very solid returns.
        Of course this is only one possibility, and it can be prudent to consider a wide range of future outcomes.","On September 19th of 2016, a Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) analyst suggested that Maryland-based Aerospace, Defense and Technology company Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) could generate $20 in earnings-per-share by 2020. The analyst pointed to organic growth, reduced share count, higher U.S. defense spending, F-35 growth and pension income as tailwinds for the company.In addition, the analyst suggested that shares could be worth $300 in the coming year. The reasoning was logical enough. Here's how that particular number was calculated.If Lockheed is to earn $20 by 2020, you can discount that value back in time. Using the company's cost of capital (they use 7.8%) this means that your discount rate would be about 1.25 (1.078^3). In other words, the present value of that $20 in 2020 EPS would be about $16 by 2017. Based on the consensus earnings multiple (around 19) that equates to a future share price just above $300.It's logical, and comes about in a nice, clean fashion. Of course the investment world isn't quite so tidy. Just because you suppose something could happen does not automatically make it so. In the above example, any number of things could be drastically different as a reality. Earnings may not be exactly $20 - instead it could be $20.10 or $19.90, $18 or $22, $16 or $24, or… well you get the idea. Earnings estimates are simply that: guesses about the future that are overwhelmingly likely to be wrong.Next up you have the discount rate to use. Seven point eight percent might be reasonable, and granted you need some sort of proxy, but here again there's a rational argument to be made for 7% or 9% or something a bit different. And these seemingly small changes can have large impacts.Finally, the earnings multiple is perhaps the most finicky of the three aspects. Even if you get the future earnings exactly spot on, there's no mechanism that requires shares to trade at $300 instead of $280 or $320.In other words, be cautious about expectations down to the exact dollar. It's absolutely necessary to create a baseline. However, without simultaneously acknowledging the wide range of potential error, you can set yourself up for future disappointment.With that in mind, let's think about three separate scenarios for Lockheed Martin's future. In the first case, we'll suppose that the analyst gets the future earnings exactly correct: $20 in EPS by 2020.Shares of Lockheed Martin presently trade with an earnings multiple north of 20. Should this ratio continue, $20 in EPS would imply a future price of about $413. In addition, you would collect dividends along the way. Based on the current $1.65 quarterly dividend, Lockheed's payout ratio sits around 55%. Should this ratio continue you would also anticipate receiving $37 or so in cash dividends per share.Collectively that equates to a total anticipated value of about $450. As compared to the current price near $241, this would imply an average compound total gain of over 15% per annum. Clearly this (and anything better) would be a rather impressive result.Then again, it's conceivable that the current valuation multiple is so high as a result of the solid anticipated growth prospects. For the second scenario, let's scale things back a bit.Twenty dollars in EPS by 2020 is certainly possible, but I've also seen much more subdued expectations. Should Lockheed ""only"" earn say $17.50 by 2020, your results are naturally going to be lower. For one thing, if you keep the payout ratio constant, you might only anticipate receiving $33.50 in per share dividends in the coming four years.Over the past two decades Lockheed has traded with an average earnings multiple of about 16. In the last decade this number has been closer to 13. Only in the last couple of years has something above 16 been a common occurrence. Should shares of Lockheed trade at say 16 times earnings, this would imply a future price of about $280.That's a total value of about $313.50 including dividends, or an average compound gain of roughly 6.4% per annum. This would still build wealth, but a more conservative view provides a drastically different outcome.Finally, we can look at a third scenario showing even more caution. For instance, should Lockheed ""only"" generate $15 in per share earnings by 2020 (still well above today's mark) and trade at say 14 times earnings, suddenly you're looking at the potential for nonexistent gains (even including dividends).Of course this is just three of an infinite number of possibilities. Here's a look at a much wider range, showing 80 different alternatives:The top row shows earnings-per-share by 2020 for Lockheed Martin. The left-hand column details various P/E ratios ranging from 11 to 20. The intersection of each metric represents the annualized rate of return (based on 4.25 years) that these assumptions would represent. The dividend is included and grows in line with earnings in this hypothetical example.The three yellow highlighted cells roughly indicate the three scenarios that I outlined above. Moving from the lower right-hand corner to the middle-left, you have the robust scenario followed by the two more cautious approaches.This sort of table allows you to complete various scenario analyses immediately. If you suspect that Lockheed can earn say $16 per share by 2020 and ought to trade at perhaps 17 times earnings, you can instantly see that these suppositions would translate to an assumption of 6% annual returns; keeping in mind that this is merely a baseline.In viewing the table, a couple of things jump out to me. Notably, the values are somewhat skewed to the downside. This was done intentionally.If the analyst's presumptions come to fruition and Lockheed earns $20 per share by 2020 (or even $19) and later trades at 18 or 20 times earnings, you're looking at the prospect for double-digit returns. It's just the way the math works out. And naturally if the results were a bit better - say earning $21 per share or trading at 22 times earnings - your anticipated returns would be even greater.In this light, I don't find it useful to extrapolate to the sky. I could have included say $25 in earnings and a P/E of 30, but this doesn't add much insight - we already know the returns would be solid prior to getting to that mark.The second thing to note is the wide range of values represented. An analyst is going to give you a very specific, down to the dollar, expectation but in reality you have to be cognizant of the many possibilities. In other words, I find it prudent to both come up with a baseline and recognize the great degree of possible fluctuations.In short, if $20 in EPS for Lockheed Martin comes about, that's great and could very well mean solid returns for today's owner. If the company comes up a bit short of that expectation, something in the mid-single digits as a potential return assumption appears more prudent. And if the company only improves slightly, the returns are apt to be unimpressive. The takeaway is to not accept a given number at face value and instead create a range of scenarios that would better help you deal with the future fluctuations that are sure to come about."
4003758,34851,2016-09-02T04:40:20-04:00,"Defense contractors Leidos and Lockheed had their $5 billion contract with the National Nuclear Security Administration invalidated days after being awarded.
        Administration officials cancelled the contract after finding out that Lockheed had sold the corporate assets named to manage the contract to Leidos without disclosing the sale to the NNSA.
        The stunning action takes a huge hit on Leidos which has been flying high.","In the last week of August defense contractors Leidos Holdings (NYSE: LDOS) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) were celebrating in winning a $5 billion, 10-year contract awarded last week to a wholly owned Lockheed Martin subsidiary, Nevada Site Science Support and Technologies Corp (known as NVS3T), to manage and operate the Nevada National Security Site.The security site, 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas, was formerly known as the Nevada Test Site where full-scale nuclear weapons tests were conducted from 1951 to 1992. The contract was in part to ensure the safety and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile located there.Wednesday that contract was revoked when the National Nuclear Security Administration discovered that NVS3T had been sold during the bidding process from Lockheed to Leidos, without notifying the government.Leidos is a defense contractor, specializing in support for intelligence and cyber security operations, among other specialties. On August 16 Leidos announced the NVS3T deal in a press release:Leidos is currently trading just above $40, in the upper end of its $29.56-$43.81 52-week trading range. It boasts an 11 PE based on EPS of 3.60. It has a dividend rate of $1.28 for a yield of 3.16%. This yield does not reflect a hefty $13.64 special dividend that went ex-div on August 17.With 1Q Revenue at $1.31 billion and Operating Income of $89 million, losing their expected $500 million a year will likely hurt. The board may wish some of that special dividend back.In his last earnings call in April, 2016, CEO Roger Krone was gushing over the soon-to-be closed transaction:It is not clear if Leidos still considers the transaction to be accretive after the contract fiasco with the NNSA. However word of the flub has not yet seemed to have made a significant impact on share price.LDOS data by YChartsAt first glance it looks like prices crashed, but actually the $10 plunge on August 17 reflects ex-div trading on the aforementioned special dividend.As far as Lockheed Martin, this is likely to be nothing more than some egg on the face. Their side of the transaction is done so they at least have not lost $500 million in annual revenue. The danger is if they have drawn the ire of government procurer's due to their fumble, causing more intense scrutiny on future bids.As for Leidos - it is a profitable business. But the share price likely will be rocky the next few months as the effects of the NNSA pratfall get sorted out."
3999902,26141,2016-08-16T09:16:26-04:00,Risk-free arbitrage opportunities do exist via public information sources.Only a simple English interpretation and arithmetic calculation are required to take advantage of this opportunity.Optimistic outlooks for both stocks are anticipated post-split-off.,"In a July 11 press release, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) announced that it will split off its Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS) business segment to Leidos Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LDOS). It's being called a Reverse Morris Trust transaction for tax-efficient purposes.LDOS's price moved up from $52.78 per share on July 11 to $55.39 the next day. LMT's performance is also slightly up by 1.2%, which indicates the indifferent attitude the market give to this news. Is there a profitable opportunity woven into this deal? And what is a ""Reverse Morris Trust"" transaction anyway?As usual, the devil lies in the details. Let's take a deep dive into the finer points. According to the press release on July 11, 2016, there are several key elements pertinent to this exchange offer: So the caveat in the design that catches an investor's eye instantly is the receipt of $111 in value of Abacus common stock in exchange of $100 value of Lockheed Martin common stock. So if I am a Lockheed shareholder agreeing to participate into this deal, I receive 10% return right off the bat. Should I purchase LMT shares to pocket the anticipated 10% return? Before jumping into action, I'd check three points:For question 1, one potential risk is that Leidos takes a nose dive, causing the Leidos shares to be worth less than the $110 of anticipated value. Or LDOS shares decline significantly in value post-split-off. There is another caveat in the calculation based on prospectus excerpt below, so the number used is the dividend-adjusted price of LDOS. Given today is just one day ahead of final expiration, the terms are determined as follows:According to the table above, $35.8319 multiplied by 8.2136 equals 294.3089, denominated by LMT price of $263.5256. At the pure stock exchange level, I will gain 11.68% profit. Actually, LMT published on its website on Aug. 15 the final prices, which were in line with my calculations. Note it is 7.42%, instead of the 10% previously claimed.For question 2, if everyone wants to capitalize on this opportunity and wants to maximize the profits, then the exchange is subject to proration if the offer is oversubscribed. There are roughly 303 million LMT outside while only 76 million is needed, so about a quarter of the shares I purchased can be converted to get an estimated 7% return if every shareholder elects to do so. In reality, I speculate not everyone tries to figure out this great deal and simply waives this opportunity. So I might have 50% chance, leading to a 3.5% return relative to the capital invested.Alternatively, there is a carve out giving ""odd lot"" shareholders a guarantee of 100% participation in the offer. So by tendering 99 shares or fewer, you can be assured of fully participating in the exchange of LMT for LDOS. Based on the arithmetic, this looks like a fair risk to take for a potential 10% return subject to pro-ration for tendering 100 shares or more. It looks even better for a smaller amount tendered under the ""odd lot"" carve out.What really strikes me is why this deal is designed in such a way that leaves free money on the table. Just some simple third-grade math can lead to an almost risk-free return. Any smart investors who identified this opportunity will come into play with large positions. No wonder the price of LMT has been driven up since January of this year until the present by 22.73%By the time this article is published, it will already be too late for readers to capitalize on this deal. However, it's still worth some contemplation and speculation on both stocks' performance after the exchange offer is consummated. Take a look at the year-to-date performance of Leidos. It took a plunge during a span of January and February. Given the new 77 million shares to be issued, existing outstanding share values are at the risk of dilution. However, in just the last five days closing to this deal consummation, there was a 5% uptick of Leidos, indicating the optimistic sentiment toward its future outlook.I would conclude that this optimism is well-founded by understanding their ownership structure. Even though LMT is splitting off IS&GS to Leidos Holdings, LMT holds 50.5% stake in Leidos. Given the core competencies of Leidos to run this business in the future and the deep client connection LMT has with the government, substantial synergies can be created by this deal. And let's not forget the tax efficiencies presented by the Reverse Morris Trust nature of the transaction itself.Editing on Aug 19th to correct my misunderstanding of the ownership structure of LDOS after merger. Thanks @dlma1 for pointing it out -""The FORMER SHAREHOLDERS (not the corporation) who tendered their shares acquire 50.5% interest in Leidos."", illustrated by the graph at page 28 of the prospectus below:"
3993089,65113,2016-07-29T04:05:00-04:00,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) has seen both price and free cash flow increase significantly in the past few months.
        Worldwide defense spending is expected to continue to increase.
        I rate Lockheed Martin as a buy at this time.","MY CURRENT RATING: BUYLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is a company that has continued to go from strength to strength.My prior analysis commended the company for its strong business model evidenced by the company's ability to attract large and influential customers, as well as the company's vibrant growth in free cash flow.Since my last analysis, the company has risen from $214 on February 18 to $254 at the time of writing. Additionally, we see a more or less uninterrupted wave of growth since 2013:In spite of this, the company may in fact still be undervalued. For instance, while price has increased significantly, the company's price to free cash flow ratio of 15.73 is still slightly lower than that of 15.81 last February:Free cash flow per share has risen to just under 15 last March to 16.18 at the time of writing. Moreover, Lockheed Martin has continued to achieve key milestones such as securing a contract to participate in the Presidential Helicopter Replacement Program. Currently, two model aircraft are undergoing required modifications, with configured aircraft set to fly next year. While there has been some concern over competition from rivals such as Northrop Grumman, I had pointed out in a previous article that Lockheed Martin's cash flow and debt position is significantly more attractive and long-term sustainable growth is more likely in this regard.Additionally, the company has continued to win defense contracts such as that of production of the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter aircraft worth $559.5 million. Aside from individual projects, the defense sector in general is undergoing a boom as both U.S. and worldwide defense spending continues to increase. Moreover, given that one-fifth of Lockheed Martin's earnings comes from abroad, I expect that sales and earnings will continue to increase accordingly.Ultimately, I rate Lockheed Martin as a buy at this time given that the price to free cash flow remains unchanged as both price and free cash flow continue to increase. Moreover, new contracts and the industry environment in general is conducive to higher gains across the defense sector as a whole at this time."
4000161,89346,2016-08-17T06:59:40-04:00,"Lockheed Martin stock dropped by 3% on Tuesday on news of its Leidos Holdings offer.The company still offers promising prospects as nothing else has changed.LMT fundamentals are pristine, and the stock price drop could offer a good chance to make a quick gain as well.","In Tuesday's trading Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) saw its stock price drop by more than 3% as the company announced that its spinoff of its IT division Leidos Holdings would end up making less than what the investors had expected.LMT was trading near an all-time high by Monday, however after announcing the preliminary results of the Leidos Holdings exchange offer which showed that the company repurchased approximately 9.4 million shares through a Reverse Morris Trust, missing the target expectation of 10 million shares, the company stock dropped by $8.46 per share and closing at $256.77 per share.A 3% drop for a company as stable as Lockheed Martin is enough to rattle some of the more ardent LMT shareholders, and given that many investors were expecting the Leidos Holding exchange to be more fruitful it is absolutely understandable why many investors would be disheartened by the aftermath of Tuesday's trading session.However I urge those reconsidering their position in LMT to hold on.Even after the fall in share price the company stock has seen a gain of more than 20% in the past 52-weeks, and that's a feat any company should be proud of regardless of the prevalent market scenario. A quick look at the latest fiscal quarter shows that the company outpaced expectations by posting a profit of $3.37 per share on sales of $12.91 billion, a y-o-y gain of 13% and 11%.Now looking ahead we have to consider a few things. First of all besides the Leidos Holding effect on the stock price there does not seem to be any other major update regarding the company. Secondly, the new lower stock price offers investors a chance to capitalize on the short term adjustment up ahead. Lockheed Martin is expected to announce its 3rd quarter updates in the upcoming weeks with no announcement date set as of yet. The most likely dates land between 18th and 24th October. Provided that the company does not go through any other unforeseen circumstances the stock should see itself rebound and cross back in the $260 per share territory.Now, on the off-chance LMT does experience adverse results the stock price could drop further or even stagnate. If you're an LMT holder then my sincerest advice would be to stick with the stock. In the past 8 months the stock price has appreciated by approximately 20% and you're looking at a decent gain as it is. Even if Lockheed Martin does take another beating in the upcoming weeks it'll take a lot of brute force to eradicate the gain it's made since the start of 2016.But all these warnings of a gloomy future for the company stock are rather farfetched. You're looking at the largest US defense contractor which has revenue streams for the next many years locked and confirmed. There are competitors in the vicinity but none on par with this behemoth of a company. Analysts across the board had a general ""hold"" rating for the stock before Tuesday, some of whom might have changed their rating thereafter. However I firmly believe this is but a small hindrance.The company has a current dividend yield of 2.50%, and has a diluted EPS of 12.01. Net earnings for the first half of fiscal 2016 stand at $1.919 billion a gain of more than 6% as compared to the same period last year. Cash dividends have also gone up by $0.30 to $3.30 for the first half of fiscal 2016. Gross margins have also improved in the same period, having gone down to 0.108 from 0.121, a promising sign for a company as large as Lockheed Martin."

The defense and aerospace company has seen the stock surge during that time period stretching valuation multiples to new highs and pressing yields to recent lows.After the guidance raise, the stock made a big reversal on Tuesday going from a high of over $263 to a low of $252 due to concerns regarding the F-35 fighter jet program. Is this a signal to avoid the stock?Depressed YieldsAlong with the Q2 report, Lockheed Martin raised the EPS guidance to a midpoint of $12.30. The number far exceeds the analyst estimates of $11.84. Note though, the stock closed the day all the way at nearly $260.Beating quarterly analyst estimates are only one of many ways to value a stock. In this market, a solid dividend yield is highly valued by the market.In this case, Lockheed Martin has seen the yield shrink over the years to only 2.5% now. Considering the company pays an annual dividend rate of $6.60 per share, the payout ratio exceeds 50% providing limited upside for raising the dividend in the near term.The company is active in stock buybacks further limiting the upside potential of dividend hikes from the EPS bump. The dividend yield has declined from the attractive levels above 4% a few years back due to the huge gains in the stock over the last five years.LMT data by YChartsLockheed Martin even reduced the stock buyback big time compared to last Q2. The defense contractor only spent $501 million on stock buybacks during Q2 after paying $937 million last year. The quarterly amount used to repurchase shares fluctuates on a quarterly basis, but clearly Lockheed Martin didn't see a bargain stock during the quarter for a stock now worth $78 billion to spend a rather meaningless amount of $501 million.In essence, Lockheed Martin returned an annualized rate of 5% based on the Q2 levels. The market is full of large-cap stocks with net payout yields (net stock buyback yields plus dividend yields) of over 15%.Why Own Here?The market is clearly in love with utility, telecom, and defense stocks that pay consistent dividends. The question at this point is why an investor would want to own the stocks at these levels.Lockheed Martin trades at nearly 19x forward EPS estimates. Over the last five years, the stock offered the opportunity for a couple of years to buy the company at roughly 9x forward numbers.LMT PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsThe good question is why own the stock at these levels. The only reason to stay involved is momentum. One can argue from the data above that Lockheed Martin could lose 50% of its value and stay in the normal valuation range. On the flip side, it seems rather unlikely that the stock eventually trades at a higher multiple.TakeawayThe low interest rate environment is pushing people irrationally into a defense stock like Lockheed Martin at expanded multiples and lower yields. The current valuation is not justified by the fundamentals of the company. Investors will clearly get hurt eventually, but momentum could send the stock higher in the short term if the trading action wasn't a reversal signal today.The recommendation is to look for better opportunities in the market."

        The buyback rate has been reduced, which allowed Lockheed to repay $400M+ of its debt.
        Continuous share repurchases and lower interest expenses will allow Lockheed to continue to increase the dividend as the current payout ratio is just 40% of the adjusted free cash flow.
        I expect the dividend to be hiked to $2/quarter by the end of 2018 the latest.","IntroductionIt's now been a year since I had a look at Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and in the past 12 months the company has seen its share price increase by approximately 31%. That's an excellent performance, but not entirely unexpected as Lockheed's cash flows were very robust. I did initiate a small long position after the article and have been mulling over selling the stock and cashing up. Before making any rash decisions, I decided to wait for the H1 results and go from there.LMT data by YChartsCombing through the SEC filings - no red flagsLockheed remains one of the bigger companies out there as the company generated almost $13B in revenue in the second quarter of the year, a 10% increase compared to the first quarter and the same quarter in the previous financial year. The majority of this revenue increase was caused by the mission systems and training division, which almost singlehandedly took care of the total revenue increase.Source: SEC filingsHowever, despite the substantial 53% increase in the mission systems division revenue, the operating profit actually decreased by 23%, indicating Lockheed was working on some lower-margin operations. That beind said, the total operating profit did increase by 2% to $1.42B (thanks to a 41% increase of the information systems operating income despite the 5% revenue drop). Due to a lower tax rate (27.1% versus 30.8% last year), the quarterly net income increased by approximately 10% to $1.02B or $3.37 per share.So far, so good. Lockheed definitely had a good quarter (and semester), and the aggressive share buyback program has boosted the EPS by approximately 3% compared to the second quarter of last year. That's obviously very nice, but I'm also always very curious to see the EPS/FCFPS ratio to find out how much of the net income has been converted into hard dollars.Source: SEC filingsThe operating income in the first semester was $3.14B, and after taking the changes in Lockheed's working capital into consideration, the adjusted operating cash flow came in at $2.8B. As the capex remained quite low (at just 1.5% of the total revenue during those six months), Lockheed's adjusted free cash flow was $2.4B, or approximately $7.92 per share (based on 303 million shares). That's really good, as the free cash flow is substantially higher (20%+) than the net income.I was really worried about the share repurchase pace. Has this issue been resolved?Last year, Lockheed spent almost $1B on dividends in the first semester (the current dividend yield is approximately 2.55%), as well as $1.5B on buying back stock. That usually is a good move to increase the shareholder value of a company, but there were two reasons why I wasn't too keen on Lockheed Martin doing so. First of all, its total cash outflow to reward its shareholders was higher than the cash flow it generated, and secondly, Lockheed was about to commit to a multi-billion dollar acquisition of Sikorsky, and I would have been in favor of using the cash flow to fund the purchase rather than having to issue new debt.LMT Shares Outstanding data by YChartsThe situation has changed now, and of the $2.4B in adjusted free cash flow, Lockheed has now spent $1B on dividends and $1B on share buybacks, leaving $400M on the table which has been used to reduce its gross debt position.Source: annual report 2015And that's exactly how I would want a company to operate. It should take care of its shareholders (by paying a dividend and repurchasing stock), but it should also make sure its financial situation remains very healthy. Lockheed is now fitting that bill, as it repaid almost half a billion in debt during the first semester, reducing its net debt position to $13.5B (from $14.2B last year) thanks to the repayment and adding cash to its balance sheet that became available after working capital changes.Investment thesisI think (and hope) Lockheed will continue to slightly reduce its net debt, without forgetting to reward its shareholders by continuously buying back stock to increase both the earnings and free cash flow per share. Doing all three things simultaneously, Lockheed will unlock more value for its shareholders as a reduced share count and lower interest expenses will increase the free cash flow per share, paving the way for continuous dividend increases (even if the revenue doesn't increase anymore).Deleveraging the balance sheet will be key, although a net debt/EBITDA ratio of less than 2 is already very acceptable considering the robust cash flows and good visibility (the total value of the order book is almost $100B, or 2 years worth of revenue), but I would be happier if the ratio could be reduced further to 1.5.LMT Dividend Per Share (Quarterly) data by YChartsBased on the results in the first semester, Lockheed is currently trading at a free cash flow yield of slightly above 6%, which isn't expensive at all for, again, a company with robust cash flows and good earnings visibility. I won't sell my stock just yet, as I think a valuation of $300M could be justified based on the free cash flows. In fact, I might even add to my position should the share price fall below the $225-mark as the company might become an excellent dividend play. Should the company continue to repurchase shares at a rate of $2B per year, I expect Lockheed Martin to generate a FCF per share of $16 per share. A payout ratio of 50% would then result in an annual dividend of $8/share, or in excess of 3% based on the current share price (and more than 4% based on my average cost basis).Lockheed Martin still is a viable candidate to add to your dividend portfolio, but it might be wise to wait for a temporary weak moment to pick up (NYSE:MORE) stock."

(The green horizontal scale.)Figure 1(used with permission)The red vertical risk scale measures the average worst-case percentage price drawdowns seen during holding periods on the way to those upside price targets. Number [4] is Lockheed-Martin (NYSE:LMT), with the best reward-to-risk tradeoff of the bunch.Sure, if shoot-the-lights-out is your thing there are others with twice the upside. But none with less risk exposure.Let's see (Figure 2) what LMT price performance has been over the past 5 years.Figure 2source: blockdesk.comWhen you take each day of the past 5 years and measure how its price has changed (at CAGR rates) over the next 16 weeks and average them all together, including the interim weeks, the blue row is what you get. That's right, LMT trend-line growth has been at a CAGR of 25%+, no further analysis involved, just straight price history.Where the other rows come from is by knowing what the market-makers thought (at each day) their big-money clients were likely to do to LMT's coming prices. Not just as a single-point upside target, but as a range - up and down - of what could happen.Why they had to have an idea of that range is because they typically had to facilitate those big trade orders by putting firm capital at risk temporarily. Too smart to take the risk, either long or short, they hedge-protect the exposures. Too frugal to overpay for the price-change insurance, they want to have a good idea of the likely prospects.The hedge specifics tell what the likely coming price range looks like - in the cauldron of the derivatives markets, where the protection deals are negotiated. And the ranges often are not symmetrically related to the current price.That's where the row headers of RWD:RSK come from.Each row, as it steps away from the trendline blue row, includes only those price range forecasts with the more extreme balances between risk and reward. The payoff comes from picking times to act when better price prospects are at hand.Like now, indicated by the magenta numbers in the #BUYS count of such forecasts - or better - at the 5:1 row. The 223 prior forecasts with upside price change potentials 5 times as large as the downsides held to be likely are about one sixth of the 1256 measurable days of the past 5 years.That's a pretty big sample to draw conclusions from. It says that CAGRs of +35%-40% have been the typical price changes for LMT when these kinds of forecasts were seen. The bright white numbers out at the 40+ week holding periods indicate that their difference from the +27% blue trend CAGRs are statistically significant, not simply an accident of data peculiarities.Big payoff prospects. But how likely are they to come to your pocket? Figure 3 tells what percent of the measurable forecasts from Figure 2 produced profits.Figure 3source: blockdesk.comNothing in life (but death and taxes) is certain, including big Win Odds. But having 9 out of 10 chances is a lot better than the market's typical coin-flip odds, and even better than LMT's trend-line 6 out of 8 to 8 out of 10.ConclusionKeep it simple. There are dog stocks and good ones. There are better times and worse ones to buy the good stocks. There are folks who know when those better times are.To them, now looks like a pretty good time to be buying LMT. But it's your capital to be at risk, so you decide.

As a reward for their efforts, our campus outreach team invited the winners of these nationwide collegiate stock pitch competitions to convene in New York City for Seeking Alpha's First Annual Ultimate Competition - and the students certainly did not disappoint!  Although many more stock pitch competitions were made possible through Seeking Alpha, nine collegiate teams were represented at the first annual competition: Bentley University, Carnegie Mellon University, Columbia University, Fordham University, Georgetown University, Northeastern University, Texas A&M, University of Maryland and the University of Texas (Austin). Of course, a competition would not be complete without a group of judges, and ten top-notch investment professionals willingly volunteered their Saturday afternoon to hear and evaluate each team’s performance. The following individuals served on our panel of judges, and their advice and service must be commended: Kristina Cibor (Goldman Sachs), Ian Clark (Dichotomy Capital), Jeffrey Fischer (Seeking Alpha), Nikhil Jog (Kedar Capital), John Leonard (Seeking Alpha), Joe Mazzella (Goldman Sachs), Joe McCann (Slingshot Insights), Neil Mehta (Goldman Sachs), Johannes Salim (Quanam Capital), and Michael Taylor (Seeking Alpha).  The day consisted of a preliminary round for each school, where the students presented their broad, 30,000-foot view for one long or short idea. After each school presented, the judges used scorecards with a variety of detailed criteria in order to determine which three schools would be presenting in the final round. The top three teams were then given 25 minutes to present their 100-foot view of their long or short idea to the judges. Cash prizes were awarded to the top three winners: the first place team was awarded $3,000; second place $2,000; and third place $1,000.  Overall the event was a culmination of intricately researched stock ideas from some very talented and highly intelligent students, mixed with some invaluable analysis and advice on the part of our judges.

This chart, along with all of the charts included in this article, as well as the detail behind the graphics, can be found here.The four panels above explain the company's historical corporate performance and valuation levels plus consensus estimates for forecast years as well as what the market is currently pricing in, in terms of expectations for profitability and growth.This analysis uses Uniform Adjusted Financial Reporting Standards (UAFRS) metrics, or adjusted metrics, which remove accounting distortions found in GAAP and IFRS to reveal the true economic profitability of a firm. This allows us to better understand the real historic economic profitability of a firm as well as allows for better comparability between peers. To better understand UAFRS, please refer to our explanation here.The problem with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is that they create inconsistencies when comparing one company to another, and when comparing a company to itself from year to year. By using Uniform Adjusted Financial Reporting Standards, we aim to remove the financial statement distortions and miscategorizations of GAAP. Some of these can be automated through consistently applied formulas; however, many must be made manually. Manual adjustments that cannot be automated include mergers and acquisitions accounting, special charges, business impairments, and others. The practice of creating consistent, apples-to-apples comparable measures of financial performance is often considered either tedious or overly complex by even seasoned financial analysts.Under GAAP, the as-reported financial statements and financial ratios of LMT do not reflect economic reality. The traditional ROA computation understates the company's profitability by incorrectly including certain items. The distortion of both profitability measures and valuation metrics of LMT are primarily driven by the inclusion of the firm's goodwill ($13.6bn), which inflates the firm's asset base, and by incorrectly expensing R&D ($839mn) and operating leases ($256mn) rather than treating them as part of the company's investments.After adjusting for similar issues and a host of other GAAP-based miscategorizations with UAFRS, Valens calculates LMT's UAFRS-based Return on Assets as 16% in 2015. In contrast, most financial databases show a traditional ROA of only 8%. Additionally, our analysis shows that LMT has an UAFRS-based P/E of 23.6x, compared to the firm's traditional forward P/E at 16.6x. The profitability of LMT's operations and their equity's true value are therefore not what traditional metrics originally indicate.Adjusted Return on Assets - ROA'The top panel of the chart shows the firm's UAFRS-based ROA (a.k.a. ROA', or ROA Prime). This measure is comparable from year to year and across peers as it utilizes UAFRS, which ""clean up"" the aforementioned GAAP accounting issues to provide consistent analysis.Lockheed Martin's Adjusted ROA was 16% in 2015. This is not only +2x the U.S. average cost of capital, it is also twice that of the traditional 8% ROA being reported for the firm. The spread between LMT's Adjusted ROA and its traditional ROA is driven by an understatement in the company's Adjusted Earnings From Operations (the numerator, Earnings'), and an overstatement of their Adjusted Total Operating Assets (the denominator, Asset').Earnings are understated because the traditional calculation of net income does not recognize R&D expenses ($839mn) and operating leases ($256mn) as part of the company's operating investments. The incorrect deduction of these items makes it near-impossible to objectively compare the firm to its peers and even to its own historical performance. Our adjustments resolve the accounting issues between the expensing and capitalization of certain expenses.Furthermore, by adjusting for the firm's goodwill of $13.6bn with UAFRS, the returns earned by LMT through its operations can be identified. This adjustment provides better investment analysis because it separates the firm's profitability into: 1) organic Adjusted ROA, which indicates how well management executes the business, and 2) acquisitive Adjusted ROA, which shows how well management does when they acquire a business.With everything considered, LMT appears to be far more profitable than what traditional metrics might suggest. That is a major difference in context and concept for evaluating the firm's situation.Growth in Adjusted Business Assets - A'In the second panel of the chart, Asset' growth stands for ""Asset Prime Growth"" (or UAFRS-based Asset Growth) and is the real annual growth rate of the cleaned-up UAFRS adjusted asset base of the company. This metric shows the management team's propensity to reinvest or divest over time. When viewed in context of the Adjusted ROA, the growth rate explains a lot about management's intended strategies and even performance incentives.LMT's Adjusted Asset growth has been volatile over the last decade. After their Adjusted Assets shrunk by 1% in 2007, growth ramped to 17% in 2008. Their Adjusted Asset growth then slowed to 2% in 2009 before shrinking by 3% in 2010 following the divestiture of Pacific Architects and Engineers and a majority of their Enterprise Integration Group.LMT's Adjusted Asset base then grew by 4% in 2011 and 3% in 2012, before once again shrinking by 2% in 2013 and 7% in 2014 due to decreased operating lease investment, as well as a decrease in cash following their acquisition of Systems Made Simple, Zeta Associates, and Industrial Defender (tech companies that mostly contributed goodwill and other intangibles). Finally, their Adjusted Asset base grew 11% in 2015 with their $9.0bn acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft from United Technologies Corporation.Valuation Relative to Adjusted Assets - V/A'The third panel shows the Adjusted Value to Assets ratio (V/A'), a UAFRS Price-to-Book metric that compares the Adjusted Enterprise Value (V') of the company to its Adjusted Asset level (A'). The Adjusted Enterprise Value is the market capitalization of the company plus the total debt of the company, including off-balance sheet debt, and less excess cash (or non-operating cash balances). Meanwhile, the Adjusted Asset level reflects the total operating assets of the firm, utilizing UAFRS to adjust for problematic accounting standards for reporting of the balance sheet. The Adjusted Asset level is the same as the denominator of the Adjusted Return on Assets calculation and the Adjusted Asset growth panel.LMT is trading at the peak of historical valuations relative to asset values with an Adjusted Value to Assets ratio of 3.7x, though much lower than the firm's traditional 22.2x P/B. The classic P/B figure is distorted because the traditional calculation utilizes the firm's book equity value as the denominator, as opposed to the total operating assets of the company. In the case of LMT, the traditional P/B multiple appears higher than it should be because of the firm's significant accumulated other comprehensive income, which artificially shrinks their equity base. By looking instead at the company's entire asset base, as opposed to the book equity value, which can be distorted by the way management chooses to account for underfunded pensions, Valens is able to get a clearer picture of real valuations.However, even though traditional metrics are overstating the firm's valuation relative to assets, this does not imply that LMT is cheap. Considering that the firm's Adjusted ROA of 16% warrants a V/A' closer to 2.5x, the firm's V/A' of 3.7x indicates that the market may be overvaluing the firm's equity relative to its assets.Valuation Relative to Adjusted Earnings - V/E'In the fourth panel, we have another perspective of valuation to help triangulate the market's embedded expectations for company performance. We always want to know what is ""priced in"" to the stock price. In this case, Valens evaluates the Adjusted Enterprise Value (V') of the firm relative to their expected Adjusted Earnings (E') for the next year. Adjusted Earnings are earnings resulting from the company's core business operations, regardless of how it is financed, and adjusted to its current dollar value. This is adjusted to eliminate accounting distortions and shenanigans, and to enhance comparability across different companies, industries and geographies, to determine potential mispricings. The Adjusted Enterprise Value (V') numerator is the same as that in the Adjusted Value to Assets ratio.LMT's as-reported forward P/E is at 16.6x, making their equity appear fairly valued (or even slightly undervalued) by the market. However, our analysis finds that LMT is trading at the peak of historical valuations with an Adjusted Value to Earnings ratio of 23.6x. Considering that LMT is already trading toward the high end of historical valuations, their stock may not be as cheap as markets perceive.ConclusionAs-reported financial statement information and financial ratios, which make up most of the publicly available financial databases, do not consider the extent to which distortions, miscategorizations, and misclassifications cause as-reported financial statements to depart from economic reality. Even the venerable ""statement of cash flaws"" - pun intended - is horribly distorted, as many items in the statement of cash flows are actually non-cash related. What is deemed cash flow from operations, investing, and financing activities are inconsistently booked from company to company and even just from year-to-year at an individual company. The distortions are material and directionally changing, and the mis-measurements that result are decision-changing issues.A far better picture of the economic reality of Lockheed Martin Corporation can be seen once those distortions are removed with Uniform Adjusted Financial Reporting Standards. The firm is generating returns two times what most financial databases report. However, adjusted valuations indicate that LMT's stock price may not be as cheap as traditional valuations indicate. With that context of corporate performance and market valuation, we have a far better means for evaluating LMT's stock price prospects.Our Chief Investment Strategist, Joel Litman, chairs the Valens Equities and Credit Research Committees, which are responsible for this article along with the lead analyst, Rafael Formoso.

This combination of endogenous diversification and exogenous increase in demand creates a viable argument to assure the stability and sustainable growth of LMT in the financial markets.LMT is one of the biggest military contractors in the world, and its economic activity is highly correlated with the adjudication of defense contracts by the United States of America government; nevertheless, the company is aiming to benefit from official military programs and diversify into other advanced technology sectors such as civilian supersonic aircraft, aerospace industry, and laser/supersonic technologies.As LMT CEO Marillyn Hewson recently mentioned:Now, LMT has the technology to start delivering beyond the illustrations on a computer screen or drawing board. The company could build a hypersonic demonstrator aircraft the size of an F-22 stealth fighter for less than $1 billion, which is pocket-change for military programs nowadays.Source: Bloomberg as of December 31, 2016LMT relies on the U.S. defense budget, which is certainly aiming for expansion considering the asymmetric and increasingly dangerous threats in the international arena. Conventional weapon arsenals are not enough to combat terrorism; therefore, the U.S. Department of Defense is relying on companies such as LMT to introduce new and less conventional weapons and vehicles to confront the global threat of terrorism that is increasingly affecting the world, especially the Western nations.The chart above shows the bidirectional dependency between corporations such as LMT and the U.S. Department of Defense, showing a substantial growth in dividends as global threats increase and the United States government increases its involvement whether it is direct through military mission or indirect through military aid. As described by George Schneider in his 2015 article ""Retirement FrontlLne: Investing In The Fight Against Terrorism Alongside Defense Contractors For Growing Dividends,"" corporations such as LMT are making lemonade out of lemons.Even though the company focuses mainly in military aircraft and other conventional weapons manufacturing, there is a recent shift, where it is starting to use supersonic technology to rescue and re-introduce the supersonic civilian aircraft technology abandoned in the early 2000s by the French company Concorde. It is estimated that LMT has invested close to $2 billion in the design and innovation of this new aircraft that would not only just reduce the air time, but will also increase the environmental sustainability as result of its low consumption of fossil fuel and high dependency on solar energy and other renewable sources.Furthermore, the company is highly invested in the aerospace industry, being as well one of the most important suppliers of NASA - in this area, LMT is expecting to be the first company to create the first aircraft to transport civilians to the space as part of a pilot project encouraged by NASA by 2040. Also, Lockheed is a main protagonist in the development of the Exploration Mission-1 (EM-1) on Mars. During Exploration Mission-1, Orion will travel thousands of miles beyond the moon over the course of about three weeks. To get ready for that mission, a full-size test version of Orion's service module provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) will be tested at NASA's Plum Brook Station in Sandusky, Ohio. Testing of the service module begins in early 2016, creating a positive expectation on LMT's full incursion on aerospace missions.Macroeconomic AnalysisSource: BloombergWeaker global growth and financial market turmoil drove the U.S. Federal Reserve's (""the Fed"") decision to leave the range for its target funds rate unchanged at 0.25% at its latest meeting on March 15-16, 2016, while reducing the number of projected hike for this year from four - projected in the December meeting - to two. The Fed also sounded cautious as to when the next rate hike will be, providing no clear guidance of when to expect the next one. The latest labor reports, which can be a significant source of volatility, came in solid in February after a softer announcement in January that warned about potential danger in markets throughout the first two months of the year. The report, in essence, puts to rest concerns about job growth deceleration and unemployment that had clouded the market.A slow growth in global production has driven oil - and other commodity - prices since late-February and throughout March as a tentative freeze - or slowing - in global production by both OPEC and non-OPEC is within reach. China's economy continues its noticeable deceleration as it continues to shift from a manufacturing economy to a service-oriented one, with ""industrial"" jobs shifting to other Asian economies that have lower labor costs such as India and the Philippines. Other commodities, such as iron and gold (after Fed didn't rate hikes), have posted strong gains in recent weeks as the market has changed its perception on the Chinese economic data. For the purpose of this article as of March 22, 2016, it is a good place to be in terms of purchasing stocks with the S&P 500 posting roughly 7% gains in the past month. This is good news for LMT as equity markets are rallying. Within LMT's overlapping sector, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up approximately 7%, and this trend is expected to continue into the next week and throughout the year (Source: WSJ Market Data Center).Financial AnalysisSource: BloombergSource: Bloomberg as of March 22, 2016As investors continue to have an appetite for equity markets and LMT continues to post strong numbers in its next quarterly presentation in mid-April - which it will - the company will continue to boost its price and its liquidity. LMT is trading at an all-time high due to its exceptional financial position. Among its many attractive characteristics is the growth trend that the company has seen since the past two years. Orders received, which are a driver of the company's financial performance, have increased from $48,799 million in 2011 to $82,600 million in 2013 to $99,600 million at year-end 2016, which consequently boosted the company's revenue and income. Although the increase is not huge, it is steady, and considering that 2014 was the year that the U.S. - main source of revenue for the company - invested the least in the past decade as a percentage of its GDP in the military, we believe that the key statistic is underplayed and isn't making as big of an effect as it should on the stock price. It is understandable in nature, as speculative markets tend to be inefficient, but studying key trends is vital to gaining insight into the company's real performance. As the world continues its fight against terrorism, we expect these figures to grow consistently throughout the next 2-3 years - especially with a Republican President - giving LMT increased prospective future orders, prospective cash flows and the ability to quickly turn over its increasing order backlog.Source: BloombergIn addition to this, we believe the company is looking for opportunities that allow it to expand its project horizon - including its acquisition in November 2015. In order to execute the transaction, LMT, which is rated Baa1 by Moody's, BBB+ by S&P and BBB+ by Fitch, issued Notes in the international debt capital markets in order to fund its acquisition of United Technologies' (NYSE:UTX) Sikorsky Aircraft Unit for ~$9 billion. This move was the largest acquisition since the company bought Martin Marietta Corp. for about $10 billion 20 years ago and a very bold strategic move by CEO Marilyn Hewson. Sikorsky Aircraft is the U.S.'s largest helicopter supplier, and while this could create conflicts of interest with the government - because of the elimination of competition - we believe it to be ultimately beneficial as it remains the number one provider of military technology to the U.S. institutions. This acquisition not only provides access into the helicopter sector for LMT as it did not previously produce them, but it also allows the management to shed or sell less profitable business units. Namely, the issuance into the debt capital markets should not be a problem for LMT as it has more than enough in its reserve account to cover both interest payments and the principal of its bonds - which also should be aided by the Fed keeping rates still in March. We expect the long-term debt to be partially offset by the continued increase in sales as well as the boost from the acquired helicopter business unit.Relative Value UniverseAs we compare LMT to other peers in the industry, we can observe the relative value of the company; keep in mind that Lockheed is the largest company of its kind and has exclusive contracts to the government. We have chosen a few key competitors and their respective profitability ratios as a measure for comparison:Source: BloombergLMT features some of the best and most improved ratios in the industry within the past five years, and these are still going strong. Specially, when considering the order backlog that the company has yet to satisfy, which is offset by the increase in employees and positive working capital LMT has achieved since year-end 2014. Please note that 12-month sales growth is around mid-table when compared to the rest of the industry. These are not recognized as revenue, but are already executed contracts that have yet to be converted into sales in future periods (Source: LMT Annual Report). As of December 31, 2015, LMT expected ~$43bn or 43% of backlog would be transformed into sales throughout 2016.DCF ValuationAfter considering all of the aforementioned variables, our discounted cash flow model yielded the current intrinsic value of the stock at ~$248 per share, which is ~$28 or 12.80% less than it is trading at today, March 29, 2016. The DCF model takes into consideration all future cash flows at present value as well as a discount rate determined by the Capital Asset Pricing Model (""CAPM""), which we estimated to be between 10% and 12%, as well as our revenue growth projections. In addition to this, we are also awarding LMT a positive outlook for the foreseeable future with our stock price projections at $275 (or +24.6%) by Q4 2016.ConclusionThe financial success of Lockheed Martin relies on the diversification of technologies in the long-lasting love story with the U.S. Department of Defense and both the organically growing business and the redefined worldwide scenery. It is true that innovation and new waves of technological spirals will increase the profile of LMT as a multinational corporation; nonetheless, it is military spending in countries such as the United States and the emergence of new, asymmetric warfare threats that upswing the value of corporations as LMT where transparency, innovation and historical leadership create a perfect combination for national and financial security."

Yet recently comments from readers on my Honeywell (NYSE:HON) vs. United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) and Altria (NYSE:MO) articles have asked my opinion about one company in particular: Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT).Lockheed Martin, I must admit, has not featured on my investment radar to date. Yet this was for no more specific reason than it had just not been subject to any analysis by me either at the superficial or in-depth level. Here I plan to change that.Lockheed Martin is going to pass through my five free cash flow (that is, FCF) tests.* These tests form the first steps in my analysis of a company. Although far from exhaustive, it gives me a good indication of its competitive advantages, its FCF health and efficiency as well as the debt and dividend position. Fair value based on FCF alone is also calculated.These tests merely mark the first step in what may develop into a more thorough analysis of the business in the future. So let's get started.A Little About Lockheed MartinFirst, let's take a little look into what Lockheed Martin actually does.Lockheed Martin is, of course, most famous for its aeronautic products such as the current F-35 fighter (though I know it better from its Hercules transport aircraft). Aeronautics compose over a third of its total revenues:Yet, as can be seen, it is also involved in a variety of other areas, which largely all fall within the defense industry.US government remains, unsurprisingly, by far the largest customer for the business. Over three-quarters of all revenue comes from governmental coffers:Lockheed Martin therefore operates in an industry with high barriers to entry due to the complex nature of the products they manufacturer. Lockheed Martin also benefits from the equally high barriers to entry caused by its close relationship to its main customer (the US government). For investors, this sort of economic moat is a welcome sight.Let's now turn to how Lockheed Martin performs against my FCF tests.1: Positive Free Cash FlowSimple one to start. I look for the company to have produced positive cash flow for all of the last five years. Lockheed Martin manages this (just):Lockheed Martin's OCF (operating cash flow) seems incredibly variable. Not quite such a welcome sight for an investor. Why? Well, put simply, it is due to the nature of its business.Let's take 2012 as an example. 2012's hefty OCF drop was caused by changes in working capital, payment timings, and pension payments. Lockheed Martin's 2012 annual report explains that:This is important as it is a common distortion for companies like Lockheed Martin. The big-contract-heavy nature of Lockheed Martin's business means that changes in working capital can often be quite sizeable. In 2012 this was compounded by additional $1.1 billion payments related to pension payments.Such variations are common for Lockheed Martin (""other"" is mostly, though not exclusively, related to pension-related effects):Ordinarily, I include such cash matters in the final FCF figure. Yet Lockheed Martin's variations are extreme enough to warrant adjusted figures to be introduced. After all, we want to see what the underlying cash flow earnings actually are more than just specific cash events in its recent history. Reintroducing these into the OCF figures offers us a new FCF history:Doing this provides us with a less volatile set of FCF figures which, I believe, better reflects Lockheed Martin's genuine cash flow generation. This will be the cash flow data that I will be using for the rest of the article.Nonetheless, with or without the adjustments, Lockheed Martin has opened with a solid PASS.2: CROIC: Cash Return on Invested CapitalThe CROIC (cash return on invested capital) gives us an idea of how much FCF is generated for all invested capital (that is, total debt and shareholders' equity). What I look for here is a CROIC of 10% or more. Such a CROIC would mean that for each $100 of invested capital the company produced $10 in FCF.So how does Lockheed Martin do? Very well indeed:Over the five-year period, it has averaged a CROIC of over 38%. Returning over $38 for every $100 invested is very impressive indeed. Yet this is not overwhelmingly surprising. Lockheed Martin's products attract high prices and the complicated nature of their design and construction means that it has very high barriers to entry. Nonetheless, this is still an impressive result.Again, we have to throw Lockheed Martin a comfortable PASS here.3: FCF to Debt RatioDebt levels are, in part, integrated into the CROIC calculations (high debt would mean a lower CROIC). Yet here I focus specifically on debt levels.Until 2015 debt levels had remained fairly flat. In early November 2015, Lockheed Martin closed its $9 billion Sikorsky acquisition. The Sikorsky deal resulted in debt-levels leaping up significantly in 2015, however:What I really care about, however, is the FCF/Debt ratio. This tells us how well covered by FCF the total debt at the company is. My target is 25% or more. In theory this means they could repay their entire debt load in four years just by using FCF. Does Lockheed Martin cross that particular threshold? Let's see:Generally, Lockheed Martin has remained well above my 25% target. Yet in 2015 the Sikorsky deal saw them drop just below this at 22.85%.So what to do? Should we consider Lockheed Martin a pass or fail here? I think we should mark it as a pass. Why? First of all because the average FCF/Debt ratio is considerably above the 25% target. Second, the Sikorsky purchase (closed on 6 November) had little time to contribute much cash flow to the company before the end of the financial year (31 December).Future cash flows could be boosted by between $250 and $600 million dollars (according to operating income figures for recent years when Sikorsky was owned by United Technologies). Full cash flow contribution and/or a modest reduction in debt levels will see Lockheed Martin again comfortably above the 25% target.As a result, I give Lockheed Martin a de facto PASS.4: FCF YieldNext is the matter of the yield. Following my FCF focus, I utilize the FCF yield here. The FCF yield is the dividend yield the stock would provide an investor if the entirety of the company's FCF was distributed as a dividend.All I look for here is a yield above 3.5% and a FCF payout ratio below 75%. So how does Lockheed Martin do here? Very well indeed, in fact:With a FCF yield of nearly 6.4%, Lockheed Martin is easily ahead of my 3.5%. With a historic dividend yield of over 2.8%, it is also fairly generous right now while still only paying out under 45% of FCF to produce this.All in all, this means another comfortable PASS.5: FCF ValuationFinally we come to the valuation test. Here I first predict the FCF at Lockheed Martin for the next two year. Taking the consensus revenue predictions for the next two years, I multiply this by my predicted FCF/Revenue ratios for each year.I calculate my FCF/Revenue figure by taking the ratio in 2015 (7.6%) and adjusting this by the growth or shrinkage in this ratio over the last three years using a three-year moving average. Doing so provides us with predicted FCF figures of $3.861 and $3.936 billion this year and next.These FCF predictions are then averaged and multiplied by the average enterprise value to FCF multiple Lockheed Martin has attracted over the last five years:Lockheed Martin has attracted an EV/FCF average of 14.68 over that time period. My FCF fair value is therefore: $189. Lockheed Martin currently trades at over $216 suggesting that it is about 15% above my fair value.Lockheed Martin therefore has to chalk up its first FAIL here.ConclusionLockheed Martin did very well against my FCF tests here. It passed all but my valuation test. I was very impressed by the company during the process of reviewing it. Consequently, it has certainly earned a place on my main watchlist.Would I invest today? No, probably not. It is clearly a high-quality operation with a strong economic moat. Yet it seems to be rather overvalued compared to its historic FCF valuation.The Sikorsky deal I would also like to see ""bed down"" a little before opening a position. Operating margins in the segment had varied greatly under United Technologies (the average was around the 10% mark, but 2014 saw margins under 3%). How much operating cash flow it contributes is, as yet, unclear. More clarity with regards to the speed at which debt is paid down and Sikorsky is able to contribute cash to Lockheed Martin's total would be preferred.That being said, my FCF tests have shown that the company is an excellent business in fantastic health. Should it drop down to around my FCF fair value I would be tempted to open a modest ""pilot"" position. In the meantime, I feel very happy to include Lockheed Martin on my main watchlist with a view to doing a fuller analysis of the business in the future.Notes* In this article, I use free cash flow as calculated by subtracting capital expenditure from operating cash flow.Unless otherwise stated, all graphs and tables and the calculations contained within them were created by the author.

3937266,99196,2016-02-27T14:23:36-05:00,Lockheed shares are outperforming the S&P 500 YTD.The business is fairly valued near $225.The F-35 narrative remains a risk to future stock performance.,"2016 LandscapeThe 2016 landscape for Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) is driven by a number of factors. 2016 will be focused on building profitability leading into an election and returning nearly all free cash flow to shareholders and cutting costs. It aligns with my investment goals of capital appreciation through dividend growth and share price appreciation. Lockheed Martin's future looks bright as their dividend continues to grow at an 18% annualized rate when calculated over the last 5 years. They return tremendous capital to shareholders through repurchasing $3.1 billion common stock in 2015 and approving an additional $3 billion in repurchase power for 2016 on top of the remaining $3.6 billion authorization. They anticipate getting the share count below 300 million outstanding by 2017.Remarkable performance during January sell-offThe stock has been a safe haven during the January sell-off. The recent performance of LMT stock during the month of January shows shareholder belief in the execution of the boards plan to cut costs to grow profitability and returning capital to shareholders. Since January 1st Lockheed has outperformed the S&P 500 by 6% and is near breakeven for the year at -.8% YTD.A contributing factor to Lockheed's stellar performance is because in times of economic turmoil national defense budgets hold relatively steady. The DOD budget for fiscal 16 has been finalized at $605 billion, an increase of $9 billion from 2015. Another factor easing the minds of shareholders is Lockheed has reduced their reliance on US arms sales by expanding their international sales exposure to 25% of total revenue by focusing on delivering their THADD missiles, NATO F-35's and Littoral combat ships.Looking at the businessThe delivery of 53 F-35's in 2015 and the Sikorsky acquisition building sales backlog to $100 billion from $80 billion have Lockheed's business looking bright. They plan to focus on expanding margins in F-35 production by getting out of the LRIP phase of production and delivering more planes to the military. Their sales are expected to be $50.4 billion for 2016 and 50.7 billion in 2017, and that is flat YOY when factoring in the Sikorsky acquisition and ISGS divestiture through the Reverse Morris transaction. GAAP EPS for 2016 and 2017 is expected to be in the range of $11.90 per share and $13.30. This EPS growth is achieved through a reduced share count, cost savings and margin improvement. If I project out these earnings I anticipate another dividend raise in 2017 to $1.80 quarterly or $7.20 annually. The growth of the earnings is financially engineered and these get distributed to shareholders in a proportional amount, meaning less shares equals more money distributed to you and me. A stagnant top line coupled with an increasing bottom line is overcome by the board's commitment to return all excess cash to shareholders and leaves me feeling confident good times lie ahead.ValuationPrice target: $225Wall Street will look at LMT and observe it isn't seeing organic top line growth and is growing the bottom line by financial engineering. The stock has run up in anticipation of the F-35 production ramp and there remains few near term catalysts to propel the stock higher. The loss of the Bomber and JLTV contracts to Northrup Grumman (NYSE: NOC) and Oshkosh (NYSE: OSK) have stunted sales growth and the stock is trading near fair value. The ratios as follows:EV/SalesLMT currently has an EV/Sales Ratio 1.76 in line with its peers of Raytheon (NYSE: RTN) 1.76 and Northrup Grumman 1.65 showing the market gives a higher multiple for the predictability of sales and operational excellence.P/E Ratio - LMT, RTN, NOC and BAWhen it comes to price to earnings they have the second highest multiple at around 18, indicating the market is either overvaluing their shares or giving credit for the future cashflows of the business. I choose the latter because of the $100 billion in backlog and capital return to shareholders. The defense industry multiple is around 18 which is higher than the historical average around 15 and can be explained by the record size of contracts being awarded.F-35 Lightning RodSome risks to Lockheed over the next couple of years are the cost of the F-35 program and enemy stealth detection capabilities. With the program life expected to be 50+ years and total cost of the program to exceed $1 trillion, these numbers are highly dependent on the F-35 maintaining technological superiority. If the Pentagon discovers Russia or China develops technology to render the stealth capabilities useless it will more than likely shrink the life of the F-35 program. The plane was marketed as a silent killer and if loses this distinction it could cause order reductions for the F-35 program.The development of the F-35 can be described as tumultuous at best from failing to meet LRIP deadlines, additional development costs for lines of code, and the infamous pilot ejection whiplash. These blunders have even brought discussions in the Pentagon of allocating dwindling defense budgets to the B3 Bomber. Fund re-appropriation can be overlooked because the military has sunk cost in the production process that they are finally starting to see decreasing production costs. While I find program cancellation a remote possibility, it seems a growing possibility because of the F-22 cancellation. The F-22 is an all-around better fighter aircraft and it falls into the same category as the F-35 of taking too long and costing too much to produce. Our northerly neighbor has even stated their intentions to back out of their F-35 orders, with Justin Tredeau the newly minted Prime Minister running on a platform of canceling the orders of F-35 planes, he claimed:Now I say to hell with Canada because other NATO nations are lining up, but this cancellation will cost Lockheed $49 billion on 65 F-35A jets. The 45 F-35's delivered in 2015 accounts for 20% FY 15 sales and are only expected to grow from here on. It is product concentration issue, meaning overall sales depend heavily on the strength of the program. Lockheed will have F-35 production at full capacity in 2019 by producing 150 -160 jets. I don't see a near term event that would shorten the F-35's operational life, yet there remains a possibility something could happen.Political Lightning RodThe F-35 A,B and C variants are the Pentagon's most expensive acquisition program and it may come under political pressures because of cost overruns to develop multi variants of the same jet. The Marines, Air force and Navy intended to reduce production costs by sharing the same air frame and the jets share only 35% of the same structural components. Statements like this become a political lightening rod and with the growing possibility of Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders becoming president, it wouldn't surprise me if they buckled to political pressures and pulled a Justin Tredeau by lobbying congress to reduce the number of planes produced and shorten the life of the program to 30-50 years.ConclusionLockheed is trading near fair value and are reliant on the F-35 program to maintain their valuation. The F-35 narrative has become repetitive and likely won't see any major cuts. The board remains committed to return record amounts of cash to shareholders and are exhibiting operational excellence. The stock has shown insulation from the major downturn in January proving shareholders are in for the long haul. For this reason, I would continue holding shares hoping management pulls a lever to create near term stock catalyst and I remain committed to reinvesting dividends in this exceptional defense company."

3920496,23757,2016-02-23T12:30:03-05:00,The new LCS ship program suffers from several serious flaws.The Navy's dual procurement path for the LCS will likely end with LMT declared the winner.Lockheed's export version of the LCS for Saudi Arabia provides a great template for future domestic and international orders.,"Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is one of the prime contractors for the US Navy's Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) (Freedom class) with Austal and General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) being the other prime contractor for the competing version, the Independence class (a/k/a the weird looking trimaran one). Right now, the US Navy has decided to simultaneously procure equal numbers of both classes of ships but we believe that eventually the dual procurement strategy will be stopped and Lockheed's Freedom class ship will be procured in greater numbers. Additionally we believe that Lockheed's version has much greater potential for international sales as well. Before we go into why, we have to understand a few things about the LCS.The Littoral Combat Ship or LCS was developed to replace and augment the Navy's Oliver Hazard Perry class frigates. It was envisioned that the LCS would serve as a flexible multi-role platform that could be used for a variety of missions, chief among which was combating the proliferation of small, fast attack craft among possible aggressor states. The LCS was designed to be cheap to build and cheap to crew and maintain. Unfortunately, as currently being procured by the US Navy, the ships are next to useless and suffer from three major flaws.No Long Range Standoff Surface Attack CapabilityThe LCS has no standoff surface attack capability other than whatever their two MH-60 helicopters can carry. The ships were originally going to use the XM501 NLOS-LS also referred to as Netfires PAM system but that was canceled. (Netfires LLC was the joint venture between Lockheed and Raytheon that was developing the missile and PAM stands for Precision Attack Munition.) The missile system would have been able to deliver a 15lb warhead out to 25 miles. Instead the Navy replaced it with… nothing.Newer versions of the LCS may carry either the Griffin missile system which has a 5 mile range and a 13lb warhead or a modified version of the AGM-114 Hellfire missile with a 5 mile range but larger 18lb warhead.To understand just how much of a problem this is take a look at the Chinese Type 022 patrol boat. It's a 220 ton (versus the 3500 ton LCS) boat which is armed with the C-802 anti-ship missile which has a range of 75 to 112 miles. North Korea and Iran also operate a number of patrol boats and fast attack craft armed with versions of the C-802 or the older Silkworm anti-ship missile system. The LCS is hopelessly outclassed by the very types of vessels it's meant to defend against.No Air Defense CapabilityPerhaps an even more glaring weakness of the LCS is that the ships have no air defense capability. The LCS is equipped with just one Mk-49 RIM-116 missile launcher for point defense (5.6mi range). This means that LCS ships would need to be deployed alongside other assets such as air-defense capable cruisers or destroyers if a theater had any serious airborne threats. Instead of being a smaller, cheaper, and easier to deploy ship the LCS becomes a burden by virtue of its need for an air defense capable escort. The need to be escorted almost everywhere makes the LCS more of a liability than an asset.Inadequate Crew SizeThe ships are crewed by just 50 sailors plus an aviation complement and whatever additional crew are added with the specific mission package(s) fitted with the ship. While the ships were designed to be highly automated and run by few people, other critical tasks still require significant manpower. There are many reports that there are simply not enough people on board to perform the necessary maintenance on the ships. Even more critically there are serious concerns that the ship's damage control would be severely compromised in a combat situation by the low crew levels. Indeed, a recent GAO report questioned the damage control capability of the LCS which such low crew levels.Lockheed Martin obviously realizes the limitations of the ship and has proposed numerous improvements. Starting with LCS-17 the US Navy has accepted some of the improvements. The new flight of ships will be designated FF and include upgraded armor, radar systems, countermeasures, and some increases in firepower. But the ships are still lacking.Enter Saudi Arabia. In October 2015 Saudi Arabia requested the sale of four modified Freedom class ships in a deal worth up to $11.25B. The modified ships will feature two 8 cell Mk 41 VLS systems which can carry 16 SM-2 or 62 ESSMs total, a 76MM main gun (compared to the LCS existing 57mm gun), Harpoon Block II anti-ship missiles, torpedoes, and the SeaRAM point defense system. The Aegis combat system was available but Saudi Arabia elected to use the TRS-4D AESA air search radar for cost reasons. If the sale goes through Lockheed will now have a fully functional, fully armed, ready to kick butt ship rolling off the slipway and ready to sell to other customers including the US Navy.We believe it's highly likely that the version of the LCS sold to the Saudis will eventually be the ship the US Navy procures. It's just too good to overlook and the with the Saudis bearing the cost of working out the kinks in the first few examples it will be a mature platform by the time the US Navy is ready to revisit its LCS procurement plans. It's going to get increasingly harder for the Navy to justify buying less effective versions of the LCS when there is a better cost effective version sitting there available for order.This wouldn't be the first time the Navy has ended up with the version of a ship designed originally for someone else. The ""Ayatollah class"" or Kidd class destroyers were heavily modified Spruance class destroyers originally designed for Iran. As with Saudi Arabia's version of the LCS, the Kidds were much more heavily armed with much greater air defense capability due to their intended multi use role in the Iranian Navy. Because of the Iranian Revolution the sale never went through and the Navy ended up buying the ships.What about the Independence class LCS produced by Austal and General Dynamics (NYSE:GD)? Where does that fit into everything? Well we think the competing design suffers from a few flaws that make it unlikely to be chosen by any international customers and also make it less appealing.First the Independence class has an all aluminum design (as opposed to the freedom class' steel hull/aluminum superstructure design). The all aluminum design makes the ship more susceptible to combat damage and less survivable. It's also been known to be more maintenance intensive and the Navy has had problems with electrolysis/galvanic corrosion damaging the hull necessitating significant repair work.Second, and perhaps most importantly is that the ships are not capable of accepting full length missiles if fitted with the Mk 41 VLS system. This means the ships would not be capable of carrying the SM-3 anti-ballistic missile interceptor and the tomahawk cruise missile and would instead be limited to just the SM-2 and ESSM missiles. This is not likely an issue for the US Navy as the LCS was never envisioned to provide ballistic missile defense or long range multi-role standoff attack capability. The issue would however be huge for international customers who would be looking at the ships to fulfill a much broader range of roles in their smaller navies.In Fiscal 2014 Lockheed had $45.6B in net sales. So, selling upgraded Freedom class ships at perhaps $450-$600M a pop (the per unit cost for the Saudi order is likely higher due to the inclusion of initial design and testing work which wouldn't be needed for subsequent orders) represents an opportunity that could have an appreciable effect on LMT's future. Indeed, the modified version of the LCS is going to be extremely competitive internationally due to its size, crew requirements, and price point. Indeed, the market for the Navy's backbone Arleigh Burke class destroyer is limited to just a few rich nations (Japan operates a class of ships based on the Arleigh Burke) due to the ship's cost. The Lockheed LCS is one of the first US Navy ships in a long time to have broad potential for export and represents yet another growth area for Lockheed in an era of stagnant (or slow growing) defense budgets."
3879366,98146,2016-02-09T13:50:13-05:00,Investors in Lockheed Martin may be concerned the F-35 will drag the company down.Cost overruns and setback after setback have plagued the project for years and media attention is negative.Fortunately for investors the program isn't going anywhere and will be a success for Lockheed.,"A very comprehensive article recently published on SA by SqueezeMetrics makes a very good case to be concerned about the future of Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) based largely off the F-35 program and the possibility of Democrats taking over Congress and the White House this year. While I can't argue with the short selling, increased leverage or threat to the share buyback they outlined which should be strongly considered by current and potential investors, I feel that their interpretation of the F-35 program and those pesky Democrats leaves much to be desired. By taking a look at how deep the F-35 project really goes and what happens to defense spending under Democrat controlled governments we can sleep a little easier at night with LMT and the other large defense companies.The media loves to hate the F-35, and for good reason. The program is one problem after another and is easy cannon-fodder for journalists already critical of the defense spending. Despite my stance that investors need not worry about the F-35, I'm critical of the overall program myself. From an investing standpoint though, the military and the US Government has left itself no choice but to press forward. Without even debating the merits of the program it is very clear this train has left the station and will not be returning. The F-35 program is much larger than a plane; it is a cottage industry in itself. Across the country air bases are being updated to accommodate the stealth fighter. Due to its advanced engines and sensors current repairs facilities do not meet the requirements to properly maintain them forcing the military to build depot-level facilities for maintenance, such as in Cherry Point, NC. The military has also invested heavily in the training of pilots for the new plane and for the mechanics and technicians necessary to maintain the craft. Those men and women in the military who previously maintained older aircraft are given the opportunity to laterally move into an F-35 maintenance military occupational specialty which many choosing this route due to the phasing out of the planes they used to maintain. Runways are being updated to accommodate the fifth generation fighter, tool kits are being replaced and updated, security measures aboard installations are being revamped and enhanced, starting to get the picture? With the F-35 we have passed the line of departure and there will be no retreat, we may need to stop and catch our breath at a rally point, but the ultimate mission will be accomplished no matter the cost.Still there may be issues that the plane just doesn't fly and isn't ready. I guess somebody should go ahead and tell that to the Marines in Yuma, AZ, who were the first to employ 10 operationally back in July of 2015. That number is now up to 17 at Yuma. The Commandant of the Marine Corps at the time, General ""Fighting Joe"" Dunford had this to say about the squadrons abilities with the F-35 JSF.It is worth noting that General Dunford is now the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and is no stranger to warfare. He outlines the missions that the F-35 JSF is capable of, what he doesn't state is that with that one plane they can effectively replace the F/A 18 Hornet, AV-8B Harrier and the EA-6B Prowler in the Marine Corps. Those planes have served their purposes very well but are becoming increasingly costly to maintain and keep in the air. For the Marines from a long-term cost-benefit analysis standpoint the F-35 is a no brainer, you can essentially have one-third the amount of squadrons and planes yet still accomplish the same missions. I guess the word to relate this to investors is the often-used ""synergies."" The ""synergies"" with this program will be accretive to the bottom line. With such an extensive list of capabilities comes an extensive list of possible problems. Every newly fielded piece of gear has issues and the more complex they are at their core the more complex the issues are. Now that the plane is flying in an operational capacity the issues can be fleshed out and dealt with much faster than in a testing only environment. Marines are an ideal group to be the first to deploy the craft, they typically function with much less available to them, are taught to rapidly adapt to the situation and just as rapidly to overcome the situation, they're also not slow to criticize something.With such a huge price tag for each plane it is only natural to next look at total defense spending. Many investors are nervous about what a Democrat controlled Federal Government could do to the US budget for defense spending. It is natural to think that the party who is known for their anti-war stance would shrink the defense budget, that turns out not to be the case.Defense spending doesn't really follow party lines; it follows war and conflict. In periods of increased conflict the defense spending naturally increases, after all you need more bullets and band-aids when fighting a war. Elected officials are not excited about lowering defense spending and then being blamed for flag-draped caskets being unloaded off of airplanes because they trimmed a few billion from the budget. They're also not in a rush to cut defense spending that could impact jobs for their constituents. The Congressional Budget Office anticipates flat defense spending regardless of which political party is in power through 2020 referencing the DOD Future Years Defense Program. The popular idea that Democrats spend less on defense than the more hawkish Republicans just is not the case. The argument could be made that Democrats tend to avoid conflict more than their Republican counterparts, but that is an argument for another day and one I simply don't care to enter into.While there may be concerns regarding LMT in the short-term as outlined by SqueezeMetrics, they should not be the F-35 program or what political party is in office. The F-35 is still going to take off regardless of the spending situation and in years to come the international orders will come in as they wish to streamline and update their current airpower. Every new platform takes years to fully implement, and nothing has been built with the capabilities of the F-35 so the learning curve is steep. Despite the concerns the plane is flying and our allies and enemies will soon witness the benefit of the aircraft. While the cost may be high we clearly see that the defense spending has little to do with which political party holds Congress or the White House and everything to do with conflicts across the globe. As we enter into a period of less ground combat in Iraq and Afghanistan defense spending will naturally taper off from their war-time highs but so will the budgetary needs of the defense contractors. Lockheed Martin still stands as a wonderful long-term investment, as do the other major defense contractors. As always I appreciate you reading and I look forward to the discussion in the comments. I wish you all the best of luck."

In other words; the company grows as the US military budget goes. Those heavy ties with the US Government are both a blessing (securing future revenues) and a curse (as it limits LMT's upside potential).Strong regulation around military defense projects, ridiculously high entry costs to enter this field and continuous R&D budget requirements make Lockheed Martin's business model well protected from the arrival of any new competitors.RatiosPrice to Earnings: 18.64Price to Free Cash Flow: 15.77Price to Book: 21.20Return on Equity: 114%RevenueRevenue Graph from YchartsRevenues have slowed down recently after an important increases since 2007.

Margin improvements are expected as the result of synergy between their aircraft division and the purchase of the helicopter maker.How LMT fares vs. My 7 Principles of InvestingWe all have our methods for analyzing a company. Over the years of trading, I've been through several stock research methodologies from various sources. This is how I came up with my 7 investing principles of dividend investing. Let's take a closer look at them.Source: YchartsPrinciple #1: High Dividend Yield Doesn't Equal High ReturnsMy first investment principle goes against many income seeking investors' rule: I try to avoid most companies with a dividend yield over 5%. Very few investments like this will be made in my case (you can read my case against high dividend yield here). The reason is simple; when a company pays a high dividend, it's because the market thinks it's a risky investment… or that the company has nothing else but a constant cash flow to offer its investors. However, high yield hardly come with dividend growth and this is what I am seeking most.Source: data from Ycharts.The stock yield wasn't interesting until recently when we consider the long history of the company. Starting in 2009, the company yield increased significantly due to an aggressive dividend growth policy. The stock price followed a strong uptrend during the same period, bringing the yield back to the 2.75-3.25% bracket. The company has definitely landed in the ""perfect bracket"" providing an interesting yield and not raising concerns around the stock's yield. LMT meets my 1st investing principle.Principle#2: Focus on Dividend GrowthMy second investing principle relates to dividend growth as being the most important metric of all. It doesn't only prove management's trust in the company's future but it is also a good sign of a sound business model. Over time, a dividend payment cannot be increased if the company is unable to increase its earnings. Steadily increasing earnings can't be derived from anything else but increasing revenue. Who doesn't want to own a company that shows rising revenues and earnings?Did you know that Lockheed Martin has posted a double digit dividend growth for the past twelve consecutive years? Management has made a clear statement over the past decade that investors will be rewarded through higher dividend payments and stock repurchases. Also, keep in mind that a company able to maintain a dividend yield around 3% with double digit dividend growth automatically leads to a great capital appreciation in your portfolio. Over the past 5 years, the dividend payment increased by 18.45% CAGR and the stock price went up by 175% total. LMT meets my 2nd investing principle.Principle #3: Find Sustainable Dividend Growth StocksPast dividend growth history is always interesting and tells you a lot about what happened with a company. As investors, we are more concerned about the future than the past, this is why it is important to find companies that will be able to sustain their dividend growth.Source: data from Ycharts.It is one thing to offer an incredible dividend growth rate, it's another to keep it going afterwards. LMT management has a clear focus on earnings growth and this is why they were able to keep the dividend payout ratio at a more than acceptable level. The payout ratio doubled during the past 10 years but the dividend payment increased by 450% during the same period. I guess we can ""forgive"" the company for letting the payout ratio drift higher.I also like the fact the cash payout ratio is relatively in line with the classic payout ratio. Here again, it's a good sign we are not facing accounting tricks to boost earnings but real cash is also being generating within the company's bank account. It is clear the company can sustain dividend growth in the upcoming years. However, I do not expect the company to keep its 18% CAGR forever. LMT meets my 3rd investing principle.Principle #4: The Business Model Ensure Future GrowthLockheed Martin business model relies on one of the most stable events in world history: war or threat of a war. There is and always has been a great need to defend ourselves and military budgets for countries like the US is not an option. Therefore, LMT's business is safe with 80% of their revenues coming from the US Government. On the other hand, it is true that their growth could be severely limited when the US Gov't decides to cut in their military budget. The budget sequestration requires a military budget cut of $1 billion by 2021.However, the current world situation opens the door to more international sales and even the need for the US to maintain (and probably increase) their military spending budget. Overall, the company benefits from a near monopoly when it comes to fighting aircraft production and LMT has also become the world's largest military helicopter maker with the purchase of Sikorsky aircraft. Their numerous years dealing with the US Government and impressive budgets protect LMT's economic moat from external competitors.What Lockheed Martin does with its cash?source: YchartsBesides heavy stock repurchases and dividend payment increases, Lockheed Martin also keep an eye on potential deals. Last year, they purchased the world's largest military helicopter maker in the hopes of synergy with their aeronautic division. This moves will not only boost the company's sales but should also bring more profit to the table. Since this was a $9 billion deal, the pill was still hard to swallow. More recently, LMT decided to spin their IT division with Leidos generating 1.8 billion in liquidity and 3.2 billion in equity in the new Leidos entity. LMT has a strong business model and meets my 4th investing principle.Principle #5: Buy When You Have Money in Hand - At The Right ValuationI think the perfect time to buy stocks is when you have money. Sleeping money is always a bad investment. However, it doesn't mean that you should buy everything you see because you have some savings put aside. There is valuation work to be done. In order to achieve this task, I will start by looking at how the stock market valued the stock over the past 10 years by looking at its PE ratio:Source: data from Ycharts.My first thought when I look a graphic like the above published is to think: ""wow, this stock is hitting a wall at any minute"". The company went from a PE ratio under 10 in 2008 to 19 recently. This seems a bit exaggerated. I understand the company is solid and pays a great dividend, but it seems to me that investors might be paying a little bit too much at first glance. However, I will use a second technique to determine the company's intrinsic value.I will use a double stage dividend discount model (NYSEARCA:DDM). The purpose is to be able to use a dividend growth rate for the first 10 years and another one afterward. For the first dividend growth rate, I will use a 10% rate. This is an aggressive number but the company posted an 18% CAGR over the past 5 years. Then, I will reduce it to 5%. I'm expecting more return from Lockheed in the upcoming years since the demand for defense material should increase. Here's the detail of my calculations:Source: Dividend Monk Toolkit Excel Calculation SpreadsheetUsing the dividend discount model, it seems that my first impression has been confirmed; the company is trading at a 10% premium. While this is a great dividend growth company, this might not be the right time to buy it. LMT doesn't meet my 5th investing principle.Principle #6: The Rationale Used to Buy is Also Used to SellI've found one of the biggest investors' struggles is to know when to buy and when to sell his holdings. I use a very simple, but very effective rule to overcome my emotions when it is the time to pull the trigger. My investment decisions are motivated by the fact that the company confirms or not my investment thesis. Once the reasons (my investment thesis) why I purchase shares of a company are not valid anymore, I sell and never look back.Investment thesisAn investment in Lockheed Martin right now is an investment in a strong dividend grower. The company enjoys the benefit of a close-to-be-called monopoly with its fighter aircraft. The future of LMT is somewhat tied to how well the F-35 is being developed.Current tension in many countries leads me to think that LMT will have other sales opportunities in the near future and it won't suffer from the budget sequestration as it should have a few years ago.The company's recent move to spin off its IT division because management sees more competition coming from Silicon Valley was not only a good decision business wise, but also in terms of cash flow management. This transaction enable the company to focus on its main area of business and the proceeds will ease the 8 billion debt contracted to buy Sikorsky.RisksOn the other hand, there are also some risks attached to LMT. The sequestration bill still hangs over LMT's head and it may put some serious brakes on their earrings (and eventually dividends) strong growth.The company is also stuck with a substantial pension plan to support. If the stock market would drop significantly, LMT would have to increase its participation to maintain their coverage ratio.Principle #7: Think Core, Think GrowthMy investing strategy is divided into two segments: the core portfolio built with strong & stable stocks meeting all our requirements. The second part is called the ""dividend growth stock addition"" where I may ignore one of the metrics mentioned in principles #1 to #5 for a greater upside potential (e.g. riskier pick as well).Having both segment helps me to categorize my investments into a ""conservative"" or ""core"" section or into a ""growth"" section. I then know exactly what to expect from it; a steady dividend payment or higher fluctuation with a great growth potential.While the company seems to be overvalued at the moment, there are growth factors that could lead LMT to an even higher price. The ever growing need for military defense equipment around the world and the company's recent purchase in the helicopter industry are two factors that could positively influence LMT's results in upcoming years. If this scenario happens as described, the dividend yield will not only continue to grow in the double digit range but the stock price will continue to reach new highs.For this reason, I consider LMT as a growth dividend stock.Final Thoughts on LMT - Buy, Hold or Sell?I do hold LMT at the moment in my portfolio and intend to keep it. However, I'm not sure it's the perfect time to enter in a new position. The stock has greatly outperformed the S&P 500 over the past 12 months and investors might want to wait a little to get a better entry point.Disclaimer: I hold LMT in my DividendStocksRock portfolios.

I also own PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) in rather nice size holdings, so it really was a duplication.PCP now belongs to Berkshire (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) and Warren Buffett. I had no real say to keep it.Questar (NYSE:STR) is a buyout by (NYSE:D) Dominion, for $25; I sold @ 24.98 sooner rather than later. Close enough for me, and I put the proceeds back into Dominion at about $68. A nice buy price, so I am pleased.New PurchasesI have already introduced HCN with a recent article about that purchase along with NHI. They are both healthcare eREITs and are dong extremely well. I remain very pleased.Some of the proceeds I put into Valero (NYSE:VLO). I soon decided I have enough energy exposure and wanted something to replace PCP in the industrial area. I also wanted something more defensive. VLO had been purchased at the end of February for $57.52. I sold it at $63.44, making a nice profit of ~10% on it in ~1 week, or about 2.5 years of dividends. So I am not too upset to let it go. I am hoping it will fall back down to the 4% yield or about $60 on the 2016 dividend of $2.40. I might own it again.Lockheed MartinI decided on Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). It has been a long lost love of mine and a dumb mistake I made in selling it a few years ago. I did write a blog about that mistake, which also included selling 3M (NYSE:MMM) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), all of them and all the shares. The lesson I learned is some stocks should just never be sold, at least ALL of the shares. Trimming is okay, but not often. Hold tight and think many times before even trimming.I am happy to announce they are ALL back now, LMT being the last purchase from that misadventure.From Yahoo Finance: Lockheed Martin Corporation, is a security and aerospace company. It engages in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, and sustainment of technology systems, products, and services worldwide. Here is a look at its latest venture, a cargo blimp for landing in difficult-to-access areas.The full-sized LMH-1 could have its first flight by late 2017, and it is expected to be in commercial service by the end of 2018. A single airship will cost $40 million. Cheap in comparison to other cargo aircraft for the most part, but that will be decided in the future.My shares in LMT were not cheap, but I will explain my reasoning for the purchase. I paid $214.68/ share for my entry position. I know, I know, that is not anywhere near fair value (FV).Morning Star has a FV of $193, and only 2 star hold rating on it with an A- credit rating. S&P rates it BBB+. I was really hoping for a $200 purchase price. I just decided it was a defensive stock and I wanted it. It has a 3.15% yield right now for my entry price. I don't know if I will see it at a lower price. I have before and hesitated. I have decided sometimes just starting a position is the best medicine. I now have $205 as my want price. I can easily wait and adjust that number as the year or years go by. The FAST graph shown reveals the potential of 17% earnings growth proposed. I think my purchase price can easily be grown up and into, with LMT soaring up up and away. It has an excellent 5-year dividend growth rate of 18.6% and 10-year DGR of 19.5%. The current dividend for 2015 was $6.15, which was a 12% increase from 2014. FG is projecting about a 10% raise for 2016 to $6.76. The Current payment is $1.65 quarterly or $6.60 without a raise and a yield of 3.1% for me.My yield at my purchase price using the old dividend is 2.9%. This would be a Chowder # of (18.6 + 2.9) = 21.5. It easily passes that hurdle for purchase. The yield will be 3.15% if FG is right.I am so pleased to own it now and am doing a happy dance about it.Snoopy the Charlie Brown dog does it best, but you get my feeling of being pleased.UNILEVER (NYSE:UL)From Yahoo Finance summary: Unilever PLC operates in the fast-moving consumer goods market in Africa, the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, and Middle East. The company operates through Personal Care, Foods, Refreshment, and Home Care segments.I purchased some Unilever for $43.25/ share as a starter position. Morningstar has a fair value of $44 and an A+ credit rating. It is also somewhat overpriced with a P/E of 22. I believe it deserves some kind of premium valuation for me with just starting a position. I do want to build the position in time. My yield is 3.3% on the 1.44 dividend for 2016, and 3% on the old dividend of $1.30. The 5-yr dividend growth rate is hard to determine using FG, as this stock chart suffers from the exchange rate issues with the UK.I did find this chart on the Investor website that states 8% per year dividend growth rate over the last 5 years, which is shown in the British pound.The 3.3% yield + 8% = 11.3% This is close enough to the Chowder rule of 12 to prompt me to make the purchase. I am, however, still hoping to add closer to $40 to build this position. The 5-year normal P/E is closer to 19, which would also indicate that price. The present P/E of 22 and current normal is ~ 21, giving me another reason to feel good about starting this position in a quality company, that I like.These are the final two added to my portfolio of 74 stocks for 2016. Barring no dividend cuts or disastrous happenings, all should be the same. I do admit if I find an outstanding bargain and I want it, I will be tempted, and I can never rule that out. VLO is on my radar and I just might get it, if it hits under $60 again. There is only one stock right now that I really really desire to own: NNN. I don't see it falling into my price range any time soon, so I can safely say:Happy Investing."

Lockheed Martin is well-positioned.Lockheed's free cash flow generating capacity is tremendous, and by comparison, it runs a rather capital-light operation.A former unit of United Technologies, Sikorsky Aircraft, is now a part of Lockheed Martin, and while we like the transaction, credit metrics will face pressure due to increased debt.Let's take a look at the firm's investment considerations as we attempt to uncover the drivers behind its Dividend Cushion ratio.","By The Valuentum TeamAcquisitive activity may threten the pace of Lockheed Martin's dividend growth--> Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is a global security and aerospace company that is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services.--> The evolving global security landscape dictates the need for powerful systems like the F-35 Lightning II, Littoral Combat Ship, integrated missile defense and advanced satellites. Lockheed Martin is well-positioned to meet the needs of governments across the globe.--> Lockheed Martin's business quality (an evaluation of our ValueCreation and ValueRisk ratings) ranks among the best of the firms in our coverage universe. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders with relatively stable operating results for the past few years, a combination we view very positively.--> Lockheed Martin was rather acquisitive in 2014, acquiring cyber security firm Industrial Defender, integrated system planning firm BEONTRA, and federal healthcare IT solution firm Systems Made Simple. Also in 2014, it won its largest international IT contract to date from Australia's Department of Defense.--> The firm does business with 70 nations around the world. With a growing international backlog, it is well-positioned to achieve its goal of growing international sales over the next few years to over 20% of revenue.Note: Lockheed Martin's dividend yield is above average, offering a 3% annual yield at recent price levels. We like this defense contractor a lot, but we haven't yet pulled the trigger. A lofty valuation and a spending spree by management are two areas we'd like to see resolved. Let's walk through Lockheed's strengths and weaknesses as it relates to its dividend payout.Dividend StrengthsLockheed's free cash flow generating capacity is tremendous, and by comparison, it runs a rather capital-light operation. Excluding its recent deal to scoop up Sikorsky Aircraft, net sales is expected to be roughly flat in 2016 with an operating margin in the 11%-11.5% range. Changes in US government funding and the integration of Sikorsky will impact reported results, but we remain impressed with Lockheed's cash-generating prowess. We'll be watching Lockheed's Dividend Cushion ratio closely in light of recent acquisitive activity, however.Dividend WeaknessesA former unit of United Technologies, Sikorsky Aircraft, is now a part of Lockheed Martin, and while we like the transaction, credit metrics will face pressure as a result of the incremental debt coming on the books. Management is still buying back stock, despite the increase in leverage, and we're not sure this is a great move, particularly in light of our estimate of the company's intrinsic value. We're expecting some big changes in Lockheed's financials in coming years. Look for the Dividend Cushion ratio to be revised lower.From the Comments Section: How to Interpret the Dividend Cushion Ratio -- A Ranking of RiskAs for how to interpret the Dividend Cushion ratio, itself, it is a measure of financial risk to the dividend, much like a credit rating is a measure of the default risk of the entity. Said differently, a poor Dividend Cushion ratio of below 1 or negative doesn't imply the company will cut the dividend tomorrow, no more than a junk credit rating implies a company will default tomorrow. That said, the Dividend Cushion ratio does punish companies for outsize debt loads because in times of adverse conditions, entities often need to shore up cash, and that means the dividend becomes increasingly more risky.We think investors should look at a variety of different metrics in assessing the sustainability of the dividend. Because the Dividend Cushion ratio is systematically applied across our coverage, it can be used to compare entities on an apples-to-apples basis. Dividend payers with significant free cash flow generation and substantial net cash on the balance sheet often register the highest Dividend Cushion ratios, as they should. These companies have substantial financial flexibility to keep raising the dividend.Dividend SafetyWe think the safety of Lockheed Martin's dividend is good. Please let us explain.First, we measure the safety of the dividend in a unique but very straightforward fashion. As many know, earnings can fluctuate, so using the payout ratio in any given year has some limitations. Plus, companies can often encounter unforeseen charges, which makes earnings an even less-than-predictable measure of the safety of the dividend. We know that companies won't cut the dividend just because earnings have declined or they had a restructuring charge that put them in the red for the quarter (year). As such, we think that assessing the cash flows of a business allows us to determine whether it has the capacity to continue paying dividends well into the future.That has led us to develop the forward-looking Dividend Cushion ratio, which we make available on our website. The measure is a ratio that sums the existing net cash a company has on hand (on its balance sheet) plus its expected future free cash flows (cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) over the next five years and divides that sum by future expected cash dividends over the same time period. Basically, if the score is above 1, the company has the capacity to pay out its expected future dividends and the expected growth in them.As income investors, however, we'd like to see a ratio much larger than 1 for a couple of reasons: 1) the higher the ratio, the more ""cushion"" the company has against unexpected earnings shortfalls, and 2) the higher the ratio, the greater capacity a dividend-payer has in boosting the dividend in the future. For Lockheed Martin, this ratio is 1.4, revealing that on its current path the firm should be able to cover its future dividends and growth in them with net cash on hand and future free cash flow.Dividend Cushion Ratio Cash Flow BridgeThe Dividend Cushion Cash Flow Bridge, shown in the graph below, illustrates the components of the Dividend Cushion ratio and highlights in detail the many drivers behind it. Lockheed Martin's Dividend Cushion Cash Flow Bridge reveals that the sum of the company's 5-year cumulative free cash flow generation, as measured by cash flow from operations less all capital spending, plus its net cash/debt position on the balance sheet, as of the last fiscal year, is greater than the sum of the next 5 years of expected cash dividends paid.Because the Dividend Cushion ratio is forward-looking and captures the trajectory of the company's free cash flow generation and dividend growth, it reveals whether there will be a cash surplus or a cash shortfall at the end of the 5-year period, taking into consideration the leverage on the balance sheet, a key source of risk. On a fundamental basis, we believe companies that have a strong net cash position on the balance sheet and are generating a significant amount of free cash flow are better able to pay and grow their dividend over time.Firms that are buried under a mountain of debt and do not sufficiently cover their dividend with free cash flow are more at risk of a dividend cut or a suspension of growth, all else equal, in ouropinion. Generally speaking, the greater the 'blue bar' to the right is in the positive, the more durable a company's dividend, and the greater the 'blue bar' to the right is in the negative, the less durable a company's dividend.Dividend Cushion Ratio DeconstructionThe Dividend Cushion Ratio Deconstruction, shown in the graph below, reveals the numerator and denominator of the Dividend Cushion ratio. At the core, the larger the numerator, or the healthier a company's balance sheet and future free cash flow generation, relative to the denominator, or a company's cash dividend obligations, the more durable the dividend. In the context of the Dividend Cushion ratio, Lockheed Martin's numerator is larger than its denominator suggesting strong dividend coverage in the future. The Dividend Cushion Ratio Deconstruction image puts sources of free cash in the context of financial obligations next to expected cash dividend payments over the next 5 years on a side-by-side comparison. Because the Dividend Cushion ratio and many of its components are forward-looking, our dividend evaluation may change upon subsequent updates as future forecasts are altered to reflect new information.Please note that to arrive at the Dividend Cushion ratio, divide the numerator by the denominator in the graph below. The difference between the numerator and denominator is the firm's ""total cumulative 5-year forecasted distributable excess cash after dividends paid, ex buybacks.""Dividend GrowthNow on to the potential growth of Lockheed Martin's dividend. As we mentioned above, we think the larger the ""cushion"" the larger capacity the company has to raise the dividend. However, such dividend growth analysis is not complete until after considering management's willingness to increase the dividend. To do so, we evaluate the company's historical dividend track record. If there have been no dividend cuts in the past 10 years, the company has a nice dividend growth rate, and a solid Dividend Cushion ratio, we characterize its future potential dividend growth as excellent, which is the case for Lockheed Martin.Because capital preservation is also an important consideration to any income strategy, we use our estimate of the company's fair value range to assess the risk associated with the potential for capital loss. In Lockheed Martin's case, we currently think shares are fairly valued, meaning the share price falls within our estimate of the fair value range, so the risk of capital loss is medium (our valuation analysis can be found by downloading the 16-page report on our website). If we thought the shares were undervalued, the risk of capital loss would be low.Wrapping Things UpLockheed Martin is well-positioned to meet the needs of governments across the globe, and the evolving global security landscape will only increase those needs. As it relates to the firm's dividend, we love its free cash flow generating capacity and rather capital-light operation compared to peers.Though we are fans of the firm's acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft, it will undoubtedly pressure credit metrics due to the increase in debt, which we think should prompt management to put an end to its share buyback program. In addition to our questions of its capital management, shares are currently overpriced on the basis of our discounted cash flow model.We'd like to see two things happen before we jump into Lockheed's shares: a lower price, and more prudent capital allocation by management. Both may not happen anytime soon.Breakpoints: Dividend Safety. We measure the safety of a firm's dividend by adding its net cash to our forecast of its future cash flows and divide that sum by our forecast of its future dividend payments. This process results in a ratio called the Dividend Cushion. Scale: Above 2.75 = EXCELLENT; Between 1.25 and 2.75 = GOOD; Between 0.5 and 1.25 = POOR; Below 0.5 = VERY POOR.This article or report and any links within are for information purposes only and should not be considered a solicitation to buy or sell any security.

3831286,68315,2016-01-25T09:47:27-05:00,"Lockheed Martin performed well in the last quarter.Lockheed Martin offers high cash flows, high shareholder returns.Lockheed Martin has a very low beta and thus gives your depot stability in volatile times.The company's valuation does not seem high right now.","Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is one of the biggest aerospace/defense companies in the world, and I believe in times like this, the company is a compelling addition to the portfolios of most investors since the company offers attractive income and depot stability.Lockheed Martin's fourth-quarter and full-year 2015 results have not been reported yet, but we can take a look at the previous earnings numbers in order to determine where the company is headed fundamentally: In the third quarter, Lockheed Martin grossed revenues of $11.5 billion, an increase of three percent over the prior year's quarter - a strong result in times when a lot of companies are struggling to grow revenues at all, e.g. due to currency headwinds. Earnings for the third quarter came in at $865 million, or $2.77 per share, which was a small increase over the prior year's quarter and which beat estimates by $0.05, or two percent.Lockheed Martin also announced that full-year 2015 results would likely come in at $11.30, the high end of the previous guidance, full-year 2015 revenue is seen around $45 billion.The best performing segment in the last quarter was aeronautics, which saw revenues climb eleven percent, mission systems and training grew seven percent, the other three segments (missiles and fire control, information systems & space systems) saw yoy declines in revenues.All in all we can say that the quarter had been good for Lockheed Martin, revenues grew in a harsh environment, the company's aeronautics division once again has grown at a very attractive pace (aeronautics grew seven percent in the previous quarter), and Lockheed Martin's cash generation remained very strong. The company's operating cash flows totaled $1.5 billion, which is mostly available for shareholder returns - the company spent just $190 million on capex, thus producing free cash flows of $1.3 billion for the quarter (or $5.2 billion annualized).Of these $1.3 billion in free cash flows, Lockheed Martin has spent about $510 million on dividends ($1.65 per share), which gives the company a dividend yield of 3.1 percent at the current price. Roughly $800 million were spent on share repurchases, thereby paying out all of the company's free cash flows to shareholders. With $800 million in share repurchases, Lockheed Martin reduced the share count by 4.1 million, which means an annual buyback pace of five and a half percent - this alone leads to earnings per share growth of six percent a year, all else equal.These strong shareholder returns - mainly the dividend - are a strong positive in times where the stock markets are not providing positive returns at all:The broad indices, Dow Jones Industrial and S&P 500, are both negative for the last twelve months, declining ten percent and eight percent, respectively. The Dow Jones index is even negative for the time period starting January 2014. Lockheed Martin, on the other hand, not only grew its share price ten percent over the last twelve months, but also provides investors with an ample income yield of 3.1 percent, which helps in times when capital appreciation is hard to find. Lockheed Martin's dividend yield is not only fifty percent higher than the broad market's yield, Lockheed Martin's dividend is also growing at an attractive pace: Over the last five years, the company has increased its payout by seventeen percent annually, and with its high cash generation, growing earnings and declining share count, Lockheed Martin can easily increase the dividend at a substantial pace in the future.Another positive about having Lockheed Martin in your portfolio is the stability this stock gives you: With a beta of just 0.57, Lockheed Martin is relatively uncorrelated to the broad market's movements. There are stocks that will go up when the S&P 500 goes up, and that will go down when the S&P 500 goes down (in many cases, to an even larger degree both up and down) - Lockheed Martin is not one of those stocks with a high correlation to the broad markets, as could be seen over the last year (where Lockheed Martin is up ten percent and the markets are down eight to ten percent), and over the last weeks:Starting from January, Lockheed Martin's stock is down 0.5 percent for the year, whereas the S&P 500 index is down ten times as much, five percent. This autonomy from the S&P 500's movements is also working in the other direction, if the broad indices are gaining substantial amounts, this does not necessarily mean that Lockheed Martin's share price will increase as well. Lockheed Martin's low correlation to the movements of the broad market do thus not lead to outperformance per se, but having Lockheed Martin (or other stocks with very low betas) in your portfolio decreases the swings (both up and down) and gives you less volatility overall.Lockheed Martin's outlook is good as well: With conflict brewing in many parts of the world, it is very likely that demand for military equipment and services remains strong - this is a negative for humanity, but a positive for Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin won a couple of major deals in the recent, past, including a $1.1 billion contract for more than thirty new C-130J aircraft (US government), a $1.2 billion contract relating to a new batch of F-35 jets (US government) and a $1.8 billion contract for frigates and other equipment (Taiwan government).Another very positive piece of news is the fact that spending on military aircraft in the US is higher than it ever was over the last decade, which should turn out as a huge positive for Lockheed Martin (and other military aircraft suppliers such as Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) and General Dynamics (NYSE:GD)).Another factor that will lead to increased demand for Lockheed Martin's products comes from the fact that the US Air Force is running out of ammunition due to increased fighting activity over the last months (e.g. ISIS campaign). As the Air Force's ammunition depot stocks are below the desired level, we can suspect increased procuration activity over the next quarters, which will ultimately mean higher revenues for Lockheed Martin and other suppliers.These points do, I believe, allow for ample growth for Lockheed Martin over the coming years, which should help keep the dividend growth rate high.Looking at Lockheed Martin's valuation, we see that the company trades at 18.8 times trailing earnings, which is more expensive than the company's price over the last year (on average), but at the same time, the valuation is lower than the broad market's valuation (S&P 500 trades at 20.1 times trailing earnings). Lockheed Martin's forward earnings multiple of 15.7 shows a low valuation relative to the company's strong expected growth rates.When we look at Lockheed Martin's cash generation ability, we see that the company produces about $1.5 billion in operating cash flows and about $1.3 billion in free cash flows a quarter, which gives Lockheed Martin a free cash flow yield of 7.7 percent - this looks like a low valuation per se, and it is especially so for a non cyclical, strong growth business like Lockheed Martin.TakeawayWe can summarize that Lockheed Martin offers good fundamentals, high shareholder returns and a good growth outlook. At the same time, the company's share price is rather unrelated to the broad market's ups and downs, which decreases portfolio volatility.Relative to the broad market Lockheed Martin trades at a discount, although the company's shares are more expensive than they were a couple of months ago. With a free cash flow yield of 7.7 percent, Lockheed Martin doesn't look too expensive yet and could thus be a good addition to a portfolio, providing stability and income."

        And holding LMT probably isn't worth the risk of a misstep.
        A large short sale crossed the tape in November following additional debt issuance.
        Isn't this just too much leverage?","To any good investor, this famous quote by Donald Rumsfeld should be so internalized as to seem obvious.Indeed, the omnipresent spectre of Seeking Alpha's Chris DeMuth Jr. (a reasonably good investor) frequently makes reference to a paper with a strikingly similar concept, the ""unknown and unknowable"" in investing.These concepts are critical to the assessment of risk, reward, mispricing, and comparative advantage in investing. If you don't agree, you're wrong.Making an unknown unknown a known unknown.While part of investing is acknowledging that we can't know everything, that's not an excuse to be lazy. So here's something you didn't know about Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) stock, but probably should know.On November 25th, at $224.16, the majority of shares traded in LMT were short sales (red bars on the chart above). In a stock like LMT, that's extraordinarily rare.Even more extraordinary, perhaps, is that these short sellers appear to have very effectively picked a local maximum in LMT's price, and either hedged effectively or profited handsomely as a result of their excellent timing.What do they know - if anything?We don't know what they know, but whenever $267M in short sales occur in one day, we start to wonder what we may be missing.So what's at risk in LMT? If you were to peruse any article on Seeking Alpha, you would get the impression that Lockheed is the very definition of ""stability."" Much of this, however, seems to be the clouded reasoning of yield-chasers.Unfortunately for the ubiquitous optimist, there are plenty of downside catalysts hiding in plain sight.1. The ongoing F-35 debacle. They're twice as expensive as they were supposed to be, and getting pricier every day. And that's just the beginning, really. Vanity Fair summed it up nicely (here):Will LMT be able to shove this flying bloatware down its customers' throats anyway? Canadian procurers, for one, are wishy-washy.And if you were about to say that the F-35 is just one of many opportunities, consider that LMT just lost a big contract from the USMC to competitors SAIC and BAE - and that the F-35 accounts for a substantial portion (20%) of current sales and anticipated revenues.2. Democrats. Election season is approaching, and budget cuts are a real possibility. Over 80% of LMT's revenue comes from the U.S. government in its many forms.Generally, the government is a good basket to put your eggs in, but it should still be sobering to think that legislators have so much power over LMT's revenue.3. Leverage. Lockheed's balance sheet just called, and it would like to consider suspending the share buyback program. How often do you see a debt-to-equity ratio like this?[Source: SEC Filings]While leverage is not bad per se, leverage in an arguably overvalued company with more down- than up-side catalysts can be a scary thing. In 2015, more than $9B (Isn't that how much they payed for Sikorsky?) was spent on share buybacks (1/3) and paying down debt (2/3). Is it a coincidence that this 8-K, reporting the issuance of more debt, came just a few days before that short sale?Combined...These factors make for a deceptively fragile situation. Our sense that the risks seem to be largely brushed aside and the ""stability"" of LMT universally acknowledged makes the leverage that much more dangerous to the stock.And then there's the fact that the leverage funds a frothy dividend and that taken-for-granted buyback program. And the fact that holdings are nearly 90% institutional. The upshot is that hardly anyone will want to short a stock like this, and so the risks compound indeterminately alongside sunny expectations. No voices of reason are permitted in LMT, and everything will be just fine.That is, until the buyback program is suspended. Or F-35 orders don't meet the grade. Or the Democrats arrive on the scene. Then we're back to $185 in a few days' time.""Unknown Knowns?""Slavoj Žižek says there's another type of information, ""unknown knowns"" - the things we know, but really don't want to admit to ourselves. That seems to describe investor sentiment in LMT pretty well.Is this why we see uncharacteristic short selling at $224? Is someone finally taking the other side of the trade, even if it costs them >5% in interest and dividend payments to do so?Maybe.But what's more important is that this is a good a time as any to reconsider your position in LMT, and your expectations for the future. Don't underestimate the risks.Hopefully, we've been able to turn a few unknown unknowns into known unknowns. Something else you should know is that the referenced short sale data comes from FINRA's TRFs.If you want to know more, read this, or shoot us an email at info@sqzme.co.Matt"

With the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) higher by just 1.5% in YTD15, Lockheed Martin can be considered as an outperformer. However, the bullish trend for the stock is still not over and I believe that the remainder of 2015 and 2016 will continue to be positive for Lockheed Martin. This article discusses the factors that will trigger further upside for the stock.From an industry perspective, increasing geopolitical tensions can potentially imply that defense budget might witness some revision in the foreseeable future. This holds true for US and its allies globally. I will explain later how this can have a positive impact on Lockheed Martin's prospects.Coming to the potential positive triggers, according to Defense news:If this suggestion is implemented, the number of bombers will double and this is likely to provide a strong boost to Lockheed Martin's order book in the next 12-24 months.In another recent development, the Pentagon expects the new Canadian government to allow Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter aircraft to compete to replace Canada's aging CF-18 jets. If this deal is through, Lockheed Martin will see growth beyond the United States. With countries willing to co-operate in tackling increasing terrorism threats, I believe that the deal is likely as it can significantly improve Canada's air power.From a regional diversification perspective, I must add here that Lockheed Martin is optimistic on the Trans Pacific Partnership agreement and I share this optimism. According to Lockheed Martin press release:It is clear that Lockheed Martin wants to expand its order book beyond the United States and I see that increasingly likely in the foreseeable future as allies work together to strengthen the defense systems.Besides these upside trigger factors, robust dividends make Lockheed Martin an attractive stock to own. The company's current dividend of $6.6 per share is sustainable, and I expect another dividend increase in FY16. With likely cash flows in excess of $5 billion in FY15 and a similar range for FY16, shareholder value creation will continue through dividends and share repurchase. I therefore recommend Lockheed Martin for dividend seekers.From a long-term perspective, Lockheed Martin is a portfolio stock considering the company's robust investment in the field of research & development. From the launch of F-35 jets to the recently commissioned Littoral Combat Ship, Lockheed Martin has been leading the way.In a recent development, Lockheed and Boeing (NYSE:BA) have launched a joint venture to launch miniature satellites, known as CubeSats. Through this, the company plans to enter the high growth market of small hardware.The point I am trying to make is that existing markets have potential, newer markets are likely to open and production diversification is also being pursued. All this combines to make Lockheed Martin interesting for the coming year as well as for the long term.In conclusion, Lockheed Martin is among the attractive stock picks for 2016 and I believe that the stock has the potential to outperform the index even in the coming year."
3756616,74695,2015-12-15T10:56:03-05:00,"Lockheed Martin continues to profit from smart acquisitions and ramping geopolitical conflicts.Despite all the negative press surrounding Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter jets, the company's F-35 program is starting to gain steam.As much of Lockheed Martin's fortunes depend on global conflicts, military de-escalations in regions like the Middle East should adversely affect profits.","Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) continues to be top performer in the defense industry. In fact, Lockheed Martin has been reaching record highs over the past few months, which is not surprising given the company's winning moves. The company's Sikorsky acquisition, for instance, has so far proven valuable given Sikorsky's list of recent contract wins. Over the past few weeks, the company's Sikorsky unit has won nearly $1 billion in US Army contracts and a $354 million Navy helicopter contract.Lockheed Martin's growing list of acquisitions have helped the company retain its premier position within the defense industry. Given the rising geopolitical pressures around the world, particularly in the Middle East, Lockheed Martin has enormous opportunities ahead of it. What's more, the company's F-35 line is not performing as poorly as many had expected. As the F-35 is already generating about 20% of the company's revenues, the success of this line is incredibly important to the company's long-term success.Geopolitical Conflicts on the RiseConflicts on the international stage have risen dramatically over the past few years. With a growing number of countries becoming involved in Middle Eastern conflicts, rising tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, and so forth, Lockheed Martin is in a great position to profit. As many of these conflicts do not seem to be dying down anytime soon, highlighted by the fact that President Obama is now sending special operations forces into Syria to help combat ISIS, Lockheed Martin is set to gain immensely.Lockheed Martin is already starting to experience the benefits of such ramping tensions. In fact, Middle Eastern and Asia-Pacific countries are pushing the company's missile-defense sales. Products such as Lockheed Martin's Patriot, Aegis, and THAAD continue to experience strong sales from such high conflict regions. The Middle East, in particular, is helping drive the company to 25% international sales. As conflicts in the Middle East are nowhere near settled, Lockheed Martin is in a better position than its competitors to profit given its strong ties to the region. Given the trend of increasingly globalized military conflicts, Lockheed Martin should see its international share continue to rise.F-35 Program is Gaining SteamLockheed Martin has billions of dollars into its F-35 program over the years. Unfortunately, the F-35 has been repeatedly slammed for performance issues, which has led to decreased enthusiasm for this fighter jet. In fact, customers that were committed to buying Lockheed Martin's F-35 have increasingly second-guessed their decisions. Even the U.S. Navy is rethinking its commitment to the F-35.With that being said, Lockheed Martin is finally starting to gain some positive momentum with its F-35 fighter jets. The company has achieved a growing number of milestones over the past few quarters and is on track to ship nearly 50 F-35 fighter jets in 2015 alone. In fact, the F-35 program is generating approximately 1/5 of the company's revenues, which goes to show how important the program is to the company. What's more, Britain recently committed to buying 138 of the company's F-35 jets, which is approximately triple its previous commitment to buy 48 jets.Britain's massive increase in its projected orders should result in tens of billions of dollars in additional revenue for Lockheed Martin. Not surprisingly, Britain's increasing commitment to its military was a direct result of rising geopolitical tensions. PM David Cameron stated that ""the world is more dangerous and uncertain today"" due to ""the rise of ISIL"" among many other things. The current tensions in the major conflict zones are clearly spilling over to the rest of the world, making Lockheed Martin uniquely situated to take advantage of the current atmosphere given its large international presence.Lockheed Martin's F-35 program is starting to pick up its pace.Source: nationalinterestChallengesMuch of Lockheed Martin's business is centered around international conflict, of which is inherently unpredictable. While the current atmosphere of conflict is highly favorable for Lockheed Martin, this can change rapidly. Although the problems plaguing the Middle East will likely not disappear anytime soon, tensions in regions like the Asia-Pacific region could easily de-escalate. Such de-escalations could lead to military cutbacks around the world, putting Lockheed Martin in a bad position. Lockheed Martin's South Korea business, for instance, could suffer greatly if North Korea decided to pull back on its dangerous rhetoric. On balance, however, geopolitical tensions around the world only seem to be ramping up.ConclusionLockheed Martin currently stands at a market capitalization of $67 billion, making it the largest defense company in the US. With net sales of $11.5 billion in Q3 and solid future demand, the company still has more room to grow. The company will likely continue to outperform moving forward given the current geopolitical atmosphere and its strengthening F-35 program. Lockheed Martin is a great choice for investors looking to buy a high quality defense stock."

Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has been making advanced weapons for the military for decades and advanced aircraft for over a hundred years. So the company knows a thing or two about its industry. But what many investors may not know is that LMT also writes the software that goes into the many highly advanced weapon systems that it sells to the military.More specifically, LMT writes encrypted software that makes it next to impossible for a hacker to gain access to the weapons systems that are ultimately used to defend the country against both traditional military rivals as well as the modern threat of terrorism. This is a market that has major growth potential for LMT, especially in the current environment of global fear of terrorism. With the British government announcing they will double funding to defend against cyber attacks in the wake of the recent attacks in Paris, LMT is positioned well to benefit from this new focus on security from both the UK and governments all over the world. So that provides the stock with some nice potential upside to go along with its already very strong core business.Looking at LMT's performance based on the company's fundamentals and dividend, the stock looks like a nice value play right now. With quarterly YoY revenue growing 3% and a forward P/E of 18, the stock looks fairly valued, even without taking the above mentioned growth catalyst into account. The PEG of 2.8 also isn't bad for a company not known for rapid growth. Taken together with the reasonable P/E and 3% dividend, the company looks very well rounded and is putting up pretty solid numbers across the board.While quarterly YoY earnings declined a very small 2.6%, the stock is trading at only 1.49 times sales with a stellar return on equity of 96%. So while the company hasn't exactly been growing rapidly over the past year or so, it is operating very efficiently and creating good cashflow for investors in an environment where the military's budget has been cut dramatically. But this could change going forward as the political landscape changes and one of the major parties is calling loudly to increase military spending, which would of course have a positive impact on LMT's bottom line.So it's entirely possible that within just one or two years we could see a situation where spending is growing and the increased need for cyber security, which can be provided by LMT, are taking place at the same time, with the latter happening as we speak. Obviously, we don't want to be making common stock investments based on things that may or may not happen, but even without all of the above, LMT's core business remains robust with the nice fundamentals mentioned above to back it up.In the meantime, the patient investor can collect a nice 3% dividend and sleep well at night knowing their capital is in one of the safest industries in the stock market, in a company whose products will always be necessary and where LMT has a strong competitive advantage."
3592006,91235,2015-10-22T04:52:05-04:00,"Lockheed Martin delivered solid Q3 results.Significant stock appreciation occurred over July, a result of an acquisition.This acquisition represents a free upside catalyst in addition to Lockheed's already stable dividends.Investors should continue to keep Lockheed on their radar and look for chances to buy into the stock.","This article serves as an update to a previous article I wrote about Lockheed Martin.Since my last article, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has been doing fairly well, and the company's third-quarter results certainly corroborate this outlook. Net sales rose from $11.1B to $11.5B quarter-on-quarter, representing an increase of 3.6%. Margins held up pretty well, as represented by a 2.7% increase in net earnings from $865M to $888M quarter-on-quarter. Earnings per share rose only slightly by $0.01 to $2.77, a negligible percent increase. However, Lockheed's share repurchase program was increased by $3B, and its quarterly dividend was increased 10% to $1.65 per share. Furthermore, cash from operations rose to $1.5B from $900M quarter-on-quarter, a significant increase. All in all, a solid quarter for the company.Investors did not react much to the good news, although that could be because the stock had already experienced a strong amount of upside during the past six months. Investors who bought at the lows shown during the summer months snagged about a 12% return on investment over the past several months. But, if investors look closer, the stock wasn't actually doing too well before July, and most of the upside experienced by the stock happened during July. Since then, the stock has resumed trading sideways between price barriers of about $200 to $210.Source: Stockcharts.comWhat accounted for this dramatic increase? Well, the major piece of news that was happening during this time was that Lockheed was going to purchase Sikorsky, a helicopter unit from United Technologies Corp. (NYSE:UTX), for about $8B. Lockheed normally doesn't execute major acquisitions, so this piece of news was a major surprise to investors, who reacted positively. Sikorsky is one of the world's largest helicopter makers, and the unit is known for its Black Hawk choppers.So, the company completed an acquisition, but what does this actually mean? In my last article on the company, I mentioned investing in Lockheed not for growth, but for stability. The company's top line has either been relatively flat or growing very slowly for the past several years, and its bottom line paints pretty much the same picture. While the company has been an excellent bunker against significant amounts of volatility, for investors looking for capital appreciation, Lockheed may not have been the best choice. Now, however, with this acquisition, that could change.Sikorsky represents change for Lockheed. With a significant backlog of orders and a well-known brand, Sikorsky could give Lockheed the jumpstart it needs to fire up its growth engines. With the right moves, Lockheed may be able to fuel Sikorsky's growth with free cash flow generated from its cash-cow businesses and reward investors not only with steady dividends but also with stock value appreciation.Of course, none of this may come to fruition. But think about it like this: Sikorsky doesn't represent a large portion of Lockheed's sales mix to begin with, and any mix of cash, equity, and debt that the company used to purchase Sikorsky will quickly be absorbed. So, if things don't work out, investors will still have Lockheed's stability to fall back on. Sikorsky essentially represents a free potential upside catalyst for the stock.And that's why investors who are looking to invest in Lockheed just got presented with an even sweeter deal: initially just stability, but now stability and the chance for capital appreciation. Investors should continue keeping Lockheed on their radar and look for any chances to buy in."
3558646,23757,2015-10-08T03:38:44-04:00,Lockheed's IS&GS business is underperforming due to industry problems.Sikorsky deal helps Lockheed diversify the aerospace business.Sikorsky deal allows Lockheed to replace non-DoD revenue lost from the sale of IS&GS.Sikorsky is a better fit for Lockheed's portfolio than the old IS&GS business.,"We've criticized a lot of corporate executive's decisions (like Coach, GE, or Weight Watchers), in previous articles so it's only fair we point out a great move by a CEO when we see one.On July 20th, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) announced it had agreed to buy United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) Sikorsky aircraft division for a net purchase price of $7.1B ($9B list price with $1.9B in tax benefits). Then, in related news, Lockheed announced it was exploring strategic alternatives for its IT services business. As shareholders in Lockheed Martin, we heartily agree with these moves and applaud CEO Marillyn Hewson for building what we think will be a stronger, more-profitable Lockheed.Rationale Behind the IS&GS DivesitureBefore we talk about Sikorsky, let's first look at what Lockheed is getting rid of to help pay for part of the acquisition. I've seen some confusion from Lockheed investors here on Seeking Alpha as to exactly what parts of its IT business Lockheed is looking to divest. Lockheed Martin's latest 10-K describes the Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS) business unit as (emphasis added):You'll notice that the IS&GS business unit serves both defense and non-defense customers. It's the non-defense, non-classified businesses that Lockheed is considering divesting. According to Lockheed's press release:There are very good reasons for Lockheed to want rid of the bulk of its IT services business. The business has been commoditized with contractors competing almost solely on price, the industry is saturated with competition, and the government IT business has very little synergies with Lockheed's weapon systems businesses.The government IT services business is characterized by intense competition. The best way to illustrate just how different the government IT services and weapons system businesses are is the table below. It shows the top 100 government technology contractors (using data on government technology contracts from WashingtonTechnology.com). I've highlighted in orange the contractors that also sell major weapons system platforms.But it's not only these large firms competing in the IT arena. The government is actively encouraging smaller IT services firms to bid on contracts. In any case, out of the 100 IT services contractors only 7 (soon to be 6, if the Sikorsky sale goes through) are major weapons system manufacturers. Now, add in Airbus Group (OTCPK:EADSF) (OTCPK:EADSY), Finmeccanica (OTCPK:FINMF) (OTCPK:FINMY), Thales (OTCPK:THLEF) (OTCPK:THLEY), Huntington Ingalls (NYSE:HII), Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK), and EADS and you get a total of only about a dozen large defense contractors (presuming the U.S. Department of Defense isn't going to buy Russian or Chinese equipment, which we think is a pretty safe assumption) that are capable of producing expensive, complex weapons systems platforms.You can see the effect of the intense competition in the IS&GS segment results compared to Lockheed as whole.(Data from Lockheed Martin FY2014 10-K)Not only have IS&GS sales fallen over the past three years, but they are falling at a rate faster than Lockheed's overall sales decline in FY2013. Additionally, operating profit margins are below Lockheed's overall operating margins. Worse yet, IS&GS profit margins are showing a steady deterioration from even its below-average figure.While the IS&GS business unit did have some problems, it did have one important aspect for Lockheed. The civil and other government contracts of the IS&GS business had reduced Lockheed's dependence of defense spending. This is where the Sikorsky deal comes into play.Sikorsky's Value to LockheedThe Sikorsky deal is much more than just another defense industry consolidation for Lockheed. With Sikorsky, Lockheed can kill two (maybe even three) birds with one stone. It helps Lockheed diversify its aeronautics business unit away from the F-35 program (we like the prospects of the F-35, but diversification is good as well), it consolidates two major aerospace contractors, which reduces competition, and Sikorsky's non-government customers help replace the non-defense revenue lost with the divestiture of the IS&GS business.In United Technologies' latest 10-K, we can see that 48% of Sikorsky's sales were to non-government customers.Now, a large portion of those customers were in the oil and gas industry but remember this deal was done in July after oil prices had fallen and indeed Lockheed has stated that the price they paid for Sikorsky reflects the weakness in the oil and gas market.On the other side, Sikorsky's defense business looks to be adequate. The table below shows proposed DoD budget increases for Sikorsky's major platforms.Sikorsky manufactures the ubiquitous UH-60 Black Hawk series of helicopters which provides the company with a nice steady stream of profits. This supplements some minor growth opportunities in several smaller programs. The biggest value to Lockheed will likely be the diversification Sikorsky provides along with the estimated $150M in cost savings and synergies.SummaryWe really like this deal for Lockheed. CEO Hewson is ditching an underperforming business that shows no real signs of ever turning around and parlaying the proceeds to buy a solid, synergistic defense business. It's hard to imagine a scenario, other than a complete and total collapse of the oil and gas sector, in which this deal looks bad. If federal spending rises and the IT services industry dynamics improve, it's hard to imagine that defense spending wouldn't also be rising at the same time, meaning shareholders in LMT are unlikely to regret seeing the IT business go. The Sikorsky deal has a lot of positives for shareholders and there looks to be little downside in the method chosen to pay for some of it."
3674676,89346,2015-11-11T01:53:42-05:00,"Lockheed Martin recently lost an $80 billion contract for long-range stealth bombers to Northrop Grumman.The company released third-quarter earnings, posting a slight decline in profits, while increasing dividends to $1.50 per share.Lockheed Martin is well positioned to continue generating substantial revenues in the coming years, thanks to a number of programs it has lined up.","Like many investors, I too sometimes can't shake off the feeling one gets from missing opportunities. I'm not happy. I missed out on a great chance a few years ago in Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and now I am cautiously optimistic about the company's future. LMT has seen its stock price climb by nearly 13% over the past 1 year, while over the past 3 years the stock price has surged by more than 130%. The stock offers a healthy dividend, having recently crossed the 3% dividend yield mark.LMT reported third-quarter earnings last month, which saw revenues for the quarter climb to $11.461 billion, up from $11.114 billion in the same quarter last year. Interestingly enough, the company has seen its net earnings slightly decline by 2.6% year over year to $865 million for the quarter, while at the same time the common share dividends have climbed by 12.78% to $1.50 per share, taking the nine-month period dividend aggregate up to $4.50 per share. The following week saw LMT stock soar by nearly 7% to a high of $223.04 per share, eventually settling to its current price of $214.66. The company's focus on returning value to shareholders was well received by Wall Street, but the question remains: Can it continue this impressive performance?Swing and a missJust like me, the company is troubled by its missed chances. Along with Boeing (NYSE:BA), Lockheed Martin is protesting the United States Air Force's decision to award the $80 billion stealth bomber contract to Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC). How significant was this contract? Well, Northrop Grumman should be able to add about 1,800 well-paying engineering and program management jobs for work on the bomber, and the award is expected to top $100 billion over the life of the contract. In other words, it is looking at years, if not decades, of revenues.So, it's no surprise that Boeing and Lockheed have been protesting the USAF's decision by calling it ""fundamentally flawed"". For Lockheed, the USAF's decision to go with Northrop Grumman is fairly shocking, since the Pentagon makes up about 60% of the company's business, with the balance coming from various other customers, such as NASA and other government agencies from across the world. On the other hand, Boeing's St. Louis, Missouri military aircraft facility is in jeopardy without the long-range stealth bomber (LRS-B) contract.Unfortunately for both Boeing and Lockheed Martin, it seems like the USAF is not going to budge on its decision, especially given the fact that the GAO Protest Sustainment Rate for Federal and the US Department of Defense was less than 4%, even though there had been an increase in the total number of bid protests filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) against the Department of Defense. The award has helped Northrop Grumman stock soar to levels near its all-time high, currently trading at $181.66, having peaked at $190.50 late last month.But Big Wheels Keep on Turnin'I'm sure losing an $80 billion contract to your lesser competitor is something that will keep even the most hardened of CEOs up at night, but I don't think Marillyn Hewson is one of them. Ever since she took command of the company back in 2013, Lockheed's stock price has seen a sharp upward movement, which continues to this day. Under her leadership, the company continues to enter into lucrative contracts which have the ability to further fuel the Bethesda, Maryland-based company.Earlier this month, Lockheed Martin managed to win a preliminary contract worth $5.37 billion to build a ninth batch of 55 F-35 jets for the US military and its allies. When the deal finalizes at the end of this year, it will allow the aerospace, defense, and advanced technologies company to receive $625 million in funding immediately. The immediate funding is said to be aimed at preventing major delays in production of the F-35 jets, since the plane was plagued by years of glitches and software tweaks. However, the US Marines have now taken possession of their first combat-ready F-35s, with the USAF expected to follow next year. Even Frank Kendall, the current Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisitions, Technologies and Logistics, believes that the troubled days of the F-35 are now a thing of the past, and that the ambitious program is set to continue serving the Pentagon and Lockheed Martin's top line.The F-35 has turned out to be Lockheed's flagship offering, with the company having designed three models of the warplane for the US military, while numerous countries, such as Britain, Australia, Turkey, Israel and Japan, have signed up to acquire the jet. The F-35 has proven to be a phenomenal success, so much so that the Pentagon expects to dish out $391 billion to develop the plane and buy 2,457 jets, making the F-35 the single-most expensive weapons program.In other news, Lockheed Martin and the US Air Force reached another deal, this time involving the company's C-130J transport plane, for a contract of up to 83 deliveries. This will allow Lockheed to continue deliveries through 2020 (not including orders from other countries). There is a catch; the USAF's acquisition chief, William LaPlante, warned that if the Pentagon is forced to operate under a long-term continuing resolution (such as this 5-year contract for the C-130Js) - a stopgap spending measure to fund the government if the Congress fails to reach a budget deal - the USAF will break the multi-year deal for the C-130s. With parties increasingly more interested in partisanship than in solving major issues facing the nation, the C-130 deal has a chance, albeit relatively small, of failing.Of Choppers and LevantSo this is where the global political arena comes into play in favor of Lockheed Martin. Recently, the Russian armed forces took a huge toll on ISIS and its factions by coordinating an extensive attack, in which they put their Soviet-era Mi-24 Hind to good use. The legendary machine is known for its ability to skim through vast areas of land at speeds of 200 km/h, while being able to deliver a ferocious punch, making it a highly relevant machine even in today's world.This is where Lockheed's Sikorsky acquisition comes into play, as the tension in Syria shows no signs of dissipating anytime soon. In other words, the United States seems to have no plans of backing off. According to Marillyn Hewson, her company's takeover of Sikorsky from United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) was an opportunistic deal. Once the helicopter manufacturer was put up for sale on the market, Lockheed Martin did not hesitate to pay $9 billion for Sikorsky, having closed the deal on Friday last week. The company is a wonderful fit for Lockheed, especially since the new business unit already has two new helicopters in the pipeline. These are the S-97 Raider and the CH-53K King Stallion helicopters. The S-97 Raider is designed to be a direct competitor for the Mi-24 Hind, with its ability to carry 6 soldiers, aside from the 2-man crew, and its blistering top speed of 250 mph (that's more than 400 km/h). The King Stallion is the reincarnation of the iconic CH-53 helicopter, and houses three large engines which allow it to carry nearly three times as much weight (over 12 metric tons) for a distance of 110 miles. The best part: Both these helicopters have flown and are in their last stages of production, with the CH-53K King Stallion scheduled to enter service in 2019.ConclusionHad Lockheed Martin won the LRS-B contract, the stock price would have seen an even sharper ascent, but alas, things took a different turn. However, the company's numerous projects and extensive portfolio have assured that it will continue to generate significant revenues for the next couple of years. With Sikorsky under its belt, the company should be able to avoid development issues like the ones it faced with the F-35 and deliver the two helicopters in time and in full force.For those who missed out on a chance to buy LMT a few years ago, I suggest you wait no further and add some Lockheed Martin stocks to your portfolio for the next decade. The last 5 years have seen the stock offer greater dividends with ever-increasing capital gains, and with the crisis in Syria showing no signs of dampening anytime soon, Lockheed Martin will be able to capitalize on the unfortunate situation through its multi-billion dollar Sikorsky acquisition."
3538186,69695,2015-09-28T15:31:07-04:00,"Defense giant Lockheed Martin recently passed through a solid 10% dividend increase. The company has significantly increased its dividend over the past five years.Even though defense budgets are coming down, Lockheed Martin can still increase dividends, thanks to its strong free cash flow generation.Earnings may come down slightly this year, but long-term dividend growth is still likely due to continued free cash flow generation, as well as the Sikorsky acquisition.Lockheed Martin remains an attractive stock for income investors.","Dividend increases are a great way for corporate management teams to show their confidence in the power of their underlying businesses. On September 24, defense contractor Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) demonstrated its own dividend fire power when it raised its dividend by 10% to $6.60 per share annualized. The stock now provides investors with a 3.2% yield. On top of that, the company just announced an additional $3 billion stock buyback authorization.It might seem counter-intuitive for a defense company to raise its dividend by double digits, and also announce such a large new buyback, in a world of falling defense budgets. But Lockheed Martin has several positive catalysts working in its favor that should allow it to keep increasing its dividend in the years ahead.A Good Start To 2015Lockheed Martin's revenue of $11.6 billion last quarter exceeded analyst estimates, which called for $10.9 billion. Earnings per share of $2.94 per share represented 7% year-over-year growth, and significantly beat expectations as well. In fact, Lockheed Martin's fundamentals have held up very well, and its dividend track record is a thing of beauty. Including its most recent raise, the company has now increased its dividend by 17% compounded annually over the past five years.To be sure, the company expects $11 per share-$11.30 per share in fiscal 2015 earnings. The midpoint of that range represents a 2% year over year decline in earnings per share. And yet, Lockheed Martin raised its dividend by 10% anyway. The reason why is because management is confident the company will still generate loads of free cash flow this year and beyond, even if revenue and earnings dip slightly in 2015.Lockheed Martin: A Cash Flow PowerhouseLockheed Martin's cost controls and effective management of capital allow it to run a tight ship. This results in a very high level of free cash flow generation. As the chart indicates, this translates into robust dividend growth as well.For example, Lockheed Martin generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow over the first half of the year. Its dividend cost the company $965 million in that time, which comes out to a comfortable 50% free cash flow payout ratio.Since the dividend represents just half of free cash flow, there is plenty of free cash flow left to buy back a significant amount of stock and also raise the dividend. Lockheed Martin repurchased $1.5 billion of stock over the first half of the year, and its recent addition to the buyback authorization should help boost earnings growth, even if revenue declines slightly in 2015.Separately, another forward catalyst for the company is its $9 billion acquisition of the Sikorsky Aircraft business from United Technologies (NYSE:UTX). This acquisition should complement Lockheed Martin's existing portfolio well, and is a natural fit given the company's strong position in aerospace and defense technologies.This deal will help Lockheed Martin expand its footprint in international business, which is a wise strategy given the likelihood of contraction of military spending in the United States. As management indicated on the last conference call, approximately 50% of Sikorsky's revenue comes from international operations. Lockheed got a good price for Sikorsky, paying 10 times EBITDA. This should make the deal accretive to earnings over the long term.Lockheed Martin Remains A Strong Dividend StockAs defense budgets come down slightly this year and beyond, it's prudent not to expect Lockheed Martin to keep up its near-20% annual dividend growth rate from the past five years. However, double-digit increases like the one Lockheed Martin just passed through should still be attainable. The company is effectively cutting costs, which should help keep modest earnings growth intact even though revenue could decline slightly this year.Plus, Lockheed Martin generates a high amount of free cash flow, which is critical for dividend growth going forward. Based on the combination of its 3.2% dividend and the potential for 10% compound annual dividend growth, Lockheed Martin should still be viewed as an attractive holding as part of an income-oriented portfolio.Disclaimer: This article represents the opinion of the author, who is not a licensed financial advisor.

3523406,21798,2015-09-22T08:05:28-04:00,"Lockheed Martin is likely to continue to achieve steady growth due to acquisitions and a steady stream of contracts.The stock has a margin of safety, based on a DCF analysis.Lockheed Martin outperforms over the long term.","The United States has preserved its freedom over the years by protecting and defending the country and its people. Freedom isn't free. It takes a strong military to defend a nation with over 300 million people. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is one of the major players that supply the U.S. and other countries with security and aerospace solutions for the needed protection in today's dangerous world. Lockheed's stock has had plenty of momentum over the past two years, rising from $87 in January 2013 to the current price of $203. I think that momentum can continue for Lockheed as the company continues to secure new contracts to grow revenue and as the Sikorsky acquisition adds value.Investors not only benefit from Lockheed's price appreciation, they also reap the benefits of the 3% dividend. The company increased its dividend every year since 2003. Lockheed is able to do this due to its strong free cash flow. It had over $3 billion in free cash flow in 2014.I expect Lockheed to continue to grow as the company continues to get new contracts and make strategic acquisitions. One large potential deal for Lockheed is for its coastal warships. Saudi Arabia has been in talks with the U.S. government about purchasing two frigates. These frigates are based on the warships that the company is building for the U.S. Navy. This deal is estimated to be worth $1 billion. So, this would be a positive revenue boost for Lockheed if it gets the deal.The company won a 10-year contract with the potential to be worth $428 million. This contract involves integrating the Aegis Combat System on the U.S. Navy's fleet. The latest version of the Aegis configuration, known as Baseline 9, is the only naval combat system in the world that can conduct integrated air and missile defense simultaneously.Lockheed Martin also won a $500 million contract to provide the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile to Poland. This is to be used on Poland's F-16 fleet. The deal includes 40 missiles and related hardware, software, and program management. This is likely to be a bridge to similar contracts with Poland and other countries. Poland is likely to order additional missiles, since the current order is to fill an immediate need. Additional orders could come in the future from Poland as the country looks to fill longer-term defense goals. Lockheed has already supplied Australia, and is currently working with supplying Finland with these missiles. So, I think it is likely that other countries will look to Lockheed to obtain these missiles to strengthen their defenses.Another positive growth driver for Lockheed Martin is the ramping up of F-35 production. Production of these stealth fighter jets is increasing from 40 per year to over 120 per year over the next three years. The F-35 program ran into a snag when the Air Force considered lowering its planned purchase of 1,763 F-35 jets from Lockheed. However, discussions regarding lowering the purchases have been delayed so that they don't risk scaring off buyers from other countries. Whatever is decided, I'm sure there will plenty of demand for Lockheed's F-35. Delaying the discussions will help to alleviate any overreactions regarding the situation. At a cost of $80 million per jet, the F-35 represents strong revenue growth potential for Lockheed Martin even if the Air Force revises its original plan downward.Recently, the company signed a contract with Turkey's Roketsan to develop a mid-range cruise missile known as the SOM-J for the F-35. Another recent contract was awarded to Lockheed from the U.K. Ministry of Defence to support the Desert Hawk 3 program and to establish the small unmanned aerial system. The amount of these contracts was not released.Acquisitions are another growth driver for Lockheed. The company is currently in the process of acquiring advanced helicopter designer and producer, Sikorsky Aircraft. The addition of Sikorsky will enhance Lockheed's current defense offerings and provide the company with a new stream of revenue. Sikorsky generated about $7 billion in revenue in 2014. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2015 or the beginning of 2016.Attractively Valued on a Discounted Cash Flow BasisLockheed Martin is trading at 16X next year's expected earnings. This is slightly below the S&P 500's forward P/E of 16.5. What looks more compelling is Lockheed's valuation on a discounted cash flow basis. Using the company's WACC of 7.7% as the discount rate, I calculated a discounted cash flow analysis for Lockheed. I estimated that the company would increase free cash flow at an average of 7% annually for the next five years, 5% annually for years 6-10, and 3% annually thereafter. This gives Lockheed an intrinsic value of $244, which is 20% higher than the current price. This shows that the stock has a good margin of safety.The RisksThe company is highly dependent upon U.S. defense spending. So, Lockheed's revenue could take a hit if the amount of defense spending is reduced, since the company derives 79% of net sales from the U.S. government.The F-35 fighter jet comprised 17% of the company's net sales in 2014, and it is expected to comprise a higher percentage in future years. So, spending cuts or reduced orders for the F-35 would negatively affect Lockheed's revenue.ConclusionThere is likely no end to the world's dangers and the advanced protections that countries need to defend themselves and protect their citizens. For this reason, I think that Lockheed Martin will continue to obtain a growing amount of contracts. I also think that the company will continue to balance that with new acquisitions to continue its growth. That combination is likely to lead to increased revenue growth. The company's high ROE of 98.6% gives Lockheed a sustainable growth rate of 47.5% [1-payout ratio of 0.5179 x 98.6]. The sustainable growth rate is enough to sustain double-digit earnings growth. The company is expected to achieve earnings growth of between 11% and 12% in 2016, according to consensus estimates at Nasdaq.com. Given the attractive valuation and above-average earnings growth, I think that the stock will continue to outperform the market over at least the next year."
3477056,74695,2015-08-30T20:15:44-04:00,"While Lockheed Martin experienced a great Q2, the company has been on a slight downturn due to recent industry headwinds.Lockheed Martin continues to establish itself as a premier defense presence with its planned acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft.Lockheed Martin's strategic review of its technical services and government IT businesses is smart in light of current technology trends.Despite near-term obstacles, Lockheed Martin should move higher in the long-run given its cutting edge technology, growing presence, and improving financials.","After posting outstanding Q2 results last month, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has since erased all of its gains due to increasing industry headwinds. As the government has been facing more pressure to reduce its overall defense spending, Lockheed Martin's recent downturn is not so surprising. While Lockheed Martin may face some near-term volatility, the company is still poised for growth in the long-term. Lockheed Martin boasts an increasingly competitive market positioning through key business expansions and improving financials.Expanding Business PortfolioLockheed Martin is clearly cementing its strong market positioning, evident in its quarterly net sales of $11.6B. Not surprisingly, Aeronautics continues to be the company's main sales engine at $4.131B in Q2 sales. While Lockheed Martin is already well diversified, with huge businesses in Missiles & Fire Control, Mission Systems & Training, Space Systems, and so forth, the company is still broadening its business portfolio. Lockheed Martin's recent planned acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft is a prime example of the company's expansion mindset.Sikorsky Aircraft, which is a leader in the commercial and military helicopter industry, fits into Lockheed Martin's business extremely well. Sikorsky Aircraft already has a huge presence across the globe and is expected to have ~$6.5B in revenue for 2015 alone. With the acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft, Lockheed Martin will now be able to have full access to a multi-billion dollar market. Sikorsky Aircraft's famous product lineup of helicopters such as the MH-60R Seahawk or the H-60 Black Hawk should only bolster Lockheed Martin's reputation as the premier defense contractor.Given Sikorsky Aircraft's presence in over 40 countries, Lockheed Martin will be able to more easily meet its growth targets moving forward. In addition, both Sikorsky Aircraft and Lockheed Martin have similar business cultures, making integration much easier. This acquisition will clearly augment Lockheed Martin's current business portfolio by providing the company with cutting-edge helicopter and systems engineering technology. Lockheed Martin comes out as a clear winner in this acquisition given the numerous technology and financial synergies that should appear.Sikorsky Aircraft's large global presence should benefit Lockheed Martin.Source: Lockheed MartinBeneficial RestructuringLockheed Martin is strategically reviewing several parts of its information systems & global solution business, or more specifically its technical services and government IT segments. The businesses under review, which account for approximately $6B in revenue, will likely either be sold or spun off in an attempt to better organize the company. Such a strategic review only makes sense as the technical services and government IT sectors are only becoming more complex with the technological advances being made.Lockheed Martin will likely be better off focusing more exclusively on its core defense businesses, especially following its planned acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft. As IT arenas like cybersecurity become increasingly advanced, Lockheed Martin may not be able to compete with the IT pure plays of the industry. Given that Lockheed Martin obtains the vast majority of its revenues from arenas outside of technical services and government IT, these businesses could become more of a distraction moving forward. By separating these segments from its core businesses, Lockheed Martin should be able to create more value for its shareholders.Improving Balance SheetLockheed Martin is set to continue its strong financial performance after its excellent Q2. With Q2 net sales of $11.6B and net earnings of $929M, the company is well on track to meet and even beat its full-year guidance. As Lockheed Martin is performing above expectations on nearly all of its business segments, the company has much to look forward to. Not surprisingly, Lockheed Martin is increasing its 2015 operating profit and EPS forecasts. With ~$1.3B in cash from operations as of Q2, Lockheed Martin's balance sheet is extremely robust.RisksThe defense segment is still a relatively volatile business as much of the industry is determined by unpredictable geopolitics. Lockheed Martin's recent minor downturn is evidence of this, as the company has been affected by pressures to reduce government defense spending. In the long-run, however, Lockheed Martin should continue to outperform as global conflicts do not look to be cooling down anytime soon. Furthermore, Lockheed Martin is well-diversified across the globe, further reducing potential volatility.ConclusionLockheed Martin will likely continue its long-term upsurge given its improving market positioning. With its huge acquisition of Sikorsky, Lockheed Martin has cemented its presence on all the major defense arenas. As such, Lockheed Martin still has much more room to grow at a market capitalization of $63.3B, especially considering the growing unrest around the world. With some of the world's most advanced technology systems at its disposal, Lockheed Martin is set to continue its dominance in the defense space."

It's the largest, most expensive weapons program in the history of the Department of Defense, and if you believe everything the news says it's a complete debacle, a terrible plane, and the program should be canceled or drastically cut. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is the prime contractor for the plane and the company's future growth hinges on how the JSF program ultimately turns out. (Note: Throughout this article we will use the acronym JSF or the airplane's designation of F-35 interchangeably to refer to the program.)The JSF Program's FutureLet's get one thing out of the way first. There is no way the program is going to be canceled or seriously scaled down. The JSF program is spread out over 44 states and Puerto Rico. Too many important congressional districts contain jobs from the JSF program. Heck, even the king of advocating cuts to wasteful DoD programs, John McCain has started to change his tune and support the program. During a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing in March he's quoted as saying ""After suffering years of unacceptable cost growth and schedule delays, the program appears to have started to stabilize."" McCain and his office were also quick to come out and defend the program when a report about the F-35 ""losing"" a dogfight to an older F-16 was leaked last week.The F-35 program is also ""too big to fail."" Modern fighter jets take about a decade to go from an RFP until they are first accepted into service. At this point, however flawed the F-35 may be, there is simply no other option. With the shutdown of the F-22 production line the F-35 is now the only 5th generation fighter available, and it will remain the only 5th generation fighter available for at least the next decade. This is particularly true in the case of the F-35B STOVL variant which is slated to replace the Marine Corp's ancient 1970s era AV-8B Harriers. The Marine Corp has called that version essential and said that they have no plan B. There are not even any new STOVL aircraft designs even being considered by any country.The F-35 Program Will Likely Mirror the F-16 ProgramWhile the F-35 is over budget and behind schedule it's not the unmitigated disaster many make it out to be. In fact, the F-35 program looks a whole lot like the widely successful F-16 program (the F-16 is one of the most widely produced Western fighter aircraft with 4,500 sold to over 25 different countries) in its early years.The F-35 is being produced the same way the F-16 was, using a block scheduled concurrency program. Concurrency means that the different design and production phases of the aircraft overlap and the plane is being brought into service before all its final features are completed. This concurrency model may be responsible for some of the cost overruns and is also responsible for the initial underwhelming performance of the F-35. For example, in the article I cited at the beginning where an F-35 lost to an F-16 in a mock dogfight, the F-35 did not have its special stealth coating applied, the pilot did not have the correct helmet (the helmet for the F-35 contains critical targeting features), and did not have a complete, up to date software package among other issues. Block scheduling means that features are added to future production runs (blocks) and if necessary retrofitted onto previous blocks in order to keep costs low. Unfortunately, like with concurrency this means that the F-35's coming off the production run right now are not at their full potential.All of this is similar to how the F-16 was produced. Right now there are 15 different blocks of F-16s with over 138 different versions between all the blocks. The early F-16 program also struggled with cost overruns with the initial concept of the LWF (Lightweight Fighter as the early program was known) projected to cost $3M each but eventually costing around $4.6M for the early production version. The F-16 also suffered from early teething problems with cockpit, engine, and canopy issues.The F-35 is likely to follow a similar lifecycle. The DoD has made some missteps along the line such as starting off production at low numbers which increases costs rather than starting production at high numbers as with the F-16. However, the F-35's lack of competition and too big to fail status ensure that despite the DoD's production order blunder the F-35 will stick around. The program is likely to meet its goal of at least 3,000 aircraft produced over the next 50 years. Once newer block changes are put into production and costs are driven down the program should mirror the success of the F-16 and drive Lockheed's profits over the coming decades. In fact if Lockheed is able to meet its $80M per unit target the plane should be a wild success. Heck, even if it's able to get to $100M orders should take off.So what will Lockheed look like in the future with the JSF program?Modeling Lockheed's Future with the JSFWe know from Lockheed's latest 10-K that the JSF program accounted for 17% of the company's revenues in FY2014. In FY2014 Lockheed Martin brought in around $13.8B in JSF revenue and $41.4B in on JSF program revenue. The F-35 program is projected to eventually make up 25% of Lockheed's revenue. We've projected Lockheed's non F-35 revenue to rise at the general rate of the Department of Defense's average projected budget growth of 3% from FY2015 to FY2019.We've modeled out what the financials for Lockheed might look like in several years time. An explanation follows the chart below.As we stated earlier we projected non JSF revenue to rise for the next three years by 3%. We then worked out what JSF revenue would need to reach to be around 25% of the Lockheed's total revenue. We projected operating margins of 12.5%. This is aggressive but the F-16 is Lockheed's most profitable product and the JSF should approach that status as well in the future. We then subtracted $340M in interest expenses. We used a tax rate of 31% which was approximately Lockheed's average tax rate over the past three years.We used 311.7M shares outstanding computed from Lockheed Martin's latest 10Q. Finally we put an 18x multiple on Lockheed's EPS. This is the upper range of the long term average (using Value Line's numbers) for Lockheed Martin over the past decade and a half. Considering the stock market trades around 19 times earnings we believe a P/E of 18 is appropriate at this time.Finally, we discounted the per share value back to the present day (back three years) using a discount rate of 10%.As you can see Lockheed Martin's shares are priced to essentially earn 10% over the next few years. Given the elevated valuations in the market today we think Lockheed Martin is still attractively priced and particularly suited to dividend investors (it has about a 3% yield) and more conservative investors who wish to ride out recent global events such as China's stock market crash (Lockheed does no business with China and probably won't for the foreseeable future) and the probable next round of the Greece debt crisis (Lockheed only gets 20% of its revenue overseas)."

In doing so, I will be reviewing each stock based on the following characteristics:Since all investors are not the same, I believe that looking at companies through a range of lenses is useful in determining the worth of specific stocks. In my review, I will be comparing the two stocks on individual metrics, and then tallying the results of those values to determine a winning stock for each category.STABILITYThe purpose of this category is determine which stock has the best overall financial position, possessing a stable and consistent balance sheet and overall value.Return on AssetsLockheed Martin has the advantage in terms of ROA with a value of 9.43% compared to a 5.49% value for Boeing.Return on Invested CapitalLockheed Martin maintains the advantage when it comes to ROIC as well with a value of 33.26% versus 27.23% for Boeing.Earnings YieldOver the past year, the earnings yield of these two companies have held fairly close to one another, with Boeing currently having a very slight advantage.BA Earnings Yield (TTM) data by YChartsBook ValueOver the past five years, Boeing has increased its book value by over 50%, while Lockheed Martin's book value per share decreased significantly.BA Book Value (Per Share) data by YChartsOutstanding SharesBoth companies have done a good job at lowering their outstanding share count over the past five years, with Lockheed Martin seeing the larger decrease.BA Shares Outstanding data by YChartsSummaryIn the stability section, I feel that Lockheed Martin is the winner. With stronger returns on assets and invested capital, I think it is the more stable of the two stocks. The decline in book value is a concern, but since 2014, it has actually been Boeing that has seen the larger drop in book value.BA Book Value (Per Share) data by YChartsGROWTHThe purpose of this category is to determine which stock has seen the most growth over the past several years and which stock is likely to continue seeing the most growth in the future.Revenue GrowthBoth companies have seen revenue growth over the past ten years, but Boeing's growth has been far more significant, especially in the past few years.BA Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsEarnings GrowthWhile Boeing has seen the greater revenue growth over the past ten years, it is Lockheed Martin that has seen the highest earnings growth during the same stretch of time.BA EPS Basic (TTM) data by YChartsProfit MarginLockheed Martin maintains the higher profit margin with a value of 7.93% compared to a 5.55% margin for Boeing.Return On EquityLockheed Martin's ROE is nearly double that of Boeing with a value of 95.74% vs. Boeing's' 51.30%.Stock Price GrowthWhile both stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 over the past ten years, Lockheed Martin has seen significantly higher returns.^SPX data by YChartsSummaryI believe that Lockheed Martin wins this category as well. While Boeing has seen the largest revenue growth over the past ten years, Lockheed Martin has outperformed in each of the other four metrics.VALUEThe purpose of this category is to judge each stock's current value to determine which one is more attractively priced.PE ratiosThe trailing PE ratios of these two companies are nearly identical at 17.70x (for Lockheed Martin) and 17.04x (for Boeing). Boeing is slightly more attractive based on its forward PE ratio of 15.76x compared to 17.66x for Lockheed Martin.Price to Book ValueBoeing has the lower price to book value compared to Lockheed Martin and has consistently done so over the past few years.BA Price to Book Value data by YChartsPrice to Free Cash Flow ValueThis value has been sporadic for both stocks recently with each company taking turns at who has the lower value. Currently, it is Boeing that is more attractive based on price to free cash flow.BA Price to Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YChartsSummaryBoeing is clearly the more attractively priced stock at this point based on trailing/forward PE and PEG ratios along with price to book, and price to cash flow values.DEFENSEThe purpose of this category is to judge how well each stock will hold up during a recession. I will be looking at both dividends and past performance to score this.Dividend HistoryBoth stocks pay dividends with similar yields: 2.93% for Lockheed Martin and 2.76% for Boeing.Over the past five years, Boeing's dividend has increased by 116.70%, while Lockheed Martin's dividend has increased by 138.10%.Price Returns During Prior RecessionsDuring the 2007-09 recession, both stocks significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with Boeing seeing the worst decline in its stock price.^SPX data by YChartsDuring the 2001 recession, Boeing once again underperformed the market, while Lockheed Martin outperformed with strong price appreciation.^SPX data by YChartsSummaryI don't feel that either stock is a great defensive investment option, but if I had to pick one it would be Lockheed Martin. It has the stronger dividend with a higher yield and higher growth over the past five years. It also has performed better during the past two most recent recessions.ConclusionOut of the two stocks, I feel that Lockheed Martin is the better long term option right now for most investors. I believe it has stronger fundamental financials along with a stronger history of earnings growth and stock price appreciation. The company has had most good news recently with a new $1.5B missile deal, Marine Corps approval of its F-35B fighter aircraft, and strong recent quarterly results.The company did miss out on the Humvee replacement contract, but its strong quarterly results and the company's increase in full year earnings forecast lead me to believe that Lockheed Martin will continue to perform well moving forward.Boeing has also had some good recent news, with a $1.5B Navy jet deal, but has also had to deal with the recent class action 401k lawsuit and plans to cut several hundred jobs in its satellite unit after a large contract from ABS was cancelled.Unlike Lockheed Martin, Boeing actually lowered forward earnings estimates and appears to have some cash flow concerns. In the near term, I think Lockheed Martin will clearly be the winner, but Boeing remains a strong long term play at its current price for investors looking for a value stock. As always, I suggest individual investors perform their own research before making any investment decisions."
3386895,91235,2015-08-02T02:59:27-04:00,"Lockheed Martin, a once profitable company, has been facing pressures from all sides due to US government budget reductions and other factors.The Company has projected reductions in top-line and mid-line growth, and the Company’s stock has reflected those reductions.Investors should invest in Lockheed Martin for stability, not growth.","A mammoth among defense contractors, Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT) has provided services in the defense, space, intelligence, homeland security, and information technology arenas since 1995. Over the past several years, Lockheed Martin has amassed an attractive and profitable portfolio of projects within its segments, including the F-35 Lightening II Joint Strike Fighter, the C-130 Hercules, the C-5M Super Galaxy, the LANTIRN fire control systems program, and the Aegis Combat System project, among many others. The Company has returned substantially all of the free cash flow generated from these projects to the shareholders in the form of hefty dividends and share buyback programs, and it has consistently increased its share buyback program in previous fiscal years. The chart below details the Company's activity in returning shareholders' investments.Source: LMT Company SEC FilingsAnd investors have realized Lockheed Martin's generosity. Over the past five years, the price of Lockheed Martin's stock has skyrocketed from the mid to upper-50s to the mid-200s, giving a return on investment of around 300% and leaving the S&P 500 in the dust.Source: Stockcharts.comOf course, to return this much value to shareholders, Lockheed Martin must find extremely profitable projects to invest in, and in this regard, the Company has succeeded in a spectacular fashion. If investors take a look at the Company's return on invested capital over the past several years, they'll notice an ever-increasing metric that is in-line with the Company's increasing profitability.Source: LMT Company SEC FillingsAlthough top-line growth has slowed to a trickle, with some fiscal years even returning negative top-line growth, bottom-line growth has done fairly well. With the Company's share buyback programs, this translates into explosive earnings per share growth. Over the past five years, earnings per share increased from $7.81 to $11.21, representing a CAGR of 9.5%. With the Company's stable operating cash flow and backlog, investors can expect earnings per share to only increase in the future.However, hidden beneath this rosy picture is a more somber, realistic image. While Lockheed Martin has been extremely profitable in the past, this may not be the case anymore. Geopolitical events in the past have turned the tides in the Company's favor, but as global macro events continue to put pressure on governments to reduce spending and initiate sequestration measures, companies such as Lockheed Margin, which obtain substantially all of their revenue from government contracts, have started to feel the pain.This could be a major problem for Lockheed Martin. In fiscal year 2014, the Company obtained 79% of its revenues from the US government. 59% of these sales were from the Department of Defense. With US government debt mounting, US politicians are being pressured to reduce spending on ""extraneous"" items, one of which is considered military spending. The numbers are truly frightening: Currently, US debt stands at around $18.6T dollars, and it is expected to grow to $21.7T by the end of fiscal year 2015. By the time 2019 hits, the debt could be as much as $25T.Source: usgovernmentspending.comAs a result of these pressures, Lockheed Margin may not be as profitable as it once was. Investors have factored this into their investment decisions regarding the Company, as evidenced by the Company's one year stock chart. Since late 2014, the Company's stock price has been bouncing around price barriers of the low-180s to the 200s ever since.Source: Stockcharts.comTensions mounting abroad, global macro events that are indicating more and more weaknesses in the world's developed and emerging economies, and drastic reductions in the US government's budget all have had a deleterious effect on the Company, and Lockheed Martin has reflected this in its fiscal year 2015 predictions. The Company expects top-line growth to continue to be relatively stagnated. In addition to declines in operating profit margins, operating profit growth will most likely decline as well.So, going forward, what should investors do? The Company will most likely not return to its once profitable levels in the past several years due to the above mentioned events, so investors who continue to place their faith in Lockheed Martin should dig in for the long haul. With technology improving all the time, someone will need to provide the ever-evolving sword and shield, and Lockheed Martin will be there to do so in the future. Investors should invest in Lockheed Martin for stability, not growth, in the coming months and years.For those investors looking to open a position, it would be wise to wait until after market turbulence has worked its way out of the system. Buying on the rebound of any share drop would be a great opportunity to invest in Lockheed Martin."
3530306,59781,2015-09-24T02:14:56-04:00,"Lockheed Martin has done well, even in the face of budget cuts.
        Lockheed Martin has increased dividends by double digits for 12 years.
        The company is likely to reward shareholders with an 11% annual return going forward.","Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has a long tradition supplying the U.S. Army as well as allied nations around the world with high quality weapons systems.It's had its ups and downs but the Company has fared well even during the U.S. defence budget cuts over the last couple of years. It seems like wars are not going away anytime soon.LMT data by YChartsAs can be seen on the chart above, the company's stock value has actually more than tripled over the last five years. During this time, investors have also enjoyed a very nice and growing dividend.Historical Dividend GrowthLockheed Martin has paid out quarterly dividends for a number of years, at least as far back as 1995. The level of the dividend, however, has been somewhat erratic over the years. In the year 2000, the quarterly dividend seemed to stabilize on $0.11 and remained there until 2002.In January 2003, it was hiked to $0.12 before it was almost doubled just a couple of quarters later to $0.22 per share. From then on out, the dividend hike has been regularly announced every September. Furthermore, the magnitude of the hikes have been impressive. In fact, considering the eleven years from September 2003 until the latest hike in September 2014, the dividend went up by a compound annual growth rate of 18.8% from $0.22 per share to $1.50 per share.LMT Dividend data by YChartsThough the dividend growth has been truly impressive, we can observe that the payout ratio has also increased. Granted, the ratio was extremely conservative at around 34% back in 2011 but, as everybody knows, the payout ratio cannot increase forever.Ultimately, dividend growth needs to be supported by earnings. Still, a payout ratio of 52% is still conservative so investors can rest assured that the current payout ratio is sustainable and can even increase slightly over time.The more recent trend, from 2013 until now, indicates that the Board is quite happy with a payout ratio of around 50%. If this is the case going forward, future dividend hikes will be quite closely tied to EPS growth. The Board seems committed to rewarding its shareholders with steadily rising dividends.September Dividend HikeLate every September, the Board of Lockheed Martin announces a nice little autumn gift to its shareholders, namely the annual dividend hike.Last year this gift represented an increase of 13%. As a matter of fact, this hefty hike was the lowest in years. The year before it had been hiked by 15% and the years before it had been hiked by between 15% and 33%. Even so, I doubt investors were complaining. After all, the increase marked the 12th annual double digit increase.So we now know the Board is serious about rewarding shareholders and that the Board is likely to continue doing so. It is also likely, given this history of impressive annual dividend growth rates, that the next hike will be in the double digits. However, if the Board wants to continue having a conservative payout-ratio, EPS growth must be at least something close to double digits for this to happen.Its latest earnings release revealed that EPS is probably not going to grow by double digits. Still, the company increased its EPS guidance for the year from a range of $10.85-$11.15 to a range of $11.00-$11.30. The company thus seems quite confident in its operations even though EPS growth rates are not stellar.As the Board proudly proclaimed its 12 year double digit increase last year and things are going well, they are unlikely not to continue that tradition. I therefore consider an increase of 10% a floor. Its year-over-year EPS growth rate last quarter was 6.5%. This does not give much room to increase the dividend too much, if the Board still wants a conservative payout-ratio. On the other hand, a glance at the historical dividends shows that they usually go for fairly round numbers. A quarterly dividend of $1.70 for a growth rate of 13% is thus not out of the question. It is likely that the Board will put more emphasis on continuing this strong tradition than on keeping the payout ratio around the 50% level.Based on the analysis above I believe the Board will hike the dividend by between 10% and 13% for a new quarterly dividend in the range of $1.65-$1.70. I am quite confident it will not be hiked more than that.Risk FactorsThe funny thing about the defence industry is that the more risky the world gets, the more business opportunities there will be for these companies. As such the turmoil in the Middle East might present an increasing market opportunity for Lockheed Martin both for operations by NATO countries and for increasing sales to allies like Saudi Arabia. However, a real risk is that the U.S. Government will be more careful about which countries Lockheed is allowed to sell to so that one doesn't risk meeting your owns weapons against you on the battleground. Also, some countries are increasingly focusing on building up their own defence industries, this has been especially evident in India. Admittedly, it is a difficult task but nonetheless presents a real risk for Lockheed. Currency movements are also a risk. Since Lockheed Martin reports in U.S. dollars but sells around the world, a strengthening dollar hurts profits as reported in dollars.Current ValuationAll potential investments need to pass the valuation test in order to make a nice addition to any value-oriented investor's portfolio. So let's have a look at how Lockheed Martin stacks up to its competition.I have chosen two other American defence contractors as Lockheed's peer group, namely Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) and Raytheon (RTN).Source: MorningstarAmazingly, all three companies are tied on the Price/Sales ratio at 1.4x. Raytheon wins the Price/Earnings category with Lockheed being the most expensive. On the other hand, Lockheed wins the dividend yield competition.Overall Northrop is probably the least favorably priced. Raytheon has a compelling valuation while Lockheed can entice investors with the most juicy dividend yield. If I had to choose between these three, I would go for either Raytheon or Lockheed Martin.All companies above are priced attractively as compared to the S&P 500 which trades at a Price/Earnings ratio of 18.4x.Over the long term, if we assume that the valuation level stays the same, investors can expect total annual returns equal to the annual EPS growth plus the dividend yield. According to the analyst community, Lockheed is expected to grow EPS by an annual rate over the next five years of 8.0%. Adding in the current dividend yield of 3.0%, investors can expect an annual return of 11.0%. That is slightly above what one can expect from the broader market over time. Given conservative characteristics and its non-cyclical nature I believe this stock should be part of a defensive (pun intended) dividend growth portfolio.ConclusionLockheed Martin has a long tradition of protecting the U.S. and its allies. During the last decade, this company has also started taking more care of its investors, both by an impressive rise in its stock price and nice annual dividend raises. The company is likely to continue growing forward and reward patient shareholders with continued dividend growth. Conservative dividend growth investors should add Lockheed to their portfolios."
3353945,89326,2015-07-24T04:41:26-04:00,"Lockheed Martin expects $1.9 billion in cumulative tax benefits and $150 annual cost synergies as a result of Sikorsky Aircraft acquisition.Applying FCFF valuation technique, this translates into $11.25 accretion over current share price.Apart from this deal, the stock already appears $12.64 undervalued on stand-alone basis.","On July 20, 2015, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) announced to acquire Sikorsky Aircraft, the world's leading helicopter manufacturer, for $9 billion. Coupled with 2QFY15 earnings beat and increased guidance for FY15, the stock concluded the day up 1.96% at $205.13.At first Sikorsky takeover appears as an expensive deal; however, the company management expects $1.9 billion of cumulative tax benefits associated with the transaction in the near future. Moreover, it estimates $150 million of annual cost synergies as a result of this combination. It is also pertinent to mention here that Sikorsky Aircraft exhibits higher operating margin when compared with Lockheed Martin's.Lockheed Martin share price is up 3.77% year-to-date (YTD). Over a longer horizon, the stock soared 174.30% in the last five years. This capital gain excludes quarterly dividends of cents the company pays at the conclusion of each quarter. In comparison, the broader market, S&P 500 Index, gained 98.52% during the same period.I wanted to take an in-depth look on Sikorsky acquisition and evaluate its impact on Lockheed Martin share price within one year or so. The management anticipates this deal to conclude by FY15 end or during the first quarter next year (1QFY16).The scheme of this article is to estimate Lockheed Martin stock value on stand-alone basis, perform Sikorsky Aircraft financial analysis, and then assess Lockheed Martin's share worth following the combination.Financial ValuationHere is an excerpt of Lockheed Martin's financial performance over the last six years. Every figure is based on US GAAP disclosure and presented in billions of dollars, except for percentages.Source: Company 10-KsLockheed Martin revenues have stayed around the same level during the last few years. It seems that the company's focus rests on adding profitable revenues rather than just expanding its top-line footprint.Operating margin has rebounded from its near-term trough of 8.65% in FY11 and is now targeting 12.43% in FY15. I project Lockheed Martin to maintain the latter mentioned level through the end of this decade.Other measures are forecasted on the basis of their respective historical averages. The notion of using past averages is relevant in this case, given the stable nature of these trends.The following table summarizes the key assumptions utilized in projecting free cash flows to firm (FCFFs) until 2020. A terminal FCFF growth of 0.13% is guesstimated following the studied period.Lockheed Martin has been targeting debt to value (D/V) ratio of 12% during the last three years. I presume the company to maintain this ratio by the end of this decade. The necessary inputs aided in estimating weighted average cost of capital (WACC) are tabulated as follows.By applying discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation model, enterprise value is found to be $74.52 billion. After deducting $7.95 billion of long-term debt, fair value of equity came in at $66.57 billion. With 309 million shares outstanding, intrinsic worth of Lockheed Martin stock is $215.43. The stock is 6.23% undervalued on stand-alone basis.The revenue growth pattern of Sikorsky Aircraft is no materially different than that of Lockheed Martin. However, its operating margin is slightly better than the latter's, and capital spending and depreciation ratios are around half in comparison with Lockheed Martin. Below is a snapshot provided to elaborate these trends in detail.Source: United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX) 10-Ks Following the acquisition, Sikorsky is expected to exhibit similar trends in the future. Therefore, annual averages of these financial metrics are mentioned that assisted in projecting the segment's financials.Combining the projected financials of both entities was rather an easy task. For the sake of simplicity, I assume similar tax rate and working capital investment ratio for combined company. In the capital expenditure row, I counted Sikorsky acquisition to cost $7.1 billion in FY15 (since Lockheed Martin anticipates present value of tax benefits of $1.9 billion associated with this transaction). The table below depicts the financial performance of Lockheed Martin over the coming years.Moreover, post-merger WACC is supposed to remain similar to pre-merger level. Thus, the company will maintain the same D/V for its Sikorsky segment as of other operations.By assuming terminal FCFF growth of 0.13% and applying DCF valuation method, enterprise value elevated to $79.20 billion. After subtracting $9.15 billion of long-term debt, intrinsic worth of Lockheed Martin equity is estimated at $70.05 billion. With 309 million shares outstanding, this corresponds to fair stock value of $226.68.Conclusion Acquiring Sikorsky Aircraft is another financially and strategically apt decision for Lockheed Martin. In financial terms, this transaction is $11.25 accretive to Lockheed Martin stock. On top of that, the stock is already $12.64 undervalued on stand-alone basis. Therefore, the stock offers 11.78%, or $23.89, upside over current trading price. In my opinion, these (latent) profits will be fully realized by the conclusion of this deal."

Due diligence will be required to keep tabs on new developments.Overall Lockheed is strong. As the worlds #1 defense contractor with good earnings and dividends, they're a great long-term addition to a portfolio.","The GoodLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is purchasing Sikorsky from United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) for $9 billion. The deal will add the BlackHawk Helicopter to the world's largest defense contractor's arsenal. It is worth noting that the deal involves a tax benefit that will bring the total purchase down to $7.1 billion.The famous Sikorsky Helicopter business is the largest in the world by sales. Lockheed is already at the forefront of jets with the F-35 (which is getting close to combat readiness), why not takeover the helicopter industry while they're at it? In fact, the helicopter maker could help to create more diversified sales figures for Lockheed. As of now, the F-35 fighter jet represents 20% of the firm's sales. Sikorsky will help the firm become less reliant upon one plane. Overall this merger is a good fit for Lockheed considering they have been doing business with Sikorsky for years on the Presidential helicopter as well as a rescue chopper that is currently in the works.Lockheed has been posting strong numbers leading up to this deal. Both earnings per share and dividends have been good to investors with steady increases over the past 4 years. The firm's Q2 results were strong with profits, earnings per share, and sales climbing from last year. Their problem has been stagnant revenue growth. The Sikorsky deal is just the ticket to jump start revenues. Forecasts for this year have Lockheed Martin hitting revenues of around $45 billion. The Sikorsky deal could add $6.5 billion to those figures; while executives have recently expressed their aim to bring revenues up to $10 billion. $51.5 billion in revenues would be the highest for the firm in over a decade. This growth will provide the fuel needed for Lockheed to continue their dividend growth and create opportunities for increased earnings per share. These are obviously both good things for shareholders.A comfort one can have with Lockheed is that the stock truly reacts to good earnings growth. As you can see in the 5 year chart below, buyers like the stock.(Source: Nasdaq.com)The Sikorsky purchase isn't the only thing going for Lockheed right now. They've been bringing in a slew of contracts.-The firm is working with Boeing (NYSE:BA) on bids for a contract for new bombers with the Air Force.-They're working on congressional approval for $2.5 billion worth of upgrades for South Korean F-16's.-A $119 million contract for contractor logistics to Iraq's F-16's.-$480 million for assessments of Air Force C-130J aircraft.-Potential $237 million in spares packages for the F-35 Fleet.-A missile systems contract for $8 million which options that will bring the value up to $58.9 million.These are just business deals that have taken place recently.The BadAt first glance, the additional revenue from Sikorsky might make one properly assume that revenues to pass $50 billion this year. This could be true if Lockheed were to keep the rest of the company doing ""business as usual"". However, Lockheed is in discussion about leaving parts of its IT businesses. The segments are involved in government IT infrastructure and tech services within its MFC(missiles and fire control) segment. Lockheed claims the segments they are considering selling or doing away with represent a little less than half of the $16.5 billion the MFC and Government IT infrastructure divisions made last year.Now I would assume that there is a reason they wish to be rid of these business segments. As a whole it seems the firm is trying to refocus itself into material businesses and out of infrastructure/IT. It is still worth noting that losing $6 billion in revenues from these businesses would offset the revenues gained from the Sikorsky deal. Until all of this restructuring is completed, revenue growth may not come to fruition.A Worthy Investment?It is possible that until their asset moves are completed that the firm could experience some turbulence. While the Sikorsky deal certainly makes them the most competitive in defense, it will also pressure their finances. The firm only has $3 billion in cash and is going to take on new debt in the short term. While the firm spins off tech assets and integrates the helicopter maker, profit margins could go in the cross-fire. Perhaps it's best to watch closely on exactly what Lockheed plans to do with its possible segment sales before buying in. If they maneuver the revenues as I discussed above Lockheed could have another year of stagnant (and confusing) revenues ahead.All that being said, I like Lockheed Martin. They have a good dividend. They're posting great earnings. They're the most trusted name in defense. As F-35 fighters become a real part of our armed forces, they are going to offer continued years of income for the firm. If the firm experiences some volatility in the short term, so what? Winners pick the long game and Lockheed's move into helicopters will help cement its place at the top of national defense. Furthermore, revenues have been flat for a few years now and the firm is still finding ways to eek out stronger earnings. Take on the long term investment and enjoy the 3% dividend while you're at it."

Firstly, LMT announced the acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft on an attractive multiple, taking into account almost $2 billion in tax benefits. The company also intends to divest some of its IT and Technical Services businesses. Likely cost savings from the Sikorsky deal are significant, plus potential revenue enhancement is very high, but even with only the former factored into my DCF model, I conservatively conclude a fair value of $226 per share.Lockheed Martin, the globally focused aerospace companyLockheed Martin is Headquartered in Maryland, but is focused globally on security and aerospace. It operates in the areas of research, design & development, manufacture & sustainment of advanced technological systems, products and services. LMT operates five business segments; Aeronautics, Space Systems, Information Systems & Global Solutions ""IS&GS"", Missiles and Fire Control ""MFC"" and Mission Systems and Training ""MST"". The chart below summarizes LMT's likely revenue breakdown in FY'15e by activity.Very solid Q2-15 results, mainly driven by higher aircraft deliveries, guidance raisedLMT's Q2-15 results were solid, with group net sales ahead by some 3% to $11.6 billion. This was mainly driven by the Aeronautics division which reported sales ahead by 7% to $4.1 billion due to a greater number of aircraft deliveries, as shown in the table below. Furthermore, LMT generated $1.3billion in cash from operations in the quarter and returned $1.4 billion of cash to shareholders, including $937 million of repurchased stocks. LMT has raised its FY'15 guidance for operating profit and earnings per share slightly, which highlights the positive momentum in the business.Acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft; a great deal with two key positivesLockheed Martin has announced the acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft, another globally focused business, which designs, manufactures and supports military and commercial helicopters. Around 75% of Sikorsky's revenues are derived from military customers and around 50% of revenues are derived from operations in some 20 foreign countries with its products used in 40 countries. Sikorsky's revenues are likely to be around $6.5 billion in FY'15, from customers already familiar with LMT and from a strong aftermarket business which is a key revenue and earnings driver. In addition to these favorable factors, there are two further key positives that come to mind; firstly access to Section 338(h)(10) of the US tax system is likely to provide some $2 billion of tax benefits from the business combination and secondly, via Sikorsky, LMT now has access to the global rotary-wing market, estimated to be worth around $30 billion in annual sales revenues.DCF valuation suggests $226 per share, with only moderate Sikorsky deal synergies assumedOn the assumption that LMT completes the Sikorsky deal by the end of 2015, annual cost synergies of around $150 million are likely to flow one year later. LMT will acquire Sikorsky for $9 billion which represents an acquisition multiple of only 10x historic EBITDA (net of tax benefit), a low multiple in my view. My DCF valuation model illustrates a fair value of $226 per share, which along with a near 3% dividend yield, looks attractive."

        Technical indicators suggest that investors are overly bullish on shares of Lockheed Martin ahead of earnings.
        Stable revenue growth and high shareholder profitability make Lockheed Martin a solid long-term investment position.","Security and defense leader Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT) reports FY2015 Q2 earnings before market opens on Tuesday, July 21st. Ahead of earnings, LMT shares have surged almost 9% over a three week period.Many technical indicators suggest that the recent momentum in LMT's stock is too bullish. LMT is currently trading above its Bollinger Bands. Furthermore, LMT's divergence between signal and MACD is at abnormally high levels. Both indicators suggest overly-bullish momentum.Going into earnings, we believe the downside of a miss is a greater than the upside of a beat, making it a high-risk earnings play. That being said, we believe LMT has long term upside even at its current price.Lockheed Martin's largest segment of business is its F-35 fighter jet project. Last quarter, sales of F-35's made up approximately 19% of LMT's total net sales. Even though development on the F-35 began in 2001, the jet is still very early in its life cycle. The jet is still considered in development phase; however, the US Marines are very close to being the first military unit to declare the project operational. Once declared operational, the F-35 will have a very long life cycle; deliveries of the plane are expected to continue until 2037. In addition, margins on F-35 production will improve as the project moves farther away from the development stage. LMT has locked in stable revenue in their largest segment for at least 20 years.LMT also has significant upside in other sectors of its business. The US DoD budget was expanded this year after many years of trending decline since 2007, and it is expected to grow steadily for the foreseeable future based on currently known contracts. LMT's diversified catalog of products and services in cybersecurity, information systems, space technology, and robotics positions the company well in a growing defense market.Beyond known contracts, LMT has a number of potential home-run products. Lockheed Martin is leading innovation in the fields of energy, biomechanical engineering, and nanotechnology. LMT's innovation pipeline is filled with transformative projects with military and commercial applications.LMT is a strong candidate for a long-term investment. On top of a stable projected revenue growth and an innovative product pipeline, LMT is highly profitable for shareholders thanks to a healthy dividend and consistent share buybacks. We believe that LMT has healthy upside at its current price, but technical indicators suggest a pullback is likely if the company doesn't beat considerably on estimates during the current quarter. Investors looking to initiate a long-term position in LMT should consider taking a smaller position before earnings to manage the risks of a disappointing earnings report."
3318035,74695,2015-07-11T12:09:34-04:00,"While Lockheed Martin has underperformed over the past few months, the company's prospects are bright.Lockheed Martin will benefit from industry tailwinds, notably in the form of an increasingly technologized defense segment.Recent concerns about the F-35's dogfighting capabilities are overblown, as the aircraft was not made for close-quarters combat.Lockheed martin does face some obstacles, notably in the form of increased competition in the aerospace segment.","Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has experienced a slight downturn over the past few months, declining approximately 5%-10% from its peak. Despite the markets' increasingly pessimistic view of Lockheed Martin, there are many reasons to believe that the stock still has a good deal of upside. Lockheed Martin is involved in an increasingly high-barrier defense industry, which puts it in a great position as it currently dominates this arena. The company's close relationship with some of the world's largest governments only further cements its foothold in the defense markets. On top of being the largest defense contractor for the United States, Lockheed Martin is a huge supplier to countries like Israel, Germany, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea.Not only does Lockheed Martin have an extremely secure market positioning in a hugely profitable arena, but the company will also benefit from long-term industry trends. From the increasingly technological nature of war to the growing importance of cyber warfare, Lockheed Martin is in a great position moving forward. Many recent investor concerns about the company are completely overblown, particularly involving the functionality of the costly F-35. Lockheed Martin will likely continue to outperform the market as it has over the past few years.Favorable Industry TrendsThe defense industry has become noticeably more technologized over the past few decades. Such a trend is only natural given the dramatically improving utility of technology. As the military and other defense arenas have become more reliant on technology, Lockheed Martin's prospects have skyrocketed. As Lockheed Martin's core products (i.e. aircraft, guided weapons, ground vehicles, etc.) are now essential for combat, the company has benefited enormously from this technology trend. Furthermore, this technology trend is only accelerating.With the recent advances in fields such as artificial intelligence and robotics, the defense industry is set to completely transform. Lockheed Martin is currently at the forefront of this transformation, and will undoubtedly gain as a result. The use of unmanned systems, for instance, has grown dramatically over the past decade. In fact, technologies such as predator drones are now used on a regular basis, whereas such drones were nearly unheard of at the turn of the century. Lockheed Martin is a leader in this arena, with unmanned aircraft such as its Fury, Desert Hawk, Indago, etc. Although it is not clear exactly what percent of market share Lockheed Martin has in this arena, as the entire UAV market currently only stands in the single digit billions, the company is clearly involved in cutting-edge drone technology.Lockheed Martin is also on the forefront of experimental, yet highly promising technologies such as exoskeletons. The company has developed some of the most advanced military exoskeletons such as the HULC, which is capable of greatly augmenting soldier speed and strength. As such emerging technologies will open up many new revenue streams moving forward, Lockheed Martin is in an extremely great position to profit given its heavy involvement in such technologies. As raw manpower becomes less important and technology becomes paramount in the defense arena, Lockheed Martin is set to gain enormously.Lockheed Martin's heavy involvement in the cybersecurity arena should also add enormous value to the company moving forward. The company is currently ranked in 10th place among cybersecurity companies, according to Cybersecurity 500, which uses metrics such as market share, forecasts, innovativeness, and other important metrics. It would not be surprising to see Lockheed Martin shoot up the rankings in this $71B market, as it has resources that many pure play cybersecurity firms do not have. Currently, cybersecurity only accounts for about 10% of the company's $7.8B (revenue in 2014) Information Systems & Global Solutions business.As one of the largest government cybersecurity defense contractors, Lockheed Martin is particularly well suited for the current cybersecurity environment. In fact, the U.S. government just experienced the largest hack in its history, which makes Lockheed Martin's cybersecurity business more relevant than ever. As cyber attacks grow in sophistication and frequency, as has been happening, demand for Lockheed Martin's cybersecurity services will likely grow exponentially. While cybersecurity is currently only a small percentage of the company's overall business, it will likely grow in importance moving forward.Recent F-35 Concerns Are OverblownWith countless billions spent on developing the F-35 over the years, this fighter jet is extremely important to Lockheed Martin's future success. In fact, total lifetime costs for developing the F-35 have been estimated at around $1.5 trillion (paid for by the U.S. government), making it one of the, if not the, most expensive weapons programs ever. With 11 international countries slated to acquire approximately 700 of these aircraft, the F-35 will be a major source of revenue for the company. Unfortunately, the F-35 has been mired in controversy over the years, with much higher-than-expected developmental costs and delayed timelines.With the F-35 program finally starting to gain traction, a recently leaked report stated that the F-35 performed worse than the F-16 in terms of dogfighting capabilities. While this may seem to dampen the prospects of the F-35 considerably given that the F-16 is decades old, the F-35 was not built for the purposes of close-quarters combat. Rather, the F-35 was built with stealth and more long-distance capabilities in mind, which means that the seeming damning F-35 report does little to take away from its value. While the F-35 program had certainly not met expectations over the years, the barrage of criticisms against the program are exaggerated.While the F-16 (bottom) may be superior to the F-35 in terms of close-quarters combat, the F-35 was not made for such combat.Source: fightersweepObstaclesLockheed Martin still has some challenges ahead of it. For one, it is facing increasing pressure in its aerospace sector. The United Launch Alliance, which is a joint venture with Lockheed Martin and Boeing (NYSE:BA), is coming up against increasing competition. SpaceX has been the main catalyst for increasing competition in the aerospace industry, and has been putting major pressure on Lockheed Martin. The recent SpaceX rocket disaster does temporarily relieve this pressure, although Lockheed Martin will likely continue facing difficulties in this arena. With SpaceX and others entering the aerospace industry, the ULA will no longer have a monopoly over enormous contracts such as the $11B contract for the EELV program.In addition, the company's expensive F-35 product lines may come under increasing pressure with the rise of unmanned aircraft. While the company would undoubtedly benefit from the rise of unmanned aircraft given its involvement in the arena, it would likely come at the expense of the F-35 fighter jets. Regardless, this may not prove to be a significant threat to the F-35 program in that this fighter jet is used for much more niche and complex operations, in which unmanned aircraft will likely not be able to replicate anytime soon.ConclusionLockheed Martin continues to be a solid investment, and possesses an extremely solid balance sheet. With $3.61B in annual net income and a large predictable cash flow, the company's financials are enviable. At a market capitalization of $59.46B and a P/E ratio of 17, Lockheed Martin still has more upside to come. With increasingly favorable industry trends facing the defense arena and Lockheed Martin's leading position within the industry, the company is extremely well positioned."
3266735,36201,2015-06-19T04:21:10-04:00,"Lockheed Martin's 3.14% forward dividend yield is enticing.
        Long-term consensus estimates suggest 10% annual operating income growth.
        I show readers how core growth of just 10% can lead to a total return of 14.1%.","I have an all too common problem. I want to invest in established dividend paying companies that produce predictable cash flows. The trouble is that few of these companies are growing their core business at a satisfactory rate. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is a prime example. The Marine Corps is one test away from labeling the jet as operationally ready, and consensus estimates suggest 10% core growth going forward. A double-digits is my cutoff for acceptable expected return from investment vehicles as shaky as equities. Let's see how a profitable company like Lockheed can produce total returns for shareholders well in excess of this figure.Core growth of just 10% is attractive, but Lockheed's relatively predictable earnings growth makes it more so. In fact, recent dividend growth and the presence of a wide economic moat earned the company a spot near the top on the Moaty Chowder watchlist. Past performance doesn't guarantee future results, but its durable advantages over the competition should allow for continued growth at or near this rate going forward.I want to show you how a profitable company can provide satisfactory returns well above growth of its core business. To do so requires significant levels of free cash flow, so lets begin here.Cost of Core GrowthFree cash flow can be measured as cash from operations minus the capital expenditures required to maintain those operations. You could also think of FCF as cash that a company can -- at least in theory -- safely return to shareholders. Another way to think of FCF is as management's main tool for raising shareholders' total return above the rate of core growth. Companies with established, and highly profitable operations can usually grow those at relatively little cost.At Lockheed this is clearly the case as FCF has averaged 98.4% of earnings over the past decade, although over the past five years that figure has fallen to 89.4%. Results vary from year to year, but they suggest a great deal of the company's bottom line is available for increasing shareholder value. Lets see lets see how that excess can be used to boost our total return above core growth.Adding up returnsRather than project the past forward, I'll defer to S&P Capital IQ's consensus long-term estimate of 10% operating earnings growth going forward. Now, here's where a lot of readers get excited about what is additive and what isn't. Over the past twelve months Lockheed has required 51.1% of earnings to pay dividends. That rate has been fairly stable over the past several years. Assuming the payout ratio remains constant, the total dividend payout should rise at the same pace as operating earnings. This allows us to add the trailing twelve month dividend yield to core growth and brings our total return to 13.0%, but we're not finished yet.Earlier I defined FCF as cash that can be returned to shareholders. Smoothed out over several years dividend payments do not exceed FCF, so what are the leftovers worth? To answer that we first need to find out how much is left over. You can calculate a company's required reinvestment ratio by dividing expected core growth by the company's return on equity, if its capital structure is stable. This is not the case at Lockheed, so we'll employ the non-standard measurement of return on invested capital. Over the past twelve months Lockheed's ROIC has been 33.2% which gives us a 30.1% required retention ratio.From the $11.08 in EPS that Lockheed produced over the past twelve months, $5.66 went toward dividend payments, and $3.34 will be required for reinvestment. To find the third component of total return we'll err on the side of conservatism and assume it will be used to repurchase shares. As you should be well aware by now, retiring shares increases EPS as it is net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. We all prefer growth of the numerator, but reducing the denominator does the job just as well.The $2.08 per share remaining after required retention and dividend payments is enough to reduce the total number of shares outstanding by 1.1%. Adding that this third component brings us to a total return of 14.1%.If reality happensAll these calculations seem nice and tidy, but a great many assumptions about the future have been made. In particular, a lower share price going forward might not help your blood pressure, but it does increase the number of shares likely to be repurchased. This is why I like to include a table that incorporates potential changes in core growth on top, and average share price going forward on the side, with the total return as derived above in the center.Note that average share price is also purchase price. This means that if shares fell 10% to $171.36 expected total return would rise to 14.5%.As you can see with mature, profitable, dividend paying companies the price paid affects total return almost as heavily as operating income growth. If you've ever wondered how a company with single digit growth can produce double digit returns for its shareholders (Or if you've been avoiding mature companies like Lockheed Martin because you don't feel they can offer adequate returns), I hope you found this exercise illuminating."
3340635,50662,2015-07-22T01:41:43-04:00,"Lockheed Martin posted excellent financial results in the second quarter of this year.However, I don't like to see the company 'overspend' on share buybacks, as the shareholder rewards were higher than the free cash flow.The Sikorsky deal is a good one, but it will increase the pressure on Lockheed's balance sheet; I expect the net debt/EBITDA ratio to increase to 1.6.","IntroductionI have some available cash in my defensive portfolio but I have struggled to find some decent investments lately as it's not easy to find bargains when the indices are trading at close to their all-time highs. In this article I will hold Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) second quarter results against the light to see if this company fits my (high requirement) needs.The financial results of the second quarter of this yearLockheed Martin saw its total revenue increase by 3% to $11.6B and as the total cost of sales increased at the same rate, its gross profit also showed a 3% increase to $1.37B. Fortunately the effective tax rate was lower (30.8% vs 33.7% in the same quarter last year) and this resulted in a net profit of $929M, or $2.94 per diluted share. This brings the total EPS for the first half of the year to $5.68 per diluted share and this puts the company on track to beat the full-year earnings of $11.2 per share it posted last year.Source: SEC filingsNet profits and earnings per share are one thing, but I prefer to focus on the company's ability to generate free cash flow. After all, every accountant can be very creative (in a legal way, don't get me wrong here) with the inputs, but it's much more difficult to fool around with the cash flow statements, and that's why I lend more credibility to those statements.Lockheed Martin had an operating cash flow of $2.22B in the first semester of 2015, and this was obviously sufficient to cover the capital expenditures totalling $309M. This means that Lockheed Martin generated a positive free cash flow of $1.911B. Not a bad result at all!Source: SEC filingsSo how did Lockheed spend the cash? Approximately half of it ($965M) was paid as a dividend to its shareholders, and on top of that, Lockheed also repurchased $1.54B worth of common stock. This was sufficient to buy back approximately 7.9 million shares and this should push the share count under the 310 million shares, a 2.5% reduction.You'll notice Lockheed Martin spent more cash on dividends and stock buybacks than it generated in free cash flow, and the difference was funded by raising additional debt. That's something I generally don't like to see happen, as I usually prefer companies to not spend more on dividends and buybacks than it generates, but this seems to be a one-time event as the company has confirmed it would repurchase less shares in Q3 and Q4 than it did in the second quarter of this year.Is the balance sheet robust? How will it be impacted by the Sikorsky acquisition?Raising more debt obviously creates additional pressure on any company's balance sheet, but fortunately Lockheed Martin's balance sheet can handle it. As of the end of the second quarter, Lockheed had a working capital position of $2.6B, almost twice as much compared to the end of 2014.Source: SEC filingsHowever, this results in another issue. Lockheed Martin has confirmed it plans to buy helicopter maker Sikorsky from United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) for a cash payment of $9B. It's obvious Lockheed Martin will need to find an external financing source to foot the bill as its working capital position can only cover 30% of the total price tag.Lockheed will thus have to raise $7B in debt (and maybe $8B to be comfortable), and this will increase the company's interest expenses. The interest bill was just $197M in the first half of this year and will very likely remain stable in the second half of this year considering the Sikorsky transaction is only expected to close in the final quarter of this year or even just in Q1 2016.Even though there's still a lot of demand for corporate bonds resulting in a low-yield environment, Lockheed Martin will very likely see its interest expenses double towards $800M per year. That shouldn't really be a problem for Lockheed Martin as the additional interest expenses will be covered by the incoming cash flow from the Sikorsky acquisition.I estimate Lockheed's current net debt at $4.9B and if I would add the $7B of additional debt to acquire Sikorsky to the equation, I'm expecting Lockheed to have a net debt position of $12B. This will also increase the net debt/EBITDA ratio. The $6.6B EBITDA should increase by $770M in the first year and $800M in the second year after unlocking additional synergies. At a consolidated EBITDA of $7.4B, the net debt/EBITDA ratio would increase to 1.6 from less than 0.75 as of at the end of the most recent financial year.Investment thesisLockheed Martin is generating a very strong free cash flow, but the company will now have to make a choice between continuing to treat the shareholders very well or keeping its balance sheet robust. A $9B acquisition of Sikorsky won't be an easy one to swallow and I think Lockheed Martin's first priority should be to reduce the net debt position which will increase to roughly $12B. And that shouldn't be too difficult and can easily be achieved without a dividend cut.At 310 million outstanding shares the annual $6 dividend will cost $1.86B, resulting in a remaining positive free cash flow of $2.2B assuming a 5% free cash flow yield from the Sikorsky transaction. Even if Lockheed would spend $1.5B per year on debt reduction, it would still have $700M available for share repurchases. That's less than the past few years, but it would reduce the net debt/EBITDA ratio to below 1 again within 3 years after closing the transaction.Lockheed Martin will have to make a choice between dividends, share repurchases and M&A targets. The dividend will be safe, but I'd advocate for a lower share repurchase rate to facilitate the amalgamation of Sikorsky. I'm interested and will keep a close eye on the company's share price in the coming days and weeks to benefit from any weak moments."

This was during the pullback when Lockheed Martin became oversold and I saw an opportunity to add to one of my best performing positions. I first purchased Lockheed Martin over a year ago at a price of $155. This has paid off well as the stock continued its amazing run and climbed up to $207 before pulling back lately. I believe that this represents an opportunity to add to my existing position before the stock continues its run ahead.First, a quick summary of the company: Lockheed Martin is a global security and aerospace company, which is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. It also provides a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics and information services. The company operates in five segments: Aeronautics, Information Systems & Global Solutions, Missiles and Fire Control, Mission Systems and Training and Space Systems.Fundamentals and Valuation:Lockheed Martin has enjoyed an amazing run in the last few years, gaining 137% in the last 5 years vs. 95% for the S&P 500. Lockheed Martin has managed this despite budget battles in Washington and a shrinking defense budget. Just a few years ago, sequestration was implemented and the defense budget began to shrink. Today, however the budget is already increasing beyond what was originally budgeted during the Budget Control Act. The reality is that although the United States Government wishes to rein in defense spending, the country continues to wage its war on terror thus making it impossible to drastically decrease spending and maintain its current posture around the world. This will allow Lockheed Martin to continue its consistent revenue stream as it gets about 80% of its revenue from the United States Government.As you can see in the chart above, EPS has grown with the price in the last 5 years, helping to justify the fantastic run up in price the stock has seen. Also, due to the EPS growth of the last 5 years, the stock still trades at a TTM P/E of around 17, meaning that despite the gains the stock trades at fair value. Additionally, the stock is currently trading at a P/E of 15, making it undervalued on a forward basis.Dividend:One of the most important things to me is dividend growth. As outlined here in my first article, my goal is to invest up to 80% of my portfolio in companies that will grow their dividend over time. Therefore, in order for me to add to Lockheed Martin, I must believe that it will be able to continue to grow its dividend in the future.Despite its recent run, Lockheed Martin is currently trading way below its historical average. However, the company currently yields just below 3%, which is still very good in today's environment. Additionally, the company has been growing dividends at a 5 year CAGR of 18.6%. Although dividend growth has been outpacing earnings growth in the last few years, the payout ratio still stands at only 51%, meaning that the company is not in danger of having to cut its dividend. However, dividend growth might slow down for a few years, but as a long-term investor I am okay with that. Moving forward, I would expect dividend growth to be more in line with earnings growth while estimating growth at around 8% would still be a very impressive dividend growth rate.Future Opportunities:A visit to their website revels how many projects the company is involved in. Currently, the project the company is most known for is the F-35 Lightning. Despite numerous issues and cost overruns, the F-35 will still be one of the most advanced fighter planes ever built. With recent projections calling for almost 2,500 F-35's to be built and delivered over the next decade, Lockheed Martin will have a steady revenue stream allowing for the business to continue to expand in the future. Also, the company is currently constructing six Lockheed Martin Littoral Combat Ships that were built to fulfill the Navy's requirement for a small surface combatant. The company is also involved in building the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, which has recently completed testing and should begin production soon. Finally, the company continues to invest in information technology in order to take advantage of the growing fields of cyber security, commercial aerospace, and healthcare information technology. These are just a few examples of the projects Lockheed Martin is involved in.Conclusion:Despite the excellent run over the last five years, Lockheed Martin is still trading at a lower P/E than many other popular dividend growth stocks. The company has managed to grow earnings despite shrinking budgets and is well positioned to continue that growth in the future through its backlog of F-35's and various other contracts with the government. Management has proved that it is committed to returning cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks and that should continue in the future. I recently added to my LMT position at $186.22 and will continue adding on any future pullbacks."
3204916,24787,2015-05-22T04:08:38-04:00,"Lockheed Martin has a long-term track record of beating the S&P 500.It is different from many other blue-chip stocks because it grows its revenues at a 7-8% rate in most years.Defense technology is always improving, and Lockheed benefits from regular obsolescence that lets it gain lucrative contracts with the U.S. government each generation.","Every now and then, you encounter a business that is performing well by just about any metric. Right now, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is one of those businesses. For the truly long-term shareholders among you, this news is not surprising. Lockheed has compounded at a rate of 16.5% annually since 1977, turning a $25,000 initial investment into $7,719,334 today. One of the characteristics that distinguished Lockheed Martin from other blue-chip stocks is that its revenues are perpetually growing at a high single-digit rate.Strong revenue growth over decades is important because it naturally leads to 10-12% earnings per share growth in ordinary economic times, and provides an opportunity for earnings per share growth in the 15% range during years the company runs a particularly strong buyback program or chooses to engage in some cost-cutting initiative.In other words, Lockheed is a company that does not require financial engineering like IBM to deliver long-term earnings per share growth to shareholders. And during the years in which it does decide to cut expenses or repurchase stock, the returns are even more exaggerated because the strong revenue accentuates any other initiatives.The reason why Lockheed Martin does so well for shareholders over the long run is because the business model relies on perpetual obsolescence. Right now, the bulk of its $44 billion annual revenues comes from the production of F-16s, F-22s, F-35s, C-130s, and Titan Launch vehicles. Ten years from now, this equipment will be out-of-date and Lockheed will be manufacturing something new from scratch. It's the inherent nature of the defense business. As technology advances, the U.S. government will order the latest and greatest defense machinery, and the aircraft that is currently built will become obsolete by that time. The constant desire to spend on defense technology improvement explains why Lockheed's revenue has perpetually grown over the past four decades.A few years ago, people were concerned about a sequestration and a curb in U.S. defense spending, but those kinds of speculations haven't affected Lockheed's bottom line. Over the full course of the Obama administration, the company has managed to grow earnings per share from $7.78 at the start of 2008 to $11.25 per share by the end of last year. In the past thirty years, Lockheed Martin has never had more than two consecutive years of earnings per share declines. The absolute ""worst"" earnings per share moment that Lockheed investors had to deal with in the past three decades came between 1999 and 2001. Earnings per share went from $1.41 in 1999 to $1.07 in 2000 before rebounding to $1.60 in 2001. That's it. That's the greatest hardship Lockheed shareholders had to endure in the past thirty years.The only real drawback is that the company's dividend payout ratio has become historically high in recent years. For much of the 1990s and early 1990s, Lockheed kept its dividend payout ratio pretty close to 25%. Over the past ten years, Lockheed has been unapologetic about giving its owners dividend hikes that are significantly higher than earnings per share growth alone would merit. Since 2005, Lockheed has grown earnings per share by 14.5% annually while raising the dividend by 22.5% annually over that time.It has been a fun ride for shareholders, as the $1.05 per share annual dividend in 2005 has grown to $6 per share today. But it does come with a consequence: Lockheed now has significantly less capital available to retire its own stock. Between 2007 and 2011, Lockheed was retiring almost 25 million shares of stock per year. Now, Lockheed is retiring about 4 or 5 million shares of stock per year. The elevated dividend payout ratio that now takes up half of profits is the culprit.Lockheed management recently approved a $2 billion buyback program and indicated that the share count will be below 300 million within the next three years. This should add 6-8% cumulatively to earnings per share between now and 2018. This means that the stock buyback program will continue to provide a moderate boost to earnings per share growth, but the company's ability to continue growing revenues will be the primary driver of earnings per share growth over the long haul.And it appears that the growth of the F-35 backlog order from the U.S. government will continue to give Lockheed Martin solid annual revenue growth in the 7% to 8% range. Lockheed has delivered over 100 of these planes so far, and has a remaining contract to create 2,300 more. Each of these aircraft costs between $150 and $350 million. The Air Force F-35A costs $148 million. A Marine F-35B costs $251 million, and a Navy F-35C costs $337 million. The blended cost is $178 million per aircraft. The fulfillment of this contract alone will add 5% annually to Lockheed's revenues without taking into account any of the company's other defense orders.The difference between investing in Lockheed Martin and investing in an index fund that tracks the S&P 500 is staggering. In the past twenty years, the S&P 500 has returned 9% annually. Lockheed Martin, meanwhile, has returned 13%. A $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 grew to $60,000. The same amount invested in Lockheed Martin would have grown to $132,000. Both cases assume full dividend reinvestment. The secret sauce at Lockheed Martin is that the company is always growing revenues because technology changes enable the company to constantly address a large backlog through good times and bad, and this gives the company an anti-cyclical advantage that explains why it trounces the S&P 500 over long periods of time."
3167626,80836,2015-05-11T06:09:50-04:00,"The company has strong fundamentals and fair valuation.In addition, the company manages to grow dividends steadily.Safe government contracts ensure steady income and lower beta for investors.","IntroductionI am constantly looking for more diversification in my portfolio. One of the advantages of investing in ETFs is that you get instant diversification. In order to cope with that, I always scan and look for new stocks. If they follow my investment thesis and trade at fair valuation, I will consider adding them to my portfolio. If not, I will put them in my watchlist. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is an example.Lockheed Martin is an industrial company that operates in the aerospace and defense sector. It is a leader in its industry that is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacturing, combination, and sustainability of systems and products. It also provides a range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, and information services. It serves both domestic and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil, and commercial applications.The company suffered from a pullback in its share price. The shares plunged over 8% since they hit their 52-week high. The reason for that is the weaker outlook for 2015 that shows practically no growth in 2015. After the pullback, several analysts upgraded their opinion on Lockheed Martin. I also believe that at the moment, it should be considered for my portfolio.FundamentalsLockheed Martin fired on all cylinders over the past decade, and it is in a great position to keep going forward. The revenues rose from $35.526 billion in 2005 to $45.6 billion in 2015. That is a CAGR of 2.53. This might look low, but the company still manages to increase its earnings both by increasing the margins and by way of share buybacks.LMT Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsThe EPS over the same period of time rose substantially. In 2005, EPS was only $4.1. In 2014, EPS almost tripled and reached $11.21. That is a CAGR of 10.58%, which is extremely impressive, especially for a company that derives most of its revenues from the U.S government. The company outlook for 2015 isn't very good, as it predicts EPS to stay flat. However, analysts covering the company believe that the company will keep growing at a quick pace in 2016.LMT EPS Diluted (Annual) data by YChartsThe dividend is very important for me. Lockheed Martin managed to raise the annual payment for 12 years. It isn't a dividend aristocrat, but it is in the right direction. The dividend has grown very fast over the past decade. It grew from $1.05 in 2005 to $5.49 in 2014. That is a CAGR growth of 18%, I can't ask for much more. The current payout ratio is sustainable, and stands at 53%. It means that the company, in the future, will be able to raise the dividend only as fast as the EPS grows, as it won't be able to expand the payout for much longer. At the moment, Lockheed Martin yields 3.15%, which is a great and sustainable yield.LMT Dividend data by YChartsAnother proof to the commitment of the company to its shareholders is the massive share buybacks. As long as the share trades at low or fair valuation, I believe that share buybacks will help investors achieve better returns. Lockheed Martin has purchased its own shares aggressively over the past decade. The share count decreased from 430 million to 315 million. That is a decline of 29%, which helped the company show a better bottom line. The only downside is that FCF is lower than the combined amount of dividend and share buybacks, so I believe the buyback rate will be slower in the future.LMT Shares Outstanding data by YChartsValuationThis is a little bit tricky. The current valuation of Lockheed Martin seems fair. The shares have suffered a 8% pullback in their price, so the P/E ratio is now 17.19. The forward P/E is 17.13 and 15.17 for 2015 and 2016, respectively.I believe that it is tricky, because although the valuation seems fair, the P/E over the past 5 years was much lower. I believe that the current valuation is fair, as most analysts covering the company give their target price according to a forward P/E ratio of 18-19.In my opinion, the current valuation and yield are suitable for initiating a position.LMT PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsOpportunitiesFirst of all, Lockheed Martin keeps increasing its margins. As the margins are predicted to stay flat in 2015, they are forecasted to rise to almost 16% in 2016. Lockheed Martin manages to be more efficient, and it will reward shareholders for the long run. The company has managed to make its operation more profitable over the past several years.LMT EBITDA Margin (TTM) data by YChartsAnother opportunity is the F-35. This aircraft is the most sophisticated aircraft in the world. It will gradually replace the USAF F-16 and other aircraft in the navy and the marines. It is also sold to other countries around the world, such as Norway, Korea, Japan and Israel. This aircraft will be used for many years to come. In addition, Lockheed Martin also advances forward with technology. It emphasizes the importance of cyber warfare, and plans to keep giving solutions in that area as well. It lately acquired an Israeli startup that deals exactly with that area.Another advantage is the stable stream of revenues that the company gets from defense contracts. The U.S government accounts for 80% of the company's revenues. As long as the U.S is involved in so many battlefields around the world, the demand for these products will continue to rise. New technology will always be necessary, as a technological advantage is extremely important. I don't want to be too pessimistic, but I don't see American involvement around the world over. Even if it does, cyber warfare is another battlefield in which the western world has to compete, and Lockheed Martin is ready for it.The steady stream of revenues from the American government, as well as other foreign governments gives the company a very stable share price. The beta is very low. It is much lower than that of other big blue chips, such as Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). The current beta, according to Yahoo Finance, is 0.75. Having less volatility in my portfolio is always an advantage.With a management that is committed to its shareholders by way of both dividend and buybacks, Lockheed Martin is an interesting addition to a dividend growth portfolio. The company has strong fundamentals, together with some future growth opportunities and inelastic demand.RisksThese opportunities doesn't come without risks at all. Firstly, as I said before, the valuation of the company expanded over the past year. It is still considered fair, in my opinion, but it is far from being as low as it was just one year ago. Most analysts believe that the P/E expansion is justified and will continue in the future, but the safety margin is much lower now.As the company derives most of its revenues from government contracts, military spending cuts is a true risk. As the situation in Europe is still complicated and there is an effort to lower the deficit in the U.S., Lockheed Martin might suffer due to lower revenues.The company has huge exposure to one client. The U.S government is responsible for 80% of the company's revenues. As I said before, I don't believe that the demand is going to decline, but it is still dangerous to have little diversification of clients. If the U.S government makes new contracts with other companies, it might also harm Lockheed Martin.The company also a gave a pretty low outlook for 2015. The EPS is forecasted to stay flat. In addition, the backlog is also forecasted to be lower in 2015 than it was in 2014. The backlog was at a record high in 2013, and has declined since then. The decline isn't steep at all, but it is certainly not a good sign. Analysts believe that investors will see growth again in 2016, but again, it is just a forecast, and the weak year to come might offer a better price for the stock.ConclusionFor the long run, both conventional and cyber warfare will probably stay with us. Lockheed Martin is a leader in its industry, and is ready to deal with these issues. The strong fundamentals, fair valuation and strong growth opportunities overshadow the risks. With a manage that is committed to return value to shareholders, I will consider initiating a position."
3118866,69675,2015-04-30T18:37:46-04:00,"In recent years, neither General Dynamics nor Lockheed Martin have been particularly great performers when it comes to both top and bottom line results.Whereas one has done clearly better in regards to net income and sales, the other has outperformed in terms of operating cash flow.With growing backlogs, both businesses provide opportunities, but with a cheaper share price perhaps Lockheed Martin is the way to go moving forward.","Times have been rather mixed for defense companies like General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). With falling sales and shares that are trading at fairly high levels, the business of defense doesn't appear to provide investors with very attractive prospects. That being said, due to geopolitical factors and the fact that, over the long run, defense spending has only increased, which of these two businesses is likely to provide investors with the more attractive prospects moving forward?Mixed results make things toughOver the past five years, General Dynamics hasn't done so well on its top line. Between 2010 and 2014, the company saw its revenue drop a modest 3.5% from $31.96 billion to $30.85 billion. The biggest problem here has been a falloff in revenue from the company's North American and European regions, some of which has been offset by significant improvements in Asia Pacific and the Middle East.GD Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsSimilarly, Lockheed Martin hasn't been a real poster-child for success on the revenue front either. Over the same five-year period, the company's sales ticked down 0.2% from $45.67 billion to $45.60 billion. In recent years, much of the drop in sales for the business has been driven by its Information Systems & Global Solutions segment and its Space Systems segment, both of which have seen their sales drop due to lower demand for its particular offerings.On a sales front, these companies look very similar, but the same cannot be said of things from a profitability standpoint. Between 2010 and 2014, for instance, General Dynamics saw its net income fall 3.5% from $2.62 billion to $2.53 billion while Lockheed Martin's bottom line actually grew an impressive 25.6% from $2.88 billion to $3.61 billion. At first glance, this may seem like a tremendous improvement, but when you consider that most of this change has been driven by the company's ""other unallocated"" expenses (which consists largely of gains from trading activities of securities, pension benefits or charges and stock-based compensation), the picture no longer blows you away.GD Net Income (Annual) data by YChartsWhat's perhaps more interesting is the fact that, while General Dynamics has trailed on both the sales and net income front, the company has led in terms of rising cash flows from operating activities. Between 2010 and 2014, the business saw its operating cash flows soar 26.5% from $2.95 billion to $3.73 billion while Lockheed Martin's operating cash flow inched up just 1.7% from $3.80 billion to $3.87 billion.In the face of mediocrity, go with priceBased on the data provided, it's pretty clear that neither General Dynamics nor Lockheed Martin make for clear winners. In the first case, you have a business with sales and profits falling while cash flow is on the rise, and in the second, you have one with mostly flat revenue, rising profits due to non-core operating expenses, and cash flows that haven't really done all that much. That being said, this doesn't mean that these are necessarily bad investments. With both companies posting an increase in backlog (General Dynamics' being the largest increase from $59.37 billion to $72.41 billion) in recent years and the likelihood of ever-increasing military budgets, either business could make for a decent long-term holding, but in the face of mediocrity, it may make sense for investors to pick the cheapest of the bunch.Following this approach, we find that, on a price/sales basis, shares of Lockheed Martin are meaningfully cheaper than General Dynamics with a ratio of 1.35. This means that, for every $1 in revenue the company generates, investors have to pay $1.35 for a piece of the action. General Dynamics, on the other hand, is about 12% more expensive than its larger rival with a price/sales metric of 1.54, which implies that investors are valuing each dollar that it brings in more than they do an identical dollar flowing through Lockheed Martin. In part, this disparity could be caused by the larger build in General Dynamics' backlog, but with backlog of over $80 billion, Lockheed Martin is still larger.GD PS Ratio (Annual) data by YChartsAnother way to evaluate the situation is to look at each business's price/earnings. Utilizing this metric, we find, once again, that Lockheed Martin is the cheaper of the two with a price/earnings ratio of 17.06. This is, in no way, a low multiple, especially for a business that hasn't done all that great on the sales and cash flow front in recent years, but it's lower than the 18.70 times profits that investors can pick up General Dynamics for.GD PE Ratio (Annual) data by YChartsTakeawayRight now, the picture at both Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics is okay, but far from great. With mixed results, these companies don't look to be home runs, but given the nature of the world, it's likely that they will both continue to generate profits and pay out the 3% and 2.1% dividends, respectively, for the foreseeable future. Because of this, either business makes for an alright play, but with its lower share price, higher yield, and larger (but slower-growing) backlog, Lockheed Martin may make for the more sensible prospect moving forward."
3090506,74695,2015-04-22T12:12:33-04:00,"While Lockheed Martin reported tepid quarterly results, the company's future prospects are still incredibly bright.Lockheed Martin's increasing emphasis on international sales is incredibly smart given the ramp up of global tensions/conflicts.Lockheed Martin's flagship F-35 product line has seen some promising developments in quarter 1, setting new milestones and increasing sales.While the nature of defense contracting is inherently risky due to its reliance on unpredictable global tensions/conflicts, current global tensions/conflicts should persist or likely even deteriorate for the foreseeable future.","Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) reported somewhat lukewarm quarter 1 results, reporting a slightly lower-than-expected revenue of $10.1B. On the bright side, the company reported an EPS of $2.74, which beat analyst estimates of $2.50. The company also reported net earnings of $878M and ended the quarter with $957M in cash from operations. Most of the company's quarterly financials decreased YOY, which has partially been a result of government budget cuts. Lockheed Martin President and CEO Marillyn Hewson summarized her thoughts on the quarter by stating,While Lockheed Martin did not blow past expectations for the quarter, the company still has a lot to look forward to. The company's future outlook looks promising in light of some proposed DoD budget increases, in which President Obama wants to increase the governments total spending package to $585B (significantly higher than previous years). If such proposals go through, which increasingly looks to be the case, Lockheed Martin should experience a surge in business. The company is also growing its presence on the international front, which will be vital given the ramp up in global conflicts.Growing International PresenceWith the huge ramp up in geopolitical tensions and global conflict, the international markets are becoming much more relevant for Lockheed Martin. As such, Lockheed Martin's decision to put increasing emphasis on international expansion is extremely smart. The company even plans to have its international segment account for at least one-quarter of its total sales. Given how much worse geopolitical tensions and conflicts have gotten in the last few quarters, Lockheed Martin will very likely be able to follow through on its international ambitions.The Middle East, in particular, represents huge opportunities for Lockheed Martin. With conflicts in the Middle East escalating, the company's sales to the region will surely constitute a huge portion of its international business segment. Just recently, another Middle Eastern conflict emerged in the form of a rapidly destabilizing Yemem. The Yemen situation has gotten so bad that Saudi Arabia is now basically in a proxy war against Iran. Given Lockheed Martin's somewhat close relationship with Saudi Arabia, this conflict should present the company with plenty of new opportunities. In fact, CEO Marillyn Hewson met with several senior Saudi Arabian leaders to discuss new business opportunities.The Middle East is just one of many promising international markets for Lockheed Martin. From increasing missile defense system sales in conflict zones such as Eastern Europe (e.g. MEADs sales to Ukraine) to jet deals in the APAC region(e.g. F-35 sales to South Korea), Lockheed Martin is building a formidable international presence. As international tensions/conflicts are only getting worse, Lockheed Martin has an opportune chance to cement its global presence.Notable Progress of Lockheed Martin's Flagship F-35 ProductThe F-35 Joint Strike Fighter has received a lot of criticism over the past few years for performance, safety, and spending issues. Despite such criticisms, the F-35 is still one of the world's premier fighter jet lines. As such, the F-35 is still one of Lockheed Martin's flagship products, which is not surprising given the enormous amount of time and resources spent on the F-35 program. Fortunately for Lockheed Martin, its F-35 line is gaining momentum both in terms of product milestones and sales.As for F-35 product milestones, the F-35A was assembled outside of the U.S. for the first time(in Italy), which validates the company's global F-35 partnerships. On top of this, Lockheed Martin completed 1,000 trainee sorties at Luke AFB (Air Force Base) and 500 at Nellis AFB, marking significant progress in its F-35 flight test program. With over 35,000 flight hours logged, the F-35 is showing itself to be a reliable fighter jet. Orders for these jets have also shown improvement during the quarter, with Israel signing up for 14 more aircraft, Turkey for 4, and the Netherlands for 8.In fact, approximately half of the company's F-35 orders over the next 5 years will come on the international stage, affirming the importance of the company's international business segment. Lockheed Martin's huge investment in its F-35 program is starting to pay off in big ways, which should further boost Lockheed Martin's prospects moving forward. These fifth generation fighter jets will likely be a promising mainstay for the company in the years to come, giving the company additional upside.Despite the numerous criticisms against Lockheed Martin's F-35 product line, these fighter jets are coming along fine. Here is a picture of the F-35 Lightning II.Source: lockheedmartinRisksWhile Lockheed Martin is in a pretty comfortable position as the world's premier defense contractor, the company's prospects are intimately tied to future geopolitical tensions and global conflicts. Such things are inherently unpredictable, which means that despite Lockheed Martin's dominance in the defense contracting business, the company's addressable market could shrink at a moments notice. While global tensions and conflicts have boiled up recently, there is no way of telling if global tensions/conflicts will last in the long-run.The simple fact is that the world has gotten more peaceful over the decades, which means that the current spike in tensions/conflicts could just be an aberration. If this is indeed the case, Lockheed Martin's future prospects may not be so bright. Regardless, there does not seem to be any near-term solutions in sight for the majority of current global tensions/conflicts, which means that Lockheed Martin should enjoy considerable business for the foreseeable future. On top of this, the U.S. will likely ramp up its defense contract funding over the long-term if China continues to grow in power, which will almost certainly happen.ConclusionWhile Lockheed Martin's revenues have stayed virtually unchanged over the past few years at approximately $45B/year, the company has seen a dramatic increase in gross margins and net incomes. This points to the increasing health of the company's financials, which should only get better in the years to come. The surge in radical Islamic terrorism, the rapid destabilization of Eastern Europe, the increasing tensions relating to North Korea, China's increasingly aggressive South China Sea stance, etc, will all play a huge role in propelling Lockheed Martin forward.With Lockheed Martin's product innovation/advancements, dominance in the defense contracting industry, and the spike in global conflicts/tensions, the company is poised for growth. At a market capitalization of $62.24B and a P/E ratio ( ttm ) of 17.51, the company represents an attractive investment. Lockheed Martin is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the current global situation, and should remain a dominant industry figure in the long-term."

        The company has increased its dividend payments each year since 2002.
        Is Lockheed Martin a high quality dividend growth stock or is it subject to government risks?","Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is the second largest publicly traded Aerospace manufacturer on United States markets, behind only Boeing (NYSE:BA). Lockheed Martin currently has a market cap of $60 billion. The company traces its roots back to Lockheed Corporation, which was founded in 1912.Company name is a member of the Dividend Achievers Index. Lockheed Martin has paid increasing dividends each year since 2002. The Dividend Achievers Index is comprised of businesses with 10 or more consecutive years of dividend payments. You can see the current list of all 238 members of the Dividend Achievers Index here.This article will look at Lockheed Martin's current events, competitive advantage, and future growth prospects to determine its fit in a dividend growth portfolio.Business OverviewLockheed Martin operates in five business segments: Aeronautics, Information Systems & Global Solutions, Missiles & Fire Control, Mission Systems & Training , and Space Systems.The percentage of total operating income each segment generated for Lockheed Martin in the company's latest fiscal quarter is shown below to give an idea of the relative size of each segment:The aeronautics segment is Lockheed Martin's largest segment based on total operating profit generated. The segment designs and manufactures a variety of military aircraft, including the F-16, F-22, F-35, A-10 Thunderbolt, U-2 Spy plane, and C-130 Hercules, among many others.The missiles and fire control segment generated 22% of total profits for Lockheed Martin in the company's most recent quarter. The segment produces targeting and navigation systems, air and missile defense systems, tactical missiles, nuclear components, and unmanned vehicles.The space systems segment works primarily with the United States government. In fiscal 2014, 97% of the segment's revenue came from the United States government. The segment designs and produces satellites, space transportation systems, and strategic and defensive missile systems.The mission systems & Training segment is Lockheed Martin's second smallest. The segment provides solutions for ships, submarines, and aircraft. In addition, the segment provides training exercise and services.The information systems & global solutions segment is Lockheed Martin's smallest segment based on operating profit. The segment provides information technology and management solutions for various government customers.Competitive Advantage79% of Lockheed Martin's sales were from the United States government in fiscal 2014. The company's competitive advantage comes directly from its relationship with the United states government. Lockheed Martin is the largest private contractor of the United States, with over twice as much dollars allocated to it than the next largest contractor.Lockheed Martin's products are necessary for the defense of the United States. Fortunately for Lockheed Martin, the United States military has a budget of over $600 billion a year. The United States has military bases in 63 countries. The United States has been at war continuously since 2001. There appears to be no end in sight for war in the world.Lockheed Martin attracts extremely gifted workers in STEM fields. The company has an excellent research and development department that works to make next-generation military and space weapons and equipment. In 2014, Lockheed Martin had research and development expenses of $714 million. This number is understated, as much of Lockheed Martin's real research and development costs are tied to other projects and not on the books as research and development expenses. The company's competitive advantage comes from its research and development strengths and its close ties with the United States government.Current Events & Growth ProspectsLockheed Martin has grown its earnings-per-share at 8.6% a year over the last decade. The company's growth is driven by winning government contracts. In 2015, military expenditures comprised 54% of United States government discretionary spending. Lockheed Martin will likely continue to see earnings-per-share growth as long as the United States people and government continue along with ~50% discretionary spending on the military. Simply put, an investment in Lockheed Martin is dependent upon future war and/or heightened security in the United States.Lockheed Martin saw earnings-per-share decline slightly in its most recent quarter versus the same quarter a year ago. Earnings-per-share declined from $2.87 to $2.74. The decline came from lower orders for the company's planes, missiles, and military systems. The United States military budget is virtually flat versus last year. This means that Lockheed Martin lost ground versus competitors in its most recent quarter.Declining sales and profits were partially offset by strong share repurchases. The company repurchased $604 million worth of shares in its first quarter. This comes to about 1% of the company's current market cap. Over the last decade, the company has repurchases around 3.3% of shares outstanding each year. Share repurchases over 3% combined with the company's 3.2% dividend yield give investors a shareholder yield of over 6%.Lockheed Martin's earnings outlook for 2015 is lower than 2014 earnings. The company is expecting earnings-per-share of $10.85 to $11.15 in fiscal 2015, versus $11.21 in fiscal 2014. Earnings are falling due to lower shipment volumes of the company's various military products. Lockheed Martin will not continue to see earnings decline indefinitely as long as the United States is engaged in multiple wars and operations around the world. Over the long-run, the company should manage earnings-per-share growth of between 5% and 8% a year from share repurchases (~3%) and organic growth (2% to 5%).Recession PerformanceLockheed Martin performed well during the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009. The company generates the vast majority of its revenues and profits from the United States government. As a result, the company is partially disconnected from the effects of recessions.The United States government's ability to generate nearly unlimited amounts of cash through issuing bonds backed by the ability to tax citizens means Lockheed Martin's largest customer will demand and pay for products and services regardless of the economic climate.Lockheed Martin's earnings-per-share through the Great Recession are shown below to illustrate the company's resistance to recessions:Lockheed Martin's earnings-per-share declined just 1% in 2009 during the worst of the Great Recession. The company's contracts with the United States government pay just as well in recessions as when the economy is prospering.Final ThoughtsLockheed Martin is a shareholder friendly business. The company's 3%+ dividend yield and 3%+ reduction in share count each year gives investors a 6% return before any business growth each year.Lockheed Martin has shown average growth over the last decade. If the company grows earnings-per-share at its expected 5% to 8% a year growth rate, investors will have total returns of between 8% and 11% a year from dividends (3%) and earnings-per-share growth (5% to 8%).Lockheed Martin does not have a long enough dividend history (minimum 25 years without a reduction) to pass the first rule of The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing. Still, the company makes an interesting investment for dividend growth investors looking for some diversification away from the business cycle. Lockheed Martin's growth is not as tied to the business cycle as many other dividend growth stocks (it relies on government spending instead of consumer spending)."
3156606,36201,2015-05-08T17:30:08-04:00,Lockheed Martin’s current dividend yield is 3.2%.Recent dividend growth suggests it could provide a satisfactory return in the years ahead.Strong competitive advantages make it one of the most profitible companies on my radar.,"Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) current dividend yield is at 3.2%. Although that is higher than most companies on my radar, it may not be sufficient for most dividend growth portfolios. Luckily its recent rate of growth suggests it could provide a satisfactory yield soon enough.When looking for potential additions to my dividend growth portfolio, I like to apply the Chowder Rule. This is a simple test that adds current yield to the five-year dividend growth rate. For a stock yielding more than 3%, the sum should exceed 12. With a five-year growth rate of 18.6% Lockheed blasted through this hurdle like a one of its hellfire missiles.While speedy dividend growth is encouraging, it is the simpler half of the initial screening process for stocks in the Moaty Chowder ranking system. The second step of the screening process is much more subjective. Rather than focus entirely on dividends, I give priority to critical factors that allow businesses to continue increasing shareholder value over the long run. This is why all companies in the Moaty Chowder must have a durable competitive advantage, also called an economic moat. As the world's largest defense contractor with unmatched experience navigating byzantine government regulations at home and abroad, Lockheed looks like a perfect fit.Near-term outlookLockheed's current yield is better than most companies in the Moaty Chowder watchlist. However, if we are to see a satisfactory return consistent growth is a must. This is why I begin initial evaluations by looking at the overall direction of the underlying business. When Lockheed reported first quarter earnings last month, weakened delivery of fighter and mobility aircraft resulted in sales falling 5.06%. The disappointment didn't stop at the top line though. Weakened margins led an 8.61% drop in operating income from business segments. Much of the weakness seen in the past quarter can be attributed to increased production of the low-margin F-35, a trend we can reasonably expect to continue.Looking ahead, even the high end of company guidance suggests sales for the full year will fall by more than a point. Also at the high end of the guided range, earnings per share are expected to come in 0.6% lower. Looking even further ahead, the average of 9 analysts reporting to S&P Capital IQ is expecting 2017 EPS to come in at $13.91. This would represent an annual growth rate of 6.9% over the three-year period beginning this year. While the current slowdown is a concern, a generally rosy future is worth four of a possible five points in this section.Dividend historySince you're after those dividends, it makes sense to choose a company with a strong history of not just making, but also increasing payments. Past performance never guarantees future results, but it does indicate the company's commitment to increasing shareholder value. Lockheed has raised its dividend 12 years in a row, suggesting steady raises ahead.Of course, simply raising payments each year is only helpful if those increases are significant. Over the past three-, five-, and ten-year periods, Lockheed raised dividends at rates of 19.1%, 18.6%, and 19.7% respectively. These rates blow the doors off averages for contenders -- companies with between 10 and 25 consecutive years of rising payments. With less than 25 years of rising payments I need to deduct a point, leaving Lockheed with four of a possible five points in this section.Dividend sustainabilityAlthough recent dividend growth at Lockheed has been outstanding, it won't help you retire if it's unsustainable. Here's where I evaluate just how likely the company is to continue raising dividends at a satisfactory pace.LMT Dividend data by YChartsOver the past decade, double-digit earnings growth wasn't quite fast enough to keep up with the distribution. As a result the proportion of profits required to make payments, or the payout ratio has risen to a still reasonable 54%. With such a low payout ratio, Lockheed shouldn't have much trouble continuing to raise payments at a satisfactory rate in the years ahead. With this in mind I am giving it a full five points in this section.Competitive advantageNow that we've taken a good look at the company's dividend, it's time to evaluate factors that have allowed its growth to continue well into your retirement years. A company's ability to avoid competitive pricing is absolutely essential to increasing shareholder value over the long term.One component of Lockheed's economic moat stems from more than a century of building aircraft for the US military. Generally speaking, governments do business by their own rules, however convoluted they may be. It's hard to imagine another company approaching Lockheed's level of experience, and success at winning lucrative government contracts. On the downside, nearly four-fifths of the its sales are to the US government.Beyond experience, Lockheed also benefits from high switching costs. The troublesome F-35 program is a prime example. Although recent criticisms center on engines supplied by United Technologies' (NYSE:UTX) Pratt & Whitney division, reports of disapproval for Lockheed's role in the strike fighter aren't hard to find. The important thing for investors to bear in mind is that the cost of switching to an alternate contractor increases with each fighter delivered. Considering the company's ability to strong-arm governments, I have to give a full five points in this section.ProfitabilityNow that we've established the presence of a very wide moat, we should be able to measure its effects in the numbers. If the previous section dealt with the width of the moat, we could take the metaphor a step further and consider profitability a measure of its depth.Perhaps the most common measure of a company's profitability is the rate of return on equity. This is simply calculated as net income divided by shareholder equity.LMT Return on Equity (TTM) data by YChartsYou probably noticed Lockheed's ROE is extremely high. One reason for this is the high level of debt on its balance sheet. Taking on any liability, like debt, reduces the equity base. The company finished the first quarter with debt at 2.4 times equity. It's this squeezing of the denominator that leads to a somewhat misleading ROE of 86.3%.This is why I like to assess a company's ability to profit from its competitive positioning by measuring the rate of return on invested capital. In a recent post, I walked readers through the math. What you need to know is that ROIC peels away the effects of a debt heavy balance sheet.Lockheed's current ROIC of 33.16% is outstanding. It is so good in fact that, highly profitable companies like United Technologies -- also in the Moaty Chowder list -- and General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) pale in comparison. Given its consistently high returns on invested capital, I have to give a full five points here.Bottom LineThere is an awful lot to like about Lockheed Martin as a dividend growth investment. The main drawback is over-reliance on its rich uncle. Last year the US government was responsible for 79% of net sales. An increased DoD budget for fiscal 2016 is encouraging. However, the pains of sequestration have just begun. With about six more years of budget cuts ahead, Lockheed shareholders will need extra blood pressure medicine when congress is in session for years to come.Despite over-reliance on a single customer, Lockheed just cleaned up on the ranking criteria. With 14 companies evaluated so far, a score of 23 leaves it tied for second. The complete list, rankings to date, and a methodology discussion are all available here."

Heavy regulation, years of symbiosis with the US Defense and their know-how are three key elements protecting most of LMT's business. Let's just say you can't start building military aircraft and missiles in your basement to compete with this defense behemoth.The company recently designed the most advanced fighter aircraft (F-35), made important advances in light tactical vehicles and continues its work in space exploration. These are costly industries where not many competitors can compete.How LMT fares vs. My 7 Principles of InvestingWe all have our methods for analyzing a company. Over the years of trading, I've gone through several iterations of stock research from various sources. This is how I came up with my 7 investing principles of dividend investing. The first four principles are directly linked to company metrics. Let's take a closer look at them.Principle #1: High dividend yield doesn't equal high returnsThe first principle is pretty much straightforward; if you look at a company with a high dividend yield, chances are the company won't do very well in the future. The concept is fairly easy to understand; when interest rates are so low, investors are desperately looking for other sources of revenues. They then find dividend stocks! Since there is a strong demand for dividend stocks, the price increases and pushes the yield lower. If you can find companies that are paying a high yield today; it's because they have little to no growth to offer. By looking at LMT, we can see the yield has considerably dropped from 4%-5% to close to 3% these days.Now consider the company increased its dividend by 18% annually during the last 5 years… quite impressive. This leads me to my second investing principle.Principle#2: If there is one metric, it's called dividend growthIn the past 5 years, the 1st quintile of dividend growers (companies that have the highest dividend growth rate) outperformed the others:LMT is among the best dividend growers over the past five years and there is no coincidence that the stock price surged during the same period. Strong dividend growth is a sign management is confident about the company's future. Over a short period of time however, it could be a simple way to lure investors. On the other hand, a company can't keep up this strategy very long if it doesn't generate strong sales and profits. There is a limit to playing with accounting standards and the limit is called time.In the case of LMT, revenues didn't go so well as the company faces a terrible problem; its client (80% of its business comes from the US govt) wants to cut their defense budget. This won't help LMT in the years to come. While LMT will benefit from a small break since many contracts have been awarded for 2015 and 2016, the government still has to cut its budget before 2021 due to the sequestration law. We can clearly see that LMT did a remarkable job in increasing its earnings while cutting its costs, but this can't last forever. Revenues will have to increase again to maintain a solid dividend growth.Principle #3: A dividend payment today is good, a dividend guaranteed for the next ten years is betterIn the light of LMT's current sales growth problem, can we expect them to keep the dividend payment for the next ten years and beyond moving forward? The answer is yes. The defense business will always remain a strong need in the world and LMT will remain a key player. The payout ratio is under control at 50%. This is why I'm not concerned about the dividend payment for several years ahead.However, I don't expect an annualized 18% rise in the future either. A more reasonable increase in line with single digit earnings growth would be more realistic.Principle #4: The Foundation of dividend growth stocks lies in its business modelI think it is safe to assume Lockheed Martin operates in a very strong moat. The resources and knowledge required to compete with LMT in the defense industry is very hard to acquire. While revenues might hit a speed bump in the upcoming years, the need for defense products will not stop. The business model is strong and LMT has recently improved its margin on the F-35 production.I think LMT has a short-term problem and this could affect the price you should buy the stock at. However, for a long-term dividend portfolio, this could be a great core stock.What Lockheed Martin Does With its CashI'm under the impression management does everything to keep their investors happy and almost blinds them with major share repurchases and strong dividend growth. The business obviously requires tons of cash to be invested in R&D and new technology, but management still has $3.6 billion worth of shares approved for repurchase in the future. In their 2014 financial statement, management clearly stated their focus will be applied to increasing the dividend and to buy more shares over the next three years.Note that even if LMT shows a heavy pension contribution in the 2014 financial reports ($2 billion), the business generated an additional $3.9 billion cash flow from operations. This is a true cash flow machine.Should You Buy LMT at this Value?Ah! This is the right question to ask; are you burning cash buying LMT at this price? Let's take a look at the past 10 years history of price earnings ratio:We have to understand LMT's value was hurt mainly because of the sequestration bill passed after the 2008 crash. Defense budget was clearly hit by this law and put LMT revenues under pressure with little to no growth for ten years. We all know 10 years is bigger than the cosmic universe on the stock market. Nonetheless, LMT management caught investors' attention with strong earnings growth doubled in conjunction with high dividend growth. As dividend investors, we probably overlooked the company revenues a bit to focus on our own.In order to have a better understanding of the company's value, I used the dividend discount model calculation spreadsheet with two stages. I used a 10% dividend increase for the next 10 years and dropped it down to 5% afterward. I think the company will continue to hike the dividend as high as it can until revenues come back up. They have a strong cash flow machine in hand and can play this game for a few more years. Since the business is relatively stable and the worst may have already happened to LMT, I use a 10% discount rate.Source: Dividend ToolkitThe stock is currently trading near $190 and my fair value calculation stands at $170. In other words; the stock is trading at a 20% premium.A premium paid for strong dividend growth in the past years, a strong economic moat where competitors won't play very long against LMT and a premium paid for a dividend stocks showing a yield over 3%… still in this crazy market!What I Would Do With LMT if I Had $10K in HandIf I had a new $10K to invest in this company, I wouldn't do it at the moment. I think the stock is overpriced and doesn't show the growth potential that can lead to a higher price. However, I'm keeping my shares since they are part of my core portfolio where I expect to keep a company for 10 years and maybe more. LMT is definitely a good company to hold, but it's just not the right time to buy it now…Disclaimer: I hold LMT shares at the moment"
3036806,74695,2015-03-29T20:09:57-04:00,"Lockheed Martin is wisely taking advantage of society's increasing cybersecurity needs by bolstering its own cybersecurity segment.Lockheed Martin has an extremely strong relationship with the U.S. government, which should give it an edge in the federal cybersecurity space.Lockheed Martin has a large presence in the commercial cybersecurity industry as well, supplying hundreds of different top firms with cybersecurity services/products.While Lockheed Martin faces the same volatility risks as other cybersecurity firms, the company has the advantage of having a huge balance sheet to back up its cybersecurity ambitions.","Cybersecurity is becoming an increasingly integral part of modern society. With more information than ever stored in the digital space, organizations and individuals are more at risk than ever on the digital front. Because of accelerating cyberattacks, the cybersecurity industry has exploded over the past couple of years as governments, corporations, etc., demanded for more cybersecurity solutions/products. While cybersecurity pure plays largely dominate the industry, many defense contractors are making their presence known in the industry.Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), which is currently the top U.S. defense contractor, has devoted increasing amounts of attention to its cybersecurity business segment over the past few years. Through organic growth, the acquisition of a few cybersecurity firms such as Industrial Defender, and the formation of its own cybersecurity alliance, Lockheed Martin is setting up to become an increasingly dominant force in the cybersecurity space. Just a few weeks ago, Lockheed Martin added cybersecurity standout Radware (NASDAQ:RDWR) to its every growing cybersecurity alliance, demonstrating its influence in the sector. With the Lockheed Martin's continual emphasis on cybersecurity, the company should have immense upside moving forward.An Established Cybersecurity ForceWhile Lockheed Martin is primarily involved in the physical defense business, the company has built a sizable cybersecurity segment over the years. While many of its defense contractor competitors, such as Raytheon (RTN), have developed their cybersecurity segments by relying more heavily on acquisitions, Lockheed Martin has taken a more organic growth path. This has allowed the company to have a much deeper understanding of the cybersecurity space when compared to its fellow defense contractor competitors. As a result, Lockheed Martin has become one of, if not the largest provider of cybersecurity services for the federal government.This dominance in the federal cybersecurity arena will be a huge boon for the company moving forward as the government will almost certainly start to increase the amount of money spent on cybersecurity. With exponentially increasing amounts of data breaches on government agencies, the government's cybersecurity budget will likely skyrocket in the coming years. While Lockheed Martin's federal cybersecurity segment is booming, most of the company's business comes from outside the government. For instance, the company has hundreds of customers in the private sector, and serves diverse customers ranging from petroleum companies, all the way to pharmaceutical companies.Although Lockheed Martin is the biggest cybersecurity contractor for the Pentagon, the commercial sector is likely where most of company's cybersecurity ambitions lie. This is no surprise as large corporations arguably have more at stake than any other entity in terms of pure monetary value. The good news is that Lockheed Martin is only increasing its presence on the cybersecurity commercial front. With cybersecurity needs on the rise, Lockheed Martin is incredibly well-positioned in the industry. Not only does the company have a secure relationship with the government that spans decades, but also a thriving commercial cybersecurity business as well.The illustration below depicts how the company's threat intelligence platform Palisade works.Source: lockheedmartinFuture OpportunityWhile only a small part of Lockheed Martin's overall business deals with cybersecurity, its cybersecurity segment's real promise lies in its future potential. The segment has already grown leaps and bounds over the past few years, and is slated to grow multiple fold in the next few years. Although cybersecurity accounts for a fraction of the company's Information Systems and Globals Solutions sector, cybersecurity is expected to become a much more impactful part of this business sector in the coming years.On the government cyber front, the company stands to gain from the rise of unstable and/or unfriendly geopolitical factors. For instance, cyberattacks from Russia and China have already proven to be a huge problem for the U.S. government, which should only grow worse with Russia's continued destabilisation, and China's rapid ascent. As Lockheed Martin dominates the federal cybersecurity space, it should get a disproportionate amount of government cybersecurity business.On the commercial cyber front, Lockheed Martin may see even more growth potential. Cyberattack payoffs are often the largest when targeting corporations, which means that attacks on corporations will only grow with the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks. In fact, 2014 was a record year for cyberattacks on corporations, with many notable cases such as the massive JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) hack. Already, the world is witnessing an unprecedented spike in cyberattacks, from an exponential increase in all types of cyberattacks ranging from malware to DDoS. Lockheed Martin is in prime position to benefit from this increasing surge in cyberthreats.Competitive AdvantagesWith a total revenue of $45.6B in 2014, Lockheed Martin's cybersecurity segment is still tiny percentage of the company's overall business, with revenues in the low-single digit billions. Despite this, the company is still one of the leaders of the cybersecurity segment, as the cybersecurity industry is still relatively small. With cybersecurity being such a small part of the Lockheed Martin's overall business profile, this means that the company has a relatively huge balance sheet backing up its cybersecurity segment. As Lockheed Martin is one of the largest companies in the world, its cybersecurity segment has much more room for error than traditional cybersecurity firms.Unlike pure-plays who rely solely on the cybersecurity business, Lockheed Martin can afford to underperform in its cybersecurity segment and be almost completely unaffected business wise. With such a huge balance sheet backing its cybersecurity business, Lockheed Martin's cybersecurity segment can afford to withstand levels of volatility that pure-plays cannot. In addition, Lockheed Martin has an advantage over its fellow defense contractors in that the company has more or less organically grown its cybersecurity segment. Most other defense contractors that have entered the cybersecurity industry have not experienced anywhere near the level of success that Lockheed Martin has experienced.RisksThe cybersecurity segment is still extremely volatile, which is only natural given the exponential pace of software and hardware progress. This essentially means that cybersecurity solutions/products become obsolete relatively quickly in the fast-evolving digital space. Of course, this presents a risk to Lockheed Martin's cybersecurity segment, although the company is much better positioned to handle this risk than its pure-play competitors. As was mentioned before, the cybersecurity segment still only makes up for a small percentage of the company's overall business profile, which means that it can afford to sustain higher degrees of volatility than its pure play competition (which accounts for the majority of its competition).ConclusionCybersecurity is rapidly becoming one of the most sought-after services by entities of all types, be it governmental agencies, corporations, or even individuals looking to protect private information. As Lockheed Martin has a firm grip on the government cybersecurity space, a strong presence in the commercial cybersecurity markets, and an extremely strong balance sheet to back up its cybersecurity ambitions, the company has additional upside from its promising cybersecurity segment.At a market capitalization of $64B, Lockheed Martin represents an attractive investment. As the company is already extremely well-positioned in the promising defense industry (think the rise of Wahhabi extremism, an increasingly belligerent Russia, the rise of China, tensions in the East Asia sphere, etc.), Lockheed Martin's cybersecurity business will only give the company additional upside."
3009426,74695,2015-03-18T06:57:50-04:00,"Through their joint venture the ULA, Lockheed Martin and Boeing have held a virtual monopoly over U.S. Air Force space launches.SpaceX represents a huge threat to the ULA in the form of a much more competitive space launch alternative for the U.S. Air Force.Lockheed Martin and Boeing stand to lose billions in revenue if their monopoly over U.S. Air Force space launches is broken.","Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) have long held a monopoly over U.S. Air Force space launch contracts, which are worth billions of dollars every year. Lockheed Martin and The Boeing Company , who have partnered up to form a 50-50 joint venture called The United Launch Alliance (ULA), have enjoyed the comfortable benefits of its exclusive relationship with the U.S. Air Force. Unfortunately, for Lockheed Martin and Boeing, this comfortable monopoly is successfully being challenged by Elon Musk run SpaceX.SpaceX's rapid encroachment into the U.S. Air Force space launch program could cause Lockheed Martin and Boeing to lose billions in annual revenue. If SpaceX is successful in breaking the monopoly, which looks to be increasingly likely, Lockheed Martin and Boeing will have to compete with the ultra-innovative SpaceX for future contracts. This, of course, is terrible news for Lockheed Martin and Boeing. In fact, the U.S. Air Force recently confirmed that it should have SpaceX certified to compete for launches in just a short few months.Naturally, this comfortable monopoly enjoyed by Lockheed Martin and Boeing has significantly dulled their innovativeness and motivation to reduce space launch costs. This innovation divide between Lockheed Martin/Boeing and SpaceX should have an enormous negative impact on Lockheed Martin/Boeing's businesses, especially considering the fact that a considerable amount of these companies' revenues come from their space related ventures.Innovation DivideSpaceX has survived and thrived due to the sheer will and innovative genius of Elon Musk and the SpaceX team. The company successfully broke into the space launch industry after what has to have been one of the most brutal company beginnings ever. Originally funded almost completely by Elon Musk's own wealth, SpaceX is a true example of survival of the fittest. Given that SpaceX no longer has to worry about survival, the company's innovative edge is clearly starting to show in cost-comparisons between its launch vehicles and that of the ULA's.The price differential of launch/vehicle costs between Lockheed Martin/Boeing and SpaceX is startling to say the least. SpaceX's costs are not cheaper in the single digit percentages, or even double digit percentages, but magnitudes cheaper. According to last year's Senate hearing involving both SpaceX and the ULA, SpaceX's average launches cost under $90M, while the ULA's average launches cost approximately $400M. While this cost-gap is certainly astonishing, it is not entirely unexpected given the combination of SpaceX's innovativeness, and the ULA's lack of competition.While the introduction of competition will almost certainly cause the average launch cost of ULA vehicles to plummet, it is still questionable whether its vehicles will be able to compete with those of SpaceX's. In fact, SpaceX is incredibly close to developing reusable rockets, which could be devastating for Lockheed Martin/Boeing, as no amount of innovation and cost-reductions will enable these companies to compete with SpaceX. The only way for the ULA to compete with SpaceX would be for the ULA to develop its own reusable rocket technology, which is exceedingly unlikely in the near-mid term.SpaceX's reusable rocket technology could be devastating for Lockheed Martin and Boeing's ULA. Here is a picture of SpaceX's reusable rocket technology in play.Source: engadgetFinancial Impact For Lockheed Martin/BoeingOn a purely competitive basis, it is basically a foregone conclusion that SpaceX would absolutely crush Lockheed Martin/Boeing in terms of pure economics. The only real barrier protecting Lockheed Martin/Boeing from this influx of competition has been its sole-source contracts with the U.S. Air Force. Unfortunately, for Lockheed Martin/Boeing, this barrier is crumbling due to the barrage of negative press/attention aimed at the U.S. Air Force's monopoly relationship with the ULA.SpaceX has already made significant headway into breaking this monopoly relationship between the ULA and the U.S. Air Force, which could translate into billions of lost revenue for both Lockheed Martin and Boeing. In fact, the U.S. Air Force's Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EEVL) contracts would cost the Pentagon approximately $70B over the next 15 years with ULA as the sole launch provider. If SpaceX were to break into this monopoly and take away a significant amount of business, this could easily translate into tens of billions in lost revenue for Lockheed Martin and Boeing.While the space launch business does not represent the majority of either Lockheed Martin or Boeing's business, the financial impact of SpaceX's disruptive influence is significant nonetheless. SpaceX's disruptive influence will likely show up both in terms of immediate and future lost revenues. If we were to assume that SpaceX will out-innovate Lockheed Martin and Boeing moving forward, which is more than likely given the company's amazing track record, then the ULA will almost certainly be crushed in a purely competitive environment.So far, ULA only has a financial edge over SpaceX, although even this is rapidly changing as SpaceX's business is growing exponentially. Just recently, for instance, SpaceX won a $2.6B contract with NASA to develop space taxis for astronauts, although Boeing admittedly won its own $4.2B contract. While Boeing also shared in the spoils, SpaceX's NASA contract nonetheless showcases SpaceX's growing business, and subsequently its balance sheet.ConclusionWhile Lockheed Martin still has upside due to the promise of its other businesses, investors have to be mindful of SpaceX's potential disruptive impact. Lockheed Martin, in particular, is still an attractive investment due to rising geopolitical threats (think Wahhabist terrorism, the rise of China, Russia's instability, etc.) and the increasing technological nature of war (for instance, Lockheed Martin's revolutionary laser), both of which benefit Lockheed Martin immensely.On the other hand, the attractiveness of Boeing as an investment is less clear given the company's recent stock price run-up, and its relatively higher proportion of space related businesses (of which SpaceX could easily encroach into). With that being said, SpaceX's potentially disruptive impact should have a negative impact on both Lockheed Martin and Boeing, which is something investors need to be wary about moving forward."

Lockheed is currently trading at 18.5 times book value, which is wildly higher than the industry group (2.53), industrials sector (2.62), and overall market (2.48) averages. Our algorithms take into account each metric, so the company's extremely high price-book ratio hurts its value rank. With that being said, it should be noted that Lockheed Martin has a history of trading at an extremely high price/book ratio. This ratio is significantly down from it's high of 790x book in January 2013, which has been trending downwards ever since. From a revenue and earnings basis, Lockheed looks attractively priced with both its sales yield (72.5%) and earnings yield (5.6%) being higher than the overall market averages (50.3% & 4.7%). Lockheed also offers a solid dividend yield (3%), which is double the industrial sector average (1.5%). Overall, we rate Lockheed as ""Slightly Overvalued"" but don't expect it to materially hurt the stock's performance versus the S&P 500 over the next twelve months.C) Growth BreakdownThere are a variety of different growth metrics that have been shown to predict stock returns. Most important among them is price momentum. Winning stocks keep winning (based on six-month price performance), and losing stocks keep losing. Lockheed Martin's growth breakdown is shown below:SourceAs we said at the start of the report, Lockheed Martin should be bought because of its growth not its value. Over the last six and twelve months, Lockheed has vastly outperformed its industry group, sector, and the overall market. Lockheed grew EPS (+24%) at more than double the rate of its industry group (11%), which is especially impressive given its immense size (>$62 billion market cap). Lockheed's management has clearly been doing their job well, as evidenced by their extremely strong return on equity (85%). This is a very positive sign, and shows that management has been able to convert its EPS growth into tangible value for its shareholders. Overall, Lockheed Martin is a ""Strong Growth"" company, and we expect its growth profile to contribute to significant outperformance over the next year.D) Earnings BreakdownNext, we'll see how Lockheed has been performing relative to analyst expectations recently. We've found through historical back testing that stocks that have a history of beating analyst expectations are much more likely to beat estimates in the future. This is key as stocks that beat analyst estimates often see big jumps in price, and vice versa for earnings misses. Lockheed's earnings estimate breakdown is shown below:SourceLockheed beat consensus EPS estimates by 7% last quarter, extending its streak of consecutive EPS beats to eight. It also beat on consensus revenue numbers (by 5.5%), though it had missed the quarter before. Still, the stock has now beaten EPS estimates nine times out of the last ten quarters and beat revenue estimates eight times. Our earnings model is projecting a very high probability of beating EPS estimates next quarter (75-100% probability) with the expected beat to be about the same size as last quarter. The model is less optimistic on revenue numbers, though it still expects a small beat. Analysts are calling for $2.48 in EPS and $10.22 billion in sales when the company releases (projected to be in 51 days, or early April).E) Qualitative Analysis & ConclusionNow that we've analyzed the numbers, we'll now qualitatively discuss potential catalysts for growth. As we said at the start of the report, escalation in the Middle East and the continuing conflict in Ukraine will be industry tailwinds for Lockheed. As the chart below shows, Lockheed's stock price seems to have benefited from the conflicts:Chart courtesy of John Anastakis, Special Adviser to QuantifiedAlphaThere is no doubt that investors have been piling into defense contractors whenever conflicts have escalated. While Boko Haram's pledge of allegiance to ISIS may not change anything tangibly, it makes US intervention much easier for the US public to swallow. It does this by cementing to the public the idea that ISIS is a legitimate threat that is gaining influence and power. If the US does indeed increase their use of force into Iraq, it is likely that the US defense contractors will gain significantly. Again, this is a distant possibility given President Obama's reluctance, but we feel there is a much higher probability of further escalation versus the chance of de-escalation. One potential risk faced by many US defense contractors is the rapidly appreciating US dollar. This risk is mitigated with Lockheed Martin, as the US government accounts for the overwhelming majority of its revenue (approximately 80%).Overall, we feel Lockheed Martin represents a very strong growth stock that has been crushing analyst estimates recently and that is still trading at a relatively fair valuation. With the potential to gain from the escalating conflict in Iraq as well as the continued conflict in Ukraine, the time is now to buy into US defense contractors. We believe Lockheed Martin is the best of the bunch, and maintain a ""Moderate Outperform"" on the stock over the next twelve months."
2899406,72215,2015-02-09T14:52:11-05:00,"With more spending diverted towards the military for fiscal year 2016, the increase in the budget could be directed to ordering more F-35 jets.Lockheed Martin has said that F-35 jets, which now cost about $108 million to produce, have seen their costs decline by as much as 57% in the past eight years.The aeronautics segment of the company could see significant improvements in its top line growth in the future, with margin expansion on the way.The company’s international backlog orders which amounted to nearly $20 billion. This shows that the company is now focusing on growth by securing orders from countries other than the US.We have consistently seen the company increase dividends by 10% in the past five years. With $80.5billion in backlogs, there is certainty about cash flows.","Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), which has suffered the brunt of cuts in military spending, has some things going its way in the current year which suggest that the company's long term growth prospects are intact. The recent result announcement and developments that have surfaced are indicative of the company's long term growth not only being secured, but also being dependent on contracts being secured outside of the US.Fourth quarter recapLockheed Martin recently reported its fourth quarter results and saw its production and delivery of F-35 Fighter jets lift its results, despite softening in the military spending budgets. The company reported quarterly revenues of $12.5 billion, which grew by 8.6% year on year. Quarterly revenues beat analyst estimates of $11.89 billion. The company also saw its bottom line improve, as earnings amounted to $904 million. The 85% increase in net earnings translated into earnings per share of $2.82 for the quarter. The company saw its backlog recover and amount to $80.5 billion by the end of last year. The company has forecasted declines in revenues by as much as 4.6% for the current year. The reason for this decline was sighted as the lower than expected pension income due to the low discount rate environment that is prevailing in the country.F-35 orders, revenues and margins to witness increase One of the main highlights was the high growth in volumes of F-35 jets. The company is the chief contractor for F-35 jets for the US military, which accounts for about 81% of Lockheed Martin's revenues. To begin with, President Obama has propositioned for an increase in the military budget of the country which bids well for Lockheed Martin. With more spending diverted towards the military for fiscal year 2016, Lockheed Martin is set to gain from this bump in the budget as most of the increase in the budget could be directed to ordering more F-35 jets. The Pentagon has said that an increase in the orders of these jets is necessary to complement the country's current defense strategy. The F-35 Fighter Jets have previously been excluded from budget cuts that have been introduced in the past. In more recent news, the Pentagon has planned to spend nearly $10.6 billion on these jets by 1st October. The Pentagon now plans on purchasing 57 of these jets, instead of the 38 that it had initially planned on purchasing. This increase in purchase plans suggests that the F-35 jets have a long future ahead of itself. In fact, the jets are expected to cost about $1 trillion over the next 50 years. Moreover, Lockheed Martin has said that these jets, which now cost about $108 million to produce, have seen their costs decline by as much as 57% in the past eight years and could cost nearly $85 million by the next 4-5 years as more production efficient technology comes into place. These latest developments are good news for Lockheed Martin's future as they not only mean that the aviation segment of the company will gain more momentum going forward, but we could also be looking at potential improvements in margins as the costs of manufacturing come down.International markets become new areas of focus Another key take away from the result was the improvement of the company's international backlog orders which amounted to nearly $20 billion. This shows that the company is now focusing on growth on its top and bottom lines by securing orders from countries other than the US. This focus on international markets is a step in the right direction for Lockheed Martin, given the possibilities of declines in US military budgets, going forward. In one of the most latest developments that have surfaced is the contract modification secured by the company for building testing equipment for combat avionics for the US Navy. The contract is worth $78.5 million. This development is suggestive of the company also working n the development of top line contributions from other segments that it operates.Shareholder rewards to continue Moreover, the company was active in its share repurchase program as it spent nearly $1.9 billion on buybacks during the year. The company paid out $1.8 billion in dividends during the year. We saw the company generate operating cash flow of $3.9 billion during the year, with most of it being returned to shareholders. We have consistently seen the company increase dividends by 10% in the past five years. With $80.5billion in backlogs, there is certainty about cash flows that can be expected to flow in, in the near term. The stock itself has been a good dividend play, especially as the company continues to reward its investors for being resilient in the face of challenges of possible declines in top line growth.Conclusion The aeronautics segment of the company could see significant improvements in its top line growth in the future, with margin expansion on the way. The company's gross and operating margins are currently above 10%, and investors could witness them expand over the course of the next few years. We could be looking at little reliance on US contracts to secure stream of revenues with the passage of time, with the company gaining a strong foothold in the international market as well. Although I do believe that the company may report slowdowns in its revenues for the year, the future ahead for the company seems strong. I predict that the stock holds the potential for some significant upside in the future, though it may be left hanging in the current year due to lower pension income. The company's good track record of beating analyst estimates for earnings, and the smooth upward course of earnings suggest that the company will deliver an earnings beat by the end of this year as well, which could push the stock upwards. The company's stock trades close to its 52 week high of $198.88, also having seen a low of $153.51. Analysts remain conservative in their targets for share prices, estimating prices at $203.50 by the end of one year. The long term growth potential makes me to believe that we could see the stock well above the $220 mark in the next 2 years or so, with bullish prospects in the long term. I would suggest taking a long position in the stock for a medium to long term investment horizon."
2869596,74695,2015-01-30T14:47:20-05:00,"Lockheed Martin reported lukewarm quarter 4 results, beating revenue estimates while lowering guidance.Regardless of Lockheed Martin's mixed quarterly results, the company is moving in the right direction with its focus on expansion and innovation.While the Pentagon's massive trillion dollar defense spending cut has put a damper on the company's near-term prospects, Lockheed Martin has positioned itself well to make up for lost revenue.Regardless of Lockheed Martin's tepid fourth quarter, the company remains a standout in the defense contractor/advanced technologies industry.","Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) reported slightly disappointing quarter 4 results this past Tuesday. While the company's quarter 4 revenue of $12.5B beat analyst estimates of $11.89B (largely due to F-35 demand), it lowered its 2015 pension income guidance to around $475M from its previous $650M estimate. Lowered discount rates have been the main cause of the pension income drop, which have increased company's pension liabilities.On top of the lowered income pension guidance, the Pentagon's defense spending cuts are expected to negatively impact Lockheed Martin's business, with the company reporting a 2015 earnings forecast below analyst expectations. Despite the lowered guidance, Lockheed Martin reported otherwise promising/modest results.The company's quarter 4 financial results are summarized in the following:- The adjusted quarterly earnings of the company rose approximately 26% from its quarter 3 EPS of $2.38 to its quarter 4 EPS of $3.01.- The company's total 2014 revenue rose slightly YoY to $45.6B, with the company's backlog decreased slightly YoY from $82.6B in 2013 to $80.5B in 2014.- Lockheed Martin's aeronautics sector reported quarterly sales of $4.1B, representing a 6% YOY increase. The rest of the company's business segments (information systems/global solutions, missiles and fire control, mission systems and training, and space systems) all reported quarterly sales of around $2B, with mixed YoY gains/losses.This chart gives a more detailed breakdown of the company's individual business segmentsSource: Lockheed MartinWhile the company's financial results certainly did not blow past expectations, they were still somewhat impressive in light of the Pentagon's massive $1T budget spending cut over the next decade. Despite the U.S. government's defense spending slowdown, Lockheed Martin is making some important steps and still has great prospects moving forward.International ExpansionWith global conflicts heating up significantly, Lockheed Martin's strategy of increasing its focus on the international stage appears to be paying dividends. In fact, the company reported that it has backlogged $20B worth of international business, representing more than 25% of the company's year-end backlog. This puts the company well on track to achieve its goal of expanding international sales to comprise at least 25% of its total sales over the next few years. Most of the company's international sales comprise of missile defense products, such as the Aegis Combat Systems, THAADs, Patriots, etc, in addition to high-dollar items such as the C-130J, and F-16 fighter jets.Not only does international growth help add to the company's overall business portfolio, but it also benefits the company's domestic base. The reason for this is that the companies higher production volumes (due to increased international sales) enable for larger economies of scale and cost leverage, which then helps to cut costs across the board. As the company continues to diversify and expand its business in foreign countries, the benefits that come with scale should only increase.Given the extremely volatile situation in the Middle East, largely caused by the huge resurgence of Wahhabist terrorism in the form of ISIL (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant), Middle Eastern countries are becoming increasingly desperate for high-tech weaponry and defense systems. Lockheed Martin has taken heed of the volatile situation, and is continually forming important business relations with Middle Eastern governments. As per CEO Marilyn Hewson,While the Middle East represents the most immediate opportunities for the company, perhaps even more promising is the Asia-Pacific region, where tensions between China and its neighboring countries (in particular Japan) seem to be mounting by the day. Disputes over resource rich islands, such as the Senkaku (or Diaoyu) islands, will give Lockheed Martin the chance to bring its expertise and capabilities to these regions. In addition, North Korea adds another element of volatility to the already instable region, in which the company could take advantage of by increasing its business ties with the South Korean government.Innovation and Acquisitions Ramp UpLockheed Martin has rapidly increased its R&D expenditures over the past few years, outpacing its sales trajectory. For the year of 2014, the company was up another 8% in R&D spendings, which highlights company's commitment towards innovation. Lockheed Martin understands that in spite of sales numbers, innovation will always have precedence over everything else. The defense industry is, after all, one of the most advanced and competitive industries in the world. With the likes of Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Raytheon Company (RTN) as the company's main competitors, a relentless push towards developing the most cutting-edge technology is key for success. As Lockheed Martin's CEO puts it, R&D is ""really the lifeblood of our company and we are a technology company and we have to continue to invest.""Lockheed Martin also spends a lot of its resources in cooperative R&D, rather than in just internal R&D. This is very important for the company as weapons and defense systems often need to be modified/adjusted based on differing situations. For instance, different countries may require modified versions of defense systems to suit their situational needs. A landlocked country under constant attack, such as Israel, may need much more sophisticated missile defense systems. Cooperative R&D may also have synergistic effects, where ideas are exchanged to make for better products. Lockheed Martin, for example, teamed up with South Korea in hopes of doing just this. The company has stated in its quarter 4 earnings call that,Lockheed Martin has also ramped up acquisition spendings significantly in 2014. The company's increased acquisitions can be seen as just another strategy to spur innovation and push technological boundaries. With acquisitions such as Zeta Associates, Systems Made Simple, and Astrotech, the company is clearly looking to add capabilities in all areas of its business, from healthcare to space travel. With the company's financial clout, acquisitions such as these offer more reward than risk. The company summarizes its acquisitions strategy by stating,Innovation has been the historical driver for Lockheed Martin's success, and the company is wise to increase R&D even in spite of relatively weaker sales. The company's continued investment into innovation will be a long-term differentiator between itself and the competition. The company's flagship products have in fact only been possible through intense innovation. For instance, the company's highly-touted F-35 jet has been met with high demand, largely because of its astronomical R&D spendings. In fact, the company has already sold 109 of these jets as of quarter 4, with demand only increasing.RisksWhile Lockheed Martin is well-positioned moving forward, the company is still heavily vested in the relatively volatile defense industry. With the company's increasing global penetration, it will not only be subject to the whims of the Pentagon, but also to the unpredictability of global conflict. Geopolitics is one of the most complex arenas, where singular and/or unpredictable events can trigger massive defense spending increases or cuts.Despite such risks, global conflict only seems to be heating up in recent years, with Wahhabist terrorism at the forefront. This terrorist movement has even spawned in areas such as West Africa in the form of Boko Haram. Tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, especially those regarding China and North Korea, seem to be higher than ever. Lockheed Martin will likely be needed more than ever in the years to come, as countries will need to continually defend themselves from emerging threats of the kind.SpaceX also represents a risk to Lockheed Martin, albeit a small one given Lockheed Martin's main focus on the defense industry rather than the aerospace industry. While Lockheed Martin has had the luxury of competing in a rather monopolized Air Force space flight program, safety from new competition in this arena appears to be a thing in the past. While SpaceX has dropped its lawsuit against the Air Force, this was only done so on the condition that the Air Force start to open up its launch contracts to new competition. Given SpaceX's amazing innovative streak, the company will almost certainly represent an unprecedented challenge to Lockheed Martin's aerospace segment.ConclusionLockheed Martin continues to be one of the largest advanced technologies companies in the world, with an impressive market capitalization of $60B. The company has long been a standout in the defense industry (among many others), and continues to prove that it can adapt to changing circumstances. Despite the Pentagon's massive $1T defense spending cut over the next decade, Lockheed Martin is successfully finding ways to replace this lost revenue. While the company's quarter 4 results were neither good nor bad, Lockheed Martin continues to take the right steps, and has plenty of long-term upside."
2822026,65113,2015-01-15T03:34:50-05:00,"I use the Capital Asset Pricing Model to illustrate the risk-return characteristics of Lockheed Martin (LMT) during a period of market upturn and a period of market downturn.
        The analysis shows that Lockheed Martin is among the best performers during periods of market upturn, while being the greatest under performer of the S&P 500 during market downturns.
        However, I believe Lockheed Martin's impressive characteristics as a dividend stock will continue to be of appeal to long-term investors despite defense spending cuts.","In this article, I use the Capital Asset Pricing Model to illustrate the risk-return characteristics of Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) during the time periods 8th September 2008 to 7th November 2011, and 7th November 2011 to 13th January 2015. In the analysis, I demonstrate that Lockheed Martin shows a high Jensen's Alpha return during periods of market upturns, and significantly underperforms the market during periods of market downturns. In this context, I compare the performance of Lockheed Martin with competitors Boeing (NYSE:BA), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), and Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC). The analysis demonstrates that Lockheed Martin has been among the best performers during the latter period, and the most underperforming during the former.8th September 2008 - 7th November 2011As can be seen from the below, all four companies lag the market index during this time period, with Lockheed Martin showing a negative Jensen's Alpha value of -0.09%. Additionally, we see that with an R-Squared value of 7.28%, only 7.28% of the company's returns are ""explained"" by the market index, the remaining 92.72% is owed to extraneous factors. This would imply that Lockheed Martin would significantly underperform the market index during periods of market downturns assuming a similar R-Squared value during this period. Nevertheless, the three other aerospace and defense stocks included in the analysis also show negative Jensen's Alpha values, suggesting that the aerospace and defense industry is likely to underperform during periods of market downturn.Source: Author's CalculationsSource: Yahoo Finance7th November 2011 to 13th January 2015The results below illustrate that with a Jensen's alpha of 0.04% on a daily basis, Lockheed Martin, along with Northrop Grumman outperform the market daily return of 0.02% during this period. In addition, the R-Squared value indicates that 38.57% of the company's returns are ""explained"" by the market index, the remaining 61.43% is owed to extraneous factors. Additionally, we see that the beta of 0.8 is the lowest for all four companies, and notably the risk-return slope in the aerospace and defense industry during this period is negative, i.e. the higher the beta, the lower the overall return.Source: Author's CalculationsSource: Yahoo FinanceSurprisingly, the returns of these companies do not appear to be greatly influenced by defense spending. For instance, we can see in the graph below that for the period 2008-2011, defense spending increased quite significantly, reaching almost 6 per cent of GDP in 2010. However, returns for Lockheed Martin and other companies in this industry decreased quite significantly during this period. However, defense spending has since dropped and is expected to account for 4.6 percent of GDP this year - returns for the four companies have conversely increased during this period.Source: usgovernmentspending.comIn this regard, despite the fact that the Pentagon is set to seek a 20% cut in war funding, I do not see this having a great impact on Lockheed Martin's returns during this time. Therefore, I don't think Jim Cramer is too far off the mark when he states that Lockheed Martin, along with Northrop Grumman is set to go higher. Additionally, given Lockheed Martin's impressive dividend yield of 3.09% which is the highest of the four firms, along with 12 years of consecutive dividend increases, this holds a lot of appeal to income investors who are not too concerned with short-term performance relative to the market.In conclusion, I believe that the findings of this article offer several useful insights. Firstly, according to these two time periods the rate of defense spending has not correlated highly with Lockheed Martin's returns, with the company exhibiting negative returns during periods of greater spending and positive returns during periods of lower spending. In addition, the aerospace and defense sector in general exhibits a negative risk-reward ratio during periods of market upturn, i.e. the lower the risk, the higher the reward. Lockheed Martin has shown the lowest beta value during the most recent period, and despite the fact that it is prone to a high degree of capital loss during periods of market downturn, its impressive characteristics as an income-oriented stock means that long-term investors stand to benefit from increasing dividend payments and a high degree of capital gains during periods of market upturn."
2865046,65603,2015-01-29T15:20:43-05:00,The dividend continues to buoy the stock.Management is committed to returning shareholder value.Over $80B in backlog results in predictable cash flows.,"Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is the largest defense contractor in the US, operating five segments:1. Aeronautics: Designs, develops, manufactures, maintains, and upgrades military aircraft (e.g. F-35, F-22, F-16) and associated technologies.2. Space Systems: Produces equipment and provides services relating to satellites, strategic and defensive missile systems, and launch services3. Missiles and Fire Control (MFC): Manufactures missiles and fire control systems4. Information Systems & Global Services (IS&GS): Provides IT services to the government5. Mission Systems and Training (MST): Provides System engineering, software development, complex program management, supply chain solutions, logistics, training and simulation technologies to the governmentLockheed Martin's unique competitive position allows the firm to shift its focus to international growth and improved affordability while US federal budgets are under pressure. They conduct business across 70 countries and derive over 20% of revenue from international sales. Recently, they have won air traffic control work and IT networks contracts in the UK, sold C-130Js to Saudi Arabia, and provided helicopter targeting and radar systems for Korea. Furthermore, the firm has taken to strategic M&A to improve its global footprint, acquiring Amor Group to expand its IT capabilities in IT solutions. We feel that the current low interest environment, along with the high cost of repatriating international funds to the US, could be a driver for further M&A activity that will allow Lockheed to tap into international markets. Accretive acquisitions of late have been well received by acquirers' shareholders and Lockheed also has the potential to benefit.The firm is also catering to customer demands for affordability over capability by cutting costs. Lockheed has reduced its operations in the US (e.g., Newtown, Akron, etc.) and will continue to transfer its low margin operations. The workforce has been reduced by over 30,000. The full cost benefit of this restructuring should be seen in late 2015 and beyond.Out of the five segments, Aeronautics contributes the majority of Lockheed Martin's revenues, and is currently aided by higher F-35 Jet demand.Lockheed Martin recently guided 2015 earnings below analyst estimates as a result of lower pension income. The firm now expects 2015 pension income of $475M, down from previous guidance of $650M. We would note that Lockheed is just one of many major firms to decrease 2015 pension guidance. United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) also cut its outlook due to pension rate adjustments and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) posted heavy losses related to pension costs. We believe that solid and predictable cash flows, backed by $80.5B in backlog, and steadily increasing dividend payouts will continue to carry LMT higher.LMT BacklogSource: Lockheed Martin WebsiteLMT's Continuously Increasing DividendsLMT Dividend data by YChartsWe believe that Lockheed Martin pays investors a healthy dividend in return for waiting out challenging times for the defense sector. In 2014, management sent shareholders the majority of their $3.9B in cash from operations, having repurchased $1.9B of shares and paid $1.76B of dividends. We like that management is adamant on returning free cash flow to shareholders, and we are confident that the stock will be buoyed on this basis. In fact, annual dividends have increased by over 10% annually for the past 5 years. Overall, LMT is rewarding its investors handsomely for remaining invested during a period when the Department of Defense is scaling down its budget. We recommend a long position in LMT with a great dividend and DoD budget cut delays serving as incremental upside."
2821986,74855,2015-01-15T03:20:14-05:00,"Revenue growth from the US, which accounts for 81.25% of the company’s revenues, expected to decline as the government slashed 20% off its previous war fund budget.Middle Eastern defense spending is expected to decline in the near term as oil prices sustain themselves at levels lower than required for the defense budgets to break even.The Asia Pacific region shows signs of promising growth in the near term, which provides Lockheed with a region to focus more on to combat declining revenues.Revenue will continue its downward trend this year, and will fall by a single low digit rate, according to the company’s expectations.The stock of the company is a good investment based on the company’s potential for earnings growth, strong history of dividend increases and certainty in earnings outlook.","Following reports of a decline in the US defense spending, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is now turning to international markets to fuel its growth. In some of the most recent reports, the Pentagon is seeking a 20% budget reduction in US war funding for the fiscal year commencing from 1st of October. The defense budget of the country is looking at further cuts in the budget for fiscal year 2016 as well. Lockheed Martin, that gains nearly 81.95% of its revenues from the US, faces substantial declines in its revenues as a result of this budget cut down the line. Revenues from the US have already declined by a little over 4% year on year, and it only seems fitting that Lockheed turns towards revenues from foreign governments to combat this decline. For this year however, Lockheed has managed to secure a new $78 million contract with the US Army for upgrading tactical missiles, which makes it the first of the number of contracts that the company will proceed to secure during the course of this year.Foreign government spending constitutes about 17.13% of Lockheed's revenues. This geographical segment of operations has seen its revenues decline by nearly 3.57% year on year. However, despite the fall, the rate of decline is still lower than that of the loss in revenues that the company could account for in the US. Countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE, Jordan and Qatar have been expanding their military spending over the years. For the current year, these countries are expected to spend about $95 billion for procuring defense equipment. However, the volatility in oil prices raises concerns about the continuity of growth from this segment as well, since they could alter the growth and procurement plans across the Middle Eastern region. With all prices having declined by over 50% in the past six months, it becomes difficult for these countries to balance their defense budgets since their breakeven oil price is higher than the current oil prices in the market. According to a report by the United Nations, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar and Iran have higher oil prices to break even with their budgets relative to current oil price levels. It is important to note that these countries benefited immensely during periods of higher oil prices, which allowed them to establish reserve funds, which could cushion the blow to their defense pending as oil prices drop, but only for the time being. Despite the higher breakeven price, Iran has also hiked its military spending amid defense concerns as well.Given the statistics and reports that these Middle Eastern countries have decided to leave their budgets unaltered, Lockheed should not expect a major drop in revenues from this region this year. However, when these reserves set aside for troubled times begin to dry out, Lockheed could see its revenues declines in the near term. While the annual growth rate for Middle Eastern defense spending stood at 8.45% between 2010-2014, the growth is expected to slow down to 3.48% between 2015-2019. While Lockheed enjoyed revenue boosts during the high growth period of defense spending; sometimes as high as 25% during fiscal year 2011, the company could expect its foreign government revenues to take a hit a few years down the line, with a decline of over 4% year on year as time progresses, especially as oil prices are expected to settle down between $60-$80 per barrel.While the slowdown in growth of defense spending from the US and Middle East comes as bad news for Lockheed Martin, the company's operations in Japan, India, Singapore and Korea are expected to do well and bring in revenues in the near term as Asia Pacific defense spending is expected to exceed that of the US by 2020 and as India becomes the third largest defense market by 2020. That being said, Lockheed's focus on foreign governments to bring in revenues is a good initiative and the company would do well by focusing on the Asia Pacific region to fuel this growth, since the region has the highest potential for growth in the next few years.In the company's latest earnings release, revenues declined by about 2.2% in the nine months ended in September 2014. This decline in revenue growth has raised investor concerns, especially as future cuts in defense budgets by governments could increase the pace of these declines. However, this decline in revenues has not altered the company's net earnings, which managed to swell by 8.7%, mostly due to the company's cost cutting initiatives. Announcing $8.54 earnings per share was a significant boost to investor confidence, despite the troubling declines in top lines.The factor that leaves investor confidence unaltered at this point in time is the fact the company's earnings have seen variability in meeting analyst consensus estimates and have continued with their smooth upward trajectory over the past few years. Moreover, an analysis of the company's historical financials have shown that it has been able widen its gross and operating margins to above 10%. Its dividends have registered strong growth, having more than doubled in the past five years. The consistent potential for earnings growth and dividend increases announced in the past suggest that the company has solid dividend growth to offer, going forward. Its free cash flow position has seems stable, however, its quick ratio position of 0.75 and debt/equity ratio if 1.35 suggests that its liquidity and debt levels need proper management. Trading at 19.74x its earnings, the stocks of the company offer investors an impressive 3.10% dividend yield, with a dividend of about $6 per share.Revenue growth remains a cause of concern for Lockheed Martin, and one that could mount into a significant problem, should the company decide to act quickly and focus its revenue diversification into other markets. The company's focus on booking international contracts, as it did during the course of last year by booking contracts with Japan, Israel and South Korea, are the growth that the company needs to fuel its long term prospects. If Lockheed Martin can manage to make its presence prominent in markets like the Asia Pacific region, it could actively combat revenue declines. Although the US government spending accounts for the largest portion of the company's revenue contribution, it probably will be best for Lockheed Martin to take a step back from this revenue channel and diversify top line growth by making deals with other countries. With top line improvements in the bag, the company's cost cutting initiatives could very well lead to improvements in the company's future results as well. For the year, Lockheed Martin expects net sales to decline by low digit rates relative to 2014. This expectation seems highly probable, with the US government still the main source of the company's revenues for the year.While the decline in revenues, and the possibility of this to continue into the future, may cause the company to run into a few problems down the line, Lockheed Martin retains its spot as one of the best options investors have in the defense industry, especially if investors are dividend seekers. The company holds immense potential to grow its earnings, predictability in its earnings and a good track record for its dividends. The stock has been bullish over the past one year, has gained nearly 30% in terms of value. This run is expected to continue on this year as well, especially because the company offers a lot of potential to expand its bottom lines. Investors are looking at gains not only in terms of dividends, but share price increases as well."
2747455,78355,2014-12-14T15:49:55-05:00,,"By Ethan CoyIn his final address to the American people in 1961, President Dwight D. Eisenhower warned of the power of the growing “military industrial complex.” To Eisenhower, having a well-armed nation was imperative, but he warned about the repercussions of the defense industry wielding influence. He encouraged the American people to beware of the ""danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite."" A look at the defense industry today would reveal that Eisenhower was right.According to Fidelity, the U.S. aerospace and defense industry today encompasses major corporations valued together at over $600 billion. And, by no accident, many of the companies in this industry are headquartered around Washington, D.C. The defense industry is tremendously effective at lobbying, which procures government contracts. According to Open Secrets, the defense industry spent $134 million lobbying Congress in 2013, including almost $400,000 to Senator Thad Cochran (R-Ms). Bloomberg’s Douglas Rothacker and his colleague George Ferguson write, “Mississippi Senator Thad Cochran's ascendancy to Appropriations Committee chairman in a Republican Senate, and support from shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls (NYSE:HII), may help Navy programs and the second-largest employer on the state's coast.” Lockheed Martin’s (NYSE:LMT) Joint Strike Fighter program, expected to cost over $1 trillion over its 50+ year lifespan, already 70% over budget, has infuriated Senator John McCain. Speaking on the Senate floor in June of this year, he said, “this is, of course, totally unacceptable. It is the kind of cronyism that should make us all vigilant against, as President Eisenhower warned us over 50 years ago, the military-industrial complex.” However, it’s not just political lobbying that has caused defense budgets to balloon. Over the past year, there has been a tremendous increase in geopolitical conflicts, which have destabilized markets and increased global economic volatility. Amidst this volatility, the aerospace and defense industry has seen a significant growth in market capitalization, perhaps a direct result of investors seeking stable companies. Lockheed Martin, for example, has experienced a 40% rise in stock price in the past year, which has increased its market capitalization to almost $60 billion.Wall Street analysts originally feared that sequestration would limit defense contractors’ access to government funds. In fact, a projection done by George Mason Professor Stephen Fuller in conjunction with the Aerospace Industry Association estimates that half a million jobs would be lost in the defense industry as a result of sequestration. However, the impacts were quite contrary. For one, defense contracts tend to span many years and the effect of the sequester, therefore, did not substantially impact bottom line profits, explains Marjorie Censer and Jim Tankersley of the Washington Post. In addition, because of the defense industry’s strong lobbying arm, it has continued to thrive. Even as other businesses with government contracts have had to tighten their belts, defense contractors have thrived as threats from ISIS and elsewhere force President Obama to work with Congress on funding military operations. And, because of America’s reluctance to send more than military advisors to Iraq and Syria, America has fought a war largely through the use of UAVs, unmanned aerial vehicles, and powerful fighter jets. Despite fears that sequestration would stifle defense industry growth, the defense industry has outpaced the S&P since August 2, 2011.Although defense contractors seem to be thriving, they have begun to diversify their business segments. Lockheed Martin, known for its aeronautics and missile systems, recently announced a design breakthrough in energy production that it believes would deliver functional fusion energy by 2020. Critics, however, have pointed to the lack of information Lockheed has released about its discovery, and doubt the feasibility of such technology. Northrop Grumman, another defense company, has recently begun to diversify its businesses by establishing itself in the cybersecurity market. Customers have entrusted Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) with tremendous amounts of sensitive data (in many cases the customer is the U.S. government), and therefore, they must find a way to keep this information safe. So, if companies like Northrop Grumman develop technologies equipped to keep the U.S. government’s information safe, there is an opportunity to leverage the technology and offer similar services to other companies.In terms of geopolitical conflicts, ISIS is not the only global threat fueling defense spending. It is well known that China’s military aggression has put pressure on Japan to increase its military expenditures, however, the threat China poses to the United States is not well publicized. For example, a late draft of the annual report of the bipartisan U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission described China’s increased space warfare programs. These programs pose a threat to American satellites, which are vital to United States national security. The report concludes that, Congress should increase funding for naval deployments in Asia, among other expensive expenditures. If Congress takes these threats seriously, the defense industry would receive yet another significant boost. President Eisenhower had a point; defense contractors do have significant political influence. But, Congress would not be agreeing to the demands of lobbyists if there were not such credible threats. And as the Senate now goes back into the hands of the Republicans, expect even more support for the defense industry coming from Capitol Hill. As long as the world remains dangerous and its future uncertain, defense contractors will continue to thrive.Disclosure: None"
2720085,72015,2014-12-02T04:09:47-05:00,"This article compares three large cap aerospace and defense companies that each offer strong dividends: Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon.
        Although it trades at the most expensive valuation of the group, Lockheed Martin offers the highest projected future earnings growth and analysts are fairly consistent in their earnings predictions.
        Each of these companies has increased their dividend by at least 40% during the past three years.
        Lockheed Martin seemingly represents the most compelling investment in the aerospace and defense sector for income and dividend growth focused investors.","Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) and Raytheon (RTN) are three of the largest aerospace and defense companies in North America and each stock currently yields 2% or above. Income investors looking to add an industrial stock to their portfolios should consider these three firms. This article compares these companies based on their projected earnings growth, future earnings predictability and dividend growth track records to determine which stock appears most attractive to income investors.The first part of the analysis looks at the firms' current valuations and projected earnings growth. Apart from the standard PEG (price to growth) ratio, this also features what I am calling an MPG (or modified price to growth ratio) which subtracts the coefficient variance of next year's projected earnings forecasts from the long term earnings growth rate. The coefficient variance represents earnings uncertainty, so the MPG penalizes stocks with greater earnings variability and gives a relative advantage to companies with more easily predictable future growth. Generally, companies with solid and consistent earnings growth potential and a history of dividend increases will offer impressive dividend growth moving forward.(sources of data: Yahoo! Finance, MarketWatch)Although Lockheed Martin trades at the most expensive valuation of the group, it also possesses the highest expected annualized earnings growth rate. In addition, Lockheed Martin has the least variability in analysts' earnings forecasts. Therefore, although Raytheon has a slightly lower (better) PEG ratio than Lockheed, once future earnings predictability is included in the model, Lockheed Martin becomes the most attractive stock in this group from a risk adjusted earnings growth perspective. While Northrop Grumman is the cheapest stock of the three based on its current price to earnings ratio, it has both the lowest projected earnings growth rate and the highest coefficient variance, making it unattractive relative to its two competitors based on these metrics.(source of data: Nasdaq.com)Lockheed Martin also pays the highest dividend of the group by a significant margin. Each of the three companies has increased its dividend by between 40% and 50% during the last three years, which is a remarkable level of dividend growth. Furthermore, Lockheed has more than doubled its quarterly payment to shareholders during the past five years, while Raytheon has increased it by more than 95% over this period.While Northrop Grumman has the lowest payout ratio of the group, its current yield is the lowest and its track record of dividend growth is less appealing than those of its competitors. Based on its moderate payout ratio and recent history, one could reasonably argue that Raytheon might actually offer its investors the highest level of future dividend growth of any of these aerospace and defense firms.However, based on the above data, Lockheed Martin appears to be the top choice for income investors in the aerospace and defense industry. The stock pays a significantly higher current yield than its main competitors, has the most attractive future earnings growth potential and most predictable earnings outlook according to analysts and also has the best dividend growth track record of these three corporations. While its payout ratio is above average, it remains at a reasonable level. Raytheon represents an interesting second choice - it offers similar earnings growth potential to Lockheed Martin and trades at a lower price to earnings multiple. Nevertheless, while its dividend track record is also impressive, a difference of nearly 1% in current yield keeps it firmly in second place. Income investors considering adding an aerospace and defense stock to their portfolios should choose Lockheed Martin over Northrop Grumman and Raytheon for its above average yield and impressive earnings and dividend growth potential."
2704195,73925,2014-11-23T00:57:12-05:00,"$4.7 billion contract has been awarded to Lockheed Martin for 43 F-35s.Consistently winning new contracts, even though the defense budget is facing reductions, is a positive sign for the company.The stock is recommended investment for short term.","On Friday, November 21, 2014, the Pentagon awarded Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE:LMT) a contract for an eight batch of F-35 fighter jets, worth $4.7 billion, that lowered the average price per jet by 3.5 percent from the last contract, and 57 percent from the first batch. The deal includes 29 jets for the United States and 14 for five other countries: Israel, Japan, Norway, Britain and Italy. More than 200 F-35s will be in operation by eight countries once the production of those jets is completed. The Pentagon has signed a separate contract valued at $1.05 billion for an eighth batch of engines built by Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp (NYSE:UTX), to power the jets.The United States defense budgets are under pressure due to Budget Control Act of 2011, which limits discretionary spending and it also provides for additional spending reductions known as the ""sequestration"", which went into effect in March 2013, it would reduce the planned defense spending by $500 billion over a period of nine years that began in GFY 2013. The U.S. government, being the prime customer of Lockheed, is cutting down its defense budget; however, its impact has been reduced by the Bipartisan Budget Act, which increased the limits on discretionary spending for GFY 2014 and GFY 2015 imposed by the Budget Control Act.It has been reported in the original article that the short-term prospects for the company will not get hurt. However, long-term defense budget decline can negatively influence the company, to some extent. Since Lockheed is a stable company, even though this year's projected revenues of the company have seen a slight decline compared to the last year, the company still managed to post higher EPS compared to last year. That shows company's effective management of costs. And with this contract, the F-35 program costs are further expected to reduce. Plus it also depicts that, even with decline in the defense budget, Lockheed martin is still winning new contracts, which is positive sign for the company, showing that its prospects are not much affected by the budget decline. My opinion regarding LMT stock is unchanged, having a moderate growth, the stock is recommended for short-term investment.Coverage was initiated with ""Lockheed Martin: A Steady Take-Off"""
2839266,74695,2015-01-22T01:38:44-05:00,"Lockheed Martin is one of the world's largest defense contractors, and plays an integral role for the U.S. military.Unprecedented geopolitical risks will ensure Lockheed Martin's success for years to come.The increasingly technologically sophisticated nature of warfare will lead to high-tech defense contractors, such as Lockheed Martin, taking a larger role in global security.Lockheed Martin's international diversification is a wise move in light of escalating global conflicts.","Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is the leading defense contractor in the United States, and one of the largest in the world. While the company has a diverse range of businesses including aerospace, information technologies, and emerging technologies, the vast majority(approximately 90%) of its revenues come from the defense industry. Lockheed Martin epitomizes the technological superiority of the United States' military machine, with the company constantly supplying the U.S. armed forces with more and more powerful and technologically advanced equipment and weaponry. With national security threats becoming increasingly more sophisticated, Lockheed Martin is doing a great job of keeping the U.S. military one step ahead.While the recent government defense spending cuts will certainly hurt the company in the short run, there are several factors that will keep Lockheed Martin's momentum strong. At present, the U.S. is in a particularly precarious situation due to uniquely dangerous geopolitical risks. While these risks are certainly a negative for the welfare of the country, Lockheed Martin should be able to profit greatly from this, especially in an era where advanced warfare capabilities are more important than ever.Unprecedented Geopolitical RisksThe Pentagon's recent defense spending cuts have seemed hugely counterintuitive in a period where national security threats are especially pressing. These cuts could largely be attributed to the war fatigue caused by more than a decade of military involvement in the Middle East, and could very well be reversed due to increasing awareness of external threats. The investors largely seem to agree on this sentiment, as the stock has been continually rising over the past year.One of the largest potential threats to U.S. security, or more accurately U.S. sovereignty, is the expanding economic and military influence of China. While actual military conflict between the U.S. and China is extremely unlikely due to the fact that both countries are rational actors, their ideological differences cannot be overlooked. Because of the inherent ideological differences in democratic and authoritarian governments, the U.S. still needs to possess great military might for the sake of hard power influence.For the first time in centuries, the United States is facing a country with the potential to truly surpass the U.S. in terms of economics and military power. While the Soviet Union appeared to be equals to the U.S. during the Cold War, it was still very much lagging behind the U.S. in almost every aspect. China, on the other hand, represents a true threat to the U.S. in every sense of the word, if not just due to the country's size alone. With a GDP per capita of only a fraction compared to that of United States', China and the U.S. still have equivalent total GDPs. On top of this, China's militaristic growth appears to be ramping up, which represents a massive threat to the United States' global interests.If the U.S. wants to keep its militaristic edge, it will have to keep funding companies such as Lockheed Martin to develop the most cutting-edge technology. Funding for privatized defense companies will almost certainly speed up once the U.S. government comes to grips with how much of a threat China truly is. China has arguably already surpassing the U.S. on the cyberspace front, and it would not be surprising to see the same thing happen on the military front given its current pace of military spending. The one absolute advantage that the U.S. holds over China is its technological superiority, which is exactly what privatized companies like Lockheed Martin help to maintain.Reports that Chinese spies have stolen Lockheed Martin's F-35 stealth fighter designs have leaked from Snowden. This may be a catalyst for the U.S. government to increase security and defense spending. With U.S. technology blueprints in China's hands, the U.S. will have to work even harder to keep its technological edge. The F-35 is in fact one of the most advanced U.S. stealth fighter jets, with the Pentagon even recently awarding Lockheed Martin with a $4.7B contract for a few dozen F-35s.Source: Lockheed MartinThe organised rise of Wahhabist terrorism has represented a whole new threat to U.S. national security. While Wahhabist terrorism has always been a problem, this specific form of terrorism has become unprecedented in scale with the almost inexplicable rise of ISIL (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant). Wahhabist terrorism, with ISIL in particular, represents perhaps the most urgent geopolitical threat to not only the U.S., but global civilization.Because the U.S. has been forced into launching airstrikes and using other forms of long-range warfare (due to the government's insistence of having no boots on the ground), the government will almost certainly have to look increasingly towards Lockheed Martin in order to continue its assault on ISIL, and other terrorist groups/regimes. In a period of time where the U.S. public is suffering from a major case of war fatigue, defense contractors that focus on high-tech weaponry, such as long-range missiles, drones, lasers, high-altitude fighter jets, etc., will be key to fighting the war on terrorism.The U.S., for instance, has already bombarded ISIL with thousands upon thousands of airstrikes, which has subsequently led to Lockheed Martin's soaring missile sales. With each missile costing in the range of hundreds of thousands to even millions of dollars, Lockheed Martin is benefiting tremendously from the United States' long-range campaign against ISIL. The demand for such high-tech weaponry will likely continue to soar into the future, as organized global terrorism is becoming more entrenched, and more powerful than ever before. The Iraqi government has even decided to do business with Lockheed Martin, by purchasing several thousand hellfire missiles from the company. This showcases the growing demand not just in the U.S., but around the world, for high-tech weaponry in the fight against global terrorism.The Future of WarfareSociety is becoming increasingly technologically advanced, and the military is no exception. While wars have historically been fought mainly with the use of physical manpower, warfare has gotten to the point where technology plays the predominant role. With the exponential nature of technological advancement, Lockheed Martin will be more important than ever.Over the past decades, we have seen increasingly absurd amounts of money (even in the trillions range) being poured into defense contractors to develop the most sophisticated warfare technologies. Just recently, Lockheed Martin received two new production contracts for Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM), which will be especially useful in the fight against ISIL. With the progression of technology, warfare will become an increasingly nonpersonal affair, with high-tech defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin playing larger and larger roles.ExpansionWhile Lockheed Martin's business is primarily focused on the U.S. market, with 81.25% of its revenue based in the U.S., the company is looking at the international markets to expand its business. Lockheed Martin already has business in global markets such as the Middle East, and the Asias. With conflicts looking to boil over in many parts of the world, Lockheed Martin's decision to diversify its business is a smart move.With rising tensions on the issues of sovereignty in East Asia, for instance, Lockheed Martin may be able to benefit tremendously in markets such as Japan, where the country is currently locked in a mounting dispute with China over the Senkaku (or Diaoyu) islands. The rise of China is not only threatening the U.S., but also many of U.S. allies in the Pacific. Israel, which has become involved in escalating conflicts, represents another hugely profitable market for the company. With security risks at an all-time high not just in the U.S., but also across the entire globe, Lockheed Martin's expansion ambitions are well-founded.RisksAs unseemly as it sounds, the biggest risk to Lockheed Martin's business is the cooling down of global conflict. If China were to suddenly cut military spending/aggression, Wahhabist terrorism were to be extinguished, issues in the South China Sea were to be resolved, etc., Lockheed Martin would undoubtedly lose business in major markets. Ultimately though, these scenarios are highly unlikely, as such global conflicts seem to be getting more in scale and scope.Financials and ConclusionLockheed Martin reported sales of $11.1B, and net earnings from continuing operations of $888M in quarter 3. At a market capitalization of $61.5B, Lockheed Martin has a firm grip as the United States' leading defense contractor. With the company trading at a P/E ratio (TTM) of 19.7, the company still has upside given its extraordinarily high competitive moat. The company is, after all, in an extremely technologically advanced industry with close government ties. In addition, many analysts and investors seem to be underestimating the severity of rising global threats, which seem to be compounding by the day.Lockheed Martin is uniquely positioned to supply the U.S., and the world to a smaller extend, with the most technologically advanced weaponry and equipment. With national security threats and global conflicts on the rise, the company appears to have great potential for upside. Lockheed Martin is especially well-situated to help defend the U.S. and its allies in a perilous and technologically advanced 21st century."

Diluted earnings per share are expected in the range of $10.80-$11.10.","Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) recently announced its fourth quarter and full year earnings for 2014. Following the earnings announcement, the company's stocks declined by nearly 2.6% as the guidance for the current year came in below analyst expectations. While 2015 may be a slow year for the company due to a number of factors, the company is confident that it is progressing in the right direction.Fourth quarter earnings reviewLockheed Martin reported quarterly revenues of $12.5 billion, up by 8.6% from revenues of $11.5 billion reported in the year ago quarter. 4 out of 5 of the company's segments reported growth in revenues during the fourth quarter. The company's Aeronautics segments saw its revenues increase by 6% during the quarter. Missiles and Fire Control reported increases in revenue of 16.8% in the fourth quarter, while the Mission Systems and Training and Space Systems segments saw their revenues increase by 11.5% and 18.8% respectively.Operating profits from the segments noted a decline of 1.1% relative to last year and were reported at $1.4 billion. The Aeronautics segment was the only division that recorded a notable rise in operating profits, recording a 6.5% increase. Profits from Mission Systems and Training and Space Systems remained flat during the quarter. Operating profits from Information Systems and Global solutions declined by 7.4% during the quarter, while those from Missiles and Fire Control slipped by 8.6% compared to the year ago quarter.Overall, the increase in revenues trickled down to the lower levels of the financial tiers, where the company saw its operating profit grow from $834 million in the corresponding period last year to $1.3 billion in the recently concluded quarter. Simultaneously, operating margins expanded from 7.23% in Q4 2013 to 10.7% in Q4 2014. The company reported net earnings of $904 million, which grew by 85% compared to last year. On a per share basis, earnings amounted to $2.82 per share, growing by 88% from the earnings of $1.50 reported last year. Cash from operations was a negative $201 million in the fourth quarter.Full year earnings reviewNet sales for Lockheed Martin remained flat in 2014 and were reported at $45.6 billion at the end of the year. Consolidated operating profits grew during the year. A segment wise analysis of companies showed that 3 out of 5 divisions saw their revenues decline during the year. Aeronautics reported a revenue increase of 5.6% during the year. Space Systems saw its revenues make some progress during the year as well as they were up by 1.3% during the year.Operating profits from business segments amounted to $5.59 billion, down by 2.85% compared to 2013. Aeronautics was the only segment that was able to increase its profitability during the year. Lockheed Martin reported its consolidated operating profit at $5.6 billion in 2014, up by 24% from the figure reported in 2013. Operating margins grew from 9.9% in 2013 to 12.2% in 2014. Net earnings grew during the year and were reported at $3.6 billion; up by 21% compared to the net earnings of $2.9 billion recorded a year earlier. Earnings per share were announced at $11.21, up by 22.8% year on year. Cash flow from operations during the year amounted to $3.9 billion.Lockheed Martin returned a total of $3.7 billion to shareholders during the year. The company purchased 11.5 million shares for $1.9 billion during the year, while paying out $1.8 billion in the form of dividends.Outlook for 2015Lockheed Martin provided its guidance for net sales during 2015. The company has projected net sales between $43.5-$45 billion during the current year. This is a rather damp outlook for the year, suggesting that investors might see revenues report little to no growth by the end of the year.The company's outlook for operating profit was even more disappointing. Business segment operating profit is expected at $5.1-$5.25 billion by the end of the year, while consolidated profit is forecasted at $5.3-$5.45 billion. This outlook guides investors to brace themselves for operating profits registering negative growth compared to 2014.Diluted earnings per share are expected in the range of $10.80-$11.10, which lies below the EPS of 2014. This estimate is lower than analyst expectations of $11.49 earnings per share during the year. The company has cited lower pension income as the reason for a dimmed outlook for earnings in the current year. Lockheed stated that income from pensions during the year have been revised downward from $650 million to $475 million due to the low discount rate.AnalysisAeronautics was perhaps the only segment that reported notable progress during the quarter and the full year. The F-35 fighter jet manufacturer noted that contracts for the production of these jets amounted to $260 million during the quarter. The F-35 program is one that will continue to bring benefits for Lockheed Martin in the form of higher sales, especially since the program is not impacted by budget cuts in defense expenditures. However, Lockheed Martin is still on its way to report declines in its organic growth during the year, as the Pentagon is likely to trim defense spending in the future. The Pentagon is ready to present a $530 billion defense spending budget early next month. Though this budget is $30 billion above the sequestration level, the news of a 20% reduction in war spending has also floated in the industry. For Lockheed Martin this sounds more like a further reduction in revenues in the future, especially since the company obtains about 82% of its revenues from the US.Lockheed Martin seems well aware of these future cuts in revenues from the US and has now directed its focus to seeking revenue growth from international markets. Lockheed Martin has latched onto the prospects of higher spending from countries in the Middle East and the Asia Pacific, especially in the years to come. It seems as though the focus on fueling revenues from the international market could help the company offset declines in revenues from the US to some degree.While top line growth is a cause of concern, the management expects the company to return towards growth by 2016. Lockheed Martin has signaled that it is prepared to fund acquisitions, dividends and buybacks through acquisition of financing in the future as well. Bruce Tanner, CFO of Lockheed Martin has added that $750 million in revenue increments are expected from the recent deals that the company has signed. In one of the most recent deals, the Sikorsky unit of Lockheed Martin and United Technologies has been able to secure a $1.24 billion contract for the production of 6 out of 23 helicopters for US Marine Corps.ConclusionWhile 2015 may be challenging for the company, the years ahead could be better as it may be able to tackle the problem of growth by 2016. The company seems dedicated towards returning value to its shareholders, and has not drifted away from its focus of cost cutting and expanding top and bottom lines. To add to this, Lockheed Martin has a good track record of posting higher than expected earnings, and its earnings have continued their upward trajectory smoothly over the past few quarters. Moreover, the dividend yield of 3% is an excellent return for income seeking investors. The company and its stock may be prone to some challenges in the current year, but it will definitely be able to pull through. Analysts project stock prices at $203.50 in the next 12 months. Investors will benefit by going long on Lockheed Martin shares for a long-term investment horizon."

Therefore, the upside potential of the stock is limited.","Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is an outstanding company of the defense sector with a wide moat thanks to the barriers posed by the great expertise requirements in its field. The stock has greatly outperformed the S&P (NYSEARCA:SPY) in almost every time horizon one can test. In the last 5 years, it has outperformed the market by about 50% (141% vs. 87%), while in the last 12 months it has offered its shareholders more than double the performance of S&P (33% vs. 14%). The big question is whether it is still worth investing in the stock now that it is trading near its all-time high.First of all, there is no doubt that Lockheed Martin is an exceptional company. To be sure, it has tripled its earnings per share (EPS) in the last 9 years and has managed to grow its EPS almost every year, even in the recent years, in which the budget of the Department of Defense has shrunk due to concerns over the national deficit. Therefore, it is a company that has proved the strength of its business even during rough times.On the other hand, it is important to note that its revenue has stumbled in the last 5 years at around $45 B and is expected to fall at $44 B in 2015, which is below the level of 2009. As there is increased concern of the US government over the budget deficit and the defense expenditures will remain strictly constrained for the next few years, it is only natural that the company is expected to report lower revenue in the next few years. Although the company has exhibited great resistance during periods of limited budget of the Department of Defense, those constraints should limit its growth rate in the next few years. To be sure, while the company almost tripled its EPS from 2004 to 2008, it has only grown its EPS by an average 3% per year since then.Another critical factor to consider is the fact that the P/E ratio of the stock has greatly expanded in the last 2 years. To be sure, the stock was trading at remarkably low P/E ratios, between 9 and 11, from 2008 to 2012, but its valuation has become increasingly rich in the last 2 years, currently standing at a decade-high P/E=19. While the shareholders have greatly benefited from this expansion of the P/E ratio, there is very limited potential for further expansion, as a P/E=19 is already too high for a company that has grown at an annual 3% rate in the last 5 years and is expected to grow at the same rate next year. Therefore, the performance of the stock will at best merely track the EPS growth from now on, while it also carries the risk that the P/E ratio has more downside than upside risk from its current level.Finally, it is remarkable that the management has been excessively rewarding itself via share repurchases in the last 12 months. More specifically, as per the latest earnings release, the company has spent $1.7 B on share repurchases in the last 12 months. Based on the average stock price during that period, this amount corresponds to 3.5% of the outstanding shares of the company. However, as the report reveals, the number of outstanding shares decreased by only 1% during that period, which means that about 2/3rds of the amount spent on share repurchases was simply returned to the management via stock options. The shareholders should not be content that the management rewarded itself with about 1/3 of the total earnings of the company.To sum up, there is no doubt that Lockheed Martin is a well-run company, with an exceptional past record and a wide moat that protects its results. Nevertheless, investors should never forget that the entry point is critical to the success of every investment, otherwise everyone would become rich by purchasing Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) shares. As the valuation (P/E) of the stock is at a decade-high, it is important to realize that there is limited upside potential for the stock. Of course the market may assign an even greater premium to the company but it is not a recipe for success to pay 19 times the EPS for a company that has grown its EPS by 3% per year in the last 5 years. Therefore, I recommend waiting for a better entry point, in the area of $170."

        LMT is a great company but it is overvalued.
        I am bailing from the DRiP and will have to decide if I want to keep LMT at all.","When companies I own change the rules, I don't like it. It's my Dividend Growth portfolio and my money, so I play by my rules or I find new ""friends"" to play with.On Friday, I received a letter from Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) explaining that its direct reinvestment plan will be no-fee no more: ""Participants will be required to bear the cost of their use of certain features in the program.""Effective Jan. 1:None of those charges currently exist.Twice per month, at my request, Lockheed Martin (through its agent, Computershare) has been debiting my checking account and buying shares of common stock for my account. Since the first of this year, I have made 21 purchases through direct automatic investment, buying a total of 21.36 shares. Under the new terms, those purchases would have cost me nearly $54. I also have received $63 in dividends that have been reinvested to buy a fraction of a share. Fees for that under the new terms would be about $3.Bottom line: What has cost me zero dollars in 2014 would run me $57 in 2015 for the exact same service. That is no bargain, so I'm getting out.This Way To ExitI have contacted Computershare and turned off both the automatic purchases of new shares and the dividend reinvestment option for existing shares. I also have instructed my broker, Vanguard, to initiate the transfer of my 28-share LMT stake into my taxable brokerage account.If I then want to resume dividend reinvestment, my broker will do so at no charge. If I want more LMT, I no longer will buy it just a share or two at a time. And if I want to sell any or all of my shares, I will pay Vanguard's very low commission instead of Lockheed Martin's pricey DRiP fees.When I started investing in Lockheed Martin via DRiP in the fall of 2013, I intended to participate for at least three years. I wanted to dollar-cost-average my way to a position that would generate about $600 in annual dividends. Soon, after Vanguard receives my shares, I will have to decide if I want to pursue a similar goal, if I want to just hold onto what I have (but not buy more), or if I want to sell the position and use the cash for something else.Great Company, Yes; Great Value, NoLockheed Martin describes itself as a ""global security and aerospace company."" Because the world is in a perpetual state of war, LMT always has a ready, willing and able client base. The majority of its business is with the U.S. Department of Defense -- enough said; we love to blow stuff up.Obviously, Lockheed Martin has a wonderfully sustainable moat. In the finale of my series on the New Nifty Fifty, I named LMT one of my Top 10. Value Line gives the company its highest ratings for both Safety (1) and Financial Strength (A++). LMT has been growing its dividend like crazy, which has kept its yield over 3%.One thing LMT isn't right now, however, is cheap. It closed Friday at $186.60, a 30% premium over Morningstar's Fair Value Estimate of $144. It is trading at 19 times earnings, which is about a point higher than the industry average and nearly 8 points higher than its five-year average. Value Line assigns LMT a 3-5 year value range of $165-$200.My inclination is to hold onto the shares I own (at a cost basis of about $155) but to wait for better opportunities to top off my stake. If LMT takes a long time to revert to its mean, it simply will end up being one of my smaller positions. If it continues to soar, as if strapped to one of its rockets, I will consider taking profits and investing in an undervalued company.ConclusionWhen Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.A) announced earlier this year that it was canceling its popular Scrips Dividend Programme, I responded by dumping my shares. Coincidentally or not, it turned out to be a fine move; Shell's price has fallen some 17% since I sold, and the subsequent investments I made with those funds have grown.Lockheed Martin is a great company, but it's hardly the only one out there. And, should I desire to do the DRiP thing again, there are many plans far superior to what LMT's plan will become after we all sing Auld Lang Syne.I am a Dividend Growth investor who reinvests the income I receive. As soon as companies make it onerous for me to do that, it's time for me to change my plans, too."
2636725,44001,2014-11-04T12:25:44-05:00,The stock appears to be fairly valued based on 2015 earnings estimates but has little earnings growth potential.The dividend is solid at 3.15% but doesn't have much room to grow right now.I'm going to take a pass on this name and continue to search for a better name in the industry.,"Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE:LMT) is a security and aerospace company engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, and sustainment of advanced technology systems and products. On October 21, 2014, the company reported third quarter earnings of $2.76 per share, which beat the consensus of analysts' estimates by $0.05. In the past year, the company's stock is up 40.78% excluding dividends (up 44.09% including dividends) and is beating the S&P 500, which has gained 13.4% in the same time frame. I am taking my IRA back from my financial advisor who has managed to not make as much money as the market has and I've decided that I want to look at Lockheed as a potential investment. With all this in mind, I'd like to take a moment to evaluate the stock to see if right now is a good time to purchase shares for the industrial sector of my IRA portfolio.FundamentalsThe company currently trades at a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 19.29, which is fairly priced, but I mainly like to purchase a stock based on where the company is going in the future as opposed to what it has done in the past. On that note, the 1-year forward-looking P/E ratio of 16.62 is currently fairly priced for the future in terms of the right here, right now. The 1-year PEG ratio (7.44), which measures the ratio of the price you're currently paying for the trailing 12-month earnings on the stock while dividing it by the earnings growth of the company for a specified amount of time (I like looking at a 1-year horizon), tells me that the company is expensively priced based on a 1-year EPS growth rate of 2.59%.FinancialsOn a financial basis, the things I look for are the dividend payouts, return on assets, equity and investment. The company pays a dividend of 3.15% with a payout ratio of 61% of trailing 12-month earnings while sporting return on assets, equity and investment values of 8.7%, 68.7% and 29.8%, respectively, which are all respectable values.The really high return on equity value (68.7%) is an important financial metric for purposes of comparing the profitability, which is generated with the money shareholders have invested in the company to that of other companies in the same industry [for comparison purposes, Lockheed has the second highest ROE of all companies in the aerospace/defense products & services industry, behind Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation (SWHC), which sports an ROE of 69.7%, and ahead of Sturm, Ruger & Co. Inc. (NYSE:RGR), which sports an ROE of 53.1%].The really high return on investment value (29.8%) is an important financial metric because it evaluates the efficiency of an investment that a company makes and if an investment doesn't have a positive ROI then the investment should not be made [for comparison purposes, Lockheed has the third highest ROI of all companies in the aerospace/defense products & services industry, behind Ruger, which sports an ROI of 61.9%, and Smith & Wesson, which sports an ROI of 38.5%].Because I believe the market may get a bit choppy here and would like a safety play, I believe the 3.15% yield of this company is good enough for me to take shelter in for the time being.TechnicalsLooking first at the relative strength index chart [RSI] at the top, I see the stock in overbought territory with a current value of 72.9. I will look at the moving average convergence-divergence [MACD] chart next. I see that the black line is above the red line with the divergence bars decreasing in height which tells me bearish momentum is starting in the name. As for the stock price itself ($191.19), I'm looking at $199.57 to act as resistance and $182.92 to act as support for a risk/reward ratio which plays out to be -4.33% to 4.38%.ConclusionThere is absolutely no doubt that this company operates very well as evidenced through its financial efficiency ratios. Fundamentally I believe the company to be fairly valued on next year's earnings estimates and expensive on earnings growth potential. Financially, the dividend is large and doesn't have a lot of room to grow. On a technical basis the risk/reward ratio shows me there is more reward than risk right now. The fact that growth is going to be relatively slow for the company makes me want to look at other aerospace defense names instead. I like the solid dividend, but want a little bit more growth for the IRA and if I can find something that is valued a little better that would be icing on the cake.Disclaimer: This article is in no way a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned. This article is meant to serve as a journal for myself as to the rationale of why I bought/sold this stock when I look back on it in the future.

2647155,75405,2014-11-06T01:43:49-05:00,"Third quarter results for 2014 indicated that Lockheed Martin’s net sales had declined relative to last year’s results.
        Lockheed Martin believes that the decline in revenues is due to fewer contracts being received by the US government. It also anticipates fewer contracts in the next year.
        In order to restore investor confidence, the company has planned share buy backs of $1 billion annually for the next three years.
        It has recently signed a $4 billion deal with Pentagon for supplying another batch of F-35 fighter jets, along with a deal with a missile manufacturing company in Turkey.
        The shares offer a yield of 3.31%, which is the highest in the industry. Shares currently trade at 18.34 times its earnings.","Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) third quarter results for 2014 came as a huge blow to investor confidence as the company reported declines in its top line growth relative to last year's results. In order to pacify worried investors, the company has taken drastic steps to encourage investors to hold on to their investment by returning value to them through dividends and share repurchases. The company hopes to turn its misfortunes around by focusing on other market segments that could show better opportunities to improve top line growth in the future.Net sales for Lockheed Martin were reported at $11.11 billion for the third quarter of this year. These levels are 2% lower than the sales of $11.35 billion that were recorded in the third quarter of the preceding year. Operating profits were improved for the company and amounted to $1.4 billion; 11% higher than the profit of $1.25 billion that was reported a year earlier. Net earnings for the company also improved relative to the last year and amounted to $888 million, nearly 1.7% higher than net earnings of $873 million reported during Q3 2013. Earnings per share were also up by 7.4% to $.276 per share.Cash from operations increased by $90 million relative to last year's records and amounted to $990 million during the third quarter of 2014.Lockheed Martin has revised its guidance for the full year following the results that were reported during the third quarter. The company now expects $41.5-$43 billion in orders. Net sales for the year are estimated at $45 billion. Business segment operating profit has been estimated at $5.5 billion and earnings per share estimates have been revised to $11.15 per share.The decline in the revenues reported by Lockheed Martin during the quarter sent off more than a few alarm bells as it signified the slowing down of military and DoD orders that the company receives. Military and DoD spending has been cut as a result of the Budget Control Act 2011 that limits spending by these defense agencies.Lockheed Martin seems to be extremely unfortunate in this scenario since it is known to generate about 80% of its revenues from US government contracts, out of which 60% belong to the DoD. After analyzing the company's downward revision of net sales, which were previously expected at $45.4 billion, it can be said that Lockheed Martin expects that further declines in top line growth are yet to come as military spending has not really dropped as low as it possibly can.In order to pacify worried investors, Lockheed Martin has announced a few important measures in order to return value to those who have invested in the company. One of these measures includes the returning value to shareholders through share repurchases. The company has said that it will spend $1 billion annually for the next three years for this purpose. It expects to buy back shares worth $2 billion in 2015 alone, while continuing to pay out sector leading dividends to its shareholders.Damaged shareholder confidence could be restored with some of the latest developments that have taken place with respect to Lockheed Martin and its future streams of revenues. The company has recently agreed to a $4 billion deal with the DoD to begin working on supplying its eighth batch of F-35 Fighter Jets.Lockheed Martin and Roketsan, a Turkish missile manufacturer, have also signed an agreement to produce and sell SOM-J air launched cruise missiles for Lockheed Martin's F-35 Lightening II combat jets. This deal is one that could possibly boost orders for Lockheed Martin's jets in the future, leading to improvements in the company's top line growth as well.An analysis of Lockheed Martin's shares indicates that share prices have been trending upwards for the past five years. In the past 52 weeks, share prices at their lowest were recorded at $131.90, whereas they have been at their highest at $184.09 during the same period. The shares offer a yield of 3.31%, which is the highest in the industry. Shares currently trade at 18.34 times its earnings.Although disappointing in terms of revenue declines, Lockheed Martin's efforts at holding investor confidence up is commendable. They have managed to lessen, if not completely restore, the impact of the worry that arose due to declines in revenues, by returning exceptional value to shareholders with high dividend yields. If that is not enough, the announcement of expanding their share repurchase program comes as better news to investors as it is an indication that EPS in the future is likely to be better and higher. In the capital markets, share prices constantly trend upwards, with only a few dips. Apart from that, no major share price erosion is expected in the future, as market sentiments remain bullish due to Lockheed Martin's attempts to turn itself around by focusing on sales from other markets to hedge the declines from receiving fewer US government contracts.For now, despite the fact that revenues could decline in the future, as the US Military could decrease future spending further, investors would still benefit from holding Lockheed Martin shares due to the high dividends, expected share repurchases, upward trending share prices and possibility of better future contracts from other markets."
2672945,58481,2014-11-13T06:44:00-05:00,"Building a core investment portfolio is key to any investment strategy.Lockheed Martin has operated successfully in a variety of core businesses with high barriers to entry, and has consistently returned value to shareholders, making it an ideal core holding.Historical performance, innovation, high barriers to entry, returning value to shareholders and being a best-of-breed are all essential for qualifying as a core holding.","Every investor should have a solid core portfolio that can be relied on for solid and steady gains without wild fluctuations. Investors shouldn't have to monitor these equities on a daily or even weekly basis. Instead, a core portfolio should consist of stocks with healthy core businesses that are self-sustaining and can be trusted to produce even 10-20 years from now. A core portfolio can consist of anywhere from a couple to 15-20 investments, but should be kept simple enough to avoid becoming burdensome. I believe a quality core investment should consist of 5 key elements.First it should have strong historical performance, where management has shown they are capable of growing and expanding their business with predictability and consistency, and follow an ""under-promise, over-deliver"" motto.Second, the company should be able to innovate and evolve its core business or be able to expand to new markets if its core business begins to see a pattern of declining sales. Think Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), not IBM Corp. (NYSE:IBM).Third, it should have a wide-business moat that prevents start-ups or new competitors from rapidly taking market share. By having high barriers to entry or industries that depend on their particular service or product, it gives a company great vision on what future revenue will be, and also gives the company time to mitigate threats or evolve before the competition catches up.Fourth, it should return value to shareholders through dividends or rapid capital appreciation. It's always favorable to have core investments pay dividends so investors can compound their earnings over a long time frame, but a stock without a dividend can be considered if capital appreciation is strong enough and offers the potential for dividends down the road.Lastly, the company should be a best-of-breed. If the company meets the previous four elements, it's already likely to be considered a best-of-breed. Best-of-breed means the company has gained the market acceptance that it is the leading company in the industry, because it offers a superior product or service and has the track record to prove it. A best-of-breed company is also likely to have staying power, which is essential for a core investment.Over a ten-part series, I'll cover 10 companies I feel make excellent additions to any core investment portfolio. I'll avoid the obvious candidates (i.e. Apple, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG)), and instead focus on off-the-beaten-path companies that aren't as highly covered on Seeking Alpha, but are just as good, if not better, choices for a core investment portfolio.Core Investment Portfolio Pick #1: Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT)Lockheed Martin meets all 5 criteria with flying colors, and can be considered a quintessential core investment. The company is best known for its military defense contracts, but has sales across 5 business segments: aeronautics, information systems, missile and fire control, mission systems and space systems. The company expects sales to reach $45 billion in 2014, EPS around $11.15 and cash flow from operations approximately $3.8 billion. Lockheed is a large-cap company with a market cap nearly $60 billion and moderate valuations. The stock has a trailing P/E of 19 and a forward P/E of 16.4 (both in line with the S&P 500). The company also has a decent balance sheet with $3 billion in cash and roughly $6 billion in long-term debt. With healthy profit and operating margins, roughly 7% and 12 % respectively, the company has the flexibility to return value to shareholders while managing its moderate debt level.Historical PerformanceLMT data by YChartsOver the past 10 years, Lockheed Martin has outperformed the S&P 500 by over 100%. With a combination of capital appreciation and high dividend yield, the stock has the historical performance investors need to look for when identifying a core investment. In addition, the company has beaten earnings estimates in 15 consecutive quarters. This remarkable feat falls in line with the ""under-promise, over-deliver"" motto, which seems to be key in effective management and, most importantly, Wall Street respecting and having confidence in the company.Innovate and EvolveThis is where Lockheed Martin blows away the competition and is legendary in the industry. An entire book has been written on Lockheed's famous R&D arm, Skunk Works. Skunk Works is an official alias for Lockheed Martin's Advanced Development Programs, developed back in 1943 to create breakthrough technologies and landmark aircraft that continually redefine flight. The program, which is responsible for breakthrough aircraft designs, such as the SR-71, U-2, stealth fighter, F-22 and F-35, still operates under its founder, Kelly Johnson's mantra, ""quick, quiet, and quality"". The latest aircraft design, the F-35, has seen extremely strong domestic and international demand. In the last 2 months alone, the company has taken orders from South Korea, the US and Israel, for a total of 108 F-35s valued at roughly $15 billion. Most recently, Skunk Works has announced breakthroughs in 2 completely new industries: water filtration and nuclear fusion.Back in July, I wrote an article profiling Lockheed Martin's newest innovation, Perforene filtration. This filtration system utilizes nanotechnology by placing holes that are one nanometer or less in a graphene membrane. The holes are small enough to trap the ions, while dramatically improving the flow-through of water molecules, reducing clogging and pressure on the membrane. Lockheed engineers estimate that the energy needed by this filter in desalination would be 100 times less than current methods. The Perforene filter would be the thickness of a piece of paper, compared to current filters which are about half a foot thick. With cities across the southwest United States and the world looking for new sources of drinking water, this new filter technology patented by Lockheed has the potential to revolutionize the water filtration industry. The company hasn't produced a prototype yet, but is currently looking for partners to help manufacture the filter in 2015.Most recently, Lockheed's Skunk Works announced a breakthrough in compact nuclear fusion. The company states that within as little as ten years, the company could be producing compact nuclear fusion reactors, which combines several alternative magnetic confinement approaches that would result in a 90% size reduction. Initial work has demonstrated the feasibility of building a 100MW reactor measuring just 7 ft. by 10 ft. If Lockheed can indeed deliver on this claim and concept, it would effectively change the entire landscape of the trillion-plus dollar energy market.While these 2 breakthrough technologies haven't moved past the concept stage and into commercial production, it demonstrates the intense research and development talent that Lockheed Martin has at its finger tips. Both energy-efficient desalination filters and compact nuclear fusion devices have raised more questions than answers, but if either one becomes commercially viable, it opens up a new multi-billion dollar industry for the company. A company that can innovate and evolve on this level is one that investors should have as a core holding.Barriers to entryLockheed Martin is involved in industries that have the highest barriers to entry in the entire market. Building military-grade fighter jets, missile defense systems, satellites and space exploration ships aren't something you can start in a garage or with a bank loan. These industries that Lockheed dominates require thousands of experts, billions of dollars in research, and impeccable track records that governments and large businesses have confidence in supporting. Elon Musk's SpaceX may be an up-and-coming company in space exploration, but it is nowhere near the level of Lockheed. Lockheed's Orion project in conjunction with NASA demonstrates the company's expertise in a field where there may not be higher barriers to entry. Lockheed is building Orion, a multi-purpose crew vehicle, which will be NASA's first spacecraft designed for long-duration, human-rated deep space exploration. Orion will transport humans to interplanetary destinations beyond low Earth orbit, such as asteroids, the moon and eventually Mars, and return them safely back to Earth. Lockheed has also been involved in every NASA mission to Mars. Trying to find another company which dominates multiple industries with such high barriers to entry is difficult.Return value to shareholdersLockheed has been paying dividends since 2000, and has become a favorite among dividend growth investors. Fellow Seeking Alpha contributor Mike Nadel published a popular series of articles last month called, ""The New Nifty Fifty"", where he asked 10 Seeking Alpha contributors and commentators to submit their top 50 dividend growth stocks. 7 out of the 10 contributors listed Lockheed Martin as a favorite pick. There were only 9 other stocks that had a higher favorability rating.LMT Dividend data by YChartsThe stock currently pays a 3.2% dividend yield, which is even more impressive when you consider it has appreciated 36% over the past 12 months. Over the past 14 years, the dividend has a 20% CAGR. The company recently increased its quarterly dividend to $1.50 per share, or $6.00 per share annually. This marked the 12th consecutive year where the dividend rate has been increased by double digits. In addition, the board of directors recently approved an additional $2 billion in share repurchasing authority, which brings the total to $4 billion. Through the first 9 months of the year, the company has paid $1.3 billion through dividends and $1.7 billion in share repurchases. This $3 billion represents 82% of free cash flow being returned to shareholders through the first 9 months of 2014. Again, Lockheed comes through with flying colors when it comes to returning value to shareholders.Best-of-breedLockheed Martin has some strong competitors in military defense contracts, such as Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) and Raytheon (RTN), but I believe Lockheed is truly the best-of-breed. Its F-35 is the new gold standard for fighter jets, its space exploration programs is taking on some of the most exciting challenges of the decade, and most importantly, it has a world-renowned R&D program that continues to innovate. Governments from around the world are trusting Lockheed with military defense contracts, and the United States government uses Lockheed for everything from satellites to radar devices. The company's culture of innovation will keep Lockheed at the forefront of the industry and continue to set the standard in military defense.RisksA core portfolio investment analysis wouldn't be complete without an accurate assessment of potential risks. Lockheed has seen a 2% decline in net sales through the first 9 months of 2014, and the company expects 2015 net sales to decline at by low-single digits from 2014. Declining revenues are always a concern, but I believe Lockheed will reverse this trend in 2016, as new multi-billion dollar orders of F-35 are scheduled to be delivered. The majority of Lockheed's revenue also comes from the US and international governments. Anyone who turns on the news knows all too well how inept the US government has become, and renewed pressure to rein in government expenditures has become increasingly important. However, Republicans taking back control of the Senate and growing international terror concerns have given renewed strength to Lockheed Martin's stock. Overall, the biggest concern for Lockheed is its large exposure to government contracts. Investors shouldn't concern themselves with short-term risks when looking to add core investments to their portfolio, and should instead focus on long-term risks and trends. Looking at historical trends and increasing global tensions, I believe the current stagnant revenue growth and exposure to government contracts aren't large enough risks to hurt Lockheed over the next 20 years.Lockheed also gives investors a potential hedge against downturns caused from wars and global tensions, because the company is heavily weighted to military defense spending. No one should hope for or make an investment based on future wars, but having a core holding that will hold up during that kind of potential crisis is nice to have.ConclusionLockheed Martin meets all 5 of my criteria for a core investment holding, and is a stock that I believe often gets overlooked as a potential cornerstone in an investment portfolio. Lockheed has a strong track record of delivering results through its core business, as well as innovating to keep itself ahead of competitors. In addition, the stock pays a healthy 3.2% dividend yield, which it has increased by double-digits for 12 consecutive years, making it a tremendous dividend growth investment. Lockheed makes a great addition that can be counted on for the next 20+ years.When looking at a stock to add to your core investment portfolio for the next 20 years, the entry price becomes less relevant, but shouldn't be ignored. I've been waiting for a pullback on Lockheed for the past several months, with no success. The stock has steadily risen for the past 18 months with no major pullback. The advantage of long-term investing is you have the ability to be patient and wait for a pullback, if you believe a stock is due for one. Buying Lockheed Martin right now with the intention to hold it for the next 10-20 years makes perfect sense, but I prefer to be patient and wait for the right opportunity, whether it be another recession, a missed earnings report or general market weakness. I'm waiting for the stock to fall back under $175 before I buy and add on any further declines."

While profits for the company increased, revenues for most of its segments experienced declines.In order to capitalize on the high volume demand for F35 jets, the company continues to develop the project further.The company is already involved in a contract with the US Military and DoD to supply jets to the agencies. Another contract seems to be underway as well.The company also signed a new contract with South Korea recently, to supply them with 40 F35 planes.Share prices have remained bullish in the market over the past six months and the trend should continue as the company continues to invest in long term growth prospects.","Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) announced its financial results for the second quarter and half year of 2014. Revenues for the second quarter registered a 1% decline over the second quarter of 2013 and were reported at $11.3 billion. On the other hand, the net earnings of the company were able to grow by 3% from the previous year and amounted to $889 million. Earnings per share registered a 5% increase and were announced at $2.76. Cash from operations also increased, and amounted to $977 million, about 57% higher than the prior year's cash flow.The earnings release has raised quite a few eyebrows as it indicates that the company is facing difficulties in keeping up its top line growth. The profitability of Lockheed Martin has increased as a result of its cost cutting and streamlining initiatives that it has been pursuing over the past few months.Analysis of the company's segment-wise financial position gives a better insight of which segments seem to be performing better that others. The Aeronautics segment revenues have registered an increase of 13%, reporting revenues at $3.9 billion. Other segments, such as Information Systems & Global Solutions, Missiles and Fire Control, Mission Systems and Training and Space Systems all reported declines in their revenues.This trend trickled down to operating profits from the segment as well, where Aeronautics was the only segment that was able to register an increase in its profits, while operating profits decreased in all other segments of the business. Operating profit for the Aeronautic segment was reported at $453 million, and has increased by 11.3% over the profit of the second quarter of 2013.The Aeronautics segment registered a 0.1% decline in its operating margins, which were calculated at 11.8% for the quarter. Information Systems and Global Solutions margins declined by 0.2% and were reported at 9%. Missiles and Fire Control margins declined by 0.4% and were reported at 18.2%. Mission Systems and Training margins decelerated rapidly by 5% and were reported at 10.4%. Space System margins increased by 0.2%, and came in at 13.4%.One of the reasons for the lackluster performance of the company during the quarter was because military spending remained depressed, due to the Budget Controls Act of 2011. Cuts in spending were proposed on the basis of this act. Given that the company generates 80% of revenues from government contracts, and 60% from the DoD contracts, this sudden cut led to a contraction in the top line of the company, of about 2%.The company also provided its financial outlook for 2014 and expects net sales to come in at around $44 billion. The company has raised its operating profit guidance and expects the profit to be recorded between ranges of $5.475-$5.625 billion. Diluted earnings per share are expected at $10.85-$11.15.Focus on AeronauticsAfter analysis of the financial results, it would not be wrong to say that most of the profit contribution for the company came from its Aeronautics segment, where F35 volumes rapidly increased, and also because the company was able to reduce pension expenses. This trend of increases in volumes of F35 is expected to carry forward into the next few quarters, and Lockheed Martin is making careful efforts to capitalize on this trend and improve top lines for the future.The F35 project roughly accounts for 17% of Lockheed Martin's revenues, which is a significant chunk. Given that the company will be able to cater to the rising demand of these aircrafts, it will be successful in turning around top line growth in future quarters.Among some of the developments in the F35 Joint Striker Fighter project, the company was involved in one of the DoD's most costly program, that has incurred about $1.5 trillion in spending by the Pentagon. The program has run into several difficulties, one of which includes overspending of the budget by nearly 300%. Despite the financial challenges and technical problems that the project seems to be encountering, Lockheed Martin is confident that it will be able to deliver the first set of F35 jets by early 2015.There is also the potential of another contract with the DoD for 43 more F35 jets, where the deal would be worth $4 billion. This deal is said to lower the cost of the jet's airframe by about 2-4%.Recently, the company was also awarded $331.4 million as part of a modification contract that will allow the company to procure tools, test equipment items and software upgrades that will allow it to develop the F35 Joint Striker Fighter project. This deal is expected to run through till December 2017.International DevelopmentsIn order to offset revenue declines from the US market, Lockheed Market has initiated steps to tap into the international market and bag some major contracts. Among these is the latest contract worth $7.1 billion with South Korea, where the country has agreed to purchase 40 F35 jets. This is the largest ever weapons purchase by the country and the delivery is expected to run between 2018 and 2025. Israel and Japan had signed contracts for purchases of these jets in 2010 and 2011 respectively.ConclusionThe mixed results reported in the second quarter raised some concerns among investors about whether the company could revive itself and turn revenue growth around. From the latest developments that have been taking place, investor confidence has received a boost as the steps being taken by the company have added to the long term growth prospects of the company. The decision to capitalize on F35 production is a wise step that will translate into higher revenues in the future as well. Top line improvements coupled with cost cutting indicate that Lockheed Martin is on its way to improve on its future results.The success in booking international contracts, and new contracts with the US military and DoD are a sign that not only growth, but share prices are also likely to remain bullish in the future. Stocks for Lockheed Martin have a 52 week low of $125.09 and a high of $184.09 in the markets. Currently, the share trades closer to its higher end. This does not make the stocks a good bargain for investors at the moment. However, should investors decide to invest and hold the share for a longer period, they could gain from increases in share prices since the target 1 year price for shares is set at $183.89.The general price trend for Lockheed Martin has been bullish over the past six months, with a few slip ups and the run is expected to continue into the future as well. Investors are likely to benefit in terms of price gains and dividends in the future, but the major setback at the moment is the current prices are not the best bargains."
2580305,22148,2014-10-21T16:10:45-04:00,Lockheed Martin reported mixed Q314 earnings.Investors should sell the stock with limited upside from these levels.The original investment thesis anticipated that the stock could start facing issues with lower capital returned to shareholders due to the higher stock prices.,"Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) reported that Q314 earnings beat analyst estimates when including money saved on pension plans. The defense firm continues to see revenue fall and now forecasts single digit declines in 2015. The mixed results sent the stock down in a very bullish day for the stock market with the S&P 500 index up close to 2%.Lockheed produced Q314 earnings of $2.76 versus estimates for EPS of $2.71. The top line actually dipped 2% and at $11.1 billion missed analyst estimates for $11.3 billion. The more concerning number was that business segment operating profits declined by 7.5% YoY to only $1.35 billion. The increase in net income and EPS was due to a more than $200 million swing in pension income between the periods. More importantly, the company reduced the share repurchases to only $421 million for this Q3, compared to $607 million last Q3. With the substantially higher stock prices this year, the actual shares bought this Q3 dropped nearly 50% over last year to only 2.6 million shares. The price paid increased to roughly $162 per share, up from $124 in Q313.The original investment thesis in the article ""Lockheed Martin Hikes Yields Again"" is further supported by the reduced capital returned to shareholders in Q314. Despite the increase in annual dividends and $2 billion added to the share repurchase program, the company bought substantially less stock this Q3. The higher stock prices over the last couple of years and a PE of roughly 15.5x current year earnings doesn't provide a lot of upside for the stock."

Revenues were $11.1 billion (-2.2% yoy), earnings per share were $2.76 (up 7.4% yoy). The company missed revenue estimates (by $180 million) and beat EPS estimates (by $0.05).Lockheed Martin updated FY 2014 guidance: Net sales guidance is $45 billion (up from $44 billion to $45 billion), operating profit guidance is $5.6 billion (up from $5.475 billion to $5.625 billion), earnings per share guidance is $11.15 (up from $10.85 to $11.15).In my original article I wrote about Lockheed Martin as an income investment. I assumed growing earnings per share and wrote about the company's EPS guidance of $10.85 to $11.15. With EPS growing 7.4% in the last quarter and the guidance rise I see my thesis about EPS growth potential confirmed.As the share price did not really change much since my original article was published, I remain with my original conclusion: Lockheed Martin offers good EPS growth and is an attractive investment for income seekers at this price."
2579985,73925,2014-10-21T14:47:52-04:00,Lockheed reported quarterly earnings of $2.76 per share.It was anticipated in my previous article that the EPS is likely to grow.I am maintaining my view of 'recommended stock' for an investment over 1-2 year period.,"Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) today reported third quarter 2014 results. In this quarter, net sales are reported $11.1 billion compared to $11.3 billion in the third quarter of 2013. Reported net earnings for the third quarter are $888 million or $ 2.76 per share, up from $842 million or $2.57 per share, in the third quarter of 2013. Cash from operations in the third quarter of 2014 was $990 million, compared to $900 million in the third quarter of 2013. Net sales for the quarter declined 2 percent as compared to same quarter last year and missed analysts' consensus revenue estimate of $11.28 billion. Accept space systems segment, all other segments reported decline in the third quarter. Profit is reported to increase by 2 percent for the third quarter from last year's third quarter, due to lower pension costs and improved operating margins. Earnings per share, or EPS, beat analysts' expectations of $2.71 and reported $2.76 in this quarter. Total operating profit for the quarter increased 11 percent to $1.39 billion from $1.25 billion in the year-ago quarter.Looking ahead, Lockheed Martin now forecasts net earnings of about $11.15 per share and net sales of about $45 billion for fiscal 2014. For fiscal 2015, Lockheed Martin forecasts net sales to decline at a low single-digit rate from 2014 levels, and total business segment operating margin in the range of 11.5 percent to 12 percent.Lockheed Martin results of this quarter are totally in line with my previous analysis, which stated that Lockheed's revenues are projected to decline however the company is likely to show EPS growth in near future. It was also stated that the likeliness of the EPS growth is due to Lockheed's tight cost control and OPEX management. The company will remain under slight pressure due to the U.S. defense budget cuts. This scenario has pulled the company's top line down by 2 percent from 11.3 billion a year ago. Despite decrease in the net sales company still continue to post positive growth in EPS, pointing towards good management of costs. So, my opinion regarding LMT stock remains same that it is recommended stock for an investment over 1-2 year time horizon.Coverage was initiated with ""Lockheed Martin: A Steady Take Off"""
2550975,72215,2014-10-09T11:51:09-04:00,"Volatility in world markets has been fueled by rising political tensions and investors feel there is an urgent need to find low beta, high cap stocks as safe investments.
        Lockheed Martin could fit the bill perfectly and it does represent itself as a safe investment.
        Lockheed Martin announced a new annual dividend of $6 per share, investors will now have a current yield of 3.4%. Their payout ratio is currently 61%, which might prove handy.
        Now would be an ideal time to invest as prices are low, and are expected to follow an upward trend.","Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is a global security, aerospace and information technology company. It is a major contractor for the US Department of Defense, along with other federal agencies operating under the US government, with which it carries out a large proportion of its business. It also carries out some business with international governments and the remainder is carried out on a commercial scale. Lockheed Martin has diverse business acumen and its operations are extended across fields such as Aeronautics, Information Systems & Global Solutions, Missiles and Fire Control, Mission Systems & Training and Space Systems. They have established themselves as innovators and as market leaders in their field.Uncertainty in the market: where to find shelter?The year 2014 has seen a surge in volatility in the stock market along with lower overall returns. Higher beta stocks and the ones with small caps have suffered significantly. Volatility, particularly in high beta stocks, can be attributed to the uncertainty created by political tensions and international conflicts such as the Middle Eastern crisis, Israel's occupation of Gaza and the ongoing clashes with pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine. These, along with economic downturns in Europe and China, have fueled negative speculations in the market. The uncertainty in the stock market can also be accredited to the monetary policy. With quantitative easing set to end, the economy awaits a policy decision regarding interest rates sometime in the near future, but with no clear timetable in sight. This might lead to a further continuation of the turbulence that stock markets have been facing. However, there are areas of safety in the market that can present themselves as highly rewarding investment opportunities. The stocks that would be considered safe investments in the prevailing situation would have to fit a certain profile. Large cap, low beta stocks with solid earnings momentum should be ideal. These stocks should also pay a decent rate of dividend and have a lower rate of leverage besides being priced reasonably and fairly. Another important feature of such a stock should be low susceptibility to the fragile state of the global economy as the dollar grows strong.Is Lockheed Martin a good fit?As investments continue to grow uncertain and risky, Lockheed Martin might just be the answer. Having announced a new annual dividend of $6 per share, investors will now have a current yield of 3.4% despite stock price increases. Their payout ratio is currently 61%, which might come in very handy for investors. Moreover, Lockheed Martin has a history of adding value to its investors by buying back shares, and has increased its buyback allocation to $2 billion this year. As political tensions and pressure continues to mount, defense spending can be expected to increase, thus making Lockheed Martin a safe investment in an uncertain business environment. Lockheed Martin has significant cash holdings and its dividends are expected to grow considerably over the next few years. Earnings are also expected to grow at a rate of 10% over the next 5 years at least. Government contracts allow Lockheed Martin to take advantage of the strengthening dollar. Currently, prices have dropped to a level of $173.55, with expectations of trading higher again with an upside target range of up to $200, thus making this a high reward entry point which investors with long positions can profit from, should additional support be provided.ConclusionConsidering trends in Lockheed Martin's stock prices and the outlook for the future, any investment, particularly in the current period of dropping prices, would be highly rewarding. Investors going long would reap huge benefits. With the current prevailing situation of uncertainty in world markets and the fact that Lockheed Martin's stock prices have currently declined, now would be an ideal time to invest. Considering the overall trend that Lockheed Martin prices have shown over the years, drops in prices have been temporary and have always bounced back, with periods of increases being longer. The growing tensions abroad will create higher demand for defense and help stock prices on their way. It would not be wrong to say that the ideal time to invest in Lockheed Martin is now, with dividends and capital gains both expected to grow. According to the Chief Executive officer of Lockheed Martin, Marilyn Hewson, ""We continue to generate excellent value for our shareholders and are proud to deliver the 12th consecutive annual double-digit increase of the Lockheed Martin quarterly dividend rate. Our world-class workforce remains focused on executing our strategy for growth, investing in innovation, meeting our customers' needs and delivering solid performance for our shareholders."""
2565225,32971,2014-10-15T19:37:54-04:00,Lockheed Martin stated that it achieved a breakthrough in developing a compact nuclear fusion reactor technology.The reactor can be “developed and deployed” in as little as ten years.A test version of the reactor may be ready already in a year.,"At the time when nuclear electric generation seems to have fallen out of popularity and is losing market share to natural gas-fired generation and alternative sources of energy, such as wind and solar, an interesting new development was just announced that may put nuclear power generation again high on the menu of future energy sources, if not completely replace that menu.Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) published a brief press release this morning which suggests that the company may have achieved a breakthrough in developing a nuclear fusion technology for power generation.The company's press release states that its Skunk Works team is working on a new compact fusion reactor (""CFR"") that can be developed and deployed in as little as ten years. Currently, there are several patents pending that cover their approach. While fusion itself is not new, the Skunk Works team has developed an approach that offers a significant reduction in size compared to mainstream efforts.According to the company, the compact fusion concept combines several alternative magnetic confinement approaches, taking the best parts of each, and offers a 90% size reduction over previous concepts. The company believes that the smaller size will allow it to design, build and test the compact fusion reactor in less than a year.After completing several of these design-build-test cycles, the team anticipates being able to produce a prototype in five years. As they gain confidence and progress technically with each experiment, they will also be searching for partners to help further the technology.Nuclear fusion can be a very powerful source of energy. In the nuclear fusion process, multiple atoms (with atom masses lower than iron) combine to form a more stable atom, with a release of energy. Fusion is the process by which stars generate energy. On the sun, four hydrogen atoms fuse into one helium atom in its core, generating the energy that ultimately warms the Earth.Nuclear fusion is the opposite process to nuclear fission, which involves splitting the nucleus of an atom, which could have the effect of generating a large release of energy. This is the mechanism used in nuclear bombs. This is also how most nuclear power plants generate energy.Nuclear fusion as a source of energy has been under development for many decades, but commercially successful technology has not been developed yet.For decades physicists and engineers around the word dreamed of being able one day to harness nuclear fusion as the source of the cheapest and most abundant energy. Has that day finally arrived?It is clearly premature to equate this announcement to probable commercial success. Still, the news is intriguing as it comes from a highly reputed defense technology leader.Could Lockheed Martin's announcement be a game-changer for the way the world's economy sources its energy? Could it make electric car manufactures, such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), ultimate big winners and crude oil and natural gas obsolete one day? Time will tell. A sneak preview - the test reactor - may be available already in a few years. If Lockheed Martin manages to find deep-pocketed partners to help it bankroll the development.Disclaimer: Opinions expressed herein by the author are not an investment recommendation and are not meant to be relied upon in investment decisions.

2575025,73315,2014-10-20T10:50:57-04:00,The company has been looking to diversify revenue streams in wake of decreased national defense budgets.Earnings are expected to rise in spite of aviation development issues.Development of new compact nuclear fusion reactor could indicate new directions for company.,"Well, it does not look like decreased national budgets will keep Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) from soaring again this quarter. Despite being the victim of several setbacks over the past months, the Maryland based aerospace firm seems quite in control of its financial state and may even be poised for greater successes in the fourth quarter. Given that 2013 was certainly a slower year for the firm, 2014 has been a year of plenty for the company and the upcoming announcement of Q3 earnings should only continue the positive investment potential.Looking at the financesIt's true, revenues are expected to be marginally down from 2013 to $11.3 bn from about $11.4 bn a year ago (about 0.6%). But this is easily explained by the recent push by the company's largest customers (Europe and the US) to slim national budgets which has, in turn, cut defense spending. However, while spending has dropped in the short term, the recent headlines grabbed by the Islamic State insurgent group may signal new streams of investment back into the recently neglected LMT. And while the US and Europe may not be investing as much into Lockheed for defense considerations, the company is developing other revenue streams with other countries instead (such as South Korea's recent $7 bn contract to revamp defense aviation there).Though some of these new investments will have to be injected back into the company to combat developmental issues that have cropped up over the company's flagship product, the F-35, enough residual remains that the investors are expected to see a 6% increase in EPS. Given that this raises the figure to $2.72 (from about $2.54 last year quarter), this is certainly nothing to sneeze at.From the stock perspective, the news is even better. Even when posting more substandard revenues, the company's stock has consistently trended positively, doubling in value since Nov 2012 and showing no consistent signs of stopping now. Though a slight consolidative slip might be expected in the near future, for now the company's stock is quite vibrant with low volatility issues.Looking Ahead: The Bottom LineEven with a slight dip in revenues from last year, Lockheed Martin definitely seems poised to grow strongly as they announce earnings tomorrow. With new revenue streams coming into the company in the near future from previously unexplored markets, the company is able to make up for any drop off in investment from traditional customers. Adding in the company's announcement of a viable fusion reactor within five years, the company also seems to be exploring less publicized avenues of development and, assuming work continues apace with projections, should ensure a fairly flexible company.The bottom line? Even if aerospace is grounded by bad finances, there is enough slack in the company that Tuesday's report will be almost certainly herald another strong quarter."
2532625,22148,2014-09-30T21:59:45-04:00,Lockheed Martin increased the quarterly dividend by 13% to $1.50.The BOD authorized a $2 billion share buyback program.These capital return plans make for an interesting comparison to recent buybacks and dividend yields.,"Last week, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) announced an increase in the dividend and a further authorization for stock buybacks. The defense contractor historically is aggressive in returning money to shareholders, but the recent move is surprising considering the stock sits at multi-year highs. In addition, valuation metrics question whether the company should continue engaging in an aggressive buyback program.Updated Capital Return ProgramThe company announced a hike in the quarterly dividend starting in December by 13% to $1.50. The annual dividend is now $6 with a solid yield of 3.4%. In addition, the BOD authorized a stock buyback of $2 billion. With a market cap of roughly $56 billion, the stock buyback amounts to about 3.6% of the outstanding stock. Assuming Lockheed Martin uses the full buyback authorization within the next 12 months, the total yield would equate to 7.0% based on the current stock price.Recent YieldsA key linchpin to any stock buyback announcement is whether the company actually follows through with a buyback that exceeds any share issuance. A net buyback significant enough to reduce the share count is one worth following.According to Marketwatch, Lockheed Martin repurchased the following amounts in the last five quarters in millions: $465, $607, $229, $1,110, and $124. In total, the company had a net buyback of only $1.4 billion in the last year despite spending over $2 billion on repurchasing shares. The current buyback authorization is equivalent in comparison to the money spent, but the shares repurchased in the next year will be less unless the stock falls. The average price in the first half of the year was around $160, compared to the current price around $177.Compared to other defense stocks, Lockheed Martin has an average capital return plan. Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) far exceeds the group with a substantial stock buyback, while Raytheon (RTN) has a similar net payout yield (net buybacks + dividend yield). Lockheed Martin does offer the highest dividend yield of the group and the increased dividend helps enhance it.LMT Net Common Payout Yield (TTM) data by YChartsValuation Too High?Part of the reason that the net payout yield isn't matching the level from last year is that the valuation is stretched on Lockheed Martin. The stock currently trades at roughly 16x current year earnings estimates at a time when analysts continue to forecast annual revenue declines.Sure, the world just got more violent with the Russian aggressions in Ukraine and the ISIS issues in Iraq and Syria, but no real signs exists that the defense contractor will suddenly obtain new large-scale orders. In fact, analysts only forecast earnings to grow roughly 6.5% in 2015, making the earnings multiple stretched.TakeawayThough Lockheed Martin continues to return a substantial amount of cash to shareholders via stock buybacks and dividends, the total amount isn't growing with the gains in the stock. The stock will remain attractive to investors focused solely on the dividend yield, but Northrop Grumman is more attractive to investors interested in the total yield.With the stock trading at all-time highs, investors should continue riding the stock higher for now. Be aware, though, the below chart shows a stock that doesn't end well when the trend ends.Source: Yahoo Finance"
2528975,73925,2014-09-29T16:03:37-04:00,"Despite U.S. defense budget cuts, Lockheed Martin is having stable revenues, and it is consistently winning new contracts.Due to effective cost management, the company is showing positive trend in EPS.Expansions in new avenues will reduce the impact of long-term defense related decline.","Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is a global security and aerospace company focusing on research, design, development and manufacturing of products, services and systems primarily for defense applications. The company's major customers include U.S. department of defense and the U.S. federal government agencies. A portion of its business also comes from international governments and some commercial sales. Lockheed Martin's business units are categorized into five broad business areas:Aeronautics includes tactical aircraft, airlift, and aeronautical research and development. Revenue of $14.1 billion was generated from this segment in 2013.Information systems and global solutions segment includes C4I, federal services, government and commercial IT solutions. Revenue contribution from this segment was around $8.3 billion in 2013.Missiles and Fire Control includes terminal high altitude area defense system, joint light tactical vehicle and PAC-3 Missiles as some of its high-profile programs with $7.7 billion in 2013 sales.Mission systems and training is involved in the development and provision of naval systems, platform integration, simulation and training. Lockheed managed to generate revenue of approximately $7.1 billion in 2013.Space Systems includes space launch, commercial satellites, government satellites and strategic missiles. Sales of $7.9 billion were attracted by this segment during year ended 2013.Revenue and earningsSource: Annual report 2013LMT had total revenue of $45.4 billion in 2013 and is expected to generate $44.85 billion in 2014. During 2013, 82% of the company's net sales were from the U.S. Government including 61% from the Department of Defense and 17% from the international customers including foreign military sales, or FMS, contracted through the U.S. Government.The sales of 2014 are expected to decline slightly from 2013. According to the company, lower net sales at space systems and ISGS segments will result in this decline. However, there is an anticipated increase in net sales of the Aeronautics department. But, overall revenue of LMT will shrink during the next couple of years as analysts are also modeling for revenue decline.Source: Yahoo financeRevenue of LMT is projected to decline but EPS is likely to grow in next few years or so. Analysts are predicting earnings growth of around 10% p.a. until 2015. The company also raised its operating profit mid-point guidance from $5.32 billion to $5.55 billion. EPS in the most recent quarter also improved.Source: Earnings presentationEarnings-growth of LMT can be explained by tight cost control and efficient OPEX management by the company. Lockheed will continue to post EPS growth in the near future because of its cost management exercises.Industry analysisDue to the Budget Control Act of 2011, the U.S. government is cutting down on defense and homeland security expenditures as the government is facing challenges such as budget uncertainty, financial deficits and increasing debt levels. The Budget Control Act limits discretionary spending. It also provides for additional spending reductions known as ""sequestration,"" which went into effect in March 2013. It would reduce the planned defense spending by $500 billion over a period of nine years that began in GFY 2013.However, the Bipartisan Budget Act increased limits on discretionary spending for GFY 2014 and GFY 2015 imposed by the Budget Control Act. It allows for additional funding of $22 billion and $9 billion for the defense spending during GFY 2014 and GFY 2015 respectively. The revised defense spending limits are set at approximately $520 billion for GFY 2014 and approximately $521 billion for GFY 2015.According to a report by PWC:According to a report by Deloitte, the American aerospace and defense industries are simultaneously in growth and decline. The civil aviation is on a course of growth. However, the defense related aerospace industry is in decline.According to IHS, the U.S. defense cuts continue to be the largest factor impacting the global defense spending as the U.S. withdraws from Afghanistan and faces continuing pressure from the Budget Control Act caps and the sequester reductions. Defense budget of the U.S. will remain capped in the next few years as shown in the chart below:Globally, defense budget in the five largest western European markets decreased 1.6% in 2013 and is forecasted to decrease further by 2.4% in 2014. The UK military budget, largest of the five, is forecasted to decline by 7.6% between 2013 and 2016.In the defense industry, the fastest growing regions over the past two years have been the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), which are projected to grow 3.5% in real terms in 2014. Of the world's 10 fastest-growing defense budgets in 2013, six were the MENA countries accounting for 7.8% of the worldwide defense expenditure up from 5.2% in 2008.According to a report by McKinsey;In simple words, although the U.S. defense related spending is set to curtail in the long term, it will slightly increase in the next couple of years. Lockheed will definitely feel the pressure of long-term decline in the defense budget spending. However, the company is likely to benefit from the increase in the U.S. discretionary defense budget spending during the next couple of years. The company itself is confident about its future and notes that:ThesisLockheed is winning contracts consistently.Lockheed Martin Corporation received five defense contracts worth approximately $268.8 million from the U.S. Department of Defense during September.Joint Venture of Lockheed Martin and the Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) has recently won a sizable contract, worth $938.4 Million, from the U.S. air force. This is a modification contract that runs through September 2015.Lockheed has recently been awarded a contract by the U.S. navy. A contract worth $147 million has been secured to upgrade the fleet's electronic warfare defenses.Continuing work from the U.S. government is enough proof of Lockheed's stability in defense related technologies.Lockheed recently made two announcements including the acquisition of Sun Catalytix Corporation and an agreement with Electro Optic Systems Holdings Ltd. Lockheed wants to expand into other avenues to cushion the impact of declining revenue in the defense industry. Sun Catalytix develops storage solutions primarily for solar and wind deployed energy scenarios. Its products will complement missile and defense system products of Lockheed that require energy backup in remote areas. The agreement with Electro Optic systems is for tracking debris in space. Lockheed will bring funding and technology as a part of the agreement. This is a healthy opportunity for Lockheed to diversify and minimize the impact of defense spending decline on its business. NASA believes that there are approximately 21000 debris with a radius of 10 centimeter or larger that can damage orbiting objects. According to Lockheed spokesman, debris collision can result in $500 million costs for satellite operators. So, I think, this partnership will bring a healthy amount of business towards Lockheed, plus it would reduce the impact of the slowing defense industry.The U.S. along with five Arab countries have launched airstrikes on Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. The defense industry usually gains from such developments in the short term. There are significant chances that LMT's stock price will appreciate from these ongoing conflicts.Technical indicatorsLMT looks moderately priced on a price-earnings basis. Industry average PE is around 19.31 according to yahoo finance. Reuters mentions an average of 25 for the industry Lockheed operates in. Lockheed's PE ratio TTM is around 18 and forward PE is around 14.8. Given a higher average PE of the industry, LMT is quite moderately priced. With forward PE around 14, LMT has some room to climb in the next year or two.EPS of the company is projected to grow going forward. Analysts are modeling for around 9% p.a. growth during next five years. As mature companies with flat growth trade around PE of 15, a PE greater than that should be warranted for Lockheed Martin. Assuming that the company will maintain a PE of around 18, the following valuation is achieved:PE based valuation paints a favorable picture for Lockheed Martin. LMT's valuation has the potential to grow by almost 20% in the next two years. Given the level of maturity of Lockheed, the return seems quite impressive with a low amount of risk.ConclusionAerospace and defense industry of the U.S. is likely to follow a long-term decline because of the defense budget restrictions. However, short-term prospects are not hurt because of the Bipartisan Budget Act. As a result, Lockheed will benefit in the short term. EPS is also projected to increase during the next few years. Despite the revenue decline, the company is managing to post EPS growth that point towards good management of costs. Expansion in new avenues, consistent award of new contracts and diversification will also reduce the impact of the defense related decline.Valuation of Lockheed is also moderate. Therefore, LMT's stock is recommended for an investment over a 1-2 year time horizon. As far as long-term growth is concerned, it's unpredictable in the current situation as the defense industry continues to decline in the U.S. and Europe."
2582975,25791,2014-10-22T09:21:43-04:00,,"By Chaith KondraguntaLockheed Martin Corporation reports preliminary financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2014.Lockheed Martin Corporation just reported its preliminary financial results based on which we provide a unique corporate earnings release based analysis of its performance. Our analysis focuses on the company’s performance for the same quarterly period on a year-on-year basis (unless stated otherwise).LMT-US is one of the first companies amongst its peer group to announce earnings for this period.HighlightsThe table below shows the preliminary results and recent trends for key metrics such as revenues and net income (See complete table at the end of this report):Revenue Growth Versus Earnings GrowthCompanies sometimes focus on growing their top-line (Sales or Revenues) more than their bottom-line i.e. Earnings or Net Income. Investors should look at revenue growth to understand a company’s ability to grow its market share, and earnings growth to look at the company’s ability to generate returns. Comparing revenue growth to earnings growth helps understand a couple of items: (1) A company’s focus on gaining market share vs. generating profits and (2) How additive or dilutive the revenue performance has been to earnings. LMT-US’s year-on-year change in top line compared to the same period last year of -2.05% trailed its change in earnings which was 5.46%. The company’s performance this period suggests some efforts to help the bottom-line earnings. It remains to be seen how the rest of the peer group results turn out and if LMT-US’s performance suggests any major shift in the composition of market share in this sector. Also, for comparison purposes, revenues changed by -1.70% and earnings by -0.11% compared to the immediate last quarter.Earnings Growth AnalysisThe company’s earnings have gone up year-on-year. But this growth has not come as a result of improvement in gross margins or any cost control activities in its operations – gross and EBITDA margins are currently at 11.47% and 11.47% respectively and 12.48% and 12.48% for the same period last year. For comparison, gross margins were 14.18% and EBITDA margins 14.18% in the immediate last quarter. Gross Margin TrendCompanies sometimes tradeoff for improvements in revenues and margins by extending friendlier terms to customers and vendors. One quick way to check against such activity is to compare the changes in gross margins with any changes in working capital. If the gross margins improved without a worsening of working capital, it is quite possible that the company’s performance is a result of truly delivering in the marketplace and not simply a prop up using the balance sheet.The company’s decline in gross margins is offset by some improvements on the balance sheet side – working capital management shows progress. The company’s working capital days have gone down to 14.60 from 15.85 for the same period last year and suggets that the gross margin decline is not altogether bad.Operating Cash Flow Growth Versus Earnings GrowthCompanies often post earnings numbers that are influenced by non-cash activities. One way to gauge the quality of the declared earnings number is to judge the deviation in the growth in earnings from the growth in operating cash flows. In general, an earnings growth rate that is higher compared to the operating cash flow growth implies a higher proportion of non-operating and even one-time activities – such activities are typically not sustainable over long periods. LMT-US’s year-on-year change in Operating Cash Flow of 10% is better than its change in earnings suggesting some ability to strengthen the balance sheet.Unusual ItemsThe company’s earnings growth has also been influenced by the following factors: (1) Improvements in EBIT margins from 10.43% to 11.47% and (2) unusual items. The company’s pretax margins are now 11.80% compared to 10.34% for the same period last year.EPS Growth Versus Earnings GrowthLMT-US’s year-on-year change in Earnings per Share (EPS) of 3.76% is less than its change in earnings of 5.46%.Supporting DataThe table below shows the preliminary results along with the recent trend for revenues, net income and other relevant metrics:Company ProfileLockheed Martin Corp. operates as a global security and aerospace company.

2523005,25319,2014-09-26T09:19:57-04:00,"Announces 12th consecutive double digit dividend increase; only 6 other companies have managed this.Rare combination of yield, dividend growth, buyback, and capital appreciation.With political pressure increasing by the day, defense spending could increase further.","Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has just announced its 12 consecutive double digit dividend increase, in terms of percentage as Seeking Alpha has covered here. To put that into context, only 6 other companies have done this according to the website that SA contributor (and the well respected) Robert Allan Schwartz maintains.This article was written in 2013 when LMT announced its dividend increase last year. With the recent increase in mind, let us re-run the numbers.New Dividend and Yield: The new annual dividend of $6.00 per share gives LMT investors a current yield of 3.4%, in spite of LMT's stock price surging along with the rest of the market. LMT's yield is significantly higher than Raytheon's (RTN) and The Boeing Company's (NYSE:BA), which stand at 2.60% and 2.40% respectively.Payout Ratio: The payout ratio currently sits at a very handy 61%. Income investors are usually comfortable until the payout reaches about 80%. The fact that the payout ratio is still low in spite of 12 consecutive double digit increases speaks about LMT's earnings potential and stock buybacks. The forward payout ratio is at a comfortable 50% based on 2015's earnings estimate of $12/share.Dividend Growth Rate [DGR]: This is where Lockheed continues to fire on all cylinders. The 5 year dividend growth rate right now stands at 19.16%. While this has been slowing down a bit (24% to 22% to 18% to 19% over the past few years), there is no doubt this is still impressive. In the last 5 years, the quarterly dividend has grown an astounding 138% from 63 cents/share to $1.50/share.(Source: Finance.Yahoo.Com)Cash on Hand: LMT's cash on hand has increased from almost $2.7B at the time of the previous writing to about $3.44 as of the most recent quarter.Buyback: Lockheed has a history of share buybacks as well, which adds more value to investors by reducing the share count. The graph below shows the share count has gone down from 400 Million in 2009 to about 317 Million in 2014. There were significant buyback announcements in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2013 . Yesterday, the company increased its buyback allocation by $2 billion as well.(Source: YCharts.com)Extrapolation: Even though LMT has been very impressive in its dividend growth so far, one cannot expect the same super growth going forward. This is already evident as the 5 year DGR has slowed from 24% to 18% over the past 4 years. Also, the past decade was very lucrative for the defense companies with the Government spending being lavish on multiple wars.Hence, the table below assumes a ""depressing"" 8% DGR for the first 5 years and a 6% DGR for the next 5 years. Even then, the yield on cost is expected to at least double.(Source: Current dividend and share price from Yahoo Finance)Conclusion: The conclusion of this year's LMT review is pretty much the same as last year's. With more added international tension over the last few months, one can even say things are looking up for defense companies. This stock has so far been a great story for income investors over the past 10 years and the numbers presented above hint it will continue to be so at least in the near future. With earnings expected to grow at 10%/yr over the next 5 years, this stock might have more capital appreciation potential too.Bottom line, we believe LMT will keep surging in Robert Allan Schwartz's list by increasing dividends by double digit percentage over the next few years."
2503875,22018,2014-09-18T06:55:17-04:00,"Although LMT's stock has significantly outperformed the market this year and in 2013, it still has room to move up.Lockheed has increased its 2014 outlook for operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations.Lockheed has shown significant earnings per share surprise in each one of the last four quarters.","In my opinion, although Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) stock is not a bargain right now, it should be included in every diversified large cap dividend stock portfolio. Lockheed Martin has good valuation metrics and strong earnings growth prospects, and it increased its 2014 outlook for operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. Lockheed has shown significant earnings per share surprise in each one of the last four quarters. In addition, Lockheed is generating strong cash flow, and it returns value to its shareholders by stock buybacks and increasing dividend payments.The CompanyLockheed Martin is the world's largest military weapons maker. The company provides advanced technology systems, products and services to the U.S. government and international defense customers. The company was founded in 1909, and is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland.Valuation MetricsThe table below presents the valuation metrics of LMT; the data were taken from Yahoo Finance and finviz.com.LMT's valuation metrics are pretty good; the forward P/E is low at 14.73, the Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio is also low at 10.07, and the average annual earnings growth estimates for the next 5 years is high at 9.40%. However, the debt-to-equity ratio is high at 1.43.Latest-Quarter ResultsOn July 22, Lockheed reported its second-quarter 2014 financial results, which beat EPS expectations by $0.10 (3.76%) and beat the Street's consensus on revenues.The company reported second-quarter 2014 net sales of $11.3 billion, compared to $11.4 billion in the second quarter of 2013. Net earnings in the second quarter of 2014 were $889 million, or $2.76 per diluted share, compared to $859 million, or $2.64 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2013. Cash from operations in the second quarter of 2014 was $977 million, compared to cash from operations of $623 million in the second quarter of 2013.In the report, Chairman, President and CEO Marillyn Hewson said:Dividend and Share RepurchaseLockheed has been paying dividends since 1982, the forward annual dividend yield is high at 3.00% and the payout ratio is at 51.5%. The annual rate of dividend growth over the past three years was very high at 21.9%, over the past five years was very high at 21.2%, and over the past ten years was also very high at 23.5%. I consider that besides dividend yield, the consistency and the rate of raising dividend payments are the most crucial factors for dividend-seeking investors, and LMT's performance has been impressive in this respect.LMT Dividend data by YChartsSince Lockheed is generating much free cash flow ($977 million cash from operations in the last quarter), and the payout ratio is not excessive, I believe that the company is well-positioned to achieve steady dividend growth going forward.In the second-quarter report, the company explained its shares repurchase policy:In the first quarter of 2014, the company repurchased 7.0 million shares for $1.1 billion, compared to 5.1 million shares for $461 million in the first quarter of 2013.CompetitorsA comparison of key fundamental data between Lockheed and its competitors is shown in the table below.There is not a big difference between Lockheed's valuation metrics and those of its competitors. However, Lockheed has the highest dividend yield among the stocks in the group.LMT's Efficiency and Return on Capital parameters have been much better than its industry median, its sector median and the S&P 500 median, as shown in the tables below.Source: Portfolio123RankingAccording to Portfolio123's ""Balanced4"" powerful ranking system LMT's stock is ranked first among all S&P 500 stocks yielding more than 2.8%. The ""Balanced4"" ranking system is quite complex, and it is taking into account many factors like EPS consistency, technical analysis, valuation, profitability ratios and dividend information, as shown in the Portfolio123 chart below.Back-testing over fifteen years has proved that this ranking system is very useful.Technical AnalysisThe charts below give some technical analysis information.Chart: finviz.comThe LMT stock price is 1.84% above its 20-day simple moving average, 5.55% above its 50-day simple moving average and 12.33% above its 200-day simple moving average. That indicates a short-term, mid-term and a long-term uptrend.Chart: TradeStation Group, Inc.The weekly MACD histogram, a particularly valuable indicator by technicians, is negative at 0.42 and ascending, which is a bullish signal (a rising MACD histogram and crossing the zero line from below is considered an extremely bullish signal). The RSI oscillator is at 68.01, approaching overbought conditions.Analyst OpinionMany analysts are covering the stock, but their opinion is divided. Among the twenty-two analysts, four rate it as a Strong Buy, three rate it as a Buy, fourteen rate it as a Hold and one analyst rates it as an Underperform.TipRanks is a website that ranks experts (analysts and bloggers) according to their performance. According to TipRanks, among the analysts covering LMT stock, there are only eight analysts who have the four or five star rating, three of them recommend the stock and five analysts have a Hold rating on the stock.Major DevelopmentsAlong with its latest-quarter results, Lockheed increased its outlook for operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations for the year, as shown in the company's table below.Lockheed has shown significant earnings per share surprise in each one of the last four quarters, as shown in the table below.Data: Yahoo Finance - Analyst EstimatesIn my opinion, the fact that the company succeeds to beat analyst expectations quarter after quarter by a considerable margin demonstrates the strength of its business, and there is a good chance that Lockheed will continue to surprise by reporting better-than-estimated results also in the future.LMT's stock has significantly outperformed the market this year and in 2013. Since the start of the year, LMT's stock has gained 19.2%, while the S&P 500 index has risen 8.1% and the Nasdaq Composite Index has increased 9.0%. Moreover, since the beginning of 2013, LMT's stock has recorded an impressive gain of 92.0%, while the S&P 500 index has increased 40.2% and the Nasdaq Composite Index has risen 50.8%. Nevertheless, considering its good valuation metrics and strong earnings growth prospects, the stock, in my opinion, still has room to move up.My TakeLockheed derived 82% of its net sales in 2013 from the U.S. government, in contrast to Boeing, which relies less on the U.S. government, with about 35% of revenue coming from there. Hence, Lockheed's revenue might decrease if the U.S government is not going to increase its defense budget.However, in my opinion, Lockheed's arms sales will continue to grow, since the company still had a massive backlog of $82.6 billion at the end of the second quarter, and it plans to reduce the impact of the decreasing U.S military budget by increasing its international sales. According to the company, it is looking to grow international sales to at least 20% of its revenues in the next years.In addition, the increasing armed conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine will increase the demand for Lockheed's arms. Qatar, for instance, has recently entered an agreement with the U.S. government to buy Patriot missiles and Apache helicopters for about $11 billion.ConclusionLockheed Martin has good valuation metrics and strong earnings growth prospects, and it increased its 2014 outlook for operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. Furthermore, LMT stock ranked first among all S&P 500 stocks yielding more than 2.8%, according to the ""Balanced4"" powerful ranking system. Lockheed is generating strong cash flow, and it returns value to its shareholders by stock buybacks and increasing dividend payments. In addition, Lockheed has shown significant earnings per share surprise in each one of the last four quarters. All these factors bring me to the conclusion that LMT stock is a smart long-term investment. Furthermore, the rich dividend represents a gratifying income."
2479325,69385,2014-09-08T16:27:04-04:00,"If you’re looking for a solid cash-minting company that knows how to return capital to its shareholders, your search ends with Lockheed Martin.LMT gives you a hedge against global conflict and possible wars over the near term.Risk factors are minimal and while not buying at dirt-cheap prices, you would be adding a 3%+ dividend yield to your portfolio.Enlist with LMT today and start collecting that nice current income.","The SituationConflicts seem to be breaking out around the globe at a much more rapid pace than normal. Geopolitical tensions continue to run high with governments battling against negative economic forces and, in some cases, armed battles.Normally, this would be a time to run away from the stock market and straight into gold. While holding some gold in your portfolio (as a crisis hedge) right now is not a bad idea, the thought of abandoning the stock market altogether is a bit impetuous.To the contrary, if one were to pick any sector of the markets to outperform in times like these, it would be the defense sector. Drilling down from there, when one thinks of defense contractors, the first one that comes to mind is Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT).Arguably the most well-known and established conglomerate of its kind in the world, LMT is a powerhouse when it comes to intelligence solutions and military/defense systems. Founded in 1909 and headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, LMT is synonymous with the development of military weaponry and information technology.Right now, given the tensions at home and abroad, the likely winner of any armed conflict is not simply the one with the most jets, bombs and tanks, but the company supplying these items. With that thought in mind, when trying to identify the largest beneficiary of planned military combat, LMT stands out as a business you want to own.LMT is a solid company that knows how to return capital to its rightful owners. Management handles the company's finances as pedantically as one would expect from a high-tech aeronautics and missile defense systems architect. It is a cash cow that diverts its excess profits back into the pockets of its shareholders through dividends and substantial share buybacks.While not dirt cheap, LMT has the benefit of big current income and a steady stream of cash flow to keep your money safe going forward. Plus, should the world enter a new stage of red-level military crisis, you can at least feel a bit safer knowing you own the goliath of weapon systems engineering.Now, let's get to the specifics…The NumbersIt is hard to find undervalued firms in the U.S. equities market today that are quality companies. LMT, while not a steal, is certainly not expensive. In our opinion, at current prices, you are paying a fair value for such a well-run business operating inside an extremely complex and politically heated industry.What jumps out at us first, and what we like the most about LMT, is that it yields a solid 3%+. Also, management has a long history of raising dividends, so you are paying a bit of a premium for those future benefits as well.As far as the safety of those dividend payments, LMT mints cash. It generated over $4.9 billion in Cash Flow over the past year alone. The dividend represents just 33.8% of this figure. Plus, CapEx is stable, making Free Cash Flow quite attractive at $4.1 billion over the same twelve-month period.Additionally, future prospects for LMT look positive. Numerous project commitments are filling the pipeline for the firm, such as the F-35 Program, which will see the development of the ""the most advanced 5th generation fighter the world has ever seen,"" according to Marillyn A. Hewson, LMT CEO and President.War is good business for LMT and the world doesn't seem to be short on conflict these days. LMT currently trades at a reasonable forward P/E ratio of 14.51.(Below based on trailing twelve months of quarterly SEC filings)Gross Profit Margin: 10.3%Net Profit Margin: 7.1%Return on Equity: 73.7%Dividend Yield: 3.1%Stockholder Yield: 13.3%Price-to-Earnings: 16.97Price-to-Book: 12.51Price-to-Sales: 1.21Price-to-Cash Flow: 10.99Current Ratio: 1.17Debt-to-Equity: 7.62Enterprise Value/EBITDA: 9.72The FactsLMT employs over 115,000 full-time workers and has been in business for over 105 years. The company operates around its five core segments:1) Aeronautics;2) Information Systems & Global Solutions;3) Missiles & Fire Controls;4) Missions Systems & Training; and5) Space Systems.When the U.S. government needs sophisticated military weaponry and advanced technological systems, it calls Lockheed Martin. LMT is of the main reasons that the United States military is light-years ahead of any other country on the planet. For better or for worse, LMT helps develop the systems that are relied upon by our leaders to eliminate physical threats of military action against our nation and our troops.A glimpse at the financial data proves that LMT is a quality company. With a monster Return on Equity of 73.7% and a Stockholder Yield of 13.3%, you can be certain management is looking out for its shareholders.Over the past twelve months, LMT has zero net-borrowing activity and has bought back in excess of $1.4 billion of stock. Top that off with a 3.1% (-ttm) dividend yield and you have yourself a well-run business.The RisksThe risk factors here are actually quite unusual. For most typical companies, the thought of war or military conflict around the globe would be cause for fear and investors' urge to dump shares. However, with LMT, you are actually somewhat hedging yourself against these events. Should tensions escalate further and conflict become increasingly ""hot,"" then LMT would likely be called upon to provide more of its products and services.It just so happens that LMT's products and services are bombs, fighter jets and advanced weapons control systems. If world peace suddenly broke out around the globe, then LMT's future projects might look dim. However, this is a very unlikely scenario.The other risk factor here is not as much external, but just an internal awareness of LMT's financials. Given that it operates in a highly capital-intensive industry, LMT carries a significant amount of debt related to its equity. Currently, its D/E ratio stands at 7.62.Also, should capital expenditures rise, it could weigh down free cash flow. However, we feel that there is enough of a cushion in place between cash flows and dividend payouts that it should not materially impact the current dividend. The payout ratio of cash flow over the past twelve months was 33.8%. This leaves plenty of room for continued dividend growth should things take a favorable course of action.The ConclusionIf you want or need current income and like the prospects of future dividend growth along with the possibility of capital gains through share price appreciation (and c'mon, who doesn't?), then LMT is a stock you should consider owning today.It is a quality business that has a solid track record of returning cash to its shareholders. Plus, since war is the company's primary revenue generator, it acts a crisis hedge to global conflict. Get on board with LMT today and start collecting a solid 3%+ dividend yield."
2495415,72235,2014-09-15T10:12:40-04:00,"SpaceX is significantly important for American space travel that is currently completely reliant on Russian cooperation and technology.The Government exclusively uses a Boeing and Lockheed Martin joint venture for their satellite launches: a wantonly overpriced monopoly that is entirely dependent on Russian parts and technology.SpaceX is close to receiving full Government clearance to compete for launches. Not only can they facilitate them at a fraction of the cost, but sans any Russian involvement.","With acrimonious geopolitical tensions abound, the current setting does not bode well for American space travel that is almost (inexcusably) entirely reliant on Russian cooperation for such endeavors. Elon Musk is seeking to change all that. His company SpaceX is aggressively looking to grant the U.S. the autonomy it deserves in space exploration and travel and in the process eliminating the monopoly held by Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) and their joint launch venture the Government has used exclusively so far: the United Launch Alliance (ULA).All of the United States' means of both launching the rockets that carry their satellites into space and their ability to send astronauts both to and from the International Space Station (ISS) are solely reliant on Russian cooperation or buttressed by Russian technology. The latter could be in jeopardy as statements released recently by Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin have threatened to ban all sales of RD-180 engines -- a highly critical rocket component -- to the United States intended for use in military launches. This is not, to say the least, an propitious scenario for United States space travel or more commonly, satellite launches.The following will aid in placing some context on just how much the U.S. values and uses satellites for military and civilian purposes:Viability and cost-effectiveness of SpaceX launches over ULASpaceX has executed nine successful flights of its Falcon 9 launch system with fifty missions currently contracted at an approximate value of $5 billion. They have met the Air Force's certification requirement of three successful launches and expect to achieve full certification by year's end. This certification is critical as it would allow SpaceX to compete for involvement in the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program: which is intended to facilitate access to space for the Air Force and Department of Defense amongst other entities of the Government. Currently the EELV program is led entirely by the ULA: no other entity is allowed to even compete for any launches let alone facilitate them.The ULA relies heavily on its Atlas 5 rocket as the primary mover of heavy satellites; these are powered exclusively by Russian RD-180 engines, of which there are only sixteen on hand in the US for launch until they're able to procure more. SpaceX can not only remedy this issue with their All-American made Falcon 9 rocket, but can do so at a greatly reduced cost to what is essentially ULA's monopoly.According to Mr. Elon Musk himself in a US Senate hearing, SpaceX can facilitate launches for less than $100 million. To place some context with that figure: ULA's average price per launch sits at $380 million, an astoundingly high amount in comparison just for the launch itself. Furthermore, the average price of the GPS satellites launched with some of these rockets sits at around $140 million. This means that with a SpaceX launch you can buy both the satellite and the launch, and still have well over $100 million in savings compared to just a ULA launch alone. These are stunning differences that just reinforce what all would expect to occur when a monopoly is allowed to operate unchallenged. The financial icing to this egregiously overvalued cake is the $1 billion annual subsidy ULA receives, allotted simply for overhead costs and personnel, even if it doesn't launch a single rocket. To reiterate: they receive $1 billion annually in a retainer fee of sorts even if they launch nothing for the Government. SpaceX requires no such subsidy.Financial impact on Boeing and Lockheed Martin and the loss of a ULA monopolyHow does this impact Lockheed Martin and Boeing? The Pentagon has planned $70 billion in anticipated costs for ULA launches spanning over the next 15 years. SpaceX, if granted the ability to compete, claims to be able to do so at a whopping 74% discount to ULA launches. While it's unlikely SpaceX will win all contracts if (more likely when) allowed to compete, what will invariably occur with the elimination of the monopoly is competition; which means lower prices for contracts won for ULA in addition to losing out on a significant number of jobs to SpaceX until they become able to conduct launches in a SpaceX-competitive price range. It is not a stretch to postulate that this $70 billion that would otherwise have become revenue for Boeing and Lockheed may conservatively get cut in half, and in all likelihood significantly more, factoring in contracts lost and reduced profit from cost cutting to remain competitive. This could very well have a material impact on earnings for Boeing and Lockheed, who have been generating roughly $20 billion and $11 billion per quarter in revenues respectively as of late, including revenue from the ULA partnership.What's even more startling for ULA, Boeing, and Lockheed, is they may see the monopolistic pendulum swing the other way and lose all launches to SpaceX; the reason being quite pragmatic considering Russia's hostility. As mentioned earlier the Russian RD-180 engine is integral to the Atlas V rocket while the Delta IV rocket, the other main ULA device, also utilizes Russian technology. A Senate panel has recently drafted legislation that would effectively bar ULA from any launches in their current form. The reason? All that Russian technology they incorporate. Within Section 1623 of the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act it explicitly states that the Secretary of Defense may not conduct any business for the EELV program with any entity that ""purchases supplies critical for space launch activities covered by contract from a Russian entity."" If this gets enacted, Boeing and Lockheed can not only say goodbye to the entirety of that $70 billion allocated for launches, but the $1 billion annual subsidy as well. This carries a far more material impact on earnings than the already large amount of contracts they'd lose if SpaceX is allowed to join the rocket-launching fray for the Government.SpaceX' importance for access to the International Space Station amongst a tenuous U.S.-Russian relationshipFollowing the comments of Rogozin, a target of US sanctions against Russia, who recommended America should find a large ""trampoline"" to continue access to the International Space Station, it also bears mentioning that SpaceX is currently the United States' only unilateral way to access the ISS. The Company's Dragon spacecraft has had successful dockings with the ISS to deliver cargo and SpaceX has its first testing of the Dragon with human participants scheduled for early 2015. The U.S. currently pays $71 million per head to Russia when sending its personnel to the ISS and as it stands currently could not do so without them. To state an obvious tautology: that means Russia gets $71 million per head. They're also due to receive a $457.9 million payment from the U.S. for their space services rendered: this is a very significant amount of money for Russia's aerospace industry. It is unlikely Russia, especially with an economy in dire straits, will end this lucrative relationship anytime soon. This does not alter the SpaceX goal of granting the U.S. the ability to operate unilaterally in its access of the ISS. A wise decision as current sanctions against Russia have shown financial deterrents are not always an effective means of corralling and altering Russian leadership's behavior.ConclusionThese figures and geopolitical events make a compelling case for the long-term viability of SpaceX. They possess a handful of NASA launches and continues to await official Air Force approval. They have shown with a recent antitrust lawsuit targeted against the Air Force and DoD that they will not stand idly by while a wanton and unnecessary level of money is spent on operations that are almost entirely reliant on hostile foreign technology. SpaceX is a significantly important disruptive force, as Elon Musk tends to create, that is actively working to create an exciting new future and independence for American space endeavors. Investors in both Boeing and Lockheed should remain cognizant of developments in the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act and up to date on SpaceX and authorizations they achieve as they may very well carry a material impact on earnings figures for both companies. Investors may even consider such information as part of a thesis for a short-term short position, particularly in Lockheed as they have lower revenue relative to Boeing with the loss potentially imparting a greater impact, on the next earnings report that reflects lost business for the ULA."

(NYSE:LMT). Below are some highlights from the above linked analysis:Company Description: Lockheed Martin Corp., the world's largest military weapons manufacturer, is also a significant supplier to NASA and other non-defense government agencies. LMT receives about 93% of its revenues from global defense sales.Fair Value: In calculating fair value, I consider the NPV MMA Differential Fair Value, along with these four calculations of fair value, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:1. Avg. High-Yield Price 2. 20-Year DCF Price 3. Avg. P/E Price 4. Graham NumberLMT is trading at a premium to all four valuations above. Since LMT's tangible book value is not meaningful, a Graham number can not be calculated. The stock is trading at a 28.8% discount to its calculated fair value of $244.26. LMT earned a Star in this section since it is trading at a fair value.Dividend Analytical Data: In this section, there are three possible Stars and three key metrics; see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:1. Free Cash Flow Payout 2. Debt-to-Total Capital 3. Key Metrics 4. Dividend Growth Rate 5. Years of Div. Growth 6. Rolling 4-yr Div. > 15%LMT earned two Stars in this section for 1.) and 3.) above. A Star was earned since the Free Cash Flow payout ratio was less than 60% and there were no negative Free Cash Flows over the last 10 years. LMT earned a Star for having an acceptable score in at least two of the four Key Metrics measured.Rolling 4-yr Div. > 15% means that dividends grew on average in excess of 15% for each consecutive 4-year period over the last 10 years (2004-2007, 2005-2008, 2006-2009, etc.). I consider this a key metric since dividends will double every 5 years if they grow by 15%. The company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since 1995, and has increased its dividend payments for 12 consecutive years.Dividend Income vs. MMA: Why would you assume the equity risk and invest in a dividend stock if you could earn a better return in a much less risky money market account (MMA) or Treasury bond? This section compares the earning ability of this stock with a high-yield MMA (20-year Treasury bond). Two items are considered in this section; see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:1. NPV MMA Diff. 2. Years to > MMALMT earned a Star in this section for its NPV MMA Diff. of the $8,640. This amount is in excess of the $2,300 target I look for in a stock that has increased dividends as long as LMT has. If LMT grows its dividend at 15.0% per year, it will take 1 year to equal a MMA yielding an estimated 20-year average rate of 3.08%. LMT earned a check for the Key Metric '""Years to >MMA"" since its 1 year is less than the 5-year target.Memberships and Peers: LMT is a member of the S&P 500 and a member of the Broad Dividend Achievers™ Index. The company's peer group includes: Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA) with a 2.4% yield, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) with a 2.3% yield and United Technologies Corp. (NYSE:UTX) with a 2.2% yield.Conclusion: LMT earned one Star in the Fair Value section, earned two Stars in the Dividend Analytical Data section and earned one Star in the Dividend Income vs. MMA section for a total of four Stars. This quantitatively ranks LMT as a 4-Star Strong stock.Using my D4L-PreScreen.xls model, I determined the share price would need to increase to $290.93 before LMT's NPV MMA Differential decreased to the $2,300 minimum that I look for in a stock with 12 years of consecutive dividend increases. At that price, the stock would yield 1.8%.Resetting the D4L-PreScreen.xls model and solving for the dividend growth rate needed to generate the target $2,300 NPV MMA Differential, the calculated rate is 10.4%. This dividend growth rate is less than 15.0% used in this analysis, thus providing a significant margin of safety. LMT has a risk rating of 2.25, which classifies it as a Medium risk stock.LMT is the largest defense contractor in the world and dominates next-generation defense platforms. It owns supply contracts for key programs such as the F-35, which assures the company multiple years of revenue. The company's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is the world's most expensive weapons system, costing around $400 billion. In spite of spending cuts, the company continues to receive contracts from the Dept. of Defense. Going forward, its varied product offerings, operating execution and cost reduction measures will help the company to sustain its profitability.The defense sector has experienced a rebound since a series of U.S. air strikes around Iraq's Mosul dam. The Pentagon confirmed continued U.S. military involvement in Iraq is needed to address the long-term threat from the Islamic State (a group of Sunni militants with roots in al-Qaeda). Such actions could well affect the fiscal 2015 defense budget, with LMT as one of the likely beneficiaries.Since the last review in February 2014, the company continued to see improved free cash flow payout, currently at 42%, down from 47%. Its debt to total capital slipped slightly to 59% from 56%. LMT is trading at a discount to my calculated fair value of $244.26. Given its improvements and favorable valuation, I will continue to look for opportunities to add to my position.Disclaimer: Material presented here is for informational purposes only.

2524835,68315,2014-09-26T23:46:42-04:00,"Lockheed Martin offers great returns on capital.Lockheed Martin's forward dividend yield is 3.4% and its Chowder number is 19, making it a good income investment.Lockheed Martin's multiples are low compared to its peers and the market, suggesting a good entry point.","With the recent expansion of the U.S.-led war against ISIS to Syria, as well as with all the other conflicts we have around the globe, it seems we are moving towards a future minted by military conflicts. One industry is poised to profit from that development: the suppliers of military equipment. One of the members of the defense industry is Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), an aerospace, defense, security and technology company. Founded in 1995 by the merger of Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta, the Bethesda, Maryland-based company operates in 4 divisions:- Aerospace and Defense- Information Technology- Space- Emerging TechnologiesWith these, Lockheed Martin generated revenues of $44.8 billion and earnings of $3.15 billion in the last twelve months. Lockheed Martin's market capitalization is $56.3 billion.Lockheed Martin's shares are up 44% over the last twelve months, up 22% year to date and currently trading 2% below their 52-week high of $181.22.Latest resultsIn the latest quarter (Q2 2014), Lockheed Martin reported revenues of $11.3 billion, down one percent from the year ago quarter. Operating profits were $1.41 billion, down from $1.53 billion. Consolidated operating profits were $1.43 billion, up from $1.30 billion. Diluted EPS were $2.76, up 5% from last year's Q2 EPS of $2.64. Additionally, Lockheed Martin grew its cash from operations from $620 million to $980 million.Although this doesn't look like an outstanding quarter, Lockheed Martin raised its FY2014 outlook considerably: Consolidated operating profit is expected in the range of $5.475 billion to $5.625 billion (previous guidance $5.250 billion to $5.400 billion), and EPS guidance was raised from $10.65 ($10.50 to $10.80) to $11.00 ($10.85 to $11.15). If EPS for 2014 come in at $11, this would be a great improvement over the EPS of $9.70 the company earned in the last twelve months.FundamentalsLMT Return on Equity (TM) data by YChartsLockheed Martin reports great returns on capital: ROI is an outstanding 34% for the last twelve months, while ROE comes in at 99%. Lockheed Martin's ROI has been at this level for the last five years, demonstrating the company's ability to allocate capital in an extremely rewarding way. The company's ROE has been at 75% or higher over the last five years; this is the result of the company's high ROI and its relatively high leverage. Lockheed Martin's extremely high ROE (which is not a one-time trick) is a plus for investors, since high-ROE businesses tend to outperform low-ROE businesses.LMT Operating Margin (TTM) data by YChartsLockheed Martin's margins are pretty average compared to its peers: its operating margin is 10% compared to 12% for General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and 8% for Boeing (NYSE:BA). Also, Lockheed Martin's profit margin is 7.1%, slightly below General Dynamics' profit margin of 7.4% and above Boeing's profit margin of 5.7%. These margins, although not great, look healthy and have been growing since 2012, a trend that will likely persist.LMT Debt to Equity Ratio (Quarterly) data by YChartsLockheed Martin has a debt/equity ratio of 1.43; this is a relatively high leverage (and one of the reasons for Lockheed Martin's high ROE). With interest rates at record lows, this is not necessarily a bad thing. The company's quick ratio of 0.8, its current ratio of 1.2 and its cash position of $3.4 billion provide enough liquidity for the company. Lockheed Martin's leverage is high, but not at a threatening level -- investors should nevertheless keep a lock on this.DividendLockheed Martin paid a quarterly dividend of $1.33 in the last four quarters, equaling a yield of 3.0% at current share prices. Lockheed Martin declared its dividend it will pay at the end of December: the dividend has been increased to $1.50, a hike of 13%. This gives Lockheed Martin a forward dividend yield of 3.4%.LMT Dividend data by YChartsLockheed Martin has increased its dividend in every year since 2002. For the last ten years, the dividend growth rate was 20%, but for the last five years, the dividend growth rate was 19%.A (forward) yield of 3.4% and a 5-year growth rate of 19% equal a Chowder number of 22, making Lockheed Martin a very interesting investment for dividend growth investors.LMT Payout Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsLockheed Martin grew its payout ratio over the last few years, however, at 52%, there still is plenty of room for dividend increases, and further dividend hikes should be expected.LMT Shares Outstanding data by YChartsLockheed Martin additionally returns cash to shareholders via share repurchases, however, those have been not very significant over the last three years. Since 2012, Lockheed Martin reduced the number of shares outstanding by 3%, between 2010 and 2012 the company had reduced the number of shares outstanding by 15%. Management's current approach of favoring dividend payments over share buybacks is good for dividend growth (or income) investors.Future prospectsLockheed Martin's raised outlook for 2014 of EPS of $10.85 to $11.15 is a definite positive for shareholders. The consensus EPS estimate for FY2015 is $12.03. EPS are expected to grow 9.5% annually over the next five years.These growth prospects are good for investors looking for capital appreciation (since share prices should grow equally) as well as for income investors, since high earnings growth allows the company to raise its dividend payments significantly without raising the payout ratio too much.For the long term, Lockheed Martin's position as one of the leading innovators and technology companies, as well as the world's growing need for security and defense solutions, should provide plenty of growth.ValuationLMT P/E Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsLockheed Martin looks reasonably valued: Its trailing P/E ratio is 18.1, slightly below its peers General Dynamic (19.1) and Boeing (19.2). Lockheed Martins forward P/E is 14.8. Lockheed thus is slightly cheaper than its peers and the broad market (S&P500's P/E is 19.5).Lockheed Martin and General Dynamic both have a EV/EBITDA multiple of 10.0. Boeing is slightly more expensive; its EV/EBITDA multiple is 10.5.LMT Price to Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YChartsLockheed Martin's price to free cash flow ratio is 14. This means Lockheed Martin's free cash flow yield is a very respectable 7%.These metrics suggest that Lockheed Martin is slightly undervalued compared to its peers and the market -- it looks like a good time to buy the stock.Bottom lineLockheed offers great returns on capital: The company's ROI and ROE are exceptional. Lockheed Martin's dividend policy is very persuasive for dividend growth investors: With a forward yield of 3.4% and a Chowder number of 19, Lockheed Martin looks like a great investment. Lockheed Martin's valuation, with multiples slightly below those of its peers and its good growth outlook suggest it is a good time to buy right now. I rate Lockheed Martin a buy for income investors."
2316965,56822,2014-07-16T05:57:32-04:00,"Lockheed Martin’s previous quarter saw sales falling but earnings increased thanks to cost optimization.Lower defense budget is being taken care of by improving cost structure in various programs.Although, the F-35 program is a major concern for investors, I believe that the Government remains committed to the program.The international markets and good guidance for the year indicate that Lockheed Martin will continue reaping revenue and generating returns for investors.","It is safe to say that Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) sailed through its last fiscal year with flying colors. Over the period, the defense stock gained a rewarding 40% in price appreciation. Several issues have surrounded the company and which may have caused some to doubt the company's future revenue stream. These include the heavy reliance on the US Department of Defense; 61% of sales come from the government.Still, Lockheed Martin remains a good choice for return-seeking investors. The company is set to announce its second quarter results late this month. Before we proceed, let's quickly recall Lockheed Martin's performance during its first quarter. During its last quarter, Lockheed Martin experienced declining volumes which led to a 3% fall in total revenue to $10.7 billion. Cost of sales fell by 9% due to greater risk retirements for the C-130 program at the aeronautics and radar surveillance systems and combat systems programs at MST. We will see these reductions continue in the future. This is because Lockheed Martin is closing and merging certain facilities to reduce its total workforce by 4,000 personnel. I believe the decision was well drafted because given the present facility capacity and future workload projections, enacting cost measures has become necessary to incorporate the changes in U.S. government spending as well as the rapidly changing competitive and economic environment. Recently when the US put sanctions on Russia, the country said it would cut off the sale of its RD-180 rocket engines for use by the American military.Growing pressure to develop additional technology in the U.S. along with a lower defense budget means that Lockheed Martin has to find a way to keep its products affordable. Otherwise, both the company and the nation would be at a drawback. This small but important issue may drive the survival strategy Lockheed Martin is considering at the moment and will highlight how the company will stay afloat.Cost leverage and other non operating factors brought in earnings of $2.87 per share and this figure was higher than last year's result. I will not incorporate order booking in my article but will let investors know that it grew year over year. My point of focus will now divert to the recent news regarding shutting down the near $400 billion F-35 program which might have worried investors.The plane was recently grounded because the engine caught on fire. This isn't the first time the program has faced difficulties. The F-35 is billions over budget, nearly a decade behind schedule, and inundated under technical flaws. But despite all of these problems, I am confident that the program will succeed. To begin with, U.S. lawmakers are still committed to supporting the F-35. Stopping this program would mean billions lost in research and development costs. Moreover, the authorities have concluded that the recent fire wasn't a systematic flaw. Just as any product needs to be developed, Lockheed Martin needs more time to develop and refine the plane. The company, together with two of its biggest suppliers, has agreed to invest up to $170 million of their own money to help lower the high cost of the new F-35 fighter jets. Given what has been already invested, I believe these planes will come to pass and Lockheed Martin won't recognize any loss going forward.In addition, to doing business with the F-35 domestically, the international arena is relatively untapped by the company. The company has the potential as was evident with Raytheon which is already well positioned in the international market and recently boosted international sales to 27% of total revenue. In its last earnings call Lockheed Martin discussed that the company was working towards reaching a 20% contribution towards total revenue from international sales.Korea has already procured the F-35 for its F-X fighter acquisition program. This year's order quantities for new aircraft are projected to increase by 20% above the previous fiscal year's levels. And the fiscal year 2015 budget projections reflect an additional expansion of over 30% in new aircraft orders for Lockheed Martin. These figures indicate growing customer demand for the aircraft.Bottom LineDespite budget constraints, Lockheed Martin's trailing return on equity has stood at 123%, significantly higher than the industry. With bottom line improvements, international expansion potential, and the F-35 program destined to remain in place, I don't see any reason why the weapon supplier should underperform in the future. Its dividend payout has been raised every year since 2003. A present payout ratio of 51% still offers Lockheed Martin plenty of elasticity to continue to raise payments in the near future, especially given the strong cash flows it has and the future backing of orders. For all of these reasons, I believe Lockheed Martin deserves a buy rating.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2345525,27361,2014-07-27T03:32:30-04:00,"On an international front, where do the opportunities lie?How will these opportunities effect growth?The current share value and what to expect looking forward.","With U.S. federal budgets under pressure and long-term fiscal challenges on the horizon, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is taking proactive measures to position themselves for growth and continued success.One of the ways that Lockheed Martin is looking to position themselves for success is through international growth. Even though the company currently does business with 70 different nations and has more than 1,000 global partnerships, the company has derived ~82% of their net sales from the U.S. Government.In 2013, as ~18% of the company's net sales were generated from international customers, Lockheed Martin's strategy to grow international sales over the next several years is vital to the long-term success of the company. In the short-term Lockheed Martin's goal is to generate ~20% of their sales outside the United States by the end of next year.A key step in the plan to diversify company sales was the creation of Lockheed Martin International. The program is designed to increase exposure and sales outside the United States and focus on international sales where military spending is expected to increase in the future. In a recent media statement Chairman, CEO and President Marillyn A. Hewson stated: ""Our international expansion will fuel our company's sustainable growth, bring economies of scale and the associated savings to our domestic and international customers, and enable a strong, safer future for our nation and allies around the world.""As the F-35 is expected to become Lockheed's largest international money maker, President, CEO and Chairman Marillyn A. Hewson has been spending a lot of time traveling to meet with international customers. In the so far in 2014 Marillyn A. Hewson has met with customers in the UAE, Israel, Poland, Germany, Singapore and Japan. On the domestic front she has met with ambassadors and visiting senior leaders from many other nations.Within the focus of international growth, Lockheed Martin has made some significant gains.1. In May, Lockheed Martin Canada announced the signing of a contract with the Government of New Zealand for the upgrade of the Royal New Zealand Navy's two ANZAC Class frigates. This represents significant growth for the company internationally as this is an export from one of the company's operations outside of the US to another customer outside the U.S.2. Lockheed Martin has agreed to terms with Israel where the country is buying Lockheed's information technology services.3. Lockheed Martin UK is pursuing the export their turret system designed for armored fighting vehicles internationally.4. Even though the F-35 has been fraught with issues, at this point 11 different countries are expected to purchase the fighter . According to reuters the U.S. will lead the way with the purchase of 2,443 fighters in total, while Britian, Turkey and Austrialia all have orders that are for 100+ fighters.At current levels the United States is spending more than 3.5x as much as any other country on defense. U.S. defense spending equates to ~38% of all military spending globally, but as many countries are looking to increase spending and the U.S. is looking to keep spending increases flat for the foreseeable future creating a global web of investments outside the U.S. looks to be a logical plan for growth.Cash FlowFree Cash Flow = Operating Cash Flow - Capital ExpenditureOver the past three and a half years, Lockheed Martin has been able to sustain positive free cash in every year. Even though 2012 represented the beginning of a new cycle and the lowest level of cash, the company now has ~$4.108 billion. With that cash the company is looking at repurchasing shares and continue to increase its dividend.LMT data by YChartsValuationIn the section below I will use the Discounted Cash Flow valuation model to estimate the current value of Lockheed Martin's shares as well as using the model to estimate future valuations.I believe using the Discounted Cash Flow valuation model for Lockheed Martin to be fair, because DCF analysis can help one see where the company's value is coming from and can generate an opinion based on that.Using the DCF above, there are a couple of results based on the projected earnings of Lockheed Martin.1. Based on Q2 numbers, the stock is still undervalued.2. Based on the rest of the year earnings growth of ~5%, disregarding any share buybacks in which management stated they would do, I have a value of $186.39 per share, or ~11.17% higher than the current stock value of $167.66.3. Based on the rest of the year earnings growth of ~10%, disregarding any share buybacks, I have a value of $195.18 or, ~16.42% higher than the current stock value of $167.66.4. Analysts at 4-traders have a FY 2014 target EBITDA of $6.595 billion. With that estimate, I have a valuation of ~$192.78.Based on the valuations above, I have the company trading at 10.17x EBITDA. This is based on the different business trading at different valuations. Within the different businesses, I have the Aeronautics and Mission Systems trading at 11.23x EBITDA. 11.23x EBITDA is the industry average for Aerospace / Defense while the remaining segment trade at 9.47x EBITDA which is the industry average for communications and information systems.In my opinion concentrating on a global platform will mitigate some of the risks that the company faces. As this is a very competitive business has possesses many different types of risk, focusing on International military spending should will mitigate domestic risk but also add foreign risk. As military spending is expected to increase in Asia and the Middle East being part of this growth will drive increased investment and innovation which will impact all global militaries, thus leading to more opportunities for Lockheed Martin.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

LMT is engaged in the design, development, and production of advanced systems. The company operates in five segments, Aeronautics, Information Systems, Missiles and Fire Control, Mission Systems, and Space Systems.Recent Share ActivityLMT shares have remained strong rising with the overall market yet remaining well bid over the recent, albeit modest, market sell-off. Currently, the shares trade towards the higher end of their 52-week range of 121 - 171.36. LMT shares currently have a dividend of 3.15%LMT data by YChartsValuationOur valuation analysis looks at LMT from a relative perspective, comparing LMT's metrics to both the large cap S&P 500 index and the Industrial Sector.On a dividend yield basis LMT is substantially ahead of the overall market and industrial sector with a yield of 3.15% versus 1.98% for the S&P 500 and 2.04% for the industrials sectorOn a trailing earnings basis LMT trades in line with the S&P 500 earnings multiple with a PE ration of 17.5 versus 17.61 for the index. LMT trades at a trailing earnings discount to the industrials sector that has a PE of 18.19.LMT is highly attractive on a forward earnings basis trading at 15% discount to both the S&P 500 and Industrials sector. LMT's forward PE is just 14.0 versus 16.5 for both the S&P 500 and Industrials. However, LMT's projected earnings growth rate is lower than the S&P 500 and Industrial Sector.In analyzing the above we find it helpful to view the forward PEG ratio that measure the cost of future earnings growth. We note that LMT's PEG ratio of 1.49 is right in line with both the S&P 500 and Industrials sector with ratios of 1.4 and 1.45 respectively.From a valuation perspective we find LMT highly attractive given the discount to both the market and sector on a forward basis and attractive PEG ratio.Income InvestorsFor income investors the emphasis is on the company's dividend yield, stability, and preservation of capital. LMT has a long history of paying and increasing dividends. LMT maintains a strong balance sheet and ample ability to service debt with Debt to EBITDA ratio of just over 1. LMT has ample capability to cover dividend payments that amount to just over half of annual earnings. From a qualitative standpoint the company operates in a highly competitive yet stable industry. Often government contracts are long term in nature and given many of the required security protocols for defense contracts substantial barriers to entry exist.LMT Dividend data by YChartsOverall we recommend LMT shares for income investors noting the shares have a highly attractive dividend yield, strong relative valuation, and are highly stable with little likelihood of a dividend reduction.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Through June 30, 2014, the company had total sales of nearly $22 billion across its 5 business segments: aeronautics, information systems, missile and fire control, mission systems and space systems. However, Lockheed Martin may soon add environmental systems to that list after their latest technological innovation. Engineers at Lockheed Martin have developed an advanced water filtration system that has the ability to revolutionize water treatment centers and, in particular, desalination plants across the world.The company's recently acquired patent for Perforene Filtration Solutions drastically reduces energy requirements for desalination plants. The graphene membrane was developed by placing holes that are one nanometer or less in diameter. These holes are large enough to allow water to pass through but small enough trap all other salts and minerals. At only 1 atom thick, it takes much less energy to push seawater through the filter with the force required to remove the salt from the water. John Stetson, an engineer at Lockheed Martin, said,Stetson said, the Perforene filter would be the thickness of a piece of paper compared to current filters which are about half a foot thick.Source: Huntington Beach Desalination FacilityHigh Cost of Clean WaterThe problem with desalination plants has been the extremely high energy cost required to generate clean water from seawater. Desalinated water costs on average double the cost of water obtained from a reservoir or recycling wastewater, according to a 2013 study by the Department for Water Resources. While previous advancements in technology have lowered the cost of power used to desalinate seawater from 114 kWh/1,000 gallons in 1979 to 14 kWh/1,000 gallons of fresh water today, energy costs still account for typically 20-30% of the total cost of desalinated water. Lockheed Martin's new Perforene filter has the potential to drastically cut the cost of energy use and in turn make desalination plants much more economically viable.Desalination MarketDesalination plants operate in more than 120 countries, including Saudi Arabia, Oman, Spain, Greece, Italy, India, China, Japan, Australia and the US. Over the past 40 years, the amount of potable water produced by desalination plants has skyrocketed to over 3.5 billion gallons per day. Today, more than 2,100 desalination plants operate around the world. The Middle East accounts for over 50% of capacity and North America accounts for 17%. Most recently Tampa Bay, Florida opened its desalination plant that can provide up to 25 million gallons of drinking water per day to residents. Currently, California has 15 desalination projects proposed along the coast from Los Angeles to San Francisco. A $1 billion desalination plant in Carlsbad is scheduled to open in 2016 and provide up 50 million gallons of drinking water per day in San Diego County.Source: Huntington Beach Desalination FacilityAs drought continues to linger in California and the majority of the southwest United States, local governments are increasingly looking toward desalination to fill the void. Reservoirs and lakes in the southwest are declining at extremely rapid rates. It was recently reported that Lake Mead, created by the construction of the Hoover Dam, hit its all-time low in July and is only 39% full. Over 40 million people in Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Phoenix rely on water from Lake Mead. At its current rate, officials fear long-term impacts from the continued decline could eventually force cities to look elsewhere for water supplies.Source: US Drought MonitorBrackish WaterLuckily for cities, not by the coast, there are alternatives that can take advantage of the desalination process. Roughly half of the world-wide desalination capacity uses brackish water, which is found deep underground in vast reservoirs. Before brackish water can be used must go through the same desalination process as seawater. Currently, San Antonio is in the process of building the nation's largest brackish water desalination plant, which will be operational by 2016 and at its peak capacity will supply 30 million gallons of water per day.Perforene filter's opportunityLockheed Martin's newest innovation comes at a perfect time from a marketing and distribution standpoint. Cities across the US and the world are scrambling for new sources of drinking water to supply growing populations and increasingly are turning to desalination as the best solution. If the Perforene filter can reduce energy cost in the desalination process by 100 times, as the company claims, the filter will be widely accepted as a pioneering breakthrough that can revolutionize water security.However, Lockheed still faces a number of challenges in commercializing this filter. Working with a material just one atom thick is very difficult to not tear and ramping up production to the size and scale needed has been a challenge. Lockheed expects to have a prototype by the end of 2014 that could be used as a replacement for filters now used in reverse osmosis plants. The company is looking for partners to help manufacture the filter in the 2014-2015 timeframe.ConclusionLockheed Martin is an incredibly successful company that has found profitable businesses in a variety of different areas. The Perforene filter has the opportunity to become another successful venture for the company. While the desalination market is world-wide and rapidly expanding, successful commercialization of this product has limitless opportunities. Lockheed management has already acknowledged additional areas where the Perforene filters could be utilized, such as dialysis and cleaning chemicals from water used in fracking.The filter won't have a significant impact on earnings for at least the next 2 years and probably 5 years, based on the difficulty to mass produce something so technologically advanced it has never been made before. But long-term shareholders should be encouraged by the continued diversity at Lockheed Martin. The company isn't sitting on its heels, milking its military defense contracts. Instead it's going after breakthrough advancements in clean water technology. Technology companies that don't evolve, eventually become extinct. The Perforene filter has the potential to handsomely reward shareholders down the line, by becoming the industry leader in advanced filtration technologies.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2393255,57152,2014-08-07T04:31:12-04:00,"Too much dependency on the U.S. government could be a potential downside.The Middle East conflict could play a critical role in countering the lower earnings expectations.An unexpected venture might rescue the company, but it'd be too soon to bet on it.","Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) identifies itself as a global security and aerospace company that primarily specializes in the research, design, development, and integration of advanced technology systems, products, and services. The company operates at a global level, and serves both domestic and international customers.The company is correctly labeled as too dependent on the U.S government for its sales. For instance, in 2013, 82% of its total net sales of $45.4 billion were from the U.S government, including 61% sold to the US Department of Defense alone. The remaining 17% were from international customers, mostly in the form of foreign military sales contracted through the U.S. government, and 1% were from U.S. commercial and other customers (SEC filings, quarterly report).Systematic Reduction in Defense Budget by U.S. Government is Expected in the FutureAs the U.S. tried to shy away the aftermath of the financial crisis of around 2008-2010, there has been ever-increasing pressure on the government to take steps towards monetarism and away from Keynesianism. This strategy has been put into action through the continued quantitative easing program by the Federal Reserve. This was a strategic move to revive the U.S. economy sooner than later. To further aid the policy, the U.S. government was put under pressure to reduce its defense spending levels. Pursuant to this narrative, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was passed by Congress. The Act established limits on discretionary spending on armaments to reduce spending levels by $487 billion over a 10-year period that began with government fiscal year 2012. The Budget Control Act also provided additional spending restrictions known as sequestration. These were put into effect on March 1st, 2013. According to these restrictions, spending would be reduced by an additional $500 billion over the next nine years. This amounts to $987 billion taken from the defense spending budget over the next 8 years of the 10-year program.However, in December 2013, Congress approved the Bipartisan Budget Act, which revised the budgetary limitations on defense spending to provide for an additional spending fund of about $22 billion for fiscal year 2014 and $9 billion for fiscal year 2015. However, it must be noted that the revised budget maintained the statutory limitations for the period of 2016-2021 in accordance with the Budget Control Act. Thus, these limitations could prove to be a considerable restraint on the company's revenues for the coming years.Armaments Supply to Middle Eastern Countries:However tragic the current situation in the Middle East might be, this could somewhat stabilize earnings for Lockheed Martin. This is because the turmoil has made these countries more cautious and wary of the upcoming precarious circumstances. To start with, Iraq has just signed an agreement with the U.S. to purchase 5,000 hellfire missiles valued at approximately $0.7 billion. These missiles are only developed by Lockheed Martin, and thus, it presents an opportunity for potential earnings. Similarly, there is an ongoing deal worth $6.8 billion with Saudi Arabia. Also, the U.S. has recently signed an agreement worth $11 billion with Qatar for Patriot missiles and Apache helicopters. Both of these are products only developed by Lockheed Martin. Thus, as a primary contractor of the U.S. Department of Defense, Lockheed Martin has reasonable short-term potential to increase its revenues and earnings.Efforts to Commercialize its Desalination Water System:Keeping an eye on the reduced earnings potential from the U.S. armaments sales, in the long run, the company is investing in the R&D of a product that varies from the company's portfolio. The project is to desalinate sea water and make it fit for drinking. In the wake of restrictions, the company has already made a breakthrough by registering patents of its water desalination system.The system utilizes a membrane developed by placing holes that are one nanometer or less in thickness in a graphene membrane. These holes are small enough so as to stop impurities, while improving the flow of water molecules through the holes, thereby leading to less clogging and pressure on the membrane. As the graphene membrane is only one atom thick, quite strong, and durable, it makes the system more effective and less costly.Given the fact that access to clean drinking water is going to become more critical in the future, techniques like this will become very important in providing potable fresh water. However, there is one important obstacle in translating this potential growth opportunity into tangible earnings: the commercialization of the system to produce clean water at a large scale. Right now, the company is looking for partners to commercialize this project, but it might take longer than anticipated to transform this opportunity into a practical reality.Final Thoughts:In my opinion, Lockheed's business segments with shorter-duration contracts such as Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS) are prone to taking the biggest hit from the budgetary constraints. On the other hand, it is evident that the hit to operating results will lag in certain businesses with longer cycles, such as Aeronautics and Space Systems, Missiles and Fire Control ""MFC"", and Mission Systems and Training (MST) segments due to production contract backlogs. But if the situation remains unaltered, these segments will see major declines in earnings.Therefore, for those who are currently long on the stock, I'd recommend holding the stock to gain from the short-term potential. However, for those who haven't entered yet, I wouldn't opt for buying the stock for the long term. A quick in-and-out strategy might be more beneficial, as holding the stock for longer maturities would mean betting on U.S. politics instead of the dynamics of the stock.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by APEX Financial Consultants.

2310675,50792,2014-07-11T11:01:17-04:00,Lockheed Martin is an excellent investment due to a multiple positive investment measures supported by many awarded contracts.The company has been successful at earning contracts based on its diverse range of products despite the “sequestration”.The potential upside outweighs the risks of investing in LMT currently and this is supported by a bullish mid & long-term algorithmic forecast.,"Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has consistently delivered positive earnings surprises with an average beat of just over 20% over the last four quarters. Shares have left the terminal and are on the tarmac getting ready for take off due to emboldening first quarter numbers that have allowed management to increase its operating profit, cash from operations and earnings per share forecast for 2014 with the international mix projected to rise to 20% of total sales this year. In 2013, Lockheed Martin's net sales were $45.4 billion.Shareholders on this flight have already been rewarded with share repurchases and incremental dividends including seventy-eight percent or $1.6 billion of a record $2 billion in free cash flow in the first quarter. Shares will soar because the largest U.S. defense contractor Lockheed Martin has a platform-centric focus that assures a continual inflow of follow-on orders from its leveraged presence in the Air Force, Army, IT, and Navy programs. We expect clear skies as the I Know First self-learning algorithm based on predictive analytics also has a bullish signal for this aerospace and defense behemoth, as well as LMT has a mean price target of $170.56 from 18 brokers on Yahoo! (YHOO) finance. Lockheed Martin's diverse range of products have allowed this company to win multiple contracts mainly from the U.S. Department of Defense (NYSEARCA:DOD), varying from big to small, despite the ""sequestration.""The Final FrontierRecognizing the potential in this market, Lockheed has increasingly invested in R&D and acquisitions in order to strengthen its satellite product coverage. As such, the company is anticipated to acquire Zeta Associates Inc., in the next quarter as it already acquired Astrotech Space Operations, a company specializing in prelaunch processing of satellites in May of 2014.The US Air Force has also recently awarded a contract for the sustainment of the reentry subsystem for the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) system to Lockheed Martin. In this contract, the company will provide support through maintenance engineering, aging surveillance, modification of subsystems and equipment, software maintenance, developmental engineering, production engineering, repair and procurement of the MMIII RS/RV Subsystems. Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company ICBM and advanced programs vice-president Doug Graham stated, ""this new contract will enable us to directly apply our specialized expertise to more effectively support this critical national mission area."" The RS/RV contract has a one-year base performance period valued at $109 million with options for an additional four years and a total potential value of $452 million.GEO-5 & The GEO-6This past June, Lockheed Martin also earned a $1.86 billion contract from the US Air Force to complete production of the Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (NYSE:GEO) satellites, the GEO-5 and the GEO-6 through Sep 30, 2022. Lockheed is the prime contractor of these satellites under the military's Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) program. SBIRS is designed to provide the United States with an early warning of ballistic missile launches plus other tactical intelligence. Jeffrey Smith, vice president of Lockheed Martin's Overhead Persistent Infrared mission area stated, ""this contract is the third part of a thoughtful acquisition strategy aimed at further reducing cost and cycle time for GEO-5 and GEO-6, while still providing exceptional data to the warfighter."" This system gives the President of the United States, the Secretary of Defense, combatant commanders, the intelligence community and other key decision makers reliable and accurate missile warnings and infrared surveillance information.The GEO-1 and GEO-2 satellites have both received Air Force Space Command Operational Acceptance in 2013 and have performed above its requirements in some cases. The GEO-3 is currently undergoing acoustic and thermal vacuum testing at Lockheed Martin's Sunnyvale, California satellite manufacturing facility and is on schedule for delivery at the end of 2014. The GEO-4 recently entered final assembly, integration and testing. The SBIRS program is at the forefront of our national security and further demonstrates the U.S. military's confidence in Lockheed Martin technology and its reputation as an aerospace and defense industry leader.Clean-up On Isle SpaceAside from designing the super advanced fighter jets and helicopters that keep our air force at the forefront of aerospace and defense technology, Lockheed Martin will also help protect our skies by monitoring the vast junkyard of debris orbiting our planet. The company is tasked with developing a surveillance system called ""Space Fence"" awarded by the Air Force for a $914.7 million contract. Space missions from the last half-century, have left behind objects such as lost astronaut equipment, spent rocket stages and dead satellites still cruise high above at great speeds. For this reason, the surveillance system will greatly enhance the current ability to track cosmic debris. Dana Whalley, the government's program manager stated, ""previously, the Air Force could only track and identify items the size of a basketball…with the new system, we'll be able to identify items down to the size of a softball. This will significantly increase our capability.""The current system in place now is outdated to say the least, and could certainly use an update. In fact, it has been in use since 1957 when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik. The current system called the Space Surveillance Network is a worldwide network of 25 space surveillance sensors that use radar and optical telescopes. Space Fence will utilize uninterrupted radar pulses to detect, track and determine the orbits of such objects. It essentially forms a pulse-field fence with a higher wavelength frequency that objects would pass through. Many of the debris travel in clouds of celestial debris and can cause tremendous damage to the International Space Station and other important satellites we rely on. This floating wreckage can be thought of more as bullets traveling at speeds of up to 17,000 mph. About 22,000 objects are at least the size of a softball and hundreds of thousands smaller objects clog up the low earth orbit region.A study from the National Research Council in 2007, warned that the amount of space debris was at a ""tipping point."" The main problem is due to objects colliding with each other at such great speeds, creating many smaller ones in a domino effect. There were two big collisions in recent years that have dramatically added to the problem. The first was the 2007 Chinese anti-satellite test and the second was when an active U.S. commercial satellite that accidentally collided with a defunct Russian satellite in 2009. According to a Congressional Research Services report from January 2014, orbital debris is a threat to the United States national security interests in space. Figure 1 shows a computer-generated image by NASA from the perspective outside geosynchronous orbit . Ninety-five percent of the objects in this illustration are orbital debris (non-functioning satellites). Note that the orbital debris dots are scaled according to the image size of the graphic to optimize their visibility and are not scaled to Earth. The population of objects over the northern hemisphere is due mostly to Russian objects in high-inclination, high-eccentricity orbits.Prerequisites for every launch, whether it's spy satellites, sending up astronauts, or digital television satellites, include being prudently synchronized for the reason of not being destroyed by the minefield of orbiting debris. Clearly there is a need for clean up of the dangerous objects floating above but the global community has decided that before a solution can be proposed, experts need to have a better understanding of the situation and assess the risk. This is where Space Fence comes in. Lockheed will begin production on the system in six months and it is expected to be operational by 2018.Lockheed Martin will break ground at Kwajalein Atoll, an island located more than 2,400 miles southwest of Honolulu. It will be made up of small antennas clustered into an area about the size of a basketball court and will all sit under a dome made of Kevlar on Kwajalein Atoll. There is also an option for a follow up contract to create a second radar installation in western Australia. Steve Bruce, a Lockheed vice president of space systems stated, ""the Air Force wants to protect its assets in space…We'll be able to help them with that."" The actual solution to the vast amount of space junk may even become a contract for Lockheed Martin years down the road, although this is merely speculation.Joint ProjectsThe company also landed a $1.28 billion joint project with the U.S. Air Force to build combat rescue helicopters with United Technologies Corp.'s Sikorsky Aircraft unit based in Connecticut. The Lockheed Martin-Sikorsky team will also build the next generation of presidential helicopters for a deal with the Navy worth $1.2 billion.Another joint project Lockheed Martin is also working on is with the professional services contractor GCS, for a task order worth $400 million from the General Services Administration. The GSA works to enhance operational efficiency of government services toward the public. Together Lockheed Martin and GCS will predominantly modernize specialized applications, platforms and systems, as well as advance technical architecture development, security and software development services.Turbulence To Be ExpectedWhile Lockheed Martin has been successful at being awarded multiple contracts, investors should also take the negative factors into consideration. Lockheed Martin recently received a controversial $420 million tax break. The problem surrounding this issue is a $55 billion Air Force contract to build the next generation of bombers, which is also being sought by Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Northrop (NYSE:NOC). Lockheed requested tax credit to help make the Boeing bid more attractive to the Pentagon as it would be a major Boeing subcontractor on the project but Northrop cried foul, stating that there was last-minute favoritism was at play in Sacramento. Senate Appropriations Chairman Kevin de Leon (D-Los Angeles) criticized stating that it ""exclusively focused for the benefit of one company.""LMT shares also took a hit recently when it was reported that one of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter's engines caught on fire on June 23rd. An investigation into the issue has led to the grounding of the entire F-35 fleet. This can become a problem, as the $399 billion weapons program will miss out on appearing in different airshows. While the fire was from an engine on a F-35A, the Marines may decide to allow the F-35B jump-jet models to make the trip and fly at the airshows.Bullish Algorithmic Prediction For Lockheed MartinI Know First utilizes an advanced self-learning algorithm based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and incorporates elements of Artificial Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms in order to model and predict the flow of money in almost 2,000 markets from 3 days to a year. As such, we promote algorithmic trading coupled with a vigilant risk management strategy and fundamental analysis for avant-garde investment strategies designed to mitigate maximum amount of risk as well as to optimize potential returns. Just to be clear, this is not high frequency trading and the differences are explained here.The market prediction system is entirely empirical and not based on human-derived assumptions. This system can also be referred to as a ""Big Data"" solution for Wall Street by incorporating popular types of convergence averages and moving averages that have been traditionally used to forecast assets with complex and intelligent algorithms that can make these predictions more accurate and efficient.The human factor is limited to building the mathematical framework and initially presenting the system with the ""starting set"" of inputs and outputs, which is also utilized for recognizing every other market opportunity. The algorithm then repetitively proposes ""theories"" and recurrently tests them automatically on years of daily market data. It then validates them on the most recent data, which prevents over-fitting. By separating the predictable part from stochastic (random) noise, the algorithm is able to create a model that projects the future trajectory of the given market in the multi-dimensional space of other markets. The output of the predicted trend is a number, known as the signal, which is used by traders to identify entry and exit points in the market. While the algorithm can be used for intra-day trading, the predictability tends to become stronger over longer time horizons, such as the 1-month, 3-month and 1-year forecast, making this market prediction system ideal for longer-term trading.The color-coded forecast is very easy to read, where green indicates a bullish signal and red indicates a bearish signal. Deeper greens signify that the algorithm is very bullish, and vice-versa for deeper reds. The signal is the number flush right in the middle of the box and the predicted direction (not a specific number or target price) for that asset, while the predictability is the historical correlation between the prediction and the actual market movements. In other words, the signal represents the forecasted strength of the prediction, while the predictability represents the level of confidence. These are two independent indicators, but consider both as you make your own analysis. Figure 2 shows an algorithmic prediction for LMT from 3 months ago. Algorithmic traders utilizing our Best Dividend Stocks Forecast received this forecast. The components of this forecast are the best stocks identified by the algorithm that also carry a dividend. Ticker symbols for other assets have been removed; however, you can still see their signal and predictability.In accordance with the algorithmic forecast, LMT rose 1.65% over the stated time horizon. LMT had a signal of 3.67 and predictability of 0.28 in the April 9th 3-month forecast. Comparing the algorithmic performance from the forecast above to the most contemporary forecast is an excellent strategy for rationalizing your expectations utilizing algorithmic trading as one instrument in your analysis process. Figure 3 shows the current algorithmic prediction for LMT in the 1-month, 3-month and 1-year time horizons.The signals in this most contemporary forecast are much stronger than the signal above in the April 9th 2014 forecast. This is even the case for the current 1-month time horizon forecast. LMT consistently stays in the deeper green parts of the heat map, demonstrating the bullishness of the algorithm. The general coloring of the heat map helps give algorithmic traders another indicator of confidence in the forecast. For instance, a heat map that is predominantly green should give supplementary assurance in the forecasted assets.ConclusionThese bullish signals should give investors some assurance that LMT shares will rise further over the stated time horizons. Algorithmic traders utilize these daily forecasts as a tool to enhance portfolio performance, verify their own analysis and act on market opportunities faster. We never recommend blindly purchasing assets that are endorsed by the algorithm without your own additional analysis. Lockheed Martin stands to be a strong investment while the sustainability of this 5-year bull market is being questioned, which is elaborated further by my colleague.The company has a beta of 0.62, strong stock price performance, an enticing dividend, it has shown its ability to increase in net income, growth in earnings per share and cash flow from operations as well as its noteworthy return on equity. Earnings growth for instance played a significant role over the past year, increasing share value over 45% and beating the S&P 500 return over the same time frame. During the past fiscal year, Lockheed improved its bottom line by earning $9.04 versus $8.34 in the prior year with expectations of further improvement in earnings to $10.94. The company has also been able to increase net income from $761 million to $933 million year-over-year, an increase of 22.6%. In summation, based on the convergence of these encouraging investment measures supported by the awarded contracts, some of which mentioned here plus the algorithmic forecast based on predictive analytics, makes LMT currently a buy.Business disclosure: I Know First Research is the analytic branch of I Know First, a financial services company that specializes in quantitatively predicting the stock market.

2279933,23479,2014-06-20T20:45:23-04:00,"Lockheed Martin's 2013 top line fell by 4% annually to $45.4 billion due to the U.S. government’s across-the-board spending cuts, called sequestration.Lockheed, which generates more than 80% of its revenues from government contracts, will likely be challenged in driving its growth.We figure a ramp-up in the F-35 fighter jet’s production and international sales are the two biggest growth opportunities for Lockheed in the coming years.We currently have a stock price estimate of $164 for Lockheed, approximately in-line with its current market price.","Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) 2013 top line fell by 4% annually to $45.4 billion due to the U.S. government’s across-the-board spending cuts, called sequestration. In the current year, due to flat defense spending from the government, the company anticipates its top line will decline further to about $44.8 billion, at the mid-point of its revenue forecast range. Now, in our opinion, U.S. defense spending will likely continue to remain weak through this decade due to budgetary pressures. The Budget Controls Act of 2011 requires defense spending cuts totaling $500 billion over a ten-year period that began in 2012. So Lockheed, which generates more than 80% of its revenues from government contracts, will likely be challenged in driving its growth. In such a tough environment, what are Lockheed’s two biggest growth opportunities? We figure a ramp-up in the F-35 fighter jet’s production and international sales are the two biggest growth opportunities for Lockheed in the coming years.We currently have a stock price estimate of $164 for Lockheed, approximately in-line with its current market price.Planned Hike In The F-35′s Production Rate Will Help Lift Lockheed’s Top LineThe F-35 program, which is Lockheed’s single largest program constituting around 16% of its overall revenues, is currently producing fighter jets at a low rate. This is because the program is in its initial stages with the development of the F-35 still progressing. However, in the coming years, the company plans to scale up F-35′s production to full rate. We figure this will help return Lockheed’s top line to growth trajectory after 2014. This hike from low-rate initial production to full-scale production will also help Lockheed generate cost savings through improved production efficiencies. So, apart from lifting its top line, this planned ramp-up in the F-35′s production will also help improve Lockheed’s margins.Additionally, the F-35′s development is on track with completion expected in 2019. The company will likely also get to produce around 3,000 F-35s, in-line with the initial plan, as the U.S. government has on many occasions said that it will buy its promised share of about 2,400 F-35s and international orders for the jet are continuing to flow in.International Sales Also Present A Big Growth Opportunity For LockheedRising international sales, including those for the F-35, is the second big growth opportunity for Lockheed, in our opinion. Until a few years back, Lockheed was generating more than 85% of its revenues from the U.S. government. But that percentage has steadily come down in recent years as Lockheed began to focus on the international market in response to the flat-to-declining defense spending from the U.S. government. The company currently targets to generate 20% of its overall revenues from the international market within the next few years. And we figure this figure is achievable as international orders already constitute around 25% of the company’s backlog.Recently, South Korea said that it would buy 40 F-35s in a deal valued at approximately $6.8 billion. Post this announcement, the country joined the U.K., Norway, Netherlands, Italy, Israel, Turkey, Australia and Japan in the group of countries, apart from the U.S., that have placed orders for the F-35. Many other countries, notably those from the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE, have also shown an interest in acquiring the F-35. However, in our opinion, sales of this advanced jet to these countries do not look feasible in the near term due to Israeli concerns. Overall, Lockheed anticipates selling about 600 F-35s to international buyers, and we figure this number is achievable given the high international interest in this program. Apart from the F-35 program, Lockheed is also seeing strong international demand for some of its other products such as missile defense systems, command & control systems and littoral combat ship (LCS). Growth from these products will help grow Lockheed’s international sales, which are currently being driven by the F-16 fighter jet, C-130J strategic airlift aircraft, and certain missiles and missile defense systems.However, many challenges face Lockheed in its attempt to grow its international sales. The company has to contend with U.S. government stipulations, which require prior permissions before export of defense equipment. In the past, the government has placed restrictions on the export of some of Lockheed’s highly advanced products such as the F-22 Raptor. Lockheed’s international sales are also affected by the purchasing government’s relationship with the U.S.. Many countries such as China that are not U.S. allies are restricted from the export of sophisticated military equipment. So, even though China is the second biggest defense spender after the U.S., and many of Lockheed’s defense products are likely desired by Chinese defense forces, Lockheed cannot export its advanced defense products to the country.Additionally, Lockheed competes with many international defense equipment manufacturers, such as BAE Systems (OTCPK:BAESF), Airbus (OTCPK:EADSY) and Finmeccanica (OTCPK:FINMY), some of who are not as intensely restricted by their governments as Lockheed on technology transfer. Such companies hold a competitive advantage over Lockheed if the purchasing country insists on technology transfer while awarding a contract. These challenges however, in our opinion, will shave off only a small portion of Lockheed’s potential international military sales. So, despite these challenges, we figure Lockheed will be able to grow its international sales in the coming years driven by its advanced and wide portfolio that will capitalize on the rising military spending from many countries, especially those from the Middle East.Disclosure: No positions."

The company had to undergo restrictions regarding its F-35 jets implemented the US Defense Department, causing a holdup in what is known to be the most expensive project in the world. The F-35A has a value of $98 million, F-35B $104 million and F-35C is valued at $116 million.The company is a huge contractor for US defense as it provides a range of fighter planes, missiles, satellites, shields and is a major player in the international market as far as the military spending by various countries is concerned. The restrictions caused the nonappearance of these fighter jets at two of the famous Airshows, Farnborough Air Show and the Royal International Air Tattoo preventing them from showcasing their capabilities.Lockheed's standing in the marketCurrent valuation of the company is highly dependent on the sales it makes with the international investors. Lockheed's revenue generation from the U.S government in the past few years has accounted for 85%. But due to low spending from the Defense Department, the company focused on its international sales and is predicted to generate around 20% of its total revenue from it in the near future. Since Lockheed's backlog constitutes 25% of international orders, the target would not be a hard one to achieve.Various countries of the world are spending on military equipment which provides a great opportunity for Lockheed's to advance its growth through fulfillment of international orders. Increasing demand can be seen in Asia and the Middle Eastern countries. Even though there's huge competition lined up for Lockheed along with restraints from the government which are not faced by other competitors regarding defense contracts and transfer of technology but the company has an impressive collection of military equipment that would still keep it strong rival in the race for international sales. Finmeccania, BAE Systems (OTCPK:BAESF), and Airbus (OTCPK:EADSF) are the major contenders against Lockheed.Lockheed's prospects as restrictions are easedLockheed earns about 17% of overall revenues through the F-35 program. In the years to come, Lockheed's revenues would have a greater share occupied by the F-35 program, as the company is planning for the jet's production to be accelerated. Currently the program is in the preliminary stages, which is why it has a low rate of production, but scaling up this project is in the works. US government contracts help the program generate most of its sales, which is why the government's recent low spending on the project has made the company vulnerable. Higher cost savings can be generated if the production is set to full scale which would definitely put Lockheed in the front line as F-35 program would help improve the company's margins as well. Presently the company's valuation heavily depends on the project as it drives the growth of the company which can be assessed from the quarter results announced in June where Lockheed's profits lifted despite the low spending from US defense department.Since F-35 is costing the department a fortune, Lockheed is entered into an agreement with the defense department to check the affordability of the F-35 program. As the decision to cut the prices down to $80 million or less are circulating, it is expected that international sales would increase as many countries showed their reservations on the price earlier; this re-planning would turn out to benefit of the company. With 3,000 fighter jets in the making, Lockheed would now find meeting its initial target a much easier task. The US itself is expected to obtain 2,400 pieces, while the rest would be up for grabs by countries like Turkey, the UK, Israel, South Korea, Australia, Norway, Japan, the Netherlands, and Italy, which have already placed their orders with Lockheed for the F-35's procurement.ConclusionOn 22nd August 2014, Lockheed Martin stock was observed to have traded at $175.10 with a dividend yield of 3.04%. The prospects are already looking hopeful, as the company's standing is better than that of a few months ago. Lockheed did receive an ease in restrictions earlier as well for speed testing and maneuverability, but thorough investigation - which could go on for years into the F-35 project - is needed, as it is paramount for the company to step up its game as a frontrunner in the US national security."
2249963,24491,2014-06-03T01:52:43-04:00,"The defense industry will face challenges in coming years as a result of competing budget priorities.However, that doesn't mean Lockheed's dividend growth potential is not stronger than ever.The company's ratio on the Dividend Cushion is nearly 2. Let's take a look at the shares.","It's often easy to overlook shares of the defense contractors because of competing budget priorities in Washington. However, the recent foreign policy issue with Russia has re-ignited interest in the defense group, and we think the industry is generally well-positioned to serve investors seeking dividend expansion. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), in particular, has a very healthy dividend yield (3.3% at the time of this writing) and a very strong Valuentum Dividend Cushion ratio. Let's take a look at the shares.Defense Industry OverviewThe defense industry is home to a number of large defense contractors - General Dynamics (NYSE:GD), Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), and Raytheon (RTN) - that have significant project/intellectual know-how, long-term customer/government ties, and widespread integration expertise that cannot be easily replicated by many smaller contractors. This gives established, large defense contractors a leg up on bidding for new government contracts and optimizing the margin profile for many through cost-cutting and productivity enhancements. Still, competing budget priorities within the overall US budget and within the US defense budget itself will pose both challenges and opportunities for much of the group.However, long-term cyber-security and national security risks aren't going away, and this will ensure that the group has a steady share of funding in the US and opportunities on the international market for many years to come (and arguably into perpetuity). Though we very much prefer commercial aerospace exposure at this juncture - meaning, on a fundamental basis, we like Boeing (NYSE:BA) the most out of the large defense contractors - we do applaud the healthy balance sheets, and free cash flow characteristics of the large defense contractor constituents. This bodes particularly well for future dividend increases across the industry, even if overall defense spending may be pressured in coming years.Lockheed Martin's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsValuentum's Dividend Growth ReportPlease select the image below for our assessment of Lockheed's dividend growth potential.Dividend Safety/CushionWe assess the safety of a firm's dividend by adding the company's net cash to our forecast of its free cash flows over the next five years. We then divide that sum by the total expected dividends over the next five years. This process results in our Dividend Cushion™ ratio. A Dividend Cushion™ above 1 indicates a firm can cover its future dividends with net cash on hand and future free cash flow, while a score below 1 signals trouble may be on the horizon. And by extension, the greater the score, the safer the dividend, as excess cash can be used to offset any unexpected earnings shortfall. Lockheed Martin scores a 1.8 on our Dividend Cushion™, which is GOOD.Dividend GrowthWe judge the future potential growth of the dividend by evaluating the capacity for future increases, as measured by the Dividend Cushion™, and management's willingness to consistently raise the dividend, as measured by the firm's dividend track record. Lockheed Martin registers an EXCELLENT rating on our scale, and we think the firm's annual dividend will be $8.14 per share within the next several years (please view lower left table in the picture above).Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Lockheed Martin's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 41.1%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.1%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead, based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Lockheed Martin's free cash flow margin has averaged about 5.6% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Lockheed Martin, cash flow from operations increased about 6% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 3% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Lockheed Martin's shares are worth between $114-$170 each. Shares are trading at $164 each at the time of this writing. On the basis of the fair value range, we're not expecting much more pricing upside. However, that doesn't mean shares aren't a fantastic dividend growth idea. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's LOW ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers.The estimated fair value of $142 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 15.7 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 11.7 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 1% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of -0.3%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 12.5%, which is above Lockheed Martin's trailing 3-year average. We think revenue will face pressure in the near term, but the company's lofty backlog will continue to provide support. Ongoing efficiency improvements and cost-cutting efforts will drive profit margin enhancement over the five-year discrete forecast period.Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.3% for the next 15 years, and 3% in perpetuity. For Lockheed Martin, we use a 10.1% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows. We think both of these measures are appropriate for a company of Lockheed's size.We understand the critical importance of assessing firms on a relative value basis, versus both their industry and peers. Many institutional money managers -- those that drive stock prices -- pay attention to a company's price-to-earnings ratio and price-earnings-to-growth ratio in making buy/sell decisions. With this in mind, we have included a forward-looking relative value assessment in our process to further augment our rigorous discounted cash flow process. If a company is undervalued on both a price-to-earnings ratio and a price-earnings-to-growth ratio versus industry peers, we would consider the firm to be attractive from a relative value standpoint. For relative valuation purposes, we compare Lockheed Martin to peers Boeing and General Dynamics, among others.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $142 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets, as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety, or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Lockheed Martin. We think the firm is attractive below $114 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $170 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Lockheed Martin's fair value at this point in time to be about $142 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Lockheed Martin's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $176 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $142 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Last year, the reduction in U.S. government spending, called sequestration, negatively impacted Lockheed's financial performance. However, the projected cost to develop and produce Lockheed's F-35 fighter increased 1.9% last year, or $7.4 billion, to $398.6 billion. Going forward, the DoD will purchase around 2,443 Lockheed F-35 jets by the late 2030s, which will strengthen the company's long-term growth potential. It is expected that the DoD will further increase its spending budget in the next five years ending in 2019. The U.S. DoD's budget is forecasted to have additional funds of around $115 billion compared to the authorization under sequestration.Lockheed will benefit from this increase in the DoD defense budget as the U.S. government will allocate these funds to its top priority area, and the F-35 fighter jet program is part of this priority program. For achieving its long-term growth target the company is raising its F-35 jet production rate. It is expected that by 2018-2019 the F-35 program will account for 25% of the company's total revenue compared to 16% in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 14% in 2012. This will help Lockheed improve its long-term growth outlook.Signing contracts to build its earning base strongerLockheed received contracts worth a total of $875 million or around 84% of the total contracts signed by the DoD in the first-quarter of this year. This includes the largest order of $698 million, in which the company will provide the long lead parts, material, and components that are required for the production of F-35 jets. The company is expected to complete this order through May 2015. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter will be a long-term credit positive for the company.With its wide experience in developing fighter jets, Lockheed also signed a contract of $54.6 million with the DoD. In this contract, the company will provide manufacturing and technical support to the U.S. Navy, Air Force and other international partner governments related to the production of F-35 jets. Lockheed will complete this contract by the beginning of next year. Recently, 11 countries across the globe are expected to buy the F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin under $398.6 billion weapons program. This will increase its F-35 jet sales and also support the company in achieving its expected international sales from 17%, or about $8 billion to 20% in the next year or so.Apart from the F-35 program, the company also signed a long-term contract of $245.8 million with an option for additional ""Global Positioning System III, or GPS III SV 07, and 08. GPS III satellites will have three times better accuracy and eight times improved anti-jamming capabilities, which will increase the spacecraft usable life by 25% compared to the previous GPS block. The company will complete this contract in April 2018 for SV 07 and October 2018 for SV 08.Recently, Lockheed has won a government contract of $915 million to build a space fence in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean. The company will build a high-frequency radar system, which by 2018 should be able to track 200,000 orbiting objects. Astronomers will be then able to track space debris, tag it, and monitor it as it passes through the radar. Analysts will then inform the Air Force to warn operators to move space-craft before possible collisions. It is very likely that Lockheed could also be contracted to build another phase of the space fencing in Australia at some point in the future.In addition, Lockheed has also signed three contracts with the U.S. DoD of more than $606 million as shown in the following table: -All these contracts will support Lockheed's top-line and boost its future growth prospects.Continuous cost-cutting measuresOver the past five years, Lockheed has continuously taken cost-cutting measures to face the defense spending pressures. The company is making strategic changes in its operations like reduction in headcount and plant consolidations to enhance its operating margins. The company has massively reduced its headcount over these years from 146,000 to 115,000, and will continue it this year too. Lockheed reduced its facility footprint removing around 7.2 million square feet since 2008. Last year, the company eliminated 2.1 million square feet of facility space through its plant consolidation strategy.Lockheed's first-quarter results also gained from these cost-cutting measures. In the first quarter, Lockheed expanded its segment operating margins to 13.4%, from 10.1% in the prior year period. Margins rose across four of the company's five segments. In order to continue strengthening its margins, Lockheed will vacate its leased facilities in Goodyear, Arizona and Akron, Ohio as well as shut down its owned facilities in Newtown, Pennsylvania and Sunnyvale, California by mid-2015. The company will consolidate 2.5 million square feet by next year. These facility consolidations will reduce around 4000 headcounts by 2015. Savings from these cost-cutting measures allowed Lockheed to enhance its 2013 operating margin by 50 basis points annually to 9.9%.Source: Company DataIn the light of cost-cutting measures, Lockheed expects its 2014 EPS to grow in the range of 16%-19.5% year over year to $10.50 to $10.80 per share.Strong FCF and DividendLockheed has strong free cash flow. It generated strong cash from operations, or CFO in 2013 ($6.8 billion before $2.25 billion of pension contributions). During the first-quarter it again reported strong CFO of $2.1 billion. Free cash flow (CFO less capital expenditures and dividends) was $2.2 billion in 2013. According to Fitch Ratings, Lockheed's FCF will be fairly steady in the next few years, with higher net pension recoveries offsetting higher capex and dividends.For dividends, Lockheed maintained a consistent strategy of returning at least 50% of FCF to shareholders. Dividends now exceed $1.5 billion annually, and Fitch expects these to rise at double digit rates. For second quarter of 2014, Lockheed announced dividend of $1.33 per share. With its decent dividend payout ratio of nearly 52% in 2013, Lockheed provided long-term growth opportunities to growth investors. The company has increased its year-over-year dividend by around 15% in the last two years, and it is expected that with the dividend payout ratio of 52% for 2014, the company may declare a dividend of around $5.32 per share for this full year.Dividend History of Lockheed MartinConclusionThe improvement in U.S. defense spending and the series of contracts from the DoD for the maintenance and development of its F-35 program are the revenue drivers for Lockheed Martin. Also, developing the new GPS III satellite and other contracts will generate long-term growth opportunities for the company. Along with these contracts, its cost-cutting strategies will help Lockheed to further enhance its operating margins. The company also has strong free cash flow and robust dividend history. All these points suggest that Lockheed Martin's stock has bright growth prospective for long run.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2246543,25120,2014-05-30T15:58:17-04:00,"Lockheed acquires Astrotech to boost its Space System business.The deal hardly moves the needle for Lockheed, but confirms that the company will continue to look for interesting additions.Astrotech will sell its main operations for a price tag that approximates its current market valuation.","Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) made a bolt-on acquisition for its Space Systems market, which shows that the company remains committed to the business.While the deal is too small to move the needle for Lockheed, the implications are huge for investors in selling firm Astrotech (NASDAQ:ASTC), creating potentially interesting trading opportunities in the weeks ahead.The Deal HighlightsLockheed Martin announced that it has reached an agreement to acquire the Astrotech Space Operations business from Astrotech. The company will spend some $61 million for the acquired assets. The size of the deal is very small to Lockheed Martin, with the costs of the purchase amounting to just twenty cents per share.The unit provides satellite launch preparation services, which range from final testing, fueling and encapsulation on launch day.Since 1981, the business has contributed to 300 successful missions both domestically as well as internationally. Customers include the US government and private firms as well as international agencies. The business is located in Florida very close to the famous Cape Canaveral.The deal is expected to close as soon as the third quarter of this year following which the assets will become part of Lockheed's Space Systems division.Implications For AstrotechThe deal is huge for Astrotech, whose shares have been all over the place recently. Shares traded at just $0.75 per share in the fall of last year to spike to levels approaching $4 earlier this year.Following announcement of the deal, shares jumped from $2.25 to intraday highs of $4.59 per share on Thursday, to end the trading session at $3.16. Interestingly enough, based on that closing price, the market valuation of the business is now equivalent to the reported price tag.The company will use the proceeds from the sale to focus on other growth opportunities including the development and fulfillment of the detect mass spectrometer product line. Yet note that the major operations of the company have been sold in this transaction and that losses might increase going forward.While the company operates with a roughly flat net cash position ahead of the deal, Astrotech is reporting modest losses while developing these new growth opportunities. This hardly makes initiating a long position in the stock a no-brainer.Implications For Lockheed MartinThe deal adds little in terms of revenues to Lockheed, which reports trailing annual revenues of $44.9 billion, although sales have been declining in many of its business divisions. Despite pressure on topline sales, trailing earnings at little over $3.1 billion are higher than ever.Within Lockheed, the acquired business will be placed under the Space Systems business unit, a business that generates about a sixth of total revenues as reported by Lockheed over the past quarter.While the actual financial and operational implications are negligible, it shows that the company remains focused on its space operations. For a long time, Lockheed and Boeing (NYSE:BA) have been dominant suppliers to the industry through their United Launch Alliance venture. The market is now on the verge of being disrupted by the likes of SpaceX and Virgin Galactic, among others.Takeaway For InvestorsThe deal, of course, has the biggest implications for Astrotech, with the deal value being equivalent to the firm's current market capitalization. As a matter of fact, shares traded slightly lower halfway during Friday's trading session (at the time of submission), which values the company slightly less than the proceeds of the sale.The deal will probably continue to determine trading in an anticipated volatile environment in the coming weeks.While management claims the deal is good for shareholders, and it probably is, the company is now left without operational revenues, although it does hold a huge pile of cash, which is roughly equivalent to its current valuation. However, investors should note that the company is likely to bleed cash going forward with no revenues to report.For Lockheed, the deal is tiny, although the company is committed to making more smaller acquisitions. At $163 per share, the defense giant now holds a market valuation of $52 billion, excluding a net debt position of around $3 billion. Shares now trade at around 16-17 times trailing earnings. Despite worries about defense cuts, shares have risen more than 50% over the past year.Without a doubt, the $1.33 per share quarterly dividend, which provides investors with a 3.3% dividend yield, has been a major boost to the share price with investors in Lockheed looking for yield.I would not jump on the bandwagon at Lockheed on the back of the deal, although trading in Astrotech could be much more volatile and interesting in the coming weeks. If shares trade at a deep enough discount to the cash position, with shares trading around $2.50 or less, an opportunistic trading opportunity might present itself.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Our proprietary analysis determines where sufficient prices and activity exist to imply credible forecasts of coming prices. Today that includes 2,455 issues.That forecast population is reduced to 1500+ where we have daily forecasts for at least the prior 3 years. From them then we cut to the 200 or so that both offer an 8% upside price change (or more) prospect, and have averaged at least +8% gains in the next 3 months following all prior forecasts with upside-to-downside balances similar to today's.A final cut is made to 55 issues (this time) where at least 8 out of every 10 of such forecasts produced gains. The top 10 of those 55 are based on their Reward-to-Risk ratios, where reward is the upside price change offered by today's forecast, and the risk is measured by the maximum worst case price drawdowns average of all the similar prior forecasts.Our Defense & Aerospace interest here is on Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK), the Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Lockheed martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX). These have all long been institutional objects of attention but have rarely been seen by market-makers with so disproportionate upside to downside prospects as are currently pictured I column (7). The Range Index measures what proportion of the forecast range between (2) and (3) lies below the Price Now in (4).As an example of the advantage of the active investment approach advocated by this approach, instead of the buy & hold style of investing, let's look at perhaps one of the best B&H equivalents of the Dow Jones 30 Index, LMT. Both have long-term average price growths of +20% per year.(used with permission)LMT's prior experiences following Range Indexes of 12 have (all 9, or a win odds of 100/100) produced average gains of +10.3% in holding periods of 27 market days, or 5½ calendar weeks. Such short-term capital commitments permit compounding the capital's employment in other opportunities when they can be found at an annual rate of 147%, or seven times the productivity of a buy & hold strategy.Moreover, during the 27-day holding periods the worst-case drawdowns averaged less than -1%, compared to -6% for the a buy and hold of LMT, or a -5% in the DJIA.A number of other Aerospace & Defense issues do not share the price appeal currently being afforded to these well-known issues, so it is not apparent that there is any broad-scale group attention movement afoot.Another dramatic comparison can be found in Alliance Data Systems (NYSE:ADS), a marketing information provider, where prior Range Index experiences this uncommon has caused 10% gains in 28 days to generate +136% annual rates, with only -2.2% worst-case average price drawdowns.These examples may be indicative of other institutional favorites getting priced up to a point where so little upside is seen in them by either the market-makers or their clients that other alternatives become more competitive.But that is far from all bad. In all but the worst markets there usually are many very productive alternatives to the spotlight-seeking stocks or ETFs. Being able to screen a large population on a highly comparable basis provides a continuing parade of attractive investment candidates for further inspection.Now just because these issues have performed well in the past does not provide any guarantee they will repeat this time. Several qualify on the basis of small samples, but they are drawn from five years of forecasts, so that speaks to the selectivity present.The investor is reminded of his self-obligation to perform the due diligence required to live with his/her internal remonstrations when capital cost bases are under water.The knowledge that in the preponderance of cases such discomforts have turned into satisfactions hopefully will suitably strengthen investor resolve when it is most needed.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Furthermore, the rich growing dividend represents a gratifying income.The CompanyLockheed Martin is the world's largest military weapons maker. The company provides advanced technology systems, products and services to the U.S. government and international defense customers. The company was founded in 1909 and is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland.Valuation MetricsThe table below presents the valuation metrics of LMT, the data were taken from Yahoo Finance and finviz.com.LMT's valuation metrics are pretty good; the forward P/E is low at 14.03, the Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio is also low at 9.88, and the average annual earnings growth estimates for the next 5 years is high at 8.88%. However, the debt to equity ratio is high at 1.28.Latest Quarter ResultsOn April 22, Lockheed reported its first-quarter 2014 financial results, which beat EPS expectations by $0.34 (13.40%) and missed on revenues. The company reported first quarter 2014 net sales of $10.7 billion, compared to $11.1 billion in the first quarter of 2013. Net earnings in the first quarter of 2014 were $933 million, or $2.87 per diluted share, compared to $761 million, or $2.33 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2013. Cash from operations was $2.1 billion in the first quarter of both 2014 and 2013.In the report, Chairman, President and CEO Marillyn Hewson said:Dividend and Share RepurchaseLockheed has been paying dividends since 1984, the forward annual dividend yield is high at 3.27% and the payout ratio is at 50.4%. The annual rate of dividend growth over the past three years was very high at 21.9%, over the past five years was very high at 21.2%, and over the past ten years was also very high at 23.5%. I consider that besides dividend yield, the consistency and the rate of raising dividend payments are the most crucial factors for dividend-seeking investors, and LMT's performance has been impressive in this respect.Source: Charles SchwabIn the first quarter of 2014 the company generated cash from operations of $2.1 billion, repurchased 7.0 million shares for $1.1 billion, compared to 5.1 million shares for $461 million in the first quarter of 2013, and paid cash dividends of $444 million, compared to $371 million in the first quarter of 2013.CompetitorsA comparison of key fundamental data between Lockheed and its competitors is shown in the table below.There is not a big difference between Lockheed's valuation metrics and those of its competitors. However, Lockheed has the highest dividend yield among the stocks in the group.LMT's Efficiency and Return on Capital parameters have been much better than its industry median, its sector median and the S&P 500 median, as shown in the tables below.Source: Portfolio123RankingAccording to Portfolio123's ""Balanced4"" powerful ranking system LMT's stock is ranked second among all Russell 1000 stocks that pay a dividend with more than 3% yield; only Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) has a higher ranking (see my SA article about CSCO). The ""Balanced4"" ranking system is quite complex, and it is taking into account many factors like; EPS consistency, technical analysis, valuation, profitability ratios and dividend information. Back-testing over fifteen years has proved that this ranking system is very useful.Technical AnalysisThe charts below give some technical analysis information.Chart: finviz.comThe LMT stock price is 0.36% below its 20-day simple moving average, 0.83% above its 50-day simple moving average and 11.81% above its 200-day simple moving average. That indicates a long-term uptrend.Chart: TradeStation Group, Inc.The weekly MACD histogram, a particularly valuable indicator by technicians, is negative at 0.97 and almost fix, which is a neutral signal (a rising MACD histogram and crossing the zero line from below is considered an extremely bullish signal). The RSI oscillator is at 58.79 which do not indicate oversold or overbought conditions.Analyst OpinionMany analysts are covering the stock, but their opinion is divided. Among the twenty-three analysts, four rate it as a strong buy, three rate it as a buy, fifteen rate it as a hold, and one analyst rates it as an underperform.TipRanks is a website that ranks experts (analysts and bloggers) according to their performance. According to TipRanks, among the analysts covering LMT stock there are only five analysts who have the four or five star rating, two of them recommend the stock, two others have a hold rating, and one analyst has a sell rating on the stock.Major DevelopmentsOn February 24, the Pentagon said it would shrink the U.S. Army to pre-World War Two levels, and reduce military benefits in order to meet 2015 spending caps, setting up an election-year fight with the Congress over national defense priorities. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, previewing the Pentagon's ideas on how to adapt to government belt-tightening, said that the defense budget would be the first to look beyond 13 years of conflict, shifting away from the long-term ground wars like Iraq and Afghanistan.Since Lockheed derived 82% of its net sales in 2013 from the U.S. government, the decision to reduce the nation's defense budget might be harmful to the company. However, the company still had a massive backlog of $79.6 billion at the end of the first quarter, and it plans to reduce the impact of the decreasing U.S military budget by increasing its international sales. According to the company, it is looking to grow international sales to at least 20% of its revenues in the next years.ConclusionLockheed Martin has good valuation metrics and strong earnings growth prospects, and it increased its 2014 outlook for operating profit, earnings per share, and cash from operations. Furthermore, LMT stock is ranked second among all Russell 1000 stocks that pay a dividend with more than 3% yield according to the ""Balanced4"" powerful ranking system. Lockheed is generating strong cash flow, and it returns value to its shareholders by stock buyback and by increasing dividend payments. All these factors bring me to the conclusion that LMT stock is a smart long-term investment. Furthermore, the rich dividend represents a gratifying income.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2227623,54532,2014-05-20T09:40:29-04:00,Lockheed Martin is switching focus to foreign sales to fill in the sales gap left by the US.The US defense market accounts for more than 80% of Lockheed Martin’s sales.The stock offers an excellent dividend yield and share repurchases keep the EPS growing even if the top line stays flat.,"The sustenance of revenues at Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE:LMT), one of the world's largest military contractors, - is being questioned in the wake of the reduced US military budget. However, the company has found ways to continue to be profitable and continue creating value for shareholders. In this post, I will detail why damage control measures from Lockheed Martin are effective enough to keep investors interested in the stock.Impact from US Budget CutsAs per the Budget Control Act of 2011, US defense spending is to be reduced by $500 billion over a period of nine years starting 2013. This has already resulted in a $37 billion drop in defense expenses for the government fiscal year ending September 2013. The move weighs heavily on Lockheed Martin, as the US government is the single biggest customer for the defense contractor, single-handedly accounting for most of its sales. Lockheed Martin operates in five segments, and the US government - along with its agencies, departments and contractors - is the largest buyer for each of these segments. The table below illustrates the US government's share in net sales for FY 2013 concluding that they made up 83.2% of the total net sales in 2013.Source: Lockheed Martin 2013 Annual ReportThe significance of US sales in Lockheed Martin's net sales for FY 2013 can be estimated from the graph presented below.So, the decrease in planned military spending is bound to hit Lockheed Martin's revenues. The company's annual sales for 2013 reflected a 4% YoY decline compared to a 1.5% YoY hike in 2012 as shown below in the excerpt from the 2013 annual report.Source: Lockheed Martin's 2013 Annual ReportFor 2014 and ahead, the reduced US orders are already on the cards. In March 2014, the Pentagon announced their plan to buy only 34 F-35s in 2015, eight less than the 42 expected earlier. In April 2014, the Pentagon mentioned they would be buying 19 fewer fighter jets between 2016 and 2019 as a result of spending cuts passed in 2011.Will Lockheed Martin Still be Able to Keep Sales on Track?So, the drop in US sales has impacted sales and will continue to be a factor in the coming years. In February 2014, the company reported that its net sales for FY 2014 are expected to stay flat or slightly decline for all segments due to US budget cuts, except for Aeronautics where a higher turnover of F-35s is likely. However, that is not the end of the world. I expect the sales to sustain or drop only slightly in 2014 due to two main reasons:1. International OrdersIn 2013, Lockheed Martin made about 17% of their total sales to international customers. Now, however, the company sees a shift in strategy with a greater emphasis on international markets including the sale of F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, JSF, jets. The F-35s are the company's largest selling product accounting for 16% of its net sales. Foreign sales will also help bring down the cost of jets.In April 2014, the Australian PM announced that the country would order 58 more F-35 JSFs for $11.61 billion. South Korea's arms procurements agency in March 2014 stated it would buy 40 F-35 jets in a $6.8 billion deal that is expected to close in Q3 2014. In May 2013, the Turkish government said it has decided to order two F-35 fighters as the first order from the country's already-announced plan to buy 100 joint strike fighters from Lockheed Martin for $16 billion. The company may also receive orders from Singapore, as currently Singapore is evaluating the jets for purchase. So, overall, foreign sales are going to provide a good relief to Lockheed Martin's revenues going forward and at the same time will diversify its risk profile.2. Backlog CushionThe company had a bulky backlog of $82.6 billion at the end of 2013. This is worth 22 months of production. Backlog converts to sales in future periods as orders are completed and deliveries are made. Lockheed Martin expects to convert $35.4 billion of this backlog to sales inside 2014. So, keeping in mind the thick volume of unfulfilled orders any immediate or drastic impact on the company's top line is unlikely.Attraction for ShareholdersNow that I have explained why sales should not be dented greatly by the budget cuts in the US let us turn to other factors of interest to investors. Other than exploring foreign markets the company is responding to the loss in sales from the US by cutting costs. In November 2013, the company announced a plan to close and consolidate a number of facilities and cut up to 4000 jobs. The move is hoped to weigh well on profitability.The company is generously rewarding shareholders with buybacks and dividends. In September 2013, the company decided to increase its share repurchases by $3 billion. The schedule of repurchases however has been left to management. In Q1 FY 2013, Lockheed Martin repurchased 7 million of their 319 million shares for $1.1 billion. The company has revised its 2014 EPS guidance to $10.5-$10.8 from $10.25-$10.55 compared to $9.13 for 2013 reflecting a significant 17% increase in EPS at midpoint of the guidance. As far as dividends go, the company posted its 11th consecutive year of double-digit dividend growth and now boasts a dividend yield of 3.2%.RecommendationWith such complete dependence on the US for its revenues the US military budget constraints will keep the sales growth in check. While foreign markets will help it is unlikely that they will completely offset the decline from the US, at least in the short term. So, during this transition period of shifting focus from domestic to international markets the role of the backlog will be important.The stock offers an excellent dividend yield and share repurchases keep the EPS growing even if the top line stays flat. So, despite the fact that Lockheed Martin is far from growth in the short term it is a stock that dividend lovers may consider having in their portfolio.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

        LMT is attractively valued given a modest discount to the industrial sector on both a trailing and projected earnings basis.
        LMT dividend stability is highly attractive given a conservative balance sheet and payout.","Recently Citi Equity Research released an updated list of global bond refugee stocks. Stocks with higher dividends and lower volatility as an alternative to bond investments. Among companies making the cut is Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) with a current dividend yield of 3.3%. Below we continue our review of LMT in Part XIV of this series, evaluating LMT from a relative value and dividend stability perspective. Glyndon Park Bond Refugee Ratings:Overall Bond Refugee Rating: Highly AttractiveRelative Valuation: AttractiveDividend Stability: Highly StableBackgroundLMT engages in the development and design of advanced technology systems for industrial, defense, aeronautical, space, and other commercial applications.StrategyLMT is a leading defense contractor and leverages longstanding core capabilities to continually develop advanced systems for military and government usage. As a leading defense contractor there are a limited number of competitive threats and bidding while highly competitive generally allows for reasonable rates of return. Key threats to LMT are largely political, whereby reduced military or other government spending could have a substantial negative effect.LMT generates a significant amount of free cash flow and in addition to dividends has committed to repurchasing outstanding shares. The company noted in their most recent earnings release that shares outstanding have been reduced 31% from their peak.ValuationLMT has a market capitalization of $52.3 billion, enterprise value of $53.3 billion with a current trailing PE of 17.9 and projected PE of 14.1.LMT trades at a 15.5 % premium to the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) on a trailing earnings basis and modest 3.7% on forward earnings.

2033913,21835,2014-02-20T08:05:11-05:00,,"Linked here is a detailed quantitative analysis of Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE:LMT). Below are some highlights from the above linked analysis:Company Description: Lockheed Martin Corp., the world's largest military weapons manufacturer, is also a significant supplier to NASA and other non-defense government agencies. LMT receives about 93% of its revenues from global defense sales.Fair Value: In calculating fair value, I consider the NPV MMA Differential Fair Value along with these four calculations of fair value, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:1. Avg. High Yield Price 2. 20-Year DCF Price 3. Avg. P/E Price 4. Graham NumberLMT is trading at a premium to all four valuations above. Since LMT's tangible book value is not meaningful, a Graham number cannot be calculated. The stock is trading at a 25.6% premium to its calculated fair value of $129.71. LMT did not earn any Stars in this section.Dividend Analytical Data: In this section there are three possible Stars and three key metrics, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:1. Free Cash Flow Payout 2. Debt To Total Capital 3. Key Metrics 4. Dividend Growth Rate 5. Years of Div. Growth 6. Rolling 4-yr Div. > 15%LMT earned two Stars in this section for 1.) and 3.) above. A Star was earned since the Free Cash Flow payout ratio was less than 60% and there were no negative Free Cash Flows over the last 10 years. LMT earned a Star for having an acceptable score in at least two of the four Key Metrics measured.Rolling 4-yr Div. > 15% means that dividends grew on average in excess of 15% for each consecutive 4 year period over the last 10 years (2004-2007, 2005-2008, 2006-2009, etc.). I consider this a key metric since dividends will double every 5 years if they grow by 15%. The company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since 1995 and has increased its dividend payments for 12 consecutive years.Dividend Income vs. MMA: Why would you assume the equity risk and invest in a dividend stock if you could earn a better return in a much less risky money market account (MMA) or Treasury bond? This section compares the earning ability of this stock with a high yield MMA. Two items are considered in this section, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:1. NPV MMA Diff. 2. Years to > MMALMT earned a Star in this section for its NPV MMA Diff. of the $9,281. This amount is in excess of the $2,300 target I look for in a stock that has increased dividends as long as LMT has. If LMT grows its dividend at 15.0% per year, it will take 1 year to equal a MMA yielding an estimated 20-year average rate of 3.68%. LMT earned a check for the Key Metric 'Years to >MMA' since its 1 years is less than the 5 year target.Memberships and Peers: LMT is a member of the S&P 500 and a member of the Broad Dividend Achievers™ Index. The company's peer group includes: Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA) with a 2.3% yield, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) with a 2.0% yield and United Technologies Corp. (NYSE:UTX) with a 2.1% yield.Conclusion: LMT did not earn any Stars in the Fair Value section, earned two Stars in the Dividend Analytical Data section and earned one Star in the Dividend Income vs. MMA section for a total of three Stars. This quantitatively ranks LMT as a 3-Star Hold stock.Using my D4L-PreScreen.xls model, I determined the share price would need to increase to $272.12 before LMT's NPV MMA Differential decreased to the $2,300 minimum that I look for in a stock with 12 years of consecutive dividend increases. At that price the stock would yield 2.0%.Resetting the D4L-PreScreen.xls model and solving for the dividend growth rate needed to generate the target $2,300 NPV MMA Differential, the calculated rate is 10.4%. This dividend growth rate is less than 15.0% used in this analysis, thus providing a significant margin of safety. LMT has a risk rating of 2.25 which classifies it as a Medium risk stock.LMT is the largest defense contractor in the world and dominates next-generation defense platforms. It owns supply contracts for key programs such as the F-35, which assures the company multiple years of revenue. In spite of spending cuts, the company continues to receive contracts from the Dept. of Defense. The company continued to grow its backlog in the 4th quarter and generate strong cash from operations. Going forward, its varied product offerings, operating execution and cost reduction measures will help the company sustain its profitability.The company improved its free cash flow payout to 47%, down from 73% in August 2013 when it was last reviewed. Its debt to total capital improved to 56% from 90% in August 2013. LMT is trading at a premium to my calculated fair value of $129.71. Given its improvements, I will look for an opportune time to add to my position.Full Disclosure: At the time of this writing, I was long in LMT (0.6% of my Dividend Growth Portfolio). See a list of all my dividend growth holdings here.Disclaimer: Material presented here is for informational purposes only.

1959211,21151,2014-01-22T08:07:18-05:00,,"I truly enjoy the month of January as it is usually the time when I have extra cash to fund my retirement investment account. This year, I’m adding $5,000 to my pot. In addition to this amount, I have over $1,500 that was waiting in an US index fund that I will use to buy new stocks. Instead of waiting on a pile of cash, I usually invest my dividend payouts in an index fund. This is a good method to diversify a few hundred bucks at a low cost that benefits from any market upside. I would rather do this than earn 1.25% in the money market.Last Monday, I published a stock analysis of Gluskin Sheff (NYSE:GS) and told you recently that I added this company to my dividend holdings. Today, I’m talking about another addition to my portfolio: Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). Once again, this is a stock that made my Best 2014 Dividend Stocks book.Please also note that LMT is part of many of our Dividend Stocks Rock Portfolios and according to January’s results, we beat our benchmark 8 times out of 10 over the past 5 months. Take a look at what Dividend Stocks Rock has to offer.Lockheed Martin Business Description:Lockheed Martin is engaged in the research, design, manufacturing and integration of advanced-technology products. It operates through 4 segments; Aeronautics, Electronic systems, Information systems & Global solutions and Space systems. In other words, Lockheed Martin is one of the biggest defence contractors in the world.It is important to note that LMT shows 80% of its revenues coming from the US government. In other words; if the government cuts its defence budget, chances are LMT revenues will be cut accordingly.LMT Stock GraphLMT surged in 2013 but it doesn’t mean that the stock doesn’t have any upside potential anymore. In fact, it is being traded at a relatively fair P/E ratio (fwd at 14.39). The reason why the stock is so high is also directly in line with its Earnings per Share growth:When a company is making more money, it’s only normal to have a higher value!LMT Dividend Growth GraphWhen I look at the dividend growth rate of a company, I also like to look at how other metrics react. I’ve combined the dividend payouts, payout ratio, EPS along with annual revenues to see if the trend was strong. See for yourself:Everything is pretty much going through the roof at the moment, even taking into account the US Government reducing their expenses.The Company Ratios and Financial Info:The company is showing a strong ability to turn its revenues into higher profits. While its revenues are growing slowly, LMT is able to both increase its profit and dividend payout. There is a strong will to keep pushing the dividend payout higher. If you hold this stock long enough, your dividend yield based on cost of purchase will soon hit 5%.Lockheed Martin Upcoming opportunities and dangers:LMT benefits from a leadership position while many governments feel the urge to improve their security. The diversification of its income stream is almost equally divided into their 4 segments (29%, 31%, 22%, 18%) and offers them 4 different playgrounds to provide defence products. Over 2013, they consistently beat analysts’ estimates and are already focused on consolidation projects to reduce costs. This only means more profit for the future.The worst that could happen to LMT is a massive cut in the US budget. Since about 80% of its revenue comes from Government contracts, this remains a great risk. As we can see, sales growth is far from astonishing, but it’s the price to buy a well established company in a mature market. Overall, I still believe many countries will require defence help in the future and Lockheed Martin is definitely the leader they will turn to buy more services.Final Thoughts on Lockheed MartinThis company has been on my radar for the past three years. In fact, each time I did my Best Dividend Stock for the year book, LMT appeared in my screeners. Why have I waited so long? Well… I guess I just didn’t have enough liquidity to buy all the stocks on sale 3 years ago!I also like the fact that I’m adding a new sector to my asset allocation in buying an industrial stock. There is nothing like diversification to make good returns on the market!What do you think of LMT? Is it a buy for you? Disclaimer: I own shares of LMT."

If we also include the dividend, then the total shareholder return for the company becomes around 91% in the last year. In comparison, Boeing, Raytheon and Northrop Gruman Corporation gave total shareholder returns of about 76.5%, 80.75% and 84.19%, respectively.Consistent share buybacks and dividend paymentsWith its share buyback activities, Lockheed Martin has ensured decent shareholder returns beyond just the stock returns. In 2013, the company paid back around $3.3 billion in the form of dividends and share repurchase activities, resulting in a shareholder yield of around 11% with respect to the market cap of the company at the start of 2013.Source: company presentationThe company has given back cash well over 50% of its goal.

The company also witnessed an EPS increase of 8% year-over-year and to maintain book-to-bill ratio of 1.01 in 2013, i.e., the ratio of orders received to sales. With this, the company was able to grow its backlog to the highest level. The overall financial result has met the company's expectations. Driven by good financial performance, Lockheed Martin has a positive outlook for the year 2014.ValuationSource: Morningstar.comUpon review of the valuation multiples above, Lockheed Martin seems overvalued with respect to the Price/Book and Price/Cash flow multiples compared to others in the industry. However, if we compare it using the most-followed valuation multiple, which is P/E, it is still lower than the industry average. Because the stock seems overvalued on the majority of multiples, the big question arising here is whether the stock will be able to continue the growth momentum. In my opinion, Lockheed Martin still has the potential to provide lucrative capital gains in the future. I am still bullish on the stock because of the strong fundamentals.The frontrunner in the industryLockheed Martin remained top in the weapon sales ranking, despite the rise in Russian production. The success of the companies in the aerospace industry depends on contracts from the Pentagon, despite this, the company has decided to ""go green"" for a cleaner tomorrow. To enhance the availability of alternative energy solutions, Lockheed Martin has signed a contract with Victorian Wave Partners to begin developing the world's largest wave energy project. The company announced its partnership with the alternative energy supplier to develop the world's largest project harnessing wave energy. The project is expected to produce enough power for 10,000 homes by 2018 and will be developed off the coast of Victoria, Australia. The project will involve partnership with Ocean Power Technologies (NASDAQ:OPTT), a company that focuses on the concept of converting wave energy into clean energy with the bobbing movement of a buoy. The process will produce mechanical energy that will drive an electrical generator and transmit power through an underwater cable.Recently, Rolls Royce entered into a deal with Lockheed Martin worth $1 billion, which calls for a delivery of 600 engines to power C-130J Super Hercules military transport aircraft. As a result of this agreement Rolls Royce will be able to secure its AE 2100 as the engine of choice until 2035 for all the variants of C-130J. According to Lockheed Martin, this agreement will provide its customers with the world's most affordable air lifter.Lockheed Martin is also partnering with Aerovironment (NASDAQ:AVAV) to enhance the market for the Aerovironment-built drone. Aerovironment is to supply the Pentagon with small, hand-launched drones including the Raven, Wasp and Puma models. The deal between the two companies was announced at the Defense Expo in India and was focused on collaboration of Aerovironment's massive Global Observer aircraft, which has the ability to robotically take on the work performed by satellites. The major objective of this deal would be to identify global customers of the product and convince them about its utility. The deal will lead to integration of Lockheed Martin's mission systems, ground systems and technology with Aerovironement's aircraft, increasing the opportunities for both companies in the development of unmanned aircraft.Final takeawayLockheed Martin promises good returns to its investors,and has always been active in creating value for its shareholders. The recent deals and partnerships indicate that the stock will continue to achieve its revenue and operating profit targets. Moreover, through consistent share repurchase activitites and dividends payment activities, it has established itself as an investor's dream. I give a buy recommendation on the stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1975941,25120,2014-01-29T09:05:16-05:00,,"Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) reported a solid set of fourth-quarter results last week, but the weaker revenue guidance for 2014 and further market correction resulted in some significant profit taking by investors.Strong payouts to investors and a focus on operational efficiency boosted shares over the past year, despite continued pressure on defense budgets. The strong payouts to investors have boosted the appeal to dividend-oriented investors. After the strong returns, I remain on the sidelines.Fourth Quarter HighlightsLockheed Martin reported fourth-quarter revenues of $11.53 billion, down 4.5% compared to last year, but ahead of consensus estimates at $11.3 billion.Net earnings fell by 14.2% to $488 million, with GAAP earnings coming in at $1.50 per share on a diluted basis. Earnings missed consensus estimates at $1.95 per share badly on the back of ""one-time"" charges including severance and goodwill impairment charges. Backing out these effects, and profitability came in ahead of expectations.Looking Into The Earnings ReportThe decline in sales for the fourth quarter does not come unexpected after sales have been under pressure for a while with the US military and defense budget facing continued pressure.All 5 major segments of the business reported a decline in revenues. Aeronautics revenues were down by 5.9% to $3.90 billion on the back of fewer airplane deliveries. Despite the drop in revenues, margin pressure was modest with operating margins falling by just 10 basis points to 10.6% of total revenues.Information systems sales fell by 4.5% to $2.10 billion as margins dropped by 20 basis points to 9.0% of total revenues.Missile and fire control revenues are down by 9.2% to $1.72 billion on the back of increased competition and a strained defense budget. Yet the business saw very strong margin gains with operating margins improving by nearly 6 percent points to 20.3% of total sales.Mission systems and training sales fared relatively the best, falling by just 0.3% to $1.86 billion. The business managed to grow operating earnings by 140 basis points to 11.5% of total salesFinally, the space systems business reported revenues of $1.96 billion which is down by 2.2% on the year before. Here, margins improved by 140 basis points as well to 13.0% of total sales.Despite solid margin improvements across the business, reported earnings were down. During the final quarter, Lockheed Martin cleaned up some of its affairs taking $195 million in goodwill impairment charges and another $171 million in severance charges.While Lockheed is still very much tied to defense and military spending, it has some diversified operations, at least in terms of revenue diversification as can be seen below. Unfortunately many of these end markets are positively correlated, at least to some extent.2013 In ReviewThe past year has not been a great one for Lockheed with revenues falling by 3.9% to $45.4 billion. Despite the fall in top line revenues, earnings inched up by 8.6% just shy of $3 billion, with earnings totaling $9.13 per diluted share.Note that most of the special charges related to goodwill impairment and severance payments were limited to the fourth quarter results of last year.Looking Into 2014For the current year, Lockheed Martin anticipates orders of $41.5 to $43.0 billion. Combined with the current sales outlook of revenues between $44 and $45.5 billion, which assumes that sales could come in between flat and minus 3% compared to 2013, this implies an order-to-sales ratio of 0.94.Despite the softer than expected order intake, the backlog remains solid at $82.6 billion, increasing by some $300 million on the year before. At the current pace of revenues, the backlog represents 1.8 year's worth of sales.Despite the continued pressure on the top line numbers, Lockheed Martin sees operating earnings between $5.175 and $5.325 billion. This should translate into earnings per share of $10.25 to $10.55 per share.Strong Price ActionLockheed Martin has posted revenues of around $45 billion in recent years, but is facing some pressure on the top line in 2013 and 2014, on the back of defense spending cuts. The US still makes up roughly 80% of total revenues.Yet the company made great achievements in boosting operational efficiency in recent times. Earnings came in between $2.5 and $3 billion in recent years which was combined with solid payouts to investors.Lockheed recently hiked its quarterly dividend to $1.33 per share, providing investors with a great 3.6% dividend yield after paying out more than 55% of total earnings. On top of these sizable share repurchases, the company retired more than 10% of its shares outstanding in the past three years.The pressure of all these payments on the balance sheet remains limited. Cash and equivalents stands at $2.6 billion, while Lockheed has $6.2 billion in debt outstanding. One thing to notice, Lockheed holds nearly $10 billion in pension liabilities on its balance sheet.At $147 per share, the market values Lockheed at $47 billion, or about 15-16 times past year's earnings, a ratio expected to come down to 14 times this year.These greater payouts and focus on profit improvements, boosted and fueled the share price despite spending cuts. After shares traded in a $70-$90 trading range in recent years, shares have witnessed a 60% return over the past year.Takeaway For InvestorsLockheed's past returns have made the stock historically pricey as the valuation has been driven by earnings improvements rather than topline growth. After the strong recent performance, the valuation is not rich in absolute terms, but is a bit steeper in historical terms.Besides earnings improvements, higher payouts have boosted appeal to investors as well as the company pays out a cool 3.6% yield, accompanied by further share repurchases.The outlook for modest declines in revenues, shows the environment will be tough going forward even as defense spending is stabilizing.As such, investors could use sell-offs like these to pick up shares for the very long term to pick up the appealing dividends. Yet don't buy shares for compelling upside in the coming periods, but rather as a long-term dividend paying investment.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2051483,56962,2014-02-26T16:10:05-05:00,,"Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is a security and aerospace company involved in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, and maintenance of innovative technology systems and products.The company anticipates its FY 2014 net sales to fall slightly from the net sales recorded in FY 2013. Therefore, I will determine the revenue outlook of the top two revenue generating segments of the company in this write-up. I will begin by identifying the two major revenue driving segments of the company and analyze the performance of those segments during FY 2013. I will determine the prospects of revenue growth of those segments along with a discussion about some of the latest events that will benefit the company's overall top line.Let us begin with analyzing the historical top-line performance of the company's two leading segments.Top-line AnalysisSource: LMT 2013 10KThe chart above shows that the company's aeronautics business segment is a major contributor to the company's total revenue. The segment improved its contribution to the company's total revenue from 30.89% in FY 2011 to 31.14% in FY 2013 but the segment recorded a 5.55% decline in its revenue in FY 2013 due to a decline in aircraft deliveries during the year. The company anticipates higher net sales from this segment in FY 2014, so I will determine the major revenue growth driver of this segment in the following heading.The company's IS&GS segment contributed 18.45% to the company's total revenue in FY 2013. The revenue from the information systems and global solutions declined by 5.41% in FY 2013 due to a fall in volume and the completion of several programs run under this segment. The company projects further decline in the revenue generated by this segment in FY 2014 as well. Therefore, I will consider what will drive or hinder the revenue growth of this segment in the coming year.Backlog and Segments' Revenue Growth DriversSource: LMT 2013 10KThe table above shows that the company's backlog for two of the major revenue driving segments recorded a year-over-year decline from FY 2011 to 2013. This was mainly because of a decline in orders for fighter jets such as F-16, C-5 and C-130 partially offset by higher orders for F-35. A downturn in the federal information technology budgets contributed to lower orders for the company's IS&GS's programs.Overall, the company had a backlog worth $82.6 billion by December 31st, 2013 compared to $82.3 billion by December 31st, 2012. Backlog is converted into sales in future periods as work is executed or deliveries are made. About $35.4 billion, or 43%, of the company's backlog by December 31st, 2013 is anticipated by the company to be converted into sales in FY 2014.Aeronautics: More demand for F-35The F-35 program generated 50% of the company's aeronautics segment's net sales and 16% of the company's total net sales in FY 2013, and the company expects higher sales for the jet in the coming years. However, the company aims to generate more sales of this jet from international interests. The company's F-35 jet is attracting significant interest from the Gulf region as observed by the Pentagon. More buyers such as the UAE are now considering purchasing F-35s in addition to orders placed by other gulf countries such as Turkey and Israel. Japan and South Korea are also striving to strength their defense, so they also have ordered the jet. This depth of interest in the F-35 from the Gulf was surprising for the U.S. The F-35 project is the most expensive Pentagon defense program in history, and the company will reap its benefits in the coming years.Information Systems and Solutions- U.S. Budget IssuesOn January 17th, 2014, the U.S. Government passed its GFY 2014. This budget provides discretionary defense spending at levels consistent with the planned defense spending limits in the Bipartisan Budget Act and reduced much of the uncertainty and inefficiency in procuring products and services under the persistent resolution.The planned defense budget cut has a direct impact on the U.S. government's defense spending and is a function of the country's fiscal and economic challenges. But now since the U.S. economy was forecasted to show a bit of recovery in FY 2013, these defense spending and budget constrains may cool down a bit. Moreover, companies such as Lockheed Martin that are directly affected by these budget cuts have room to reap the benefit of their international expansion through making sales to other countries. These countries include South Korea and Japan who are increasing their spending budgets for defense. Currently the company generates 17% of its net sales from its international clients.Acquisition in FY 2013 to Avail International OpportunitiesThe company paid $269 million and $259 million in FY 2013 and FY 2012, respectively, for acquisition activities, mainly related to the acquisition of businesses. In 2013, the company acquired Amor Group, a United Kingdom-based company specializing in information technology, civil government services, and the energy market. This acquisition is aligned with the company's strategy to grow international sales and has become a part of the company's IS&GS business segment. This acquisition is likely to bring synergies for the company and reduce the company's IS&GS segment's exposure to the U.S. market that will be hurt by defense budget cuts.Other Developments, Contracts and AgreementUS Army Interested in New TechnologyLockheed Martin has launched technology that will enable AH-64 Apache helicopter pilots to see targets and view surveillance data in high-resolution color rather than in the vague black and white images they use now.These new sensors developed by Lockheed Martin took four years to develop and could help pilots to avoid blunders such as an attack on an Iraqi wedding in 2007 when 12 people were mistakenly killed because they were viewed as armed protestors. The additional situational awareness provided by this technology will offer soldiers what they require to make the right decisions on the battlefield. This equipment would be the most innovative on any rotorcraft used by the army though some Special Forces units have similar equipment.Lockheed Martin and the army need to discuss a contract for the upgrading of all its 680 Apache E-model choppers. This technology with new sensors will help pilots track suspicious cars identified by troops on the ground by their color or even individuals marked in specific clothes. Orders to install this technology in the current fleet of aeronautic vehicles will bring more revenue for Lockheed Martin.My take Regarding these UpdatesThe future outlook for the revenue growth of the two major revenue generating segments of the company seems bright. This is because of the new technology and innovation that the company is bringing. The volume of the aeronautics segment is likely to get support from rising demand and orders for the company's F-35. The company's IS&GS segment, which is the second largest contributor to the company's total revenue, will recover its revenue performance from international expansion, while the U.S. defense budget cut will remain a headwind for the segment's revenue growth. The company has made acquisitions in FY 2013 that will assist in expanding the company's global footprint. The upgraded surveillance technology unveiled by the company will also bring new orders and revenue for the company. Therefore, I am optimistic about the growth of the company's two major revenue driving segments.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by a Blackstone Equity Research research analyst.

2151453,54532,2014-04-21T12:10:04-04:00,A reduction in defense spending will ultimately reduce the company’s top and bottom lines in the future.Cancellation of F-35 orders will further depress the company’s revenues stream in the coming years.The U.S. defense department will save an additional $2.1 billion over the next five years by scrapping plans for two Lockheed Martin communication satellites.,"Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is a leading security and aerospace company. Back in February the company announced its fourth quarter and full year results that were not up to the mark as the company failed to deliver strong revenues in 2013.The company is strongly interlinked with the U.S. government as 82% of net sales were from the U.S. government in 2013 either as a primary contractor or as a subcontractor. Currently the U.S. government is considering cutting spending on defense and reduced the defense budget outline for 2015. So reduced spending from the U.S. government will result in low levels of sales for the company which will ultimately reduce the company's bottom line in the coming years. Let's analyze how the recent initiatives by the U.S. and Italian governments will impact the company's top and bottom lines in the coming years.F-35 Orders:The Pentagon recently announced that it would cut 17 of the 343 F-35 fighters it plans to buy from the company in fiscal years 2016 to 2019. Currently one jet costs $100 million and this move would save about $1.7 billion of the $45.5 billion in planned spending for the F-35s.Italy is also considering cutting its defense spending and may cut its order for 90 Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets. The prime minister announced last week $14 billion in income tax cuts and the planes order would be revised as he seeks to reduce public spending. The decision has until the end of this year to be finalized. If the Italian government significantly cuts orders it will further depress the company's top line.Currently the F-35 is the company's largest program and generates about 16% of the company's net sales. Going forward the company expects that this will remain its growth driver but recent news regarding the cutting of orders and software problems in the jets will raise many questions and uncertainties. Now I believe it will be difficult for the company to secure more orders unless it successfully resolves the software problem and the Marine Corps starts using this jet by mid-2015.Space System:The company's space system segment generated net sales of $8 billion and represented 18% of total net sales. But the performance of this segment in 2013 was not impressive as net sales for 2013 decreased $389 million primarily due to lower net sales for the commercial satellite program.These communication satellites are one of the major programs for the space system segment. The 2015 budget includes $7.2 billion for these satellites and other space based products but recently the Pentagon decided to save $2.1 billion by canceling its plans to buy two communication satellites from the company. The Pentagon also said it planned to postpone work on two global positioning systems III satellites that are also to be built by the company. So this reduction will create further problems for the company as this segment is a major driver of the company's revenues. Now it seems that it will fail to provide a healthy contribution toward the company's total net sales in the coming years.Defense Industry Outlook:Global defense spending is declining due to affordability concerns in many traditional active governments. So far, the US government spends the most on defense and accounted for about 39% of total global defense spending but is now considering reducing its spending and shrinking the size of U.S. Army from 490,000 to between 440,000 and 450,000.Overall the sector's growth is also likely to be diminished with the downward trend. If we analyze the overall industry the revenues and operating margins of the different companies have shown a declining trend over the past 3 to 4 years and considering the current prospects I believe that these declining trends will continue in the coming years.Furthermore the Pentagon's anticipated five-year $550 billion budget for weapons purchases would be cut by $48.3 billion and its $337 billion research plan would be reduced by $18 billion. All of these savings by the U.S. Government are considered losses from the company's prospective because the U.S. Government is a major buyer of the company' products.Conclusion:Previously, it was believed that the F-35 would remain the bright spot for the company but the recent cancellation of orders and software problems will raise big questions on the future of this jet. Overall the company's position is not clear unless it considers deriving more revenues from other countries such as Brazil and China where defense spending trends remain positive.Despite the fact that the company is going through a tough phase it has returned $1.5 billion in dividends and $1.8 billion in share repurchase in 2013 and maintained its dividend yield at a level of almost double the industry average. The future prospects that may result in a low level of earnings and less cash flow generation in the coming years will make things difficult for the company, so I suspect that the company will fail to maintain its dividend yield at current levels in the future.Therefore I don't believe that Lockheed is an attractive investment opportunity at present and investors should consider investing elsewhere. I don't recommend buying the stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1923501,23479,2013-12-31T16:16:26-05:00,,"Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) faced a very challenging demand environment in 2013 with U.S. government spending declining due to sequestration. The defense contractor was initially assessed to be highly vulnerable to this decline as it gets over 80% of its revenues from the government, but it fared exceptionally well, growing its profits by nearly 15% annually to $2.5 billion in the first nine months of this year on gains from cost cuts. [1] In the fourth quarter, the company is likely to maintain its strong performance. In our opinion, Lockheed's profits rose despite reduced government spending due to its strategic position on important longer cycle government contracts like the F-35 which remain funded from prior year budgets and are therefore not impacted significantly from sequester, which came in force from March 2013.Looking ahead, in 2014, we anticipate higher margins under the F-35 program, which constituted around 16% of Lockheed's total revenues in the previous quarter, to offset in part the negative impact from government austerity.Uncertainty Over Future Levels Of Government SpendingThe deadlock continues in Congress over a deal that could potentially remove the current across-the-board spending cuts. If sequester remains in place then Lockheed will face a challenging 2014, even though in recent years it has increased its international sales.The company in its preliminary 2014 outlook announced in October that revenues will likely fall slightly from 2013 levels, but margins will likely not be impacted much due to gains from cost cutting measures and transition in the F-35 program from development to production.Higher Margins In F-35 Program Will Help Offset Impact From Potential Budget CutsOver the past few years, Lockheed was deeply involved in research and development of the F-35 during which period the company raised its workforce of scientists, engineers and IT professionals. However, with significant development work complete under the program and the company looking to ramp up the F-35 production rate, its margins under the contract are set to improve. One of the ways in which this transition from development to production will expand the company's margins is through reduced overall headcount. The company plans to reduce the number of development workforce it employs. At the same time, it expects the increase in its production workforce to not fully offset the decline from the development workforce. In this way, in 2014, it will benefit from reduced headcount and employee wages.Additionally, the company says that cost savings achieved from this shift from development to production will more than offset the negative impact from lower F-35 prices negotiated from the government. In the most recent lot 7 F-35 production contract, the price that Lockheed is getting for producing a F-35 is lower than what it was getting in the lot 6 production contract, which in turn was lower than what it was getting in the lot 5 production contract. The company says that this steady decline in F-35 prices is not hurting its margins as the F-35 development work during which margins were actually very low is substantially complete. Going forward, gains from ramp up in production will more than offset the price decline negotiated by the Pentagon. The company anticipates that this scenario will persist when it negotiates for lot 8 and next production contracts. In all, in 2014, higher margins at the F-35 program will help Lockheed offset the impact from potential cuts in government spending.In that case, a deal avoids large spending cuts in government spending, and there could be further upside to Lockheed's profits in 2014.Disclosure: No positions."
1880501,23479,2013-12-05T13:51:41-05:00,,"South Korea recently hinted that it would purchase Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) F-35 in a multi-billion dollar deal early next year. The country's defense ministry announced that it would place an order for 40 fighter aircraft with stealth capabilities. Though the ministry did not explicitly name the F-35, the stealth requirement leaves only this aircraft among other contenders for the deal.We figure this order from South Korea will strengthen the already strong international interest in the F-35 program, thereby helping Lockheed to partially offset the negative impact from declining U.S. defense spending on its sales. Additionally, this order will help Lockheed lower the per unit price of the F-35, thereby saving several hundreds of millions of dollars for the U.S. military.We currently have a stock price estimate of $120 for Lockheed Martin, around 15% below its current market price.Rising International Orders For The F-35 Help Lockheed Offset Government AusterityFor Lockheed Martin, the South Korean order will help offset the impact from declining defense spending from the U.S. government. The company currently anticipates its top line to fall to around $45 billion in 2013, from $47.2 billion last year, primarily due to defense spending restrictions imposed through the Budget Controls Act of 2011 and sequestration, which came into effect from March 1 earlier this year. [1] Additionally, in its last earnings release, the company announced that its top line will likely continue to contract in 2014 due to the government's defense budget cuts. [2]In light of such a challenging environment in the U.S., the growing international interest in the F-35 program is helping Lockheed to counter austerity at home. When South Korea formally announces its order for 40 F-35s next year, it will join the U.K., Italy, Norway, Netherlands, Israel, Australia and Japan in the group of countries that have placed orders for the F-35. In addition to South Korea, Turkey and Singapore will also likely place orders for the F-35 next year, while many countries in the Middle-East have also shown interest in obtaining this fifth-generation fighter jet. However, sales of the F-35 to Middle-Eastern countries do not seem likely in the foreseeable future due to Israeli concerns. Nonetheless, in our opinion, growing orders for the F-35 from international governments reflect growing confidence in the F-35 program, which until some time back was plagued with delays and cost hikes.South Korean Order Could Likely Lower F-35′s CostThese growing international orders will also lower F-35′s cost as total development and production costs under the program will get distributed over a larger number of planes. The Pentagon currently expects the cost of an F-35 fighter jet to come down to around $85 million by the end of the decade, from over $100 million presently. [3] This will in turn save several hundreds of millions of dollars for the U.S. defense forces, which plans to purchase over 2,400 F-35s from Lockheed over the next couple of decades.In the interim, international orders for the F-35 like the one anticipated from South Korea will help the Pentagon deal with the mandatory spending restrictions. International orders will help fill in for potential order delays caused by the spending cuts.South Korea Focused On Buying Jets With Stealth CapabilityEarlier this year in September, South Korea surprisingly re-opened its multi-billion fighter jet deal after turning down Boeing's F-15, which remained the only bid conforming to its $7.8 billion budget limit. The country turned down the F-15 due to its fewer stealth capabilities, and we at the time had written that the F-35 would stand a good chance of getting the contract due to the revised criteria. For South Korea, stealth capability in its fighter jets is crucial to counter the threat from North Korea with which it has technically been at war at since 1953. Regional considerations including purchase of 42 F-35s by Japan and development of indigenous fifth-generation stealth fighter by China also likely played a role in South Korea's decision to select fighter jets with radar-evading capabilities.Disclosure: No positions."
1805062,21544,2013-11-05T08:24:40-05:00,,"Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), a security and aerospace company, engages in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, and sustainment of advanced technology systems and products for defense, civil, and commercial applications in the United States and internationally. This dividend achiever has increased dividends for eleven years in a row.The company's last dividend increase was in September 2013 when the Board of Directors approved a 15.60 % increase in the quarterly dividend to $1.33 /share. The company's peer group includes Raytheon (RTN), General Dynamics (NYSE:GD), Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) and Boeing (NYSE:BA).Over the past decade this dividend growth stock has delivered an annualized total return of 13.80% to its shareholders.(Click to enlarge)The company has managed to deliver a 15.20% average increase in annual EPS between 2003 and 2012. Analysts expect Lockheed Martin Corporation to earn $9.48 per share in 2013 and $9.68 per share in 2014. In comparison, the company earned $8.36/share in 2012. Over the next five years, analysts expect EPS to rise by 6.45%/annum. The company has also managed to reduce the number of outstanding shares over the past decade from 450 million in 2003 to 326 million in 2013.(Click to enlarge)With Lockheed Martin, over 80% of revenues are derived from the U.S. government or U.S. government Agencies. The problems with the U.S. budget deficit are widespread. As a result, it is very possible that defense contractors would experience decreases or limits to the amount of weapons they can sell to their main customer. This could potentially lead to lower profits and dividend freezes or cuts.In the long-run however, (15 - 20 years from now), I cannot see anything else but increases in U.S. government spending on defense. The world could be a hostile place, and countries need to spend on defense simply to keep up with pace of technology. However, even if you buy today, you can still experience dividend cuts five years down the road, although chances are your distributions would recover within 10 years or so.For additional background on my view of the defense company prospects, check this article.The return on assets increased between 2003 and 2007, but has been on the decline since then. I generally want to see at least a stable return on equity over time. I use this indicator to assess whether management is able to put extra capital to work at sufficient returns.(Click to enlarge)The annual dividend payment has increased by 24.70% per year over the past decade, which is higher than the growth in earnings per share. This has been achieved mostly due to the expansion of the dividend payout ratio.(Click to enlarge)Unfortunately, it is highly doubtful that the company will be able to increase dividends per share at this high of a rate over the next decade. Given the outlook for defense spending in the US, even a modest dividend growth would be a positive for dividend investors who hold the stock today. In order to be able to experience dividend growth, investors need to acquire shares of defense contractors when defense spending is on the upswing. For example, the company froze dividends in 1996 and cut them in 2000. The original Lockheed Corporation suspended dividends in 1969, and did not resume payments until the early 1980's.The dividend payout ratio has increased from 25% in 2003 to almost 50% in 2012. Over the past decade, Lockheed Martin has managed to increase distributions at a rate that was much higher than earnings growth, by expanding the dividend payout ratio. A lower payout is always a plus, since it leaves room for consistent dividend growth minimizing the impact of short-term fluctuations in earnings.(Click to enlarge)Currently Lockheed Martin is attractively valued at 14.30 times earnings, yields 4% and has a sustainable distribution. However, a business that is dependent on a single customer for over 80% of their revenues scares me. Despite the great valuation, I simply cannot make myself purchase the stock, because I do not know if earnings won't fall 5 years down the road. I believe there are easier companies for me to invest money in. I see this company as a slightly riskier category than your regular sleep well at night companies like Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) or Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). In order to make money on this stock, I need to be able to get too many variables correctly, such as increase or decrease in defense spending, and how it would impact profitability. While defense spending would likely be higher in 20 years, this does not preclude short-term contractions or freezes in government spending on military over the next five years for example. This could halt earnings growth, and lead to dividend freezes or even worse, dividend cuts.That being said, the company is flush with cash, and since the U.S. defense budget is projected to grow at 2% per year between 2014 and 2023, I think it could be a decent addition for an enterprising investor, if there were few other investment ideas available. Again, as I mentioned in my previous article on defense spending, it might be a better idea to purchase shares in more than one defense company, just so you can mitigate company specific risk.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

For the first nine months, this segment has generated revenue of $10.2 billion with a year-over-year decline of 5.4%. Lockheed recently signed a $562 million contract with the U.S. Department of Defense, or DoD. The company will provide nine months of all sustainment activities for its F-22 Raptor stealth fighter jet. As the part of the contract, Lockheed will provide support for engineering, technical data, logistics, and modification and heavy maintenance of the F-22. The contract also includes reliability and maintainability upgrades, which are expected to be completed by Sept. 30, 2014.Besides the F-22 Raptor, Lockheed's largest Combat Aircraft program is the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, or JSF, which has helped the company become one of the major suppliers to the U.S. military.Betting on F-35 fighter jetsThe JSF contributed 14% to total revenue and 45% to the aeronautic segment in 2012. The success of this program is backed by the continuous strong demand for its F-35 fighter jets from the U.S. DoD. To strengthen the military, the U.S. defense ministry expects to spend $392 billion to purchase a fleet of around 2,443 F-35 jets by the late 2030s. As the part of the deal with the U.S. DoD, the Pentagon last quarter finalized two agreements with Lockheed for supplying 71 F-35 JSFs worth $7.8 billion. Lockheed is also expecting to deliver the final seven of the 36 F-35 JSFs to the U.S. Military by year-end or the beginning of the next year.Along with the U.S., other countries including Australia, Canada, Denmark, Italy, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, South Korea, Turkey, and Britain have each signed a contract with Lockheed for F-35 jets to strengthen their military. Recently, the Norwegian government was authorized by parliament to purchase six F-35 jets, bringing the total order to 16 F-35 jets. Norway's military will pay $654.7 million for the fleet of six F-35 jets, which Lockheed is expected to deliver by 2018. Further, Norway plans to purchase 52 F-35s by 2024, depending on parliament's approval.With the superior stealth capabilities of F-35 compared to Boeing's (NYSE:BA) F-15 Silent Eagle, Lockheed is expected to receive an order of 40 F-35 JSFs from the South Korean defense ministry in 2014. The first jet is expected to be delivered by 2018. South Korea's defense ministry expects with the F-35A's superior stealth capabilities that it can better respond to North Korea's growing nuclear threat. It has also stated that the South Korean Military requires another 50 to 80 new jets between 2017 and 2028 to replace its retiring F-4 and F-5 fighters.Apart from the strong U.S. DoD order for F-35 jets, the orders from these other countries are expected to generate strong future growth for Lockheed. Further, to meet such a huge demand for F-35 jets, the company has a five-year plan to increase the production rate of F-35. The production rate for the F-35 will be increased from 29 jets per annum to 42 jets next year, and is expected to increase further to 62 jets in 2016, 76 jets in 2017, and 100 jets by 2018. The company has gradually increased production before and should be able to increase the production rate further. By achieving a production rate of 100 F-35 jets, the company is expected to reduce the price for its F-35A jets from $107 million to around $75 million by 2019. The strong order book and increased production rate will help Lockheed convert its orders to revenue at a higher pace to further strengthen its top-line.The growing order for Lockheed's fighter jets will, however, also generate opportunities for United Technologies (NYSE:UTX). The company, with its Pratt & Whitney segment, supplies engines for the F-22 and F-35 jets. It has signed a contract worth $1.1 billion with the Pentagon in the fourth quarter of 2013. Under this contract United will manufacture 38 engines for F-35 jets. The higher demand for building F-22 and F-35 fighter jets is expected to generate significant revenue for United.Apart from these opportunities, United also signed a $231.5 million contract with the U.S. DoD for its F119-PW-100 engines. These F119-PW-100 engines power the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter jet. Under this contract, United Technologies will provide maintenance and repair for F119 jet engines. The contract is expected to be completed by Dec. 31, 2014. Along with its individual orders, United should benefit equally with Lockheed's growing orders for fighter jets and realize growth opportunity as well.ConclusionNew orders from the U.S. DoD and other countries for Lockheed fighter jets are expected to strengthen Lockheed's top-line. Further, its plan to increase the production rate of F-35s will enable the company timely delivers of its fighter jets. The company expects to report full-year EPS for 2013 of $9.4 to $9.7. Through the end of the third quarter Lockheed has generated EPS of $7.63, and looking at the past performance, where the company generated EPS of around $2 in every quarter since 2009; I expect it will comfortably achieve its 2013 EPS target.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The company has too low a current ratio, and too high a PB ratio for the Defensive Investor. For the Enterprising Investor, the high level of debt relative to net current assets is the deciding factor. Therefore, value investors seeking to follow the methods of Benjamin Graham should seek other opportunities, beginning by reviewing ModernGraham's analysis of The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA). From a valuation perspective, the company has seen growth in EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $7.15 in 2009 to an estimated $8.41 for 2013. This moderate growth is good to see, but does not support the market's implied growth rate of 4.9%. As a result, the company appears to be overvalued at the present time.What do you think? What value would you put on Lockheed Martin? Is the company not suitable for Defensive Investors or Enterprising Investors? Is there a company you like better?Disclosure: The author did not hold a position in Lockheed Martin (LMT) or any of the other companies listed in this article at the time of publication and had no intention of changing that position within the next 72 hours."
1852361,56732,2013-11-20T12:26:51-05:00,,"As the prime contractor for the US Government, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) leads the global defence industry as being one of the forefront companies involved in research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustaining of advanced technology systems and products for defense, space, intelligence, homeland and cyber security. For investors, its ability to secure returns is what makes the difference.For 11 years, LMT has provided returns to investors in the form of increasing dividends. It has delivered an annualized total return of 13.80% over the last decade. Will it be able to sustain it? Do its future prospects make it an attractive investment? The answers to these questions depend on LMT's future strategy and the external factors acting upon it.Dependence on the US GovernmentThe viability of LMT is directly dependent upon the budget and strategic policy of the US Government. In 2012, the US Government accounted for 99 percent of LMT's $47 billion revenue, either through direct contracts or a sale to the foreign military through contracts with the US Government. Beginning on 1st March 2013, the Budget Act plans to reduce defense spending by $500 billion over a nine-year period. This could well damage LMT in the future as the defense cuts would result in lesser sales and a potential decrease in operating margins as LMT struggles to cope with its high overhead and research costs.Impact Yet to HitDespite the tightening conditions, LMT has not yet faced the impact of the US crisis as it reported improvements in some if its segments and their performance in the third quarter of 2013. While Aeronautic and ISGS segments remained relatively stable over the term of performance, MFC and MST segments showed improvement as operating margins jumped to 17.8 and 12.8 percent, respectively. On the other hand, Space Systems showed a decline, with margins falling due to a decrease in sales.Discussing the segments that showed improvements, MFC was able to increase its sales by 3% owing to a higher sales volume of THAAD and PAC-3 programs. On 23rd September 2013, LMT entered into a $3.9 billion contract to provide 110 THAAD to the US Army and UAE. This pushed the sales even higher. Since the contract will be valid till the fiscal year 2014, it will further improve margins in the coming year.MST also reported an increase in margin even though sales revenue fell due to decreasing volume. The improvement in results was due to more risk retirements of $35 million. Like MFC, MST did not improve its margin by increasing sales or improving cost efficiency, therefore depriving the company of any future expectations regarding improving margins. This segment gained only via a one-time cost reduction.The only segment that declined was SS (Space Systems). SS margins fell due to a common factor of decreasing demand. In addition to that, SS received less income from joint ventures due to lower launch related activities and discussions over cost matters, which delayed decision making.Investments and Deals to CushionLast month, LMT announced the acquisition of Amor, a private IT firm in order to expand internationally and tap into non-defense markets. The acquisition will allow LMT to expand its capabilities and expertise in IT, civil government and energy. Combining Amor's airport operations business, which is in use at more than 75 airports worldwide, with Lockheed air traffic solutions business would create a larger and more effective business, according to Lockheed spokeswoman Jennifer Allen. With US spending cuts coming in the future, LMT's move to diversify into other markets was a smart step. IT and energy are on the rise and tapping this market will allow LMT to sustain current margins and value for its shareholders in the future.In addition, LMT could well benefit from the potential South Korean arms deal. According to Reuters, political pressure to meet budget deadlines in South Korea to deliver 5th generation war planes by 2017 means that LMT could receive an order of 60 planes by next month, promising billions in revenue. In a statement by South Korean officials, it was referred that South Korea plans to buy planes that are capable of not being seen under radar, a current capability of LMT's F-35 that is not offered by its rival Boeing (BA), another candidate trying to win the bid. This implies that LMT is a good chance of winning this tender. This tender will directly affect margins in the future and allow investors to receive higher dividends, if LMT chooses.Cutting CostsLMT announced this month that it will consolidate several of its US facilities and reduce its workforce by 4,000 due to the spending cuts. This will improve LMT's efficiency and make its products more affordable. These measures were in line with the company's future work projections. LMT will reduce nearly 2.5 million square feet of its workspace hence decreasing overhead costs. The recent government cuts have promoted LMT to adopt these measures and they will help LMT in retaining investor value for the future.Successful TestsLMT is set to become more powerful in the defense industry with its Long Rage Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM). After the first trial conducted in August, it successfully passed its second trial demonstrating its capabilities and effectiveness. The missiles offer a new spectrum of demand for sea missiles which could affect the profitability of LMT given its value to global navies.Not only that, the Javelin Joint Venture between LMT and Raytheon received $176 million in September to produce and deliver 842 Block I Javelin missile rounds and 120 command launch units (CLUs). The units will be delivered starting in October to the U.S. Army and Marine Corps as well as three international customers: Oman, Jordan and Indonesia.What about F-35?Another major product under development is the fighter aircraft F-35. The F-35 is making progress, and there's reason for investors to be hopeful especially since more and more countries are interested in purchasing the F-35. However, there are also a number of issues that still need to be addressed. The Quality Assurance Assessment report released by the Inspector General on September 30 said that the F-35 has a number a major issues that could adversely affect aircraft performance, reliability, maintainability and ultimately program cost. More pointedly, the report found 362 findings which contained 719 issues.Despite It being 70% over budget and years behind schedule along with the difference between different US departments on the costs their offices will suffer for the operating and maintenance of F-35, it is unlikely that the program will be drawn away by the US government in the future as the Pentagon estimates $392 billion of expenditures for 2,443 aircraft in the coming decades.A TreatNASA's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft, built by Lockheed Martin, was successfully launched this month. The process went smooth and accomplished LMT's research objectives. The handshake with NASA emphasizes LMT's visible strong presence. I believe such a strong political stance makes LMT powerful and with a sound standing. With LMT and Reignwood Group signing another contract to start design of a 10-megawatt Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) power plant, which, when complete, will be the largest OTEC project to date, there is no doubt for investors to gain in this defense giant.Coming to an annual analysis, LMT has performed relatively well than its competitors and the industry and is expected to do so in the future. LMT's forward P/E ratio is less than its trailing P/E ratio compared to its rival Northrup Grumman's (NYSE:NOC) that has a forward P/E ratio greater than its trailing P/E. In terms of dividend yield, taking this year into account, LMT has outperformed by yielding 4% as compared to the rival Northrup Grumman's yield of 2.3% and the industry's 2.4% dividend yield.Strong performance indicators accompanied with investments and future deals in hand, the rise in stock price for the last year is well justified. LMT has experienced a 43% increase in its stock price and I expect this trend to continue.Source: MorningstarCandy for InvestorsWith plans to open subsidiaries in Israel, potential business in the IT and energy sector along with orders from Netherland, Britain, Italy, Australia and Japan, there is no doubt that LMT holds potential rewards for its shareholders. Despite government cuts, LMT is determined to hold its value by already planning to diversify. Forward performance is expected to be better than rivals and the industry taking into account its fundamentals. One should consider LMT if he/she desires to earn returns in short term through price appreciation and a stable dividend.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1879101,57471,2013-12-05T03:59:34-05:00,,"South Korea intends to purchase 40 F-25 fighter jets with stealth capabilities, of Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), for about $7.8 billion. The company also has orders from Australia, Britain, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, and Norway for its F-35 fighter jets. On account of growth in orders for the F-35, Lockheed Martin is expected to increase the production rate of these fighter jets from the current 29 per annum to 42 jets next year, which is expected to increase revenue generation from the F-35. Currently an F-35 costs around $115 million. As per the current production rate, I estimate that the F-35 generates revenue of approximately $3.33 billion annually. With the increase in production rate to 42 jets per annum, this revenue generation is expected to increase to $4.83 billion.Growing operating marginsThe U.S. government's cut in defense spending led Lockheed Martin to adopt cost cutting strategies. As a part of its cost cutting plan, Lockheed Martin is expected to lay off approximately 4,000 employees, which is around 3.5% of its total workforce. After these job cuts, Lockheed Martin is expected to be left with 112,000 employees. Since 2008, the company has reduced its workforce by around 23%, when it employed around 146,000 employees. Moreover, the company will close and consolidate some of its facilities located in the U.S.Lockheed Martin plans to shut down its facilities in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Arizona, Texas, and its operations in California. These closures will result in reduction of workforce by 2,000 positions by 2015. Another 2,000 employees are expected to be eliminated from the company's various segments like 'Information Systems & Global Solutions,' or IS&GS, 'Mission System and Training,' or MST, and 'Space Systems' by the end of next year. Regarding its consolidation plan, Lockheed Martin will transition operations of its IS&GS segment to its facilities in Colorado and Pennsylvania. The potential sites for the MST segment are expected to be finalized early next year.As per the table below, Lockheed Martin's operating margin has been increasing since 2011. Its operating income for the nine months ending on September 29, 2013 was $3.67 billion, and extrapolating this data for twelve months, I estimate the operating income for fiscal year 2013 to be $4.89 billion. Similar calculations provide the net sales estimation for this fiscal year. Lockheed Martin's cost cutting plan drives this rise in operating margin.Going forward, as per its cost cutting strategy, Lockheed Martin expects its operating margin to be more than 11.5%. The graph below depicts this rise in the company's operating margin. The increasing operating margin suggests that Lockheed Martin is earning more on each dollar of sales, and these earnings are expected to increase going forward.Though Lockheed Martin is cutting costs due to cuts in U.S. defense spending, its competitor Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) is betting on contracts from the U.S. Air Force. On November 7, 2013, the U.S. Air Force awarded a $178 million contract to the company for its 'E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System,' also known as Joint STARS, which is the U.S. Air Force's battle aircraft. Northrop will provide logistics, training, and supply chain support services to the Joint STARS aircraft fleet. After this contract, the company received another contract of $114 million from the U.S. Air Force.As per this contract, Northrop is expected to build three 'RQ-4 Global Hawk' unmanned aircrafts, which are used for the purpose of surveillance by the Air Force. These contracts are expected to boost the company's 'aerospace system' segment, which accounted for 40.68% of the company's total revenue in the third quarter of fiscal year 2013. This segment declined by 4% in the third quarter to $2.48 billion year over year.ConclusionThe cost cutting measures are in response to the cuts in defense spending by the U.S. government, and these cuts are expected to increase Lockheed Martin's operating margins going forward. The company's F-35 jets are also vital to its growth. Along with these fundamental growth factors, the company's strong balance sheet position is marked by its long dividend distribution history. The company authorized a quarterly dividend of $1.33 per share, which is expected to be paid on December 27, 2013. This dividend is a quarter-over-quarter growth of 16%. Amassing all my discussion on Lockheed Martin, I suggest investors include this stock in their portfolio.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1774622,25319,2013-10-25T13:39:15-04:00,,"Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) recently announced its 11th consecutive double digit dividend increase, in terms of percentage. To put that into context, only 10 other companies have done this according to the website that SA contributor (and the well respected) Robert Allan Schwartz maintains.This article was written in 2012 when LMT announced its dividend increase last year. With the recent increase in mind, let us re-run the numbers.New Dividend and Yield: The new annual dividend of $5.32 per share gives LMT investors a current yield of 4%, in spite of LMT's stock price surging along with the rest of the market. LMT's yield is significantly higher than Raytheon's (RTN) and The Boeing Company's (NYSE:BA), which stand at 2.9% and 1.6% respectively.Payout Ratio: The payout ratio currently sits at a very handy 59%. Income investors are usually comfortable until the payout reaches about 80%. Well known dividend stocks like Altria Group (NYSE:MO) come to mind as companies which pay about 80% of its earnings back to investors. The fact that the payout ratio is still low in spite of 11 consecutive double digit increases speaks about LMT's earnings potential and stock buybacks.Dividend Growth Rate [DGR]: This is where Lockheed has been firing on all cylinders. The 5 year dividend growth rate right now stands at 18%. While this has been slowing down a bit (24% to 22% to 18% over the past 3 years), there is no doubt this is still impressive.Not many income investors would complain about a dividend chart like the one below.(LMT's Ballooning Dividend: (Source: YCharts.com)Cash on Hand: LMT's cash on hand has gone down from almost $4B at the time of the previous writing to about $2.7B, which is still a significant number.(Source: YCharts.com)Buyback: Lockheed has a history of share buybacks as well, which adds more value to investors by reducing the share count. The graph below shows the share count has gone down from 400 Million in 2009 to about 320 Million in 2013. There were significant buyback announcements in 2009, 2010, and 2011 but one can see there has not been any reduction of late. One can attribute this to the uncertainty over the defense spending. However, given their history if there is a share price pullback, LMT should announce a buyback.(Source: YCharts.com)Extrapolation: Even though LMT has been very impressive in its dividend growth so far, one cannot expect the same super growth going forward. This is already evident as the 5 year DGR has slowed from 24% to 18% over the past 3 years. Also, the past decade was very lucrative for the defense companies with the Government spending being lavish on multiple wars.Hence, the table below assumes a ""depressing"" 8% DGR for the first 5 years and a 6% DGR for the next 5 years. Even then, the yield on cost is expected to at least double.Conclusion: LMT has so far been a great story for income investors over the past 10 years and the numbers presented above hint it will continue to be so at least in the near future.The company's biggest red flag is the dependence on Government's defense spending. Boeing, for example is dominant in commercial aviation as well whereas Lockheed is pretty much depending on the military spending for its revenues. At the same time, it is hard to imagine the Government being too harsh when it comes to cutting down the defense budget. Plus, LMT has shown it can still keep the numbers growing impressively by cutting costs.Bottomline, we believe LMT will keep surging in Robert Allan Schwartz's list by increasing dividends by double digit percentage over the next few years. This stock will remain in our watch list to buy on any significant pullback.Disclosure: I am long MO. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1766992,23479,2013-10-24T04:46:35-04:00,,"Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) posted better-than-expected results in its third quarter earnings. Though the defense contractor's top line fell by 4% annually to $11.3 billion due to sequestration, its earnings rose by 16% annually to $2.57 per share on margin expansion driven by cost cuts. Lockheed's backlog also recovered to nearly $79 billion after falling steadily for the past couple of quarters.The company also guided for a lower impact on its 2013 top line from across-the-board government spending cuts called sequestration. Lockheed had earlier expected its 2013 top line to fall by $825 million annually due to these cuts, but revised that estimate significantly downward as it did not see much impact from these cuts in the first three quarters. The company's longer cycle programs remain funded from prior year budgets and therefore weren't impacted much from spending reductions introduced under sequestration. As a result, Lockheed raised its full year 2013 sales outlook to $45 billion from $44.5 billion, and its 2013 earnings guidance to $9.40-9.70 per share from $9.20-9.50 per share on better-than-expected gains from cost controlling measures.We are in the process of incorporating Lockheed's third quarter results in our analysis and shall update our analysis shortly.Margin Expansion Drives Lockheed's Profit GrowthIn the third quarter, Lockheed continued to cut costs through multiple initiatives which included headcount reductions and temporary factory shutdowns, among others. This was done to offset the impact from sequestration which came into effect in March. As a result, the company expanded its operating margins to 11.1% in the third quarter, from 9.6% in the year-ago period. This expansion in margins raised its profits despite top line pressure from reduced defense spending by the government.International Growth Reduces Dependence On U.S. SpendingLockheed is especially vulnerable to a decline in the government's defense spending as it gets nearly 85% of its revenues from the U.S. government (Source:10K). During the quarter, the company made steady progress in international expansion as it seeks to reduce dependence on the government. It received the first international order for its THAAD missile defense system from the UAE. The F-35′s low rate initial production (LRIP) lot 6 and 7 contracts finalized during the quarter also consisted of a larger component for international customers with production positions for Australia, Italy, Norway and the U.K. South Korea's decision last month to not finalize Boeing's (NYSE:BA) F-15 for its multibillion dollar fighter jet contract also opened a window of opportunity for Lockheed's F-35. We figure these developments will help Lockheed expand international sales, and thus reduce the impact from declining defense spending at home. On its part, the company reaffirmed, during its earnings announcement, that it will raise the proportion of international sales in its total sales to 20% within the next few years.Backlog Expansion Raises Future VisibilityInterestingly, Lockheed also expanded its backlog to $78.7 billion at the end of the third quarter driven by order inflows of $15 billion. Prior to this rise, the company's backlog had declined steadily from $82.3 billion at the start of 2013 to $75.1 billion at the end of the second quarter. This recovery in Lockheed's backlog was driven in part by its international growth. We figure that with Japan and Israel planning to purchase the F-35, Lockheed's international backlog could rise further in 2014.Additionally, Lockheed said during its earnings release that it is expecting its backlog to rise to at least $80 billion by the end of 2013 (Earnings Call Transcript). This guidance provides better visibility into the company's near-term earnings outlook. Separately, the longer cycle programs in Lockheed's backlog have funding from prior year budgets which provides stability to its future earnings in the current uncertain defense spending environment.Preliminary Outlook For 2014In 2014, the company anticipates to retain its recent margin expansion gains and also foresees only a marginal decline in its top line from 2013. However, this outlook for 2014 assumes that no new reductions will be introduced under sequestration, the government will continue to fund Lockheed's key programs and Congress will approve the budget for fiscal 2014 in a timely manner. If, however, the government introduces new reductions in its 2014 defense budget, this outlook will likely get impacted.Disclosure: No positions"

The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Lockheed Martin's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 37.3%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 9.9%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Lockheed Martin's free cash flow margin has averaged about 4.7% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively MEDIUM. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Lockheed Martin, cash flow from operations decreased about 52% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 15% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Lockheed Martin's shares are worth between $80.00 - $133.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $106 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 12.7 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 9.6 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of -0.8% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 1.4%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 11.6%, which is above Lockheed Martin's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.2% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Lockheed Martin, we use a 9.9% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $106 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Lockheed Martin. We think the firm is attractive below $80 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $133 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Lockheed Martin's fair value at this point in time to be about $106 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Lockheed Martin's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $131 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $106 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1751472,41381,2013-10-17T13:41:41-04:00,,"On Wednesday, October 16, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) announced that it would be laying-off 600 employees in its Mission Systems and Training Division this month. The plan is not linked to the government shutdown, but instead stems from a lackluster business environment. In the wake of Wednesday's announcement, I wanted to highlight a number of the reasons why I still remain bullish on shares of Lockheed Martin.#1 - Recapping The Planned Cuts By Lockheed MartinOn Wednesday, Lockheed Martin became the latest weapons maker in recent months to announce a series of layoffs, saying it would let go of 600 workers in its Mission Systems and Training Division later this month. The company said it would provide details by November 6 about which of its 100 locations around the country would be affected. Most of the affected workers would leave their jobs by late November. ""This action is necessary to address continuing challenges in our business environment, including continued uncertain program funding, delays in contract awards and an extremely competitive market,"" company spokesman, Keith Little, said in a statement.Lockheed has already cut its workforce by over 30,000 employees since 2008 and consolidated facilities as it braced for tighter military budgets. A company spokeswoman said the workforce now totaled 116,000. Although such cuts play a key role in the overall reduction of annual spending, many investors, including myself, understand how important these cuts are when it comes to such variables as earnings growth.#2 - Recent Performance & Trend StatusOn Wednesday shares of LMT, which currently possess a market cap of $41.02 billion, a beta of 0.88, a forward P/E ratio of 13.13, and a current dividend yield of 4.16% ($5.32), settled at a price of $127.86/share.Based on their closing price of $127.86/share, shares of LMT are trading 1.01% above their 20-day simple moving average, 2.43% above their 50-day simple moving average, and 22.32% above their 200-day simple moving average. These numbers indicate a short-term, mid-term, and long-term uptrend for the stock which generally translates into a moderate buying mode for both near-term traders and long-term investors.#3- Recent Dividend BehaviorSince August 30, 2011 the company has actually increased its annual dividend three times in the last 24 months. The company's forward dividend of $5.32 makes this particular aerospace play a highly considerable option, especially for those who may be in the market for a higher-yielding stream of quarterly income.A Few Risks To ConsiderAre there any risks that are associated with a long-term income-driven investment in Lockheed Martin? Clearly there are risks associated with any investment, but when it comes to establishing a position in LMT I'd look toward a two risks my fellow Seeking Alpha colleague, Dividends4Life, recently noted which are cause for concern.If these numbers continue to demonstrate significant increases, there's a chance Lockheed Martin may find it hard to maintain its continued annual dividend payouts as has been the case over the last several years.ConclusionFor those of you who may be considering a position in Lockheed, I'd keep a watchful eye on a number of catalysts over the next 12-24 months as each could play a role in the partnership's long-term growth. For example, near-term investors should focus on the company's recent trend status and long-term investors should pay close attention to any growth related to the company's cost-cutting efforts.Although I reiterated my colleague's position that increased cash flow payouts and a high debt to total capital ratio could play a factor in the company's dividend behavior, I don't foresee Lockheed Martin significantly cutting its dividend in the next 12-18 months.Disclosure: I am long LMT.

1800422,38201,2013-11-03T11:44:44-05:00,,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) announced its third quarter earnings report of fiscal year 2013, reporting net earnings increase of 16% to $842 million. The growth in its missiles and fire control segment and international business were responsible for this growth. Further, the company expects to bolster its missile and fire control segment with a contract from the U.A.E and the U.S. defense agency. Lockheed also expects to expand its international business with its global expansion strategy. The company receives more than 80% of its sales from the U.S. government. Since the government cut the defense spending budget, growing its international business is crucial for Lockheed.Booming with missilesDuring the nine months ending on September 20, 2013, Lockheed's missiles and fire control segment accounted for 17.84% of the company's net sales. Lockheed received a $3.9 billion contract from the U.S. defense agency and the U.A.E on September 23, 2013, contributing to the segment's growth. Under this contract, the company is expected to produce elements of the 'Terminal High Altitude Defense', or THAAD.THAAD is a U.S. Army system designed to demolish the missiles. The elements used by THAAD for such missiles are interceptors, radars, and fire control systems. Under the contract, Lockheed is expected to manufacture around 110 interceptors for the U.S. Army. For the U.A.E., Lockheed will manufacture and deliver missiles and system equipment.The missiles and fire control segment grew 8.53% year over year during the first nine months of this year. Due to this contract, we expect this segment's contribution to further increase, and the growth rate will persist in the next fiscal year.International dealUnder an international defense deal, South Korea's defense agency placed a RFP for 60 fighter jets in August 2013. Three aerospace giants submitted proposals to manufacture these fighter jets including Lockheed, Boeing (BA), and European Aeronautic, Defense & Space Company, or EADS. In the first bidding round, Lockheed and EADS presented bids that were higher than the proposed budget by South Korea's defense agency; consequently, both companies were out of the bidding competition. This left Boeing as the potential bidder. However, on September 24, 2013 Boeing also lost this contract of $7.7 billion, as South Korea didn't consider Boeing's fighter jets F-15 'advanced' enough to counter North Korea's nuclear threat.The removal of Boeing from the contract for fighter jets opened the window of opportunity for Lockheed to present its F-35 fighter jets at a lower cost to South Korea, to clinch the contract. Lockheed already has orders from Britain, Australia, Italy, Norway, Israel, and Japan for its F-35 fighter jets. With the large number of orders lined up, Lockheed's production of fighter jets will increase. Consequently, Lockheed might lower its cost for F-35 jets, which would strengthen it proposal in the second bidding round for the South Korea contract. If it wins this bid, Lockheed will boost its international sales.Lockheed's international business will further receive boost with its global expansion plan under which it acquired Amor Group, which we discussed in detail in our previous article. The international business currently accounts for 15% of the company's total sales, and it expects this to rise to 20% in next few years. We feel that with the above discussed developments in the international business, the company is well positioned to raise this revenue contribution. Moreover, with the growth in international sales, Lockheed will be able to offset the effects from the defense cuts by the U.S. government.Attractive stockLockheed's stock looks attractive with its share repurchase program and hike in dividend. During the first nine months of this year, the company repurchased shares worth $1.5 billion. On September 26, 2013, Lockheed increased its amount for share repurchase by $3 billion. Lockheed's stock is currently trading around $133, and the share repurchase program will further incline this stock price. Besides the increase in amount for share repurchase, the company also announced to raise its quarterly dividend by 16% to $1.33 per share. This dividend is expected to be paid to shareholders on December 27, 2013. These prospects make Lockheed's stock an attractive investment opportunity.Another company in the aerospace defense industry is Northrop Grumman (NOC), which also increased its amount for share repurchase. Under its share repurchase program, Northrop Grumman repurchased shares for $1.7 billion, year to date. The company authorized an additional $4 billion for repurchasing its shares. To attract investors, the company plans to repurchase around 25% of its total outstanding shares by the end of 2015.Northrop Grumman's stock price is also expected to rise, attributed to the ten contracts it received from the U.S. Department of Defense, or DoD. Under one of these ten contracts, the company is expected to provide logistic support to the aircraft of the Army. This contract is for $795.9 million and will run through September 30, 2015. DoD disbursed around 113 contracts for $10.92 billion, out of which 9% were awarded to Northrop Grumman. Consequently, these contracts are expected to generate revenue of $982.8 million for the company. The fundamentals and share repurchase program of Northrop Grumman are expected to incline its stock price in the long run.Stock ValuationAlong with strong fundamentals, Lockheed's stock valuation parameters also support its stock. The trailing twelve months price to earnings, or PE, ratio of Lockheed is 14.97, higher than the forward PE ratio of 13.8, implying that the earnings of the company will increase going forward. This trailing twelve months PE ratio is also lower than the industry's PE ratio of 22.2. The company's dividend yield of 3.98% also favors the growth prospect of its stock and is significantly higher than the industry's dividend yield of 1.9%.ConclusionLockheed's fundamentals are strong, as it expects to grow sales in its various segments like missile and fire control and international business. Compiling our current discussion and previous article on Lockheed, we expect that its international business will grow, despite defense cuts by the U.S. government. The fundamentals of Lockheed are well supported by its strong valuation parameters. Considering all the growth factors, we expect Lockheed to grow in the long term, and investors should consider including it in their portfolio.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1663512,21835,2013-08-29T05:17:26-04:00,,"Linked here is a detailed quantitative analysis of Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE:LMT). Below are some highlights from the above linked analysis:Company Description: Lockheed Martin Corp., the world's largest military weapons manufacturer, is also a significant supplier to NASA and other non-defense government agencies. LMT receives about 93% of its revenues from global defense sales.Fair Value: In calculating fair value, I consider the NPV MMA Differential Fair Value along with these four calculations of fair value, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:1. Avg. High Yield Price 2. 20-Year DCF Price 3. Avg. P/E Price 4. Graham NumberLMT is trading at a premium to all four valuations above. Since LMT's tangible book value is not meaningful, a Graham number can not be calculated. The stock is trading at a 9.1% premium to its calculated fair value of $115.47. LMT did not earn any Stars in this section.Dividend Analytical Data: In this section there are three possible Stars and three key metrics, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:1. Free Cash Flow Payout 2. Debt To Total Capital 3. Key Metrics 4. Dividend Growth Rate 5. Years of Div. Growth 6. Rolling 4-yr Div. > 15%LMT earned one Star in this section for 3.) above. LMT earned a Star for having an acceptable score in at least two of the four Key Metrics measured. Rolling 4-yr Div. > 15% means that dividends grew on average in excess of 15% for each consecutive 4 year period over the last 10 years (2003-2006, 2004-2007, 2005-2008, etc.). I consider this a key metric since dividends will double every 5 years if they grow by 15%. The company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since 1995 and has increased its dividend payments for 11 consecutive years.Dividend Income vs. MMA: Why would you assume the equity risk and invest in a dividend stock if you could earn a better return in a much less risky money market account (MMA) or Treasury bond? This section compares the earning ability of this stock with a high yield MMA. Two items are considered in this section, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:1. NPV MMA Diff. 2. Years to > MMALMT earned a Star in this section for its NPV MMA Diff. of the $14,215. This amount is in excess of the $2,400 target I look for in a stock that has increased dividends as long as LMT has. The stock's current yield of 3.65% exceeds the 3.22% estimated 20-year average MMA rate.Memberships and Peers: LMT is a member of the S&P 500 and a member of the Broad Dividend Achievers™ Index. The company's peer group includes: Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA) with a 1.8% yield, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) with a 2.6% yield and United Technologies Corp. (NYSE:UTX) with a 2.1% yield.Conclusion: LMT did not earn any Stars in the Fair Value section, earned one Star in the Dividend Analytical Data section and earned one Star in the Dividend Income vs. MMA section for a total of two Stars. This quantitatively ranks LMT as a 2-Star Weak stock.Using my D4L-PreScreen.xls model, I determined the share price would need to increase to $243.37 before LMT's NPV MMA Differential decreased to the $2,400 minimum that I look for in a stock with 11 years of consecutive dividend increases. At that price the stock would yield 1.9%.Resetting the D4L-PreScreen.xls model and solving for the dividend growth rate needed to generate the target $2,400 NPV MMA Differential, the calculated rate is 9.0%. This dividend growth rate is equal to the 9.0% used in this analysis, thus providing no margin of safety. LMT has a risk rating of 1.75, which classifies it as a Medium risk stock.LMT is the largest defense contractor in the world and dominates next-generation defense platforms. It owns supply contracts for key programs such as the F-35, which assures the company multiple years of revenue. However, LMT is dependent on government funding. U.S. defense spending over the next several years will likely worsen as the U.S. continues to wind down Overseas Operational Contingency spending and the impact of sequestration begins to kick in by year end. In an attempt to maintain operating margins, the firm proactively reduced head count to 120,000 in 2012 from 146,000 in 2008.I am also concerned with the company's continued increase in its free cash flow payout (73% up from 62% in February 2013) and high debt to total capital (90% up from 75% in February 2013). In addition LMT is trading at a premium to my calculated fair value of $115.70. Given these concerns, I will not add to my position at this time.Full Disclosure: At the time of this writing, I was long in LMT (0.5% of my Dividend Growth Portfolio). See a list of all my dividend growth holdings here.Disclaimer: Material presented here is for informational purposes only. The above quantitative stock analysis, including the Star rating, is mechanically calculated and is based on historical information.

1681352,38201,2013-09-09T11:18:17-04:00,,"Increasing air traffic is pressuring airline companies to buy new airplanes. This is beneficial for one of the world's largest commercial airplane manufacturers, Boeing (BA). Boeing's 737 dominates its commercial planes' segment. The company is further developing this series for potential revenue generation.Besides commercial planes, its defense, space and security segment derived significant revenue from its U.S. based services. However, these services received a setback after the U.S. government elected to cut spending on defense services. In order to diversify, Boeing has been focusing on its international defense business segment. Let's have a detailed look at these factors and their impact on the company as a whole.Commercial airlines Boeing's 737 airplanes are the most delivered commercial planes. In the second quarter of 2013, the company delivered 169 commercial planes, 68.6% of which were 737 planes. The company expects to generate significant revenue opportunities by developing the 737 series. By the end of July 2013, Boeing completed the design for the upgraded version of this plane, which is expected to start service in 2017. It is 13% more efficient than existing planes, such as the most fuel efficient planes like the Airbus A320.Besides upgrading the series, Boeing hopes to develop the 737 with an increasing number of orders. Through July 2013, Boeing had a total 1,495 orders for one of the members of the 737 series, the 737 MAX. These orders will increase since WestJet said it will purchase 65 such airplanes on Aug. 29, 2013, for $6.3 billion. With the upgrade of the 737 series, we expect many such orders will come in the future.United Technologies' (UTX) aerospace system segment has been successfully supplying various components for Boeing commercial airplanes 737, 747, 767 and 777. On Aug. 22, 2013, Boeing again selected it for supplying various components of Boeing's ""737 MAX."" We expect the above discussed upgrade plans and increasing orders of Boeing's major plane series will bring long term revenue stability for the 737's prime supplier, United Technologies' aerospace systems segment. This segment accounted for 20.5% of the company's total revenue in the second quarter of its fiscal year 2013. Developing this important revenue contributing segment is expected to fuel United Technologies' earnings, which in turn will significantly impact its stock price.Boeing's commercial airplane segment contributed $24.31 billion, which is 59.72% of the company's total revenue, in the first half of 2013. Out of 306 commercial airplane deliveries in the first half, 71% of them were of the 737 airplane series. This 71% of commercial planes' revenue contribution in the first half was $20.81 billion, and the 737 series deliveries grew by 4.8% year over year. Assuming this growth rate to be constant, the 737 series is expected to contribute $21.8 billion in the first half of next year. We feel that the modification and increasing order tally of these planes will generate more revenue than Boeing's estimated $21.8 billion.International contracts Boeing's defense, space and security segment accounted for 37.5% of the company's total revenue in the second quarter of fiscal year 2013 and 80% of this segment's revenue came from the U.S. government. However, drawing huge revenue for its defense, space and security segment from the government is a loss for the company since the government reduced its spending on defense services. In March 2013, the U.S. government canceled $42.7 billion allocated for the defense budget for fiscal year 2013. Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing are the largest defense contractors to the U.S. government, so they were most affected by this spending cut.To lower the impact of decline in government spending, Boeing is focusing on enhancing its business from international defense customers. This focus is clearly reflected in the company's second quarter in which 37% of Boeing's defense, space and security segment's backlog represented orders from international customers. This is significantly higher than historical contribution of international customers.One such international deal in defense is with the government of South Korea that is expected to buy Boeing's fighter plane, the F-15 Super Eagle. The official announcement regarding this deal is expected to come this month. South Korea's jets requirement was expected to be fulfilled by three potential bidders Lockheed, Boeing and European Aeronautic Defense and Space, or EADS. Lockheed was out of competition because during the bidding time it offered a price that was higher than the government's proposed price of $7.43 billion. EADS failed for the same reason as Lockheed. This left Boeing as the only contender.Since Boeing is one of the largest global aircraft manufacturers, we feel it is well positioned to get more such international orders. With a decline in U.S. defense spending, international defense orders are expected to become more important for the company. Following the steps of Boeing, Lockheed is also focusing on offsetting headwinds from the U.S. government through its international defense contracts. On August 12, 2013, it received an order from South Korea for the country's Apache attack helicopters. Under this contract of $223 million, Lockheed will provide its electronics assembly system, M-TADS/PNVS, for Apache helicopters. This system is an electronic fire control system used by Apache pilots for targeting in night and adverse weather conditions.In another international deal, Longbow LLC, a joint venture of Lockheed, received a $90.6 million contract from Saudi Arabia for Apache helicopters. As per this deal, Lockheed will provide Longbow LLC's fire control radars, named as ""Longbow systems,"" for these helicopters.One of the officials of Longbow LLC statedLockheed's international business accounted for 17% of the company's total revenue last year, which was $7.99 billion, and with growth in its international segment, it expects to increase this revenue contribution to 20% over the next few years. We believe that increasing this revenue contribution by a few percentage points over the next few years is not enough to provide major revenue growth opportunities.Compared to Boeing's international deals, those of Lockheed are quite small. To confront Boeing's international business, Lockheed requires more revenue generating deals. Though Lockheed is developing its international segment, we feel small deals as the ones mentioned above, will not significantly impact its earnings, resulting in no major impact on the earnings per share, or EPS, of Lockheed. As a result of no remarkable effect on the EPS, the stock price also won't show much change.Valuation:Source: Finviz.comOn the basis of market capitalization, Boeing and Lockheed are the top industry players. When reviewing the valuation of these major players, Boeing's forward price earnings, or PE, ratio for next fiscal year is significantly lower than its trailing PE ratio, signifying that its stock is undervalued and its earnings are expected to grow in the future. The difference between Lockheed's forward PE ratio and trailing PE isn't significant compared to that of Boeing. So, its earnings aren't expected to grow much. Generally, a lower price to earnings growth, or PEG, is preferred, and Boeing's PEG is quite lower than Lockheed's, again making Boeing's stock attractive as compared to Lockheed's stock.Conclusion:BA data by YChartBoeing has outperformed the S&P 500 index over the last one year. Moreover, its strong fundamentals and valuation make its stock attractively priced. The company hopes to grow its commercial planes and international defense contracts for advancing in the future. Considering its growth factors, we advise investors to buy this stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1704222,38201,2013-09-19T16:50:30-04:00,,"In our previous article on Boeing (BA) we discussed the defense spending cuts by the U.S. government and approaches adopted by Boeing and Lockheed Martin (LMT) for offsetting the pressure from these cuts. We also analyzed Lockheed's international defense deals to offset the turmoil created by defense spending cuts. In this article, we will examine Lockheed's international expansion plans with respect to these spending cuts. Under its international expansion plan, Lockheed recently announced acquisition of Amor Group, a Scotland-based information Technology Company.In addition to its approach to tackle spending cuts pressure, we have also analyzed the competitive scenario of Lockheed with its major competitors in the aerospace defense industry. Let's take a look at the aerospace defense industry and what opportunities are available for investors.Flying high with acquisitionOn September 11, 2013, Lockheed announced acquisition of Amor Group as a part of its global expansion plan. The acquisition is aimed to boost Lockheed's information system and global solutions, or IS&GS, business unit. Amor Group is one of the largest independent information technology solutions providers of Scotland.Lockheed provides cyber security services under its IS&GS segment. In its second quarter report for fiscal year 2013, the IS&GS segment's net revenue decreased 7% to $2.1 billion year over year in the second quarter of fiscal year 2013. However, the company's acquisition of Amor Group is expected to make up for these losses. Amor Group specializes in safety and security services, and when combined with Lockheed's IS&GS segment, Amor will enhance Lockheed's ability to develop advanced technology systems and cyber security.Lockheed also provides air traffic solutions under its IS&GS segment. More than 75 airports with 3 million aircrafts globally per year use Amor Group's airport operations business. This will enhance Lockheed's air traffic solutions, which serve more than 60% of the world's air traffic.Amor Group will benefit Lockheed's IS&GS operations in the U.K. based on workforce. Currently, Lockheed employs around 500 in its information technology, or IT, services segment in the U.K., and it is expected to reach 1000 post-acquisition. This is expected to boost Lockheed's IT services in the U.K., and Lockheed substantiated it by stating ""the acquisition is expected to make Lockheed a top ten information and computer technology, or ICT player in the UK market.""As discussed above, Lockheed's IS&GS segment contributed $2.1 billion net revenue in the second quarter, which is around 18% of the company's net revenue. Amor Group reported total revenue of $90.5 million in its fiscal year 2012, which is expected to increase the IS&GS segment's revenue contribution.We feel the company is correct on estimating the growth of the IS&GS segment. Its international defense deals, as discussed in our earlier article, and international expansion plans will significantly reduce the impact of the U.S. defense spending cuts.Valuation:Lockheed's major competitors in defense services are Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Raytheon (RTN). The competitive analysis of these three companies is shown below:Source: Finviz.comA lower forward price to earnings, or PE, ratio than trailing 12 months PE ratio is considered better. As per the PE ratio valuation, Lockheed's forward PE is significantly lower than its trailing PE, making it a better alternative than Northrop and Raytheon. The trailing PE of Lockheed is also better than that of the industry, making its stock attractive.If the price to sales, or P/S, ratio is 1, then it means for every $1 of revenue the company makes, the investor pays $1. This signifies that a lower P/S ratio is better. Lockheed's P/S ratio is the lowest compared to its peers, again making it preferable over Northrop and Raytheon.Generally, a higher dividend yield is preferred. In this case, Lockheed is outperforming its peers again with a dividend yield higher than Northrop and Raytheon. Lockheed's dividend yield is also higher than the industry's dividend yield, which makes its stock attractively priced.For these three companies the last five years' dividend yield range is shown below:All figures in %It is clear from the above table that Lockheed is most attractive in the above mentioned lot based on the past five years' dividend yield. Northrop's current dividend yield is 2.41, which is close to lowest dividend yield in five years. Similarly, the current dividend yield of Raytheon is near to 1.80%, its minimum dividend yield in the past five years. The current dividend yield of these two companies is also lower than their respective average dividend yield.On the other hand, the current dividend yield of Lockheed is close to its five-year maximum value and is higher than the five-year average value. Additionally, Lockheed has a long history of increasing its annual dividend. It has continuously increased its dividend over the past 10 years. Lockheed declared a dividend of $1.15 per share for the third quarter of fiscal year 2013 on June 27, 2013. This dividend is an increase of 15% from the dividend of the same quarter last year.LMT Dividend data by YChartsConclusion:In our earlier article, we preferred Boeing over Lockheed for its approache regarding U.S. defense cuts. However, we are upgrading our view on Lockheed's approache with its international expansion plan. Its strong valuation also supports it future growth perspective. These factors hint at promising returns from the Lockheed, thereby indicating a 'buy'.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Because at the end of the day, if you are an investor, you are buying the business. The FAST Graphs™ presented with this article will focus first on the business behind the stock. The orange line on the graph plots earnings per share since 2001. A quick glance vividly reveals the historical operating record of the company.Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE:LMT) is a global security and aerospace company that employs about 118,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products, and services. This article will reveal the business prospects of Lockheed Martin through the lens of FAST Graphs fundamentals analyzer software tool. Therefore, it is offered as the first step before a more comprehensive research effort. Our objective is to provide companies that have excellent historical records and appear reasonably priced based on past, present and future data and expectations.A quick glance at the graph itself and the orange earnings justified valuation line will tell the readers volumes about how well the company has historically been managed and performed as an operating business. Simply put, the reader should ask whether this example is worthy of a greater investment of their time and effort based on the data as presented and organized. The FAST Graphs' unique advantage is the graphical articulation of the price value proposition.Earnings Determine Market Price: The following earnings and price correlated F.A.S.T. Graphs™ clearly illustrates the importance of earnings. The Earnings Growth Rate Line or True Worth™ Line (orange line with white triangles) is correlated with the historical stock price line. On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem. If the stock price strays away from the earnings line (over or under), inevitably it will come back to earnings.Earnings and Price Correlated Fundamentals-at-a-GlanceA quick glance at the historical earnings and price correlated FAST Graphs™ on Lockheed Martin shows a picture of undervaluation based on the historical earnings growth rate of 16% and a current P/E of 12.3. Analysts are forecasting the earnings growth to continue at about 6.8%, and when you look at the forecasting graph below, the stock appears undervalued (it's inside of the value corridor of the five orange lines -- based on future growth).Lockheed Martin: Historical Earnings, Price, Dividends and Normal P/E Since 2001Click to enlarge images.Performance Table -- Lockheed MartinThe associated performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph, validates the principles regarding the two components of total return: capital appreciation and dividend income. Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid, but not reinvested.When presented separately like this, the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident. In addition to the 9.7% annualized ROR (without dividend) (green circle), long-term shareholders of Lockheed Martin, assuming an initial investment of $10,000, would have received an additional $6,332.79 in total dividends paid (blue highlighting) that increased their annualized ROR (without dividend) from 9.7% to a total annualized ROR plus dividends paid of 11.3% vs. 2.7% in the S&P 500.The following graph plots the historical P/E ratio (the dark blue line) in conjunction with 10-year Treasury note interest. Notice that the current price/earnings ratio on this quality company is as low as it has been since 2001.A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company's current P/S ratio relative to its historical P/S ratio. The current P/S ratio for Lockheed Martin is .73, which is historically low.Looking to the FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long-term returns are a function of two critical determinants:Forecasting future earnings growth, bought at sound valuations, is the key to safe, sound and profitable performance. The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities. Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component toward making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions.The consensus of 22 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast Lockheed Martin's long-term earnings growth at 6.8%. Lockheed Martin has high long-term debt at 95% of capital. It is currently trading at a P/E of 12.3, which is inside the value corridor (defined by the five orange lines) of a maximum P/E of 18. If the earnings materialize as forecast, based on forecast earnings growth of 6.8%, Lockheed Martin's share price would $177.48 at the end of 2018 (brown circle on EYE Chart), which would represent a 12.8% annual rate of total return -- which includes dividends paid (yellow highlighting).Earnings Yield EstimatesDiscounted Future Cash Flows: All companies derive their value from the future cash flows (earnings) they are capable of generating for their stakeholders over time. Therefore, because earnings determine market price in the long run, we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay.Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments, it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low-risk Treasury bonds. Comparing an investment in Lockheed Martin to an equal investment in 10-year Treasury bonds illustrates that Lockheed Martin's expected earnings would be 4.2 (purple circle) times that of the 10-year T-bond interest (see EYE chart below). This is the essence of the importance of proper valuation as a critical investing component.Summary and ConclusionsThis report presented essential ""fundamentals at a glance"" illustrating the past and present valuation based on earnings achievements as reported. Future forecasts for earnings growth are based on the consensus of leading analysts. Although with just a quick glance you can know a lot about the company, it's imperative that the reader conducts their own due diligence in order to validate whether the consensus estimates seem reasonable or not.Disclosure: I am long LMT.

1386011,36191,2013-04-30T15:56:24-04:00,,"The aviation industry only has a few players, but these players are in a big and mean business. Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) do not compete directly with their primary products, but many of their remaining products challenge each other. Boeing's latest Dreamliner has recently been marred by battery problems, which have kept travelers, airlines and stockholders worried sick. Lockheed Martin has the unusual problem of worrying about a drop in the number of wars around the world, which will dent the demand for its equipment. The two stocks are closely priced, so which one should you go for?AnalysisBoeing has had a long tradition of providing quality commercial airliners and is only rivaled by the European Airbus. The two companies have taken different routes in going about their businesses. While Boeing has adopted efficiency in the form of composite deposits and lower costs of operation, Airbus went for size and the supposed economies of scale. Both have been rewarded in one way or another, but Boeing's Dreamliner has had a lot more trouble recently, mainly by being grounded due to a problem with its Lithium ion batteries. Latest reports suggest, however, that after engaging in 200,000 hours of engineering, Boeing has devised solutions to remedy the problem, resulting in the planes no longer being grounded. That being said, the order list for the Chicago based company have been growing ever since, with Turkish Airlines agreeing to buy 95 new Dreamliners over the course of seven years. The total number of purchase orders for the plane so far have been 840. Furthermore, the grounding of its 787s has had little effect on the company's financials with net income for the first three months of 2013 jumping by 20% to $1.1 billion. The company has also increased its production rate for its 737 and 777 models. The halt in 787 deliveries is expected to cost $705 million, resulting in the company's free cash flow to drop to $3 million from $413 million a year earlier as it continued to push 787 production. However, the yet-to-be-delivered 787s are expected to recover the deferred cash flow as shipments resume.Lockheed, which builds F-35 fighter jets, Aegis missiles and new coastal warships, reported a better-than-expected 14.8% rise in per-share earnings. The company's first-quarter net profit rose 14% to $761 million. The company is more than a 100 years old and in its quest to find new and more profitable proving grounds, Lockheed Martin has entertained commercial ventures at sea. The U.S. Navy has awarded Lockheed Martin a $57 million contract to upgrade the fleet's electronic warfare defenses against anti-ship missile threats. While finding these new opportunities, the company is staying true to its core competency as it expects to be awarded orders for up to 71 F-35s from the U.S. and other foreign governments. Lockheed and other arms makers are trying to maintain earnings by cutting overhead and ramping up weapons sales to other countries. Even though its military capacity is earning it top returns, rumors suggest that the company is going to diversify and look into non-military avenues of revenue.Stock and Financial ReviewOver time, the aviation industry has become a necessity due to the development of the European and American markets. Despite this, the volatility of airline demand is causing more anxiety now than ever before due to skyrocketing fuel prices and a slowdown in global demand. Over the last five years, the percentage growth of BA and LMT has been below the market averages. While it has been providing a considerable and incremental dividend over the years, which goes to justify holding it, BA's low yielding dividend and inability to keep up with market averages is causing a lot of concern for its stock holders. The graph below illustrates the two companies and their performances over the course of the last year.After spending Q3 of 2012 and Q4 of 2012 underperforming when compared to its rival and the market, too, Boeing has picked up steam, which has propelled its stock price up, resulting in an increase of 20.16% compared to a year ago. This is primarily due to the increased production of the 737 and 777 models, while the 787 was also marketed to various airlines across the world.Boeing's 52-week range starts at $66.82 and ends at $93.38 per share. Boeing's current price is $91.89 per share. Lockheed Martin's 52-week range starts from $80.14 and ends at $99.49 per share. Its current price is $98.27 per share.There are many ways to estimate the fair stock value of a company. For this purpose, we applied the discounted-earnings-plus-equity model developed by EFS Investment analysts to these competitors.Data from Morningstar and Financial Visualizations on April 30, 2013The calculations based on this model allow us to suggest the following: currently, both stocks are undervalued. EFS's fair stock price valuation indicates that LMT is trading at the most attractive discount.Boeing's $70.4 billion market capitalization dwarfs that of Lockheed Martin. However, Lockheed Martin's stellar dividend yield of 4.34% makes it a lot more attractive for investors looking not only for stable price trends but also a healthy cash return. The dividend for Q2 of 2013 has been recently announced at $1.15 per share. The dividend is payable on June 28, 2013 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 3, 2013. LMT pays a good dividend and has actually increased its dividend every year since 2003, including this latest announcement of a dividend payout.Furthermore, the preposterous debt/equity ratio of Lockheed Martin shouldn't be alarming as the industry and nature of its work requires a large amount of debt to be taken on in order to complete required projects. Boeing has an advantage in this respect because its product facility is one of the largest in the world, and can accommodate different types of aircraft, even the newly designed, without the requirement of too much external support.Make or Break for InvestorsAt this point in time, my recommendation lies with Boeing because of the exploding demand for its planes. Lockheed Martin, while doing pretty well on its own and providing a brilliant yield, is expected to suffer in the future due to the automatic federal spending cuts - i.e., the sequester. The government budget cut is expected to wipe out $825 million of the company's anticipated revenue by the end of this year.Morningstar provides the following ratings for these two stocks: BA - 4/8 buy, 3/8 hold, 1/8 sell. LMT - 2/6 buy, 4/6 hold.Bottom LineAs long as Boeing's new Dreamliner does not hit any other snags, it is on course to buck the trend of under performance and gain altitude. This should become clear in the next month or so, and, keeping in mind the company's immaculate aircraft history, I believe now is the right time to buy before the price moves upward.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1356721,32361,2013-04-21T09:16:39-04:00,,"It's no surprise that defense contractors like Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) are desperately trying to diversify their business mix. The government is a big customer, but in this age of belt tightening, Lockheed needs to branch out if it wants to survive. The company is doing just that, pursuing a variety of projects outside the realm of government contracts. Today we will take a look at three of Lockheed's diversification efforts. Each project serves as an important step forward, and together they provide three reasons investors should consider buying Lockheed Martin stock.1. LNG tanks In March, Lockheed announced it was making a $3 million capital investment to develop liquefied natural gas tanks for transportation and storage. The company is using its experience manufacturing tanks for space shuttles to get into the LNG business. The increasing importance of natural gas on a global scale makes this a smart investment for Lockheed. The company has already received initial orders for the tanks, and it expects demand to grow.Indeed, companies like Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Cheniere Energy (NYSEMKT:LNG) are both quickly working to finish LNG export facilities in the next two years. At the beginning of this year, the industry was capable of producing 290 million tons per year, and some estimates for LNG see supplies rising 4.5% per year through to 2030.2. Fusion Nuclear fusion is an ambitious goal if there ever was one, but that's exactly what the company is working on at its secretive Skunk Works facility in California. Few specific details are known about the project, but as The New York Times reported last month, the company is aiming to develop small, modular fusion reactors that could be made in factories. If -- and this is obviously a big ""if"" -- Lockheed were to reach its goal the development would be nothing short of game-changing.3. Perforene The third reason to consider picking up some Lockheed Martin stock is a product called Perforene. It is a thin carbon membrane, called graphene, with perforations about a nanometer big that filters salt from water. The thinness of the filter (it is only one-atom thick) means the energy required to push salt water through the filter is considerably less -- 100 times less, according to Lockheed -- than what is needed for other filtration systems.The filter is still in its development phase, but Lockheed expects to be able to commercialize it by 2014 or 2015. It would slash the cost of filtering water at a time when world demand for clean water is reaching unprecedented levels.Tackling the world's energy problems with forward-thinking ideas is a brilliant strategy for diversifying a business away from government defense contracts. We will always need energy, and increasingly there is money to be made by whoever can develop cleaner energy, or find ways to use less of it. Lockheed is targeting those problems and I think it will pay off down the road. You might say the same for buying Lockheed Martin stock.4. NemesisLockheed Martin successfully demonstrated the launch, guided flight, target acquisition and precision strike capability of its Nemesis missile in three flight tests at White Sands Missile Range, N.M. Nemesis is a man-portable, surface-launched missile that enables warfighters to engage targets with precision lethality from as close as 100 meters to well beyond the line of sight. The missile can be employed during dismounted operations as well as be adapted for employment from various ground, maritime or airborne platforms.In the first two tests, Nemesis demonstrated vertical launch, GPS navigation to targets located at distances of eight and 12 kilometers, engagement by the missile's semi-active laser (SAL) seeker and live warhead detonation. In both flights, Nemesis performed flawlessly, destroying the intended targets. The successful third shot demonstrated the vertical launch of an inert round, followed by GPS-only navigation to a target positioned just 100 meters away. Nemesis is fired vertically from its launch tube, enabling 360-degree engagement capability. A combat-proven rocket motor, deployable wing and GPS guidance enable the missile to engage targets in excess of 12 kilometers. The missile's SAL seeker activates in the terminal phase of flight to provide precision accuracy and minimize collateral damage. The user is also able to select height of burst or point-detonation fusing options to optimize lethality against enemy personnel, light armored vehicles and structures.Nemesis's ability to be deployed from airborne Common Launch Tubes fulfills existing Special Operations Forces and U.S. Marine Corps requirements for a standoff precision guided munitions. The missile can also be configured for internal or external carriage on other fixed- and rotary-wing platforms. Nemesis's versatility enables it to contribute to a wide array of critical missions. Lockheed Martin funded the development of the Nemesis missile, building upon proven technologies from demonstrated systems, including HELLFIRE II, DAGR and Scorpion. Using components from these systems reduces risk and shortens the time from initial development to participation in government-funded flight tests. Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control is a 2012 recipient of the U.S. Department of Commerce's Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award for performance excellence. The Malcolm Baldrige Award represents the highest honor that can be awarded to American companies for achievement in leadership, strategic planning, customer relations, measurement, analysis, workforce excellence, operations and business results.Headquartered in Bethesda, Md., Lockheed Martin is a global security and aerospace company that employs about 120,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products, and services. The Corporation's net sales for 2012 were $47.2 billion.

1349741,47601,2013-04-18T02:50:41-04:00,,"Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has been at the back of my mind for a while now, teasing me with a 5% yield before the recent market run-up. Now that we've had our run up, LMT is at its highest price since September 2008. Sure, we're having a market rally this year but what about all those macro issues against defense contractors in general? Debt ceilings, sequestration and a war or two ending should keep the defense sector in check but Mr. Market seems to think otherwise.LMT has been brought to the forefront of my mind thanks to a friend looking for a good yield on a new investment. With LMT reporting on April 23, I would like to share the results of my research so that any others considering a purchase may have some extra data.The GoodFirst, let's consider the earnings numbers of LMT.They did well during the boom and started a rough patch in 2009. Last year they actually seemed to be doing well again on an EPS basis.Now, as everyone here should be aware, LMT pays a good dividend and has actually increased their dividend every year since 2003. Here is a graph showing the declared date of the increased dividend since 2003: Note that LMT increased the dividend twice in 2003 but we are only considering the highest dividend declared in 2003 when calculating the Rolling 5 Year Growth. It's also worth pointing out that each of their rolling averages are above a 20% increase. That translates to the dividend doubling every four years. Furthermore, the average individual dividend increase is 25%! Combined with the first graph it is easy to see that, so far in our data, the dividend is easily covered by the EPS.Next, let's review the sales that all earnings are derived from as well as the earnings each year. All amounts in are millions of dollars: Here is where the concern starts to creep in. Net Sales have actually continuously increased since 2003. However, net earnings decreased for a few years. This actually matches the 2009 - 2011 ""rough patch"" from the first chart where earnings were generally flat for LMT. Again though, 2012 returns to upward progress and we see an increase.Finally, I want to review the money spent on buybacks and dividends since 2003. Again all values are millions of dollars: What jumps out at me is the total amount of buybacks we see, especially 2006 - 2011. Not shown are numbers for stock compensation but they are relatively low, around $160 million a year. Now, we can clearly see that 2012 was a change of pace with regards to returning cash to shareholders. For the first time since 2003 LMT paid out more in dividends than they spent on buybacks. While that is taken into overall consideration of LMT remember that many companies chose to focus on dividends of some kind, not buybacks, at the end of 2012 as we faced the potential for a large increase in the dividend tax rate.The BadWe have seen that the more recent years of LMT show a slowdown in a few key financial areas. In the 2009 - 2011 timeframe net earnings floundered and EPS stagnated. However, I think it would be hard to find companies that weren't affected by the Great Recession during this time. Net sales actually increased, but earnings did decrease although it's not like the earnings fell off a cliff.We do have to remember that the vast majority of LMT's net sales are to the US government--in 2012 it was actually 82%. Currently we are bracing to feel the effects of Sequestration where the government reduces defense spending. And we repeatedly encounter the debt ceiling. And the United States is winding down the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. So all is gloom and doom, right?Hardly. Everyone in the defense sector will be affected to some extent but let's bear in mind a few relevant points. First, the United States has increased its debt ceiling twelve (12) times since the beginning of 2003. Somehow I think we're going to raise it again in the future. Secondly, the United States will probably cut defense spending to some extent but that isn't going to eliminate the many year to year contracts for development or maintenance already in place to service its defense needs. Third, even with the end of active combat areas like Iraq and Afghanistan we have no lack of saber rattling around the world, especially from North Korea. We are not here to debate about the efficacy of any missiles that North Korea may possess but LMT just got a $775 million dollar contract to deliver Patriot missile systems. Even without being engaged in active hostilities around the world I think it's safe to say that the United States and its allies will continue to invest in counter measures like this. Sure, there are always competitive concerns like Raytheon (RTN), Boeing (NYSE:BA) or United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) but competition is a given in business. And at this time the biggest concern is about the United States' defense spending in general, not a particular competitor.The UpcomingAll things considered I believe LMT has done well for itself during the Great Recession, debt ceiling limits and the decrease of the United States involvement in foreign wars. The numbers from 2012 show an improvement in earnings. There will continue to be a domestic and foreign market for the goods and services LMT provides.Given LMT's net earnings compared to their sales since 2003 it looks like the biggest contributor to EPS and dividend growth is actually the substantial buybacks. While buybacks are a valid use of a company's money I would rather see continuously increase earnings to match the increasing sales.Still, the second chart demonstrates LMT's generously increasing dividend. Earnings are not rising fast enough to support the current dividend's growth rate but the dividend itself is not in danger. LMT has a ten year streak of increasing their dividends which shows a commitment to the policy of increasing dividends. Last year they bought back $990 million of shares so hopefully the annual buyback war chest would be reduced before any dividend cut was initiated. I am very surprised to see a company with a current yield of 4.70% that grows at an average of 25% a year. Given that continued growth rate I would normally expect the yield to be much lower, around 1.5% or less.LMT is due to report on April 23 so we should see how it is affected by the beginning rumblings of sequestration. I very much doubt we'll see a huge negative event although I imagine any nonpositive news will be regarded like the sky is falling for the defense sector overall.Currently, LMT is hitting 52 week highs even with a 11.5x P/E ratio. The dividend yield is about 4.70% currently. Even though LMT is at a multiyear high I do not think it is overvalued at this time. Given LMT's dividend yield and surprising growth rate I eagerly await their next earnings report and would consider initiating a position if they demonstrate flat or better results.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

In my opinion, the current weakness is a great opportunity for a long-term investment in this bellwether company.In this article, I will give the corresponding fundamental parameters for this great company, and the reasons I think that now it is a good time to buy this stock. Nonetheless, these data and my opinion should only serve as a basis for further research. All the data for this article were taken from Yahoo Finance on February 12, before the market open.Lockheed Martin Corporation, is a security and aerospace company that engages in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, and sustainment of advanced technology systems and products in the areas of defense, space, intelligence, homeland security, information technology, and cyber security in the United States and internationally.The two tables below present some important valuation metrics and dividend information.On January 24, Lockheed Martin reported its results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2012, which missed EPS expectations by $0.09 and beat expectations on revenues. Lockheed said that it earned $569 million, or $1.73 per share, down from $683 million, or $2.09 per share, in the fourth quarter of last year. Revenue fell to $12.1 billion from $12.21 billion. Analysts, on average, had expected a profit of $1.82 per share on $11.17 billion in revenue. Lockheed said that revenue fell at its information systems and space systems units, but increased slightly at its aeronautics, missiles and fire control, and mission systems and training businesses.The company said that for the full year 2012, it earned $2.75 billion, or $8.36 per share, compared to $2.66 billion, or $7.81 per share, in 2011. Lockheed said that revenue increased to $47.18 billion from $46.5 billion.For 2013, Lockheed projected a profit of between $8.80 and $9.10 per share, on sales of $44.5 billion to $46 billion. The average estimate of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was a profit of $8.28 a share on sales of $45.3 billion.In the report, Marillyn Hewson, Chief Executive Officer and President, said:Lockheed Martin daily chartChart: finviz.comLockheed Martin long-term price chartLockheed Martin long-term price-to-sales ratio chartLockheed Martin has a long history of steadily increasing dividend payment. The table and the charts below present the dividend rates, the dividend yields and the dividend rate of growth for the past five years, 10 years and 20 years.The table below presents the total return and the compound annual growth rate (OTC:CAGR) of holding the LMT stock for the last five years, 10 years and 20 years. The returns without dividends (capital gains) and with dividends are shown separately, in order to emphasize the importance of the dividend yield.Holding the LMT stock during the last five years has given a minimal average annual return of 0.1%, without the dividends the average annual return would be a loss of 4.1%. Holding the LMT stock during the last 10 years has given a nice average annual return of 9.4%, and during the last 20 years a quite high average annual return of 10.7%.SummaryA good time to start a long-term investment in a blue chip company, which has a long history of steadily increasing dividend payment, is when due to temporary weakness its dividend yield is historically high. This is the case of Lockheed Martin right now, where the forward annual dividend yield is at 5.20%, much higher than the five year average dividend yield at 4.10%. Furthermore, the compelling valuation metrics; trailing P/E of 10.47, forward P/E of 9.60 and price-to-sales ratio of 0.60, are all factors that make LMT stock a great buy right now.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in LMT over the next 72 hours.

The relationship between price and valuation is what matters more than anything else. Let's take a look at what we think of Lockheed's valuation because we already know its price.At Valuentum, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index, which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. Essentially, we're looking for firms that overlap investment methodologies, thereby revealing the greatest interest by investors (we like firms that fall in the center of the diagram below). Valuentum followers know that more interest in a stock means that there will be more buying, which suggests a higher stock price.If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis, it scores high on our scale. Lockheed Martin posts a VBI score of 6 on our scale, reflecting our 'fairly valued' DCF assessment of the firm, its unattractive relative valuation versus peers, and bullish technicals. We compare Lockheed Martin to peers Boeing (NYSE:BA), General Dynamics (NYSE:GD), and Raytheon (RTN).Our Report on Lockheed MartinInvestment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• Lockheed Martin earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. We expect the firm's return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) to expand to 45.1% from 40.6% during the next two years.• Lockheed Martin is a global security and aerospace company that is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services.• Lockheed Martin has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 6.6% in coming years. Total debt-to- EBITDA was 1.4 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 86.6%.• The firm's share price performance has been roughly in line with that of the market during the past quarter. We'd expect the firm's stock price to converge to our fair value estimate within the next three years, if our forecasts prove accurate.• The firm sports a very nice dividend yield of 4.9%. We expect the firm to pay out about 54% of next year's earnings to shareholders as dividends. Its Valuentum Dividend Cushion is 1.3.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Lockheed Martin's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 36.7%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 9.8%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Lockheed Martin's free cash flow margin has averaged about 6% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Lockheed Martin, cash flow from operations increased about 34% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 4% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisThe estimated fair value of $83 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 10.6 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 8.8 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 0.6% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 2.9%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 9.1%, which is above Lockheed Martin's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.4% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Lockheed Martin, we use a 9.8% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $83 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Lockheed Martin. We think the firm is attractive below $62 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $104 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Lockheed Martin's fair value at this point in time to be about $83 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Lockheed Martin's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $99 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $83 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1200491,43981,2013-02-18T09:26:43-05:00,,"The ArgumentIf you are an active stock trader or someone who monitors the market closely you certainly have heard all the recent talk of a pullback in the market. The age old battle between the bulls and bears is heating up with the bears starting to gain momentum. The S&P has seen gains so far this year of over 8 percent. It seems just yesterday when I was playing the 138/139 call spread on the SPY. The bears are making the argument that the market is overbought therefore it is in need of a pullback. To add fuel to the bearish argument is the pending spending cuts that are slated to take effect March 1st.If you have read my previous posts you will see that I have been warning of this sequester since January. I started establishing puts on the QQQ and I purchased some VXX calls in anticipation of higher volatility. I plan on buying some vertical put spreads starting this week on the SPY but I will save that for a different post early next week.Last week the president held a press conference stating to the public that he will be asking congress to delay the spending sequester, to provide additional time. The delay would address the spending cuts during the budget debate that the administration is required to draft. That of course is due to the congress stipulation of its approval of raising the debt ceiling, otherwise we would have another year of a stale and outdated budget.I am not writing to predict if congress will allow the sequester to happen or a grand bargain will be reached to avoid the whole thing, but I will give my opinion. I think there are stubborn people on Capitol Hill, and I think that many congressman and senators, democrats and republicans alike, see the sequester as an inevitable event. I think it will be interesting to see what happens now after the president's state of the union on Tuesday.If the sequester happens, the already beaten down defense sector can, and in my opinion, will, drop further. If you look at the breakdown of the spending cuts it calls for a 50/50 between defense and discretionary spending. I don't know about you but I think 50 percent of the cuts affecting the defense industry doesn't sound good for the sector.Based off this information, I wanted to know what defense companies have the most exposure to government spending. This led me to a Seeking Alpha article showing that the top three by exposure are Northrum Gruman (NYSE:NOC) at an astounding 92 percent, Raytheon (RTN) at a lower 88 percent, and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) at 84 percent.During my research I found an interesting study by Bloomberg where the spending sequester impact was evaluated. The conclusion of the presentation states that the top three companies that may be hurt the worst due to the cuts on the defense and discretionary side are Lockheed Martin, SAIC (SAI), and Booz Allen (NYSE:BAH). The common denominator of the two lists is Lockheed Martin. I also noticed something very bearish on SAIC but I will post that separately.With this information, the question is will Lockheed Martin have the ability to sustain the current prices after having cuts to both its defensive and discretionary spending exposure? Chris Mathews of Meet the Press Friday morning reported that the Department of Transportation, in particular the FAA, will be hit with a 10 percent budget decrease. A simple Google search of ""Lockheed Martin FAA contracts"" shows that they have large exposure on new software enhancements for that government area.Lockheed Martin does not only have a large exposure to the spending sequester but the company also has a large exposure to current war efforts that are coming to an imminent end. Lockheed Martin is a fantastic company, they have been a pinnacle of the US defense industry for many years and have always attracted the best talent. With that talent came high pay resulting in high pensions from previous decades. If Lockheed Martin's sales and revenues are impacted due to the ending wars and future spending cuts then the profit margins will be extremely impacted.Even Lockheed Martin themselves expressed an indirect concern on their latest Q4 earnings conference call when they stated the following prior to giving 2013 outlooks:The concern is highlighted again in the conclusion of the report when LMT stated while once again referring to potential impacts on the 2013 earnings outlook:And once more when referring to potential unexpected costs:The good news for LMT is the president is expected to extend and make permanent the R&D Tax credit when he proposes his 2013 budget. This tax credit was explicitly called out in the earnings report as being a factor in LMT's EPS estimates. But even with the credit added into the estimate, LMT only guided $8.80 - $9.10 EPS for 2013. That is above the 2012 number of $8.36 but is not rapid growth by any stretch. A concerning fact for all LMT investors is if LMT is not accounting for any spending cuts in 2013 and they only guided .44 cents on the low end above last year's EPS, then what will happen if there is spending cuts?The FundamentalsThere is no question that LMT is a fantastic company and has been so for many years. 88 percent of the shares are owned by institutions, which is proof enough that large professional investors believe in LMT; but if you look at the fundamentals, especially compared to previous years' fundamentals, the foreseeable future does not look so promising.Looking at the two charts above, you can see that cash and short term investments are considerably below the 2011 levels, in fact these levels are at a five year low. When you compare this against LMT's current debt the results are alarming.LMT has debt levels that are just fractionally lower than the 2011 levels. The table below shows the total liability breakdown for the 5 year period of 2008 to 2012.Looking at the Operating Cash Flow from the same time period, it is can be realized that LMT is generating less income from operations than in previous years. It's interesting to point out that while total cash from operations has decreased, Operating Income has increased from 2011 levels, pointing to a much higher rate of CAPEX spending.This brings into question LMT's margins. When you compare the profit margins of LMT to the Aerospace & Defense industry median you will see that Lockheed is considerably lower than its peers.The following table shows LMT compared to the industry average.LMT is a highly leveraged company. The Total Capital ratio is 99.39% which is extremely higher than the industry average of 48.17%. Although I do not envision LMT having any problems repaying their debt, the high debt to capital ratio leaves Lockheed very vulnerable to future government cuts and possible loss of revenue.It is important to note that LMT does pay a very nice dividend to its shareholders. The table below shows the dividend payout from 2008 to 2012. The $4.15 paid out to shareholders in 2012 was well above the 2.14 industry average.The TechnicalsIf you look at the three year chart of LMT and analyze the major pullbacks that the stock had you will see the 3 year low occurred between the week of November 29th 2010 and December 6th 2010. Consequently on 11/29/2010 President Obama signed a bill to freeze government employee compensation due to deficit problems - which were much less severe compared to our current deficit issues.The next pullback was on 8/8/2011. This pullback could potentially be discarded because that was when the USA was downgraded from our AAA rating. One could also read into the pullback and make the argument that the drastic sell off of over 10 percent was due to the fear of spending cuts.When looking at a company's technicals, the first chart I like to look at is the Point and Figure (P&F) charts provided by stockcharts.com. I will write about the basics of P&F charting in a future post, for now take solace in the fact that the charts represent past performance and future demand. These charts are very useful in predicting reversals and trends.Looking at the P&F chart for LMT we see that it has hit a double bottom breakdown.After seeing that the short term technicals point to a bearish pattern, I decided to look at the all time chart for LMT. I realized that starting in 2003 the stock started a climb from 50 dollars a share to the current price of over 85 dollars a share. The argument can be made that the slow and steady climb was supplemented by the over-spending of the government that will soon be reversed.To support my bearish argument, last week LMT closed below its 50 day moving average. The last time this happened was August 2011 and the stock went on to chart a 8 dollar decline for close to a 20 percent pullback.The Trade If you own Lockheed Martin and have made profits from the stock over the past several years then I would consider lowering my exposure to the stock. Take some profits but don't close the position totally; after all, they are Lockheed Martin.I personally think that there are going to be some kind of spending cuts to defense. I think it's inevitable and will for all intents and purposes be good for the economy in the long run.I don't know if the sequester will happen or not on March 1st, but I do think that even if the sequester is avoided or delayed until the budget talks in May, the end result will be at a minimum moderate defense cuts.All this does not bode well for LMT. The trade that I like is to play the 85/82.50 Mar 13 Vertical Put Spread. This gives me 33 days till expiration for LMT to pull back. Below is a breakdown of the trade. The most I can lose is the 80.75 that I am putting up. I have a Max profit of 180 bucks if LMT falls below 82.50 by expiration. Anything below 85.70 puts the trade into the profit.Disclosure: I am short LMT. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it.

Lockheed Martin has an excellent 5% dividend yield, that is well supported by its diverse product portfolio, and continued share buybacks. Lockheed is the undisputed leader in next-gen fighter aircraft, receiving a $385 billion government contract for its F-35 fighter jet. The company's continued market dominance, and financial stability will allow it to withstand federal budget cuts, and maintain a healthy dividend for years to come.Maintaining and Growing its Dividend(Source: 2012 Q3 10-Q & 2012 Q4 Earnings Transcript)RisksConclusionThe bottom line is, dividend investors can't go wrong with Lockheed Martin. Its won't be disappearing anytime soon, and its dividend doesn't seem to stop growing. The dividend yield has more than quadrupled over the past 5 years, and will continue to be enhanced with share buybacks. Lockheed Martin is in an excellent industry, and has created a large economic moat to ward off competition. It's P/E of 10.2x is almost exactly what it was during the recession, thus giving investors an excellent opportunity to buy in.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in LMT over the next 72 hours.

1128061,23479,2013-01-23T14:51:04-05:00,,"Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) will announce its fourth quarter and full year 2012 earnings on Thursday, January 24. The defense contractor will likely post lower revenues in Q4 due to reduced contract volume and its winding down of certain defense programs like the F-22. However, the fourth quarter earnings will benefit from increased F-35 production and the absence of cash contributions towards pension costs.For full year 2012, Lockheed has forecast revenues in the range of $45.5-$46.5 billion compared to $46.5 billion in 2011, and earnings in the range of $8.20-$8.40 per share compared to $7.90 per share in 2011. We currently have a stock price estimate of $93.21 for the company, approximately in-line with the current market price.Winding Down The F-22 programFinal deliveries of the F-22 were completed in the second quarter of 2012, and thereafter the production was halted, citing high unit costs for F-22 and delays in Russian and Chinese fifth-generation fighter jets. A total of 187 F-22s were built for the U.S. defense forces. Currently, support activities are continuing under the program. We expect Lockheed’s Q4 top-line will be impacted by the winding down of F-22 production.Declining U.S. Defense SpendingDue to a constrained fiscal environment in the U.S., overall contract volume for Lockheed has declined as well. The company receives a majority of its contracts from the U.S. government. In 2011, around 82% of Lockheed’s revenues came from the U.S. government, including around 61% from the Department of Defense (DoD). U.S. defense spending is set to decline by $487 billion over a 10-year period starting from government fiscal year 2012, as required by the Budget Controls Act. Further, spending cuts will likely be applicable across all U.S. defense programs. This will exert a significant negative impact on Lockheed, as the company is highly dependent on U.S. defense spending.Increased F-35 ProductionHowever, the impact from the winding down of F-22 program and lower contract volume will be partially offset by increased production activity under low rate initial production (LRIP) contracts for the F-35. At present, the company has received production orders for 95 F-35s and delivered only 26 through the end of the third quarter of 2012. Deliveries against the remaining production orders will drive earnings growth in the fourth quarter and near term.Lockheed anticipates to produce a total of 3,100 F-35s for the defense forces of the U.S. and 10 other partner countries.Zero Pension ContributionsEarnings in the fourth quarter will also receive a boost from zero cash contribution towards under funded pension liabilities. Lockheed contributed $1.1 billion towards pension costs in the first three quarters of 2012, which fulfilled its funding obligation for 2012, compared to approximately $1 billion and $2.3 billion in Q4 2011 and full year 2011, respectively.See our complete analysis of Lockheed here.Disclosure: No positions."
1097881,24276,2013-01-07T09:23:25-05:00,,"In the face of declining defense budgets, investors should ask how long Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) can keep paying shareholders the $1/share quarterly dividend currently yielding 4.9%.Despite being a capital-intensive business, LMT keeps its debt-to-assets ratio at a low 17%, and delivers over $4 billion in free cash flow each year. The only thing shareholders seem to have to fear is fear itself, namely fear that projects will be eliminated as a ""peace dividend"" is declared.To forestall that, LMT has been on an acquisition binge aimed mainly at drone technology. Procerus in 2011, Chandler/May in 2012, AME last month - it's all about drones and drone-related technology.While some workers are looking at lay-offs, meanwhile, the company is still fighting for new money, extending its aircraft line with foreign sales.But reality is going to bite. When LMT announced a $1.9 billion satellite contract recently, you had to look closely to note that's a 10-year deal, so you're only talking about $190 million/year. The company is moving into health IT, but the numbers there are also barely $150 million/year - this is a company whose most recent year had sales of almost $47 billion.That dividend costs the company $1.4 billion/year, roughly, which is about half the total annual earnings. Despite the high dividend, the company continues to build cash, and now has $3.5 billion on its balance sheet. So the dividend should be safe for a few years at least.Investors who care about yield should keep some LMT in their portfolios, and probably buy more on dips, but there will come a time for getting out of it, and you want to keep an eye on it every quarter to make sure the deal flow is maintained. Current talk of defense cuts is an opportunity, but keep your eye on the exits. My guess is you have a good two-or-three year run ahead of you, but watch the dividend more closely than the stock price, and be ready to bounce out in the face of any serious threat to it.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

In the long list of dividend paying aerospace stocks, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is our most preferred name.LMTThe stock has a dividend yield of 4.91%. The company has a rich history with regards to dividend payments. From time to time, the company has been increasing its dividends. Around September end, the company increased its dividend from $1/ share to $1.15/share. The forward dividend yield of the stock came out to be 4.97%.3rd Quarter EarningsOn October 24, LMT reported third quarter EPS of $2.21. This was well above the consensus EPS of $1.85. The company also topped revenue estimates. However, revenue of $11.9 billion (above the $11.2 billion consensus) was down 2.1% YoY.Much to investors' delight, LMT raised its revenue outlook by $500 million to $45.5-46.5 billion. EPS outlook was raised to $8.20 - $8.40, from $7.90 - $8.10. The company is also expecting improved liquidity through a rise of $125 million in forecasted operating profits. The operating profits for the year are now expected to be in the range of $4.15-$4.25 billion.SequestrationAccording to an earlier plan, Obama's administration had planned to implement budget cuts in the next term, which was an ominous sign for the whole of the industry. The administration planned to cut $400 billion in the next decade, with a $55 billion cut for each year. However, Obama surprised everyone when he recently vowed in a campaign address that he will do everything to stop the sequestration. This has sent bullish signs to the market. Had this not happened, the budget cuts would have meant a major restructuring of the whole industry, as smaller fish would have joined with the large fish to gather the remaining orders in the market.In the earnings release, LMT provided preliminary guidance for 2013, based on the assumption that sequestration would not take place and Congress would approve a fiscal budget which is consistent with the President's proposed budget. The company expects revenue for 2013 to slip by a low single-digit figure, from the figure for 2012. Also, the company expects the operating margin to remain above 11%.Shares RepurchaseLMT repurchased 3.3 million shares worth $294 million during 3Q12 and $708 million year-to-date. The company stated, during a conference call, that it expects to return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks, but it did not give specific guidance. During the first half of the year, the company used $428 million to repurchase 4.9 million shares. Up till now, the company has used a total of more than $4 billion to buy back more than 48 million shares. The current Outstanding Shares figure stands at 323 million.Cash Flows And DebtFree Cash Flows, after CAPEX and dividends, was $1.0 billion in 3Q12, significantly higher than the $64 million in 3Q11. On YTD basis, FCF was $1.38 billion through 3Q12, down from $1.83 billion a year ago. Cash reserves increased sequentially by $850 million, to $4.65 billion. Cash flow from operations is expected to be greater than $4 billion for the year, an improvement from the current of $3.96 billion.Debt/EBITDA was flat at 1.3x for this quarter. The total debt was $6.5 billion, and net debt was $1.87 billion in 3Q12. Debt is not a big issue for the company. The only debt maturing till 2016 is one worth $150 million, maturing in 2013.ConclusionLMT has truly been a dividend king. The following chart shows the historical trend in dividends:Dividends have grown by almost 23.36% over the last 5 years. This quarter was a good one for LMT with robust cash flows and an improved operating margin. The company did not declare a CAPEX policy due to the uncertainty in the economic environment, as the issue of sequestration still remains unresolved. The company is trading at a forward P/E of 11x. With 7% per annum growth expected in earnings for the next 5 years and a solid dividend yield, the stock is recommended as a buy.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Qineqt's Aerospace Analyst.

Because at the end of the day, if you are an investor, you are buying the business. The FAST Graphs™ presented with this article will focus first on the business behind the stock. The orange line on the graph plots earnings per share since 2001. A quick glance vividly reveals the historical operating record of the company.Headquartered in Bethesda, Md., Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE:LMT) is a global security company that employs about 126,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services.This article will reveal the business prospects of Lockheed Martin Corp. through the lens of FAST Graphs - fundamentals analyzer software tool. Therefore, it is offered as the first step before a more comprehensive research effort. Our objective is to provide companies that have excellent historical records and appear reasonably priced based on past, present and future data and expectations.A quick glance at the graph itself and the orange earnings justified valuation line will tell the readers volumes about how well the company has historically been managed and performed as an operating business. Simply put, the reader should ask whether this example is worthy of a greater investment of their time and effort based on the data as presented and organized. The FAST Graphs' unique advantage is the graphical articulation of the price value proposition.Earnings Determine Market Price: The following earnings and price correlated FAST Graphs™ clearly illustrates the importance of earnings. The Earnings Growth Rate Line, or True Worth™ Line (orange line with white triangles), is correlated with the historical stock price line. On graph after graph, the lines will move in tandem. If the stock price strays away from the earnings line (over or under), inevitably it will come back to earnings.Earnings And Price Correlated Fundamentals-At-A-GlanceA quick glance at the historical earnings and price correlated FAST Graphs™ on Lockheed Martin Corp. shows a picture of undervaluation based upon the historical earnings growth rate of 15.9% and a current P/E of 10.2. Analysts are forecasting the earnings growth to continue at about 6%, and when you look at the forecasting graph below, the stock appears undervalued (it's outside of the value corridor of the five orange lines -- based on future growth).Lockheed Martin Corp.: Historical Earnings, Price, Dividends and Normal P/E Since 2001Performance Table: Lockheed Martin Corp.The associated performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph validates the principles regarding the two components of total return: capital appreciation and dividend income. Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid, but not reinvested.When presented separately like this, the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident. In addition to the 8.2% capital appreciation (green circle), long-term shareholders of Lockheed Martin Corp., assuming an initial investment of $1,000, would have received an additional $599.52 in dividends (blue highlighting) that increased their total return from 8.2% to 10% per annum versus 2.4% in the S&P 500.The following graph plots the historical P/E ratio (the dark blue line) in conjunction with 10-year Treasury note interest. Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as low as it has been since 2001.A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company's current P/S ratio relative to its historical P/S ratio. The current P/S ratio for Lockheed Martin Corp. is .60, which is historically low.Looking To The FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long-term returns are a function of two critical determinants:1. The rate of change (growth rate) of the company's earnings2. The price or valuation you pay to buy those earningsForecasting future earnings growth, bought at sound valuations, is the key to safe, sound and profitable performance.The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities. Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component towards making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions.The consensus of 20 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast Lockheed Martin Corp.'s long-term earnings growth at 6%. Lockheed Martin Corp. has high long-term debt at 99% of capital. Lockheed Martin Corp. is currently trading at a P/E of 10.2, which is below the value corridor (defined by the five orange lines) of a maximum P/E of 18. If the earnings materialize as forecast, based upon forecast earnings growth of 6%, Lockheed Martin Corp.'s share price would be $173.61 at the end of 2018 (brown circle on EYE Chart), which would represent a 15.6% annual rate of total return, which includes dividends paid (yellow highlighting).Earnings Yield EstimatesDiscounted Future Cash Flows: All companies derive their value from the future cash flows (earnings) they are capable of generating for their stakeholders over time. Therefore, because Earnings Determine Market Price in the long run, we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay.Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments, it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds. Comparing an investment in Lockheed Martin Corp. to an equal investment in 10-year Treasury bonds illustrates that Lockheed Martin Corp.'s expected earnings would be 6.8 (purple circle) times that of the 10-year T-bond interest (see EYE chart below). This is the essence of the importance of proper valuation as a critical investing component.Summary And ConclusionsThis report presented essential ""fundamentals at a glance"" illustrating the past and present valuation based on earnings achievements as reported. Future forecasts for earnings growth are based on the consensus of leading analysts. Although with just a quick glance you can know a lot about the company, it's imperative that the reader conducts their own due diligence in order to validate whether the consensus estimates seem reasonable or not.For more information on how to interpret FAST Graphs™, please click here.Disclaimer: The opinions in this document are for informational and educational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell the stocks mentioned or to solicit transactions or clients.

Despite failing to move lower, I no longer believe it makes sense to sell LMT.LMT data by YChartsObama Wins Re-ElectionOn November 6, in convincing fasion, President Obama was re-elected. Following this, the stock market as a whole has moved lower as investors look to lock in gains ahead of higher taxes. Obama's re-election had a very significant impact on all of the defense stocks as the President has said that he wants to reduce military spending. Comparably, Mitt Romney was in favor in increasing military spending. Since the election, as shown by the chart below, shares of LMT, General Dynamics (NYSE:GD), Raytheon (RTN), and Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) have all moved sharply lower.LMT data by YChartsIn my previous piece, I suggested avoiding LMT because I though it was very likely that President Obama would get re-elected. Now, given the election results and the subsequent fall in defense stocks, it no longer makes sense to be negative on the sector and LMT in specific. Going forward, investors will focus on LMT's cheap valuation and high dividend instead of the election. As discussed in my previous piece, and shown by the charts below, based on its valuation and dividend yield, LMT is very attractive.LMT PE Ratio TTM data by YChartsLMT Dividend Yield data by YChartsMiddle East ViolenceUnfortunately, violence in the middle east continues to be on the rise. In specific, right now, tensions between Israel and the Palestinians seem to be reaching new heights. Of course, no one knows exactly how this conflict will unfold, but it is possible that if the issue leads to an Iranian response, the United States may get involved. While military action by the United States in unlikely, the rising tensions in the middle east may be enough to somewhat alter the narrative regarding military spending. Perhaps, President Obama will be less aggressive with the size of military spending cuts.Fiscal CliffIn addition to the President's re-election, LMT shares have come under pressure because of the fiscal cliff. Currently, if no agreement is reached significnat military cuts would come into effect. However, contrary to popular belief, I believe a major deal will be reached to avert the fiscal cliff. Certainly, military spending cuts will be a part of any agreement reached but I believe the cuts will be less severe than if no agreement is reached.ConclusionNow that the election is over, LMT is more attractive because an Obama presidency is now priced into the stock. However, it is possible that LMT along with the rest of the sector makes one more move lower when a compromise is reached on the fiscal cliff including vast military spending cuts. However, I would view any further decline in the stock based on military spending cuts as an opportunity.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

949091,22148,2012-10-25T06:51:01-04:00,,"Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) continues to report earnings that prove revenue growth can be over rated. The defense contractor reported Q3 2012 revenue that slightly dropped from the $12.1B in 2011, yet the company managed to beat earnings estimate and hike the dividend yield by 15%.The amazing story about this stock is that even with the stock hitting multi-year highs, the stock will now yield 5% after this hike to a $1.15 dividend per quarter.Q312 Earnings HighlightsBelow are the highlights for the Q3 2012 earnings report:Cash DeploymentThe stock continues to benefit from share buybacks at much lower levels over the last few years. The company has deployed cash in the following ways during Q3:Net Payout YieldsWhile most investors shied away from Lockheed Martin over the last couple of years, the net payout yields (NYSE:NPY) highlighted a stock worth buying. The NPY is the combination of the forward dividend yield and net buyback over the last 12 months.The below chart highlights the buyback and dividend yields over the last 5 quarters:As noted, the company has a significant NPY. While the stock buyback has slowed, the NPY going forward remains attractive with the 5% dividend yield and roughly 2.5% buyback yield.Northrop GrummanCompetitor Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) reported similarly strong results. Though the company only offers a 3.1% dividend yield, it now offers a substantially higher NPY with much higher stock buybacks.The company has reduced the shares outstanding from 279M in Q3 2011 to 252M this year. The more than 10% decline in shares provides for a substantial NPY.ConclusionEven with the huge increases, Lockheed Martin remains attractive with a 5% dividend yield and continued ability to fund stock buybacks. Investors not as interested in dividends should find Northrop Grumman more appealing with the higher buyback. Either way investors can't lose with these two stocks even after huge gains.Disclosure: I am long LMT. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

950071,25791,2012-10-25T12:28:33-04:00,,"Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE:LMT) reports preliminary financial results for the quarter ended 2012-09-30.Lockheed Martin Corp. recently reported its preliminary financial results based on which CapitalCube provides a unique peer-based analysis of the company. Our analysis is based on the company's performance over the last twelve months (unless stated otherwise).Lockheed Martin Corp.'s analysis versus peers uses the following peer-set: Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA), European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co. EADS N.V. (NYSEMKT:EAD), General Dynamics Corp. (NYSE:GD), Raytheon Co. (RTN), BAE Systems PLC (OTCPK:BAESF), Northrop Grumman Corp. (NYSE:NOC), Dassault Aviation S.A. (NYSE:AM), Rockwell Collins Inc. (NYSE:COL) and Finmeccanica S.p.A. (FNC). The table below shows the preliminary results along with the recent trend for revenues, net income and returns.Valuation DriversLockheed Martin Corp. currently trades at a higher Price/Book ratio (12.2) than its peer median (4.4). Lockheed Martin Corp.'s operating performance is higher than the median of its chosen peers (ROE of 106.6% compared to the peer median ROE of 19.2%) but the market does not seem to expect higher growth relative to peers (PE of 10.5 compared to peer median of 10.5) but simply to maintain its relatively high rates of return.The company's median net profit margins of 6.1% and relative asset efficiency (asset turns of 1.3x compared to peer median of 0.9x) give it some operating leverage. Lockheed Martin Corp.'s net margin is similar to last year's low of 5.7%, which compares to the 2008 high of 7.5%.Economic MoatThe company has achieved better revenues growth than its chosen peers (year-on-year change in revenues of 1.5%) but its earnings growth performance has been below the median (change in annual reported earnings of 0.8% compared to the peer median of 6.6%). This suggests that, compared to its peers, the company is focused more on top-line revenues. Lockheed Martin Corp. is currently converting every 1% of change in revenue into 0.5% change in annual reported earnings.Lockheed Martin Corp.'s return on assets is above its peer median both in the current period (7.6% vs. peer median 6.2%) and also over the past five years (8.9% vs. peer median 4.8%). This performance suggests that the company's relatively high operating returns are sustainable.The company's comparatively low gross margins of 12.4% versus peer median of 21.3% suggests that it has a non-differentiated strategy or is in a pricing constrained position. However, Lockheed Martin Corp.'s pre-tax margin of 8.6% is around the peer median which, when combined with the gross margin, suggests lower operating costs relative to peers.Growth & Investment StrategyLockheed Martin Corp.'s revenues have grown at about the same rate as its peers (2.9% vs. 2.6% respectively for the past three years). Similarly, the stock price implies median long-term growth as its PE ratio is around the peer median of 10.5. The historical performance and long-term growth expectations for the company are largely in sync.Lockheed Martin Corp.'s annualized rate of change in capital of 3.8% over the past three years is higher than its peer median of 3.0%. This investment has generated an above peer median return on capital of 33.5% averaged over the same three years. Evidently, the relatively high capital investment was successful given the relatively strong growth in its returns.Earnings QualityLockheed Martin Corp.'s net income margin for the last twelve months is around the peer median (6.1% vs. peer median of 7.3%). This average margin combined with a level of accruals that is around peer median (2.6% vs. peer median of 2.5%) suggests there possibly isn't too much accrual movement flowing into the company's reported earnings.Lockheed Martin Corp.'s accruals over the last twelve months are positive suggesting a buildup of reserves. However, this level of accruals is also around the peer median and suggests the company is recording a proper level of reserves compared to its peers.Trend ChartsCompany ProfileLockheed Martin Corp. is a global security and aerospace company that is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. It also provides a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistic, and information services. The company operates its business through the following segments: Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, Information Systems & Global Solutions, and Space Systems.

925921,31311,2012-10-16T04:35:06-04:00,,"Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is the largest defense contractor in the world by sales (Boeing (NYSE:BA) is second with arms sales of $31.4 billion to Lockheed Martin's $35.7 billion). 82% of sales originate from the U.S. federal government, particularly the Department of Defense (DOD). Another 17% comes from foreign aligned governments, and only 1% come from the private sector. The current company was formed by the 1995 merger of Lockheed, historically a defense aerospace company, and Martin Marietta, who was known for their space systems.The remnants of the mega-merger can be seen in Lockheed Martin's four operating segments as described in the company's 2011 Annual Report. Aeronautics (31% of sales, 31% of profits) makes and maintains some of the well-known military jets and transport planes, such as the F-35, F-16, F-22, and C-130J. Lockheed has a long history making fighter and stealth jets, dating back to famous planes like the SR-71 Blackbird and F-117 Nighthawk.Space Systems (18% of sales, 19% of profits) is the ""Martin"" part, making satellites, space-based missile systems, and space transports. Electronic Systems (31% of sales, 34% profits) makes missile systems, naval sensor systems, electronic spy equipment, etc. Finally, Information Systems & Global Services (IS&GS) (20% of sales, 17% profits) is engaged in general information technology activities for various departments within the government.Investment in Lockheed Martin is a defensive play in more ways than one. The company is one of the few major government contractors, with a long history, significant trust, massive scale (in a limited market), and accrued experience that simply cannot be duplicated by potential competitors, giving the company a pretty wide economic moat. Additionally, defense spending is largely protected from wild economic swings, as witnessed by net growth in the defense budget over the past few years, despite a major draw-down in Iraq. Fast moves in technology have required continued investment in upgrading military equipment. In short, Lockheed is a not a stock that is going to give you a 100% one-year gain, nor is it likely to lose your shirt for you. The company was founded in 1912.The question of Lockheed Martin's immense debtIn contrast to an excellent cash flow statement, with a FCF (free cash flow) of $3.44 billion ($1.095 million expended on dividends paid + $2.465 million expended on share repurchases), Lockheed Martin's balance sheet looks scary. Total equity has shrunk from $9.805 million to $1.001 million since 2007, due to constant readjustments to Accrued pension liabilities which are negatively impacted by falling interest rates and falling general stock price levels. More on this complicated accounting problem in this article.Amazing dividend growth at Lockheed Martin - a shareholder friendly companyI purchased LMT on December 6 2011 for precisely $77.80. I sold on March 20 2012 for $88.80. I sold only because of certain unpredictable circumstances in my life. It is my usual modus operandi never to sell after I buy a stock. I treat it as money lost, my unyielding stance rewarded only by dividend payments. My personal experience is that I would have been a lot richer if I had never sold a single stock.Now there's gnashing of teeth when I see this same stock at $92.96 and rising dividend from $1.00 to $1.15 per year. All considering, I would buy this stock even at these levels, had I got the money, but I would make sure that it does not exceed 5% of my portfolio due to the high levels of debt mentioned above, as well as uncertainties related to global and US political and fiscal situations.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

922971,24491,2012-10-15T02:58:03-04:00,,"Unfortunately for the individual investor and time-strapped financial advisor, most dividend analysis that we've seen out there is backward-looking, meaning it rests on what the company has done in the past (how long it has raised its dividend, etc.). We're looking to change that view. In this article, let's evaluate the investment merits of Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) as well as its dividend under a new framework, the Valuentum Dividend Cushion. We think the firm will continue to grow its dividend, despite uncertainties about changing priorities within the government defense budget.Investment ConsiderationsReturn on Invested CapitalLockheed Martin's DividendLockheed Martin's dividend yield is above average, offering just below a 5% annual payout at recent price levels. We prefer yields above 3%, and don't include firms with yields below 2% in our dividend growth portfolio. In this respect, Lockheed fits the bill. For a read on how we calculate the intrinsic value of Lockheed and the hundreds of other companies in our coverage universe via an extensive discounted cash-flow model, please click here.Furthermore, we think the safety of Lockheed Martin's dividend is good (please see our definitions at the bottom of this article). We measure the safety of the dividend in a unique but very straightforward fashion. As many know, earnings can fluctuate in any given year, so using the payout ratio in any given year has some limitations. Plus, companies can often encounter unforeseen charges (read hiccups in operations), which makes earnings an even less-than-predictable measure of the safety of the dividend in any given year. We know that companies won't cut the dividend just because earnings have declined or they had a restructuring charge that put them in the red for the quarter (year). As such, we think that assessing the cash flows of a business allows us to determine whether it has the capacity to continue paying these cash outlays well into the future.That has led us to develop the forward-looking Valuentum Dividend Cushion™ (please click here for more information on this important measure that financial advisors use). The measure is a ratio that sums the existing cash a company has on hand plus its expected future free cash flows over the next five years and divides that sum by future expected dividends over the same time period. For Lockheed Martin, this score is 1.5, revealing that on its current path the firm can cover its future dividends with net cash on hand and future free cash flow. Basically, if the score is above 1, the company has the capacity to pay out its expected future dividends. As income investors, however, we'd like to see a score much larger than 1 for a couple reasons: 1) the higher the ratio, the more ""cushion"" the company has against unexpected earnings shortfalls, and 2) the higher the ratio, the greater capacity a dividend-payer has in boosting the dividend in the future. We use our dividend cushion as a key decision component in choosing companies for addition to the portfolio of our Dividend Growth Newsletter (please see our links on the left sidebar for more information).Now on to the potential growth of Lockheed Martin's dividend. As we mentioned above, we think the larger the ""cushion"" the larger capacity it has to raise the dividend. However, such dividend growth analysis is not complete until after considering management's willingness to increase the dividend. As such, we evaluate the company's historical dividend track record. If there have been no dividend cuts in 10 years, the company has a nice growth rate, and a nice dividend cushion, its future potential dividend growth would be excellent, which is the case for Lockheed Martin. The firm has a rock-solid balance sheet and strong cash-flow generating capacity.And because capital preservation is also an important consideration, we assess the risk associated with the potential for capital loss (offering investors a complete picture). In Lockheed Martin's case, we think the shares are fairly valued, so the risk of capital loss medium. If we thought the shares were undervalued, the risk of capital loss would be low. Lockheed Martin stands out to us, we'd consider adding it to our dividend growth portfolio.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

895571,25319,2012-09-29T01:26:00-04:00,,"Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) recently announced its annual dividend increase. The company's website says this is the 10th consecutive double-digit dividend increase. Pretty impressive, as not many companies have managed to do the same.This article, written back in June compared the three major defense stocks, including Raytheon Company (RTN) and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and concluded LMT is the place for dividend growth investors. This recent increase has justified the claim. As done in some recent exercises, let us recheck the dividend story after an increase.Click to enlarge(Source: Ycharts.com)Conclusion: The recent dividend increase has strengthened our belief that LMT is the best defense play for investors who seek a growing income stream, handily beating Boeing and Raytheon's dividends. Further, this report says that the recent increase might set a floor to the stock price at $90, which is good news for investors.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in LMT over the next 72 hours.

929621,30811,2012-10-17T10:56:19-04:00,,"Shares of Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) have returned 24.96% over the past 12 months and reached the 52-week high of $94.90 just recently. The strong 1-year performance is mostly attributable to the stock's lofty dividend yield which attracts income investors in the current low-yield world. However, as the stock's valuation continues to shoot up, which gradually erodes the investment margin of safety, investors should be cautious for a potential pullback. My view on the stock is supported by the following analysis:According to the chart shown below, following a dividend yield hike in late 2011, the stock price had gone up significantly due to a high demand from the yield-hungry investors. The buying spree drove the dividend yield down from over 5.5% to below 4.5%, and the stock price dropped subsequently, as the lower dividend yield were deemed less attractive. The dividend yield then reversed the downward course in May 2012 and had gradually gone up amid the declining the stock price, and once again lured a flock of income investors. The buying power again pushed down the yield to below 4.5% in September 2012. On September 27, the company raised its quarterly dividend per share by 15% from $1.00 in last quarter to $1.15 at present. The latest dividend hike helped lift the dividend yield from below 4.5% to almost 5.0%. Now, many investors may think the history will likely repeat itself as demand could go up following the yield hike and once again drive up the stock price. However, I believe the current stretched valuation would likely be a major impediment to that scenario.LMT's valuations appear to be somewhat expensive relative to the company's financial performance (see table below). Comparing to a peer group consisting of LMT's competitors such as General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), LMT's has a mediocre overall financial performance. Analysts in average predict the 2-year growth rates for LMT's revenue, EBITDA, and EPS to be -1.5%, 2.6%, and 3.4% over the current and next fiscal years, fairly in line with the peer averages at -1.2%, -0.5%, and 3.6%. The firm's EBITDA margin is forecasted to expand by 0.9%, above the peer average of only 0.1%. On the profit side, LMT has a below-average profitability. All of the firm's margin metrics are substantially below the peer averages, but its capital return ratios such as ROE and ROIC are largely above the par. In terms of leverage and liquidity, LMT assumes a higher debt level as reflected by the company's higher debt to capitalization and debt to EBITDA ratios. However, LMT's free cash flow margin is weak relative to the peer group, and the firm's interest coverage rate, current ratio, and quick ratio are all below the par, reflecting a lackluster liquidity position and a mediocre balance sheet.Despite some of the financial weaknesses, the current stock valuations at 6.1x trailing EV/EBITDA, 15.2x trailing EV/FCF, and 10.9x trailing P/E actually represent a sizable average valuation premium of 27% over the peer-average trading multiples (see table above), suggesting the stock is likely overvalued.Accounting for the earnings growth potential, LMT trades at a forward PEG of 1.73x, which is 28% higher than the peer average at 1.35x (see table above). Both the stock's trailing EV/EBITDA and P/E multiples are currently trading 8% and 6%, respectively, above their 3-year historical averages (see charts below), despite the fact that the company's revenue growth has slowed down significantly in recent years and the growth is estimated to be remain in the negative territory over the next few years (see chart below).Moreover, comparing LMT's current financials to the figures in exactly a year ago, it would be obvious to see that the stock has become more expensive (see table below). Over the past 12 months, both LMT's revenue and EPS growth estimates have dropped significantly, however, the EBITDA and EBITDA margin have better estimates. The profitability measures are almost unchanged. In terms of liquidity, the company's free cash flow margin has compressed largely. In summary, there has been basically no major improvement in LMT's financials over the past 12 months. Nevertheless, the stock's valuation multiples (including the PEG ratio) have expanded by an average of 45% over the period - a firm evidence suggesting a pricier valuation.Bottom line, it is still possible for the stock to go higher due to the tempting 5% dividend yield. However, I believe the possibility and the upside potential is likely pared by the heightened valuations. It is noted that prior to the dividend hike in late 2011, LMT's trailing P/E multiple was trending fairly in line with its peers, except for Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL) (see chart below). Therefore, based on analysts' average FY2013 EPS estimate at $8.41 and assuming a generous 15% valuation premium over the peer-average trailing P/E multiple at 9.8x (see comparable analysis table) to account for LMT's attractive dividend yield and any potential valuation improvement in the overall market, we can conclude a 1-year target price to be $95, which is only 2% above the current market price at $93. As such, I do not recommend acquiring the shares at the current price.Comparable analysis table is created by author, all other charts are sourced from Capital IQ, and all financial data is sourced from Morningstar, Thomson One, and Capital IQ.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

850801,29461,2012-09-06T13:52:19-04:00,,"Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), the largest defense contractor in the U.S., as well as one of the largest in the world, beat earnings estimates in its second quarter earnings release reported on July 24. The company also raised its full-year outlook for EPS from a range of $7.70-$7.90 to $7.90-$8.10. The company is well known for its generous dividend policy and has a rich history of paying dividends; currently, it offers a yield of 4.4%. Before discussing the future outlook, we will analyze its historical dividend payments.Dividend Performance IndicatorsDividend yields have been on the rise. Following shows the growth for yield rates. After getting a dip in 2006, the company has seen a back-to-back dividend growth rate of almost 20% for five years.Also, the company raised its dividends by 33% last year, following increments of 19% and 11% in the previous two years.Cash FlowsOCF yields have been on a rise too (2012 is an exception). Also, FCFs have turned positive since the last two years.It is interesting to note that the average 5-year OCF yields have been much higher than the averages of LMT's peers.The company has successfully maintained its dividends over the last 8 years, and the payout ratio has been on a rise since 2002, as shown by the graph.History suggests that LMT is a shareholder-friendly company. However, we need to take into account whether future circumstances will allow LMT to sustain its dividends. The most important discussion is of cash flow generation and reserves, which will eventually be used to pay off dividends.Share RepurchasesLMT has used around $2 billion each year to buy back its shares from 2006 to 2010. Recently, the management announced that it will use $1 billion to repurchase its stock. For the first half, the repurchase activity was below expectations; however, the management, in the earnings call after the second quarter earnings release, said that they will not back off from their plan to repurchase shares worth $1 billion. The management, when asked about the possible impact that repurchase activity will have on dividends, said that nothing can be publicly announced before the board's meeting in September to decide on dividends. During the first half, the company repurchased 4.9 million shares worth $428 million. Up till now, under the shares repurchase program, the company has used $3.6 billion to buy back 47.9 million shares, thus leaving behind the remaining authorization of $2.9 billion to be used for further repurchases.CAPEXThe $308 million CAPEX for the first half of 2012 was almost down 6% YoY. The majority of the company's CAPEX relates to development facilities and infrastructure to support the new and existing programs in the business. The only comment that the management made about the CAPEX was that the company had enough cash resources to fund expansion in projects. The sell side expects the CAPEX to remain stable near the $875 million mark.F-35, Sequestration and MarginsThe F-35 project is one of the key growth drivers for the company, and will give LMT an edge over its competitors. However, due to possible sequestration in the coming years, the company will have a lot less to spend on the project. The company made 13% of its 2011 revenues from this project, which generated $6 billion. The budget cuts are expected to be worth $400 billion in the next decade, with $55 billion worth of cuts being implemented each year.Also, the project is a fixed cost project. However, due to production issues and higher cost of inputs, the company is experiencing cost overruns. These will strain LMT's margins in the short-term.Debt MaturitiesThe company enjoys revolving credit of $1.5 billion, which will expire in 2016. The facility can be enhanced by $ 500 million. The only debt maturity till 2016 is an amount of $150 million in 2013. The sell side estimates show that the debt-to-equity will fall from 75% to 38% by the end of 2014. However, this is expected to happen more because of a faster rise in capital, rather than a reduction in debt.Peer Analysis and ConclusionLMT is regarded as the top dividend stock in the industrials due to its high dividend yield:What is most interesting is the 21% five-year growth rate for LMT's dividend, which is way ahead of competitors.An overall dividend growth was witnessed in the defense/aerospace industry. Raytheon (RTN), with a dividend yield of 3.54%, deserves a special mention here. With average 5-year OCF yield being almost twice of the industry's, at 14%, we think that LMT will be able to sustain its dividends in future. Its healthy operating cash flows of $3bn can easily cover this year's total dividend of $1.3 billion.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Profitability is essentially why the company exists and a key component in deciding whether to invest or to remain invested in a company. There are many metrics involved in calculating profitability, but for this article, I will look at Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) earnings and earnings growth, profit margins, profitability ratios and cash flow.Through the above-mentioned four main metrics, we will understand more about the company's profitability. And by comparing this summary to other companies in the same sector, you will be able see which has been the most profitable.All material is sourced from Morningstar, Company webpage. and MSN Money.Earnings and Earnings Growth1. Earnings = Sales x Profit MarginLockheed Martin's earnings decreased from $2.926 billion in 2010 to $2.655 billion in 2011 or an decrease of 10.2%.2. Five-year historical look at earnings growthIn analyzing Lockheed Martin's earnings growth over the past five years, you can see that the company's earnings have been decreasing from 2009 to 2011. Overall, the 2011 earnings are 14.23% lower than 2007.Profit Margins3. Gross Profit = Total Sales - Cost of SalesIn analyzing a company, gross profit is very important because it indicates how efficiently management uses labor and supplies in the production process. More specifically, it can be used to calculate gross profit margin. Here are Lockheed Martin's gross profits for the past two years:4. Gross Profit Margin = Gross Income / SalesThe gross profit margin is a measurement of a company's manufacturing and distribution efficiency during the production process. The gross profit tells an investor the percentage of revenue/sales left after subtracting the cost of goods sold. A company that boasts a higher gross profit margin than its competitors and industry is more efficient. Investors tend to pay more for businesses that have higher efficiency ratings than their competitors, as these businesses should be able to make a decent profit as long as overhead costs are controlled (overhead refers to rent, utilities, etc.).In analyzing Lockheed Martin's gross margin over the past five years, the margin looks to have declined every year since 2008. The 5-year low was in 2011 with a margin of 7.97% while the high 5-year high was in 2008 with a margin of 10.88%. The 2011 gross profit margin is below the 5-year average of 9.33%.The decrease in the gross margin implies that management was less efficient in its manufacturing and distribution during the production process in 2011 compared to the 5-year average.5. Operating income = Total Sales - Operating ExpensesThe amount of profit realized from the operations of a business after taking out operating expenses - such as cost of goods sold (COGS) or wages - and depreciation. Operating income takes the gross income (revenue minus COGS) and subtracts other operating expenses, then removes depreciation. These operating expenses are costs that are incurred from operating activities and include things such as office supplies and heat and power.6. Operating Margin = Operating Income / Total SalesOperating margin is a measure of the proportion of a company's revenue that is left over after paying for variable costs of production, such as wages, raw materials, etc. A healthy operating margin is required for a company to be able to pay for its fixed costs such as interest on debt. If a company's margin is increasing, it is earning more per dollar of sales. The higher the margin, the better.Over the past five years, Lockheed Martin's operating margin has been declining since 2008. The 2011 operating margin of 8.56% is below the 5-year average of 9.96%.As the operating margin has been declining over the past few years, this implies that there has been an decrease in the percentage of total sales left over after paying for variable costs of production such as wages and raw materials.7. Net Profit Margin = Net Income / Total SalesA ratio of profitability calculated as net income divided by revenue, or net profits divided by sales. It measures how much out of every dollar of sales a company actually keeps in earnings.Profit margin is very useful when comparing companies in similar industries. A higher profit margin indicates a more profitable company that has better control over its costs compared to its competitors. Profit margin is displayed as a percentage; a 20% profit margin, for example, means the company has a net income of $0.20 for each dollar of sales.Lockheed Martin's net profit margin has shown a steady decrease since 2008. In 2008 the net profit margin was calculated at 7.53% while the 2011 net profit margin was calculated at 5.71%. The 2011 net profit margin of 5.71% is below the 5-year average of 6.71%.As the 2011 net profit margin of 5.71% is below the 5 year average of 6.71%, this implies that there has been an decrease in the percentage of earnings that the company is able to keep compared to the company's 5-year average.Profitability Ratios8. ROA - Return on Assets = Net Income / Total AssetsROA is an indicator of how profitable a company is relative to its total assets. ROA gives an idea as to how efficient management is at using its assets to generate earnings. Calculated by dividing a company's net income by its total assets, ROA is displayed as a percentage. Sometimes this is referred to as ""return on investment.""Like the Profit margins listed above, the ROA has been steadily declining. The 2011 ROA of 7.00% is below the 5-year average of 6.71%.The 2011 ROA of 7% is below the 5-year average of 7.42%. This implies that management has been less efficient at using the company's assets to generate earnings compared to its 5-year average.9. ROE - Return on Equity = Net Income / Shareholders' EquityAs shareholders' equity is measured as a firm's total assets minus its total liabilities, ROE reveals the amount of net income returned as a percentage of shareholders' equity. The return on equity measures a company's profitability by revealing how much profit it generates with the amount shareholders have invested.Lockheed Martin's ROE is erratic in that the percentage ranges from 15.92% in 2007 to 170.42% in 2011. As the 2011 ROE is very high, this reveals that the company is generating a large amount profits compared to shareholders' equity.Cash Flows10. Free Cash Flow = Operating Cash Flow - Capital ExpenditureA measure of financial performance calculated as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. Free cash flow (FCF) represents the cash that a company is able to generate after laying out the money required to maintain or expand its asset base. Free cash flow is important because it allows a company to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value. Without cash, it's tough to develop new products, make acquisitions, pay dividends and reduce debt.It is important to note that negative free cash flow is not bad in itself. If free cash flow is negative, it could be a sign that a company is making large investments. If these investments earn a high return, the strategy has the potential to pay off in the long run.Over the past five years, Lockheed Martin's free cash flow has remained positive.The latest number, on the plus side, indicates that Lockheed Martin has enough cash to develop new products, make acquisitions, pay dividends and reduce debt.11. Cash Flow Margin = Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total SalesThe higher the percentage, the more cash available from sales.If a company is generating a negative cash flow, it shows up as a negative number in the numerator in the cash flow margin equation. This means that even as the company is generating sales revenue, it is losing money. The company will have to borrow money or raise money through investors in order to keep on operating.As Lockheed Martin's cash flow margin is positive, it does not have to take the above measures to continue operating.SummaryIn analyzing Lockheed Martin's earnings growth over the past five years, you can see the earnings have been declining since 2008. Overall, the 2011 earnings are 14.23% lower than 2007.As illustrated above and using a 5-year time frame, the listed profit margins show a decline. All the listed profit margins are below there 5 year averages.The ROA and ROE show very different results. Like the other listed profit margin metrics listed above the ROA is showing a decline. The ROE is showing strong results over the past five years with a strong increase.With free cash flow and the free cash flow margin both displaying positive cash, Lockheed Martin has enough cash to develop new products, make acquisitions, pay dividends and reduce debt without having to borrow or raise money to maintain operations.The analysis of Lockheed Martin's profitability reveals a company with declining profitability margins and earnings, but positive cash and cash flow. Based on the profitability analysis above the margins and earnings are a couple of areas of the company to watch moving forward.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

794581,32321,2012-08-09T13:30:11-04:00,,"Arguably more than any other company today, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) will remain a stalwart in its industry for a long time. By producing goods fundamentally important to the largest consumer in the world, the U.S. government, with methods superior to competitors and barriers to entry so large that only a few existing companies within the defense industry could even think of assuming Lockheed's responsibilities, Lockheed has an incredibly strong position. This same position puts the company in a difficult position to achieve substantial growth. This is additionally coupled with the uncertainty of government sequestration. At the same time, cash flow and profits will likely increase in the future even without top line growth, as the abnormal adverse effects of their pension situation wear off. With this cash flow, they will continue to increase their dividend for immediate shareholder returns, while creating long-term per share performance by decreasing the overall share count through buybacks. As long as one believes that government spending on Lockheed Martin does not decline significantly, the company represents an excellent investment opportunity.Lockheed Martin is by many accounts the supreme defense contractor. This has been evidenced by the type of contracts the company has received, including the incredibly complicated space capsule for the Mars landing, significant classified projects, and most significantly the F-35. Raytheon (RTN), Boeing (NYSE:BA), General Dynamics (NYSE:GD), and others are quite technologically savvy; however, I don't think it's a coincidence that the most demanding engineering projects that often have no precedent are given to Lockheed. In producing 4200 F-22 raptors, which take 18,500 hours to make, they have made 59 perfect jets that have not had a single malfunction. Their mechanical products are manufactured to tolerances of 1/6000th of an inch, which, to put in perspective, compares with 1/16th of an inch in the construction sector. These are testaments to the technological prowess and production skill that are all but unmatched. They are also developing products that will clearly keep us and our soldiers safer with more unmanned crafts and more comprehensive security systems, for which there will undoubtedly be demand. Possibly most telling is the opinions of the soldiers who use Lockheed products. In short, they unequivocally rave about what they produce saying that not only does it offer more functionality but that it is more maintenance free, and when malfunctions do occur, they are easier to fix. This evidence gives me the utmost confidence that Lockheed Martin will remain a main recipient of defense contracts for years to come.At the same time, much of what Lockheed produces does not lend itself to tremendous revenue growth, often due to a lack of network effects. Just because the government buys F-35 jets from Lockheed does not mean that it will have to buy helicopters from Lockheed. Although Lockheed makes some security systems for military systems, other companies such as Microsoft may offer products that are complementary. Additionally, many of the products they produce are one-time purchases. Unlike, for example, a smart phone which often has a 2-year turnover, the F-35 contract is for 50 years. This requires Lockheed to constantly obtain new contracts to increase its revenue. This simply is not happening as its principal customer is not increasing defense purchases significantly. Great evidence for this idea is that over the past three years, the company's revenue has only increased about 13%, its net income is actually down almost 20%, and its cash flow from operating activities is practically unchanged.By contracting with the government through cost reimbursable contracts and fixed cost contracts, they are able to achieve stable profits. Larger and more variable projects such as the F-35 are executed under cost reimbursable, allowing Lockheed to make superior products with premium materials because every cost is paid for by the government. They then get a profit depending upon performance incentives which Lockheed has historically almost always met. They enter into fixed price contracts for items they have already produced allowing them to book a consistent profit. While putting the company in a stable position, it also removes upside that could occur through margin expansion because the company will never be able to benefit from saving money on materials, and their profits on performance are capped according to the contract.The F-35 contract is far and away the most notable for Lockheed Martin. The government plans on purchasing 2443 F-35 planes for a total of $323B. This does not include research or maintenance costs which also boosts Lockheed's bottom line. There has been some worry about the F-35 program getting cancelled, or Lockheed Martin's role being reduced. This possibility is very remote given the confluence of forces. Secretary of Defense, Panetta, has recently said that the F-35 remains of utmost importance to national security. The current fleet or aircraft is over 22 years old, and more importantly, maintaining the current fleet would cost four times as much as developing the F-35, without even mentioning performance specs. The U.S. has not lost a plane since Vietnam, and I believe the government has tremendous pride in their air dominance and is not about to relinquish it. Other countries such as India and Russia are currently developing fifth generation fighters, which if successful, would force the U.S. to keep pace. All signs point to the further development of the F-35. The government could hypothetically switch contractors. However, Lockheed Martin is arguably the most innovative of all contractors and more importantly, has the most in depth knowledge of fighters. They combine both prior knowledge of older fighters and trade secrets they have already acquired by developing the F-35. Lockheed Martin has been criticized for increased costs of the project. Yet these claims have been overblown and this is explained well in the following Forbes article. In short, much of the increased cost has been the result of the government and its changes to the program, while Lockheed Martin has actually exceeded expectations.The F-35 also represents a nice source of growth because the government has partnered with eight different countries to which Lockheed Martin will sell F-35 jets to, albeit in smaller numbers. This opportunity is quite promising because this is one way in which Lockheed can achieve significant margins because international sales do not constitute a typical government contract. Additionally, more countries such as Japan recently are deciding to buy the F-35. I believe this trend will continue as there is truly no legitimate competitor to the F-35 in arguably the most important of industries. Finally, the F-35 should become slightly more profitable as the company moves towards more production as opposed to research.The company has a very stable base of revenue due to the F-35 contract and its superior products, and some but limited opportunity for growth due its technological prowess. The main headwind to Lockheed Martin's success is the imminent fiscal cliff and the possibility of sequestration. The government has already approved a $487B reduction in the defense spending to occur relatively evenly over 10 years starting in 2012. This could be doubled if the government does not agree to a new budget, allowing sequestration to go into effect. Lockheed is well positioned to not have its projects slashed because of their importance such as the F-35, the innovation such as unmanned aircraft and their technological superiority. Yet this will prevent revenue growth because the government will reduce new projects. Sequestration would actually have an even greater impact upon Lockheed because it would force them to get rid of employees making them pay significant severance charges.The company's pension plan upon first glance appears to be a significant obstacle. The company has been hit by a decrease in the rate of return on its plan and a lower discount rate. They paid over $2B, which is included in cost of goods according to their accenting, into the pension plan this year, and yet the pension shortfall rose from $10.5B to over $13B. It may be smart on their part, given the low returns they are expecting, to not close the gap now. The underfunded status may close by itself as almost half of the plan is in either cash or government fixed income securities with little upside.The impact of the pension liability on the company's cash flows and profits, however, is more important than a single liability, because these reward shareholders. By contracting with the government, they get reimbursed for pension expenses associated with all these contracts. In brief, about 80% of pension funding is typically reimbursed by the government. In fact, $899M of their pension payments came from the government. In their 10K they state:""We generally are able to recover these costs related to our plans as allowable costs on our U.S. Government contracts, including FMS, but there are delays between when we contribute cash to the plans under pension funding rules and recover it under government cost accounting rules.""The large amount contributed to the pension fund this year was the confluence of abnormal factors, namely the decrease in the discount rate and rate of return, that are likely to not reoccur, at least to the same degree in the future. Payments were also high because of prepayments needed for harmonization between the various pension accounting standards they must follow as seen in this quote:""The PPA became applicable to us and other large U.S. defense contractors beginning in 2011 and had the effect of accelerating the required amount of annual pension plan contributions. We made contributions related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans of $2.3 billion in 2011, $2.2 billion in 2010, and $1.5 billion in 2009.""This all leads to lower future payments combined with a higher percentage of government reimbursement, which effect can be summarized as such:""Based upon current assumptions which may change, the increase in CAS costs caused by CAS Harmonization should result in increased earnings a few years from now, as our CAS costs should be in excess of the pension expense we record under GAAP.""Thus, even if revenue is low, free cash flows should increase in the years to come. As long as revenue remains stable, Lockheed Martin can create shareholder value. It currently yields 4.47% and the company has increased its dividend each of the past three years. The company has on average repurchased over $2B of stock over the past four years and plans to do so in the future. These buybacks are significant because they continually decrease the number of shares outstanding causing free cash flow yield and EPS to rise, which should cause price appreciation in the future. These forces should continue as Lockheed has consistently had a FCF yield near 10%, their revenue base appears stable, and management has stated that free cash flow is a priority for them.The company's valuation to competitors can be summarized by the following chart:On a P/E and EV/EBITDA basis, Lockheed may appear to be expensive. However, by FCF yield, Lockheed Martin appears inexpensive, and I believe this metric is the most important of the three as it is least sensitive to accounting manipulations and includes capital expenditures, which are significant in this industry. Additionally, it does have the best dividend of its main competitors. I believe any premium indicated by P/E or EV/EBITDA ratio is justified given the innovation the company provides and its stable earnings.Even if Lockheed Martin does not experience explosive growth in the coming years, it remains a strong investment opportunity because of the qualitative strength of the company, management's commitment to shareholder value creation, the F-35 program, and the overlooked impact of lower pension costs in the future.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

762771,24063,2012-07-30T15:34:00-04:00,,"By Matt DoironLockheed Martin (LMT) is a risky stock. Not because it is exposed to macro conditions in the U.S. or the world (its market beta is 0.7), not because it is heavily exposed to oil prices, and not because it depends on trends in consumer fashion. No, the risks to Lockheed Martin's business stem from the fact that its largest customer, who is responsible for over 80% of its revenue- the U.S. federal government- is considering cuts to its spending, including to its spending on military and defense programs, as it attempts to control its budget without having to resort to broad-based tax increases.Lockheed Martin's second quarter 10-Q reported rises in first-half sales and net income. Of the company's four business units, only Information Systems & Global Solutions- its management services and IT contracting business- saw declines in revenue and operating income. Lockheed Martin did warn that under current federal law, automatic budget cuts set to begin at the end of the year if alternative cuts are not passed would lead to significant reductions in federal spending. Since, as mentioned, the company generates the vast majority of its business from the government (about 60% from the Department of Defense and about 20% from other U.S. government programs, according to the quarterly report), this would have a material effect on the company. Lockheed does note that it is prepared to engage in cost-cutting actions with regards to its suppliers and employees, including issuing conditional termination notices.Valuation multiples are not quite as useful when evaluating a business which largely depends on discretionary spending decisions from one customer, but it should be noted that analysts' expectations of the government's defense plans are not anticipated to have a major impact on earnings going forward: Lockheed Martin's $29 billion market cap is 10 times trailing earnings but still only 11 times forward earnings. A long term investor would likely have to assume that more defense cuts await in the future in order to be bearish on the stock, particularly as Lockheed Martin currently pays a 4.6% dividend yield to investors and currently has nearly $4 billion in cash on its balance sheet.The two largest 13F holders of Lockheed Martin at the end of this past March were First Eagle Investment Management and Chieftain Capital. First Eagle owned 3.9 million shares and has been steadily increasing its ownership over the past several quarters (see other stock picks from First Eagle). Chieftain Capital, managed by John Shapiro, has been reducing its position but still owned 1.8 million shares of the company at the end of the first quarter (find other stocks in Chieftain's portfolio). Cliff Asness's AQR Capital Management also had a moderate position in the stock. There has been little insider selling at Lockheed Martin and it has been composed of insiders cashing in their stock options, which they may be doing out of a desire to diversify or to make consumption purchases (the point of stock options is, after all, as compensation).Lockheed Martin's peers include other aerospace and defense companies. General Dynamics (GD), Raytheon (RTN), and Northrop Grumman (NOC) are all comparable businesses which pay smaller dividend yields, in the 3-4% range. Also similarly to Lockheed Martin, they trade at earnings multiples in the narrow window between 8 and 10 and EV/EBITDA multiples between 5 and 6. They are also all large caps, with the smallest (Northrop Grumman) having a $16 billion market cap. Lockheed Martin only stands out compared to its peers when its slightly higher dividend yield is considered, and that is a fairly small advantage. Lockheed Martin can also be compared to Boeing (BA), although Boeing has a much larger civilian customer base which makes it more highly exposed to movements in the macro economy but makes it less dependent on government spending. Boeing pays a lower dividend than the defense contractor peers at 2.4% and has a P/E ratio of 13, indicating that the market is more confident in the U.S. and global economies than in Lockheed Martin's ability to adapt to scheduled revenue reductions. We don't see a clear difference in attractiveness between any of these companies from a value perspective, but think that Lockheed Martin in particular might be a good choice for a dividend-seeking investor who wants an option other than utilities.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
830661,23255,2012-08-27T13:05:54-04:00,,"Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is an advanced technology manufacturing company that specializes in defense and other related fields. Lockheed is the company behind the F22 fighter plane, as well as anti-missile defense systems. The company has the distinction of being the largest provider of IT services and training to the United States government. The company has four primary business operations:The stock has essentially remained in a tight range between the high 60s and low 80s since the first quarter of 2009, but has been on a rollercoaster ride recently. In April, LMT set a new 52-week high of $92 before tumbling back into low $80s two months later only to regain its year-high. If Lockheed can breakthrough its old high, it could rally further to support a P/E in the low teens but there is always concerns regarding Lockheed when the military budget is on the chopping block. With the super committee's failure to make a decision, defense spending is facing $600B in cuts, which could spur further downward pressure.The outlook is somewhat bleak as a recent report by the Center for Strategic andBudgetary Assessments expects the $56.5B in Pentagon cuts for fiscal year 2013. These reductions cannot reduce pay for military personnel so the brunt will fall upon defense companies such as Lockheed. Fortunately the report indicates that service providers would face larger decreases than weapons producers so Lockheed may be higher on the priority list. This is precisely the type of looming pessimism that can force the stock price in a downward trend.(Source: Finviz.com)Due to the nature of operations, Lockheed is highly leveraged to government spending and Goldman recently estimated that the company has 97% exposure to ""government agencies."" Despite the potential decline in government spending, investors can collect a respectable dividend that has been exhibiting decent growth in the past decade. Not only does Lockheed have a strong yield, the company is dedicated to repurchasing shares and repurchased over $400M shares so far this year. Sales growth continues to be slow across most divisions with Information Systems actually contracting. The lone bright spot was Space Systems, which increased by 18%. Overall, I consider Lockheed to be a slightly above-average company; however, the investment thesis is highly reliant on politics, and requires more monitoring than most dividend leaders. Lockheed's management has been proactive in attempting to diversify the company, which is commendable, but it is difficult to overhaul a company with such a storied history.While Lockheed is still affordably priced with a forward P/E of 11.2, I believe the company will encounter difficulty appreciating materially higher. Shares have not traded at this level since Fall 2008 pre-Lehman and I believe you have ten-to-fifteen points of downside risk compared to five-to-ten points of upside potential. Considering the company's 3.3% Q/Q growth rate, this is the type of business that will encounter difficulty expanding its P/E. The most compelling reason to buy Lockheed is the 4.26% yield and the recent flight to high yielding equities could keep Lockheed in the $90s; however, there is too much political risk for me to wholeheartedly get behind this stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

LMT earned a Star for having an acceptable score in at least two of the four Key Metrics measured. Rolling 4-yr Div. > 15% means that dividends grew on average in excess of 15% for each consecutive 4 year period over the last 10 years (2002-2005, 2003-2006, 2004-2007, etc.) I consider this a key metric since dividends will double every 5 years if they grow by 15%. The company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since 1995 and has increased its dividend payments for 10 consecutive years.Dividend Income vs. MMA: Why would you assume the equity risk and invest in a dividend stock if you could earn a better return in a much less risky money market account (MMA) or Treasury bond? This section compares the earning ability of this stock with a high yield MMA. Two items are considered in this section, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:1. NPV MMA Diff. 2. Years to > MMALMT earned a Star in this section for its NPV MMA Diff. of the $327,586. This amount is in excess of the $2,500 target I look for in a stock that has increased dividends as long as LMT has. The stock's current yield of 4.47% exceeds the 2.6% estimated 20-year average MMA rate.Memberships and Peers: LMT is a member of the S&P 500. The company's peer group includes: Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA) with a 2.4% yield, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) with a 3.3% yield and United Technologies Corp. (NYSE:UTX) with a 2.8% yield.Conclusion: LMT earned one Star in the Fair Value section, earned one Star in the Dividend Analytical Data section and earned one Star in the Dividend Income vs. MMA section for a total of three Stars. This quantitatively ranks LMT as a 3-Star Hold stock.Using my D4L-PreScreen.xls model, I determined the share price would need to increase to $397.38 before LMT's NPV MMA Differential decreased to the $2,500 minimum that I look for in a stock with 10 years of consecutive dividend increases. At that price the stock would yield 1.0%.Resetting the D4L-PreScreen.xls model and solving for the dividend growth rate needed to generate the target $2,500 NPV MMA Differential, the calculated rate is 6.6%. This dividend growth rate is significantly lower than the 20.0% used in this analysis, thus providing a margin of safety. LMT has a risk rating of 2.25 which classifies it as a Medium risk stock.LMT is the largest defense contractor in the world and dominates next-generation defense platforms. It owns supply contracts for key programs such as the F-35, which assures the company multiple years of revenue. However, withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, along with U.S. budgetary concerns and the requirement for the U.S. Department of Defense to reduce spending by $450 billion over 10 years could negatively affect LMT's ability to increase its dividend.I am also concerned with the company's recent increase in its free cash flow payout (60%) debt to total capital (75%). As a mitigating factor, its net debt is $2.7 billion when subtracting out the $3.8 billion of cash currently held. Given these concerns, I will not add to my position at this time even though LMT trades below its calculated fair value of $133.37.Full Disclosure: At the time of this writing, I was long in LMT (0.5% of my Dividend Growth Portfolio). See a list of all my dividend growth holdings here.Disclaimer: Material presented here is for informational purposes only.

Given the current debt situation, spending cuts must occur. While republicans would rather cut spending in other areas, defense spending is the area democrats prefer to cut. The sector would most likely have a better fate if Mitt Romney defeats President Obama in the 2012 elections as he will not impose the cuts that President Obama would support. However, I think Romney would be forced to compromise on the issue if he wants to make a major deal with the democrats to reduce the deficit. Also, a recent survey showed that voters of both parties support defense spending cuts. Defense spending cuts would be a major negative for all industry players, not just LMT. Raytheon (RTN), General Dynamics (GD), and Northrop Grumman (NOC) would all be hurt.ConclusionDespite the cheap valuation, and high dividend yield, I would avoid LMT because of the outlook for defense spending. A significant drop in defense spending would certainly be a negative for LMT. With the odds of an Obama victory now approaching 60%, I believe LMT could see some selling as the election approaches. However, given a significant pull-back, I think LMT would be a long-term buy. Eventually, defense spending will again increase.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
741841,23479,2012-07-24T02:58:57-04:00,,"Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is scheduled to announce its second quarter earnings Tuesday, July 24. Last quarter, the company posted strong growth in revenues on a year-over-year basis driven by higher aircraft deliveries and increased production activity related to F-35 Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contracts. We anticipate the trend to continue in the second quarter as the company has several more production orders related to its F-35 program. However, we also anticipate the growth provided by the F-35 production contracts to be partially offset by the winding down of the F-22 program and under funded pension plan liabilities.Overall, Lockheed Martin is likely to post good numbers for Q2 even as defense spending cuts pose a challenge to the company's growth over the next few years.We currently have a price estimate of $95 for the company, approximately 5% above its current market price.See our complete analysis for the company here.F-35 production orders driving growthSales in the aeronautics division increased by $530 million in the previous quarter on a year-over-year basis due to production activity on the F-35 LRIP contracts and increased aircraft deliveries. At the end of the first quarter, the company was yet to deliver the last three of the LRIP lot 2 aircraft, and had received production orders for 93 F-35 aircraft, of which 11 had been delivered through the end of first quarter. We anticipate deliveries against these unfulfilled production orders to drive revenue growth during the second quarter and beyond.Growth offset by winding down of F-22 programHowever, we also anticipate the lower production volume on F-22 program to continue to impact revenue growth in the second quarter. Lockheed Martin is in the process of winding down the production under the program with final deliveries to be made by the end of 2012.Under funded pension plans to impact profitsWe also anticipate the under-funded pension plans of the company to impact margins. Lockheed Martin has been hurt by low interest rates as its pension contributions to the employee pension plans have increased manifold due to liabilities associated with pension plans. The company contributed $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion in cash in 2011 and 2010, respectively, to fund its pension plans. Yet the pension plans remain underfunded, and the contributions made in the second quarter will impact its profits.Defense spending cuts pose a challenge to long-term growthThe company's growth also faces a challenge from the looming U.S. defense spending cuts. The enactment of the Budget Control Act of 2011 will reduce defense spending by $487 billion over a 10-year period starting fiscal 2012. Lockheed Martin, which receives more than 80% of its revenues from the U.S. government, will be impacted significantly from the proposed cuts. The extent of the impact would be dependent on the extent of budget cuts. However, the company anticipates an across the board cut to reduce U.S. defense spending by $52 billion in fiscal 2013.Share repurchase program and high dividend yield to address shareholder concernsIn anticipation of the cuts, the company has taken certain steps to address shareholder concerns. First, it approved a share repurchase program, and second, it increased the dividend payout. Lockheed has authorization to repurchase its common stock worth up to $6.5 billion. By the end of the previous quarter, it had repurchased stock worth $3.4 billion under the program. Such a program helps prevent a large decline in stock price in the wake of a decline in revenues stemming from budgetary cuts. Also, the company recently announced its third quarter dividend of $1 per share, resulting in a high dividend yield of 4.51%. Such shareholder focused strategies help to address their concerns, which stem from the challenge posed by defense spending cuts to the company's growth over the next few years.Disclosure: No positions"
717171,21305,2012-07-12T08:49:57-04:00,,"Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE:LMT) is the headline developer/producer of the Joint Strike Fighter (the F-35). This is a program that is supposed to produce a total of 2,400 airplanes during the lifetime of the project. The program has been delayed by glitches in its onboard computer systems, cracks in structural components, and troubles with its electrical systems. In addition China's new J-20 fighter, which made its first test flight in Jan. 2012, is thought to be at least partially based on technology stolen from the US F-35 program. This makes many think that the F-35 may not provide enough of an edge against the Russian and Chinese planes. It makes some think that the size of the program should be more limited.An Obama commission has recommended that $9.5B could be saved through fiscal 2015 by replacing half of the planned F-35 purchases with newer models of current fighters. It further advised canceling the Marine Corps short takeoff/vertical landing version of the F-35 as simply too buggy and too expensive. The Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition Ashton Carter has already suggested that the program can be cut by 10% to 30% of its now $1T to $1.5T figure.The recent Congressional fiscal 2013 budget proposal seeks to delay the purchase of several weapons systems. It would delay the purchase of 179 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter planes. These sell for about $133 million each currently. It would substitute older, cheaper planes in their place. That's almost $24B in revenue that LMT would not collect next year. LMT's total revenue for FY2012 is $45.69B. The current Congressional budget proposal would cut LMT's revenue by roughly 50%, although a small part of this might be regained through the sale of other older systems. Still the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet is made by Boeing (NYSE:BA). The F-14 Tomcat is made by Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC). The F-16 Fighting Falcon is made by General Dynamics (NYSE:GD). The Department of Defense previously decided to order no more of the F-22 Raptors, which is the one relatively new fighter made by LMT. Some are still scheduled to be delivered in 2012, but they will supposedly be the last. New sales of the F-18, the F-16, and/or the F-14 will not add to LMT's revenues.Further the Department of Defense is already considering a 10% to 30% cut to this program longer term. It may end up cutting the program even more than that as the Congress gets more serious about cutting the federal budget in years to come. This is a real worry for Lockheed Martin . It is not just speculation. A $500B revenue loss would dramatically change LMT's prospects. Such a cut is being more seriously considered every day. Further the major advantage of these new aircraft over the old fighters is that they are stealth planes. However, rumors are floating around that stealth detecting radar already exists. Apparently during the long development process of the F-22, F-35, and other stealth planes, the engineers have had time to develop radar that will detect stealth signatures. This is just rumor to me, but as an engineer and a scientist I find it highly believable. This is yet another reason the F-35 program may get substantially reduced. LMT will be the main loser if it does. Even Sen. John McCain has called the F-35 program a scandal and a tragedy. Does that sound as if he will back it to the hilt?In the short term, it looks very probable that the 179 F-35 purchases for 2013 will be delayed beyond 2013. At $133 million per airplane, this would be a $24B revenue loss for LMT in 2013. Analysts estimates do not reflect this. Some investors are aware of what the Congress is proposing, but most are not paying attention. They view LMT as a big lumbering behemoth that cannot really be hurt. With huge losses to current revenue expectations, it can most certainly be hurt. It is a sell; or if you are an aggressive trader, it is a short.The two-year chart of LMT gives some technical direction to the trade.The slow stochastic sub chart shows that LMT is overbought. The main chart shows that the price line is near the upper Bollinger band (overbought). The 50-day SMA has turned dramatically downward since late April 2012. It seems set to cross the 200-day SMA heading downward very soon. This would be a big sell signal. The price line has rallied above both the 200-day SMA and the 50-day SMA in the recent overall market rally. Now that the overall market is again looking weak, the LMT price line is set up perfectly to fall dramatically downward. The current price is $86.84. The first area of support is at approximately $81. The next area of support is at approximately $67 to $69. It could easily fall to this level on the above news. Further descent may need more concrete news about the 2013 budget cuts or further F-35 program cuts. More definite news about significant longer-term cuts to the program may be necessary to see LMT go much below this. Of course, if the world economic news becomes bad enough, LMT could easily go lower on that basis. The 4.61% dividend should buoy the stock a bit, but that is not nearly enough to hold up a stock that may lose roughly 50% of its expected revenue for next year and possibly/probably far beyond that. It trades at a PE of 10.37, but how valid is that in the light of its likely revenue losses for 2013? The stock is a definite sell at this point. It is likely a great short opportunity. Some of the fundamental financial data above came from Yahoo Finance.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in LMT over the next 72 hours."

653681,29681,2012-06-12T11:02:35-04:00,,"Company OverviewLockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is an the world's largest defence contractor. It operates in 4 different business segments: Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, Information Systems & Global Solutions, and Space Systems. It is far ahead of any of its competitors with important contracts such as the F-35 contract. Its competitors include Boeing (NYSE:BA), General Dynamics (NYSE:GD), and Northrop Grunman Corporation (NYSE:NOC).At the end of 2011, Lockheed reported revenues of $46.499 billion, operating income of $3.980 billion, and net income of $2.655 billion. It has total assets of $37.908 billion, and total equity of $1.001 billion. Its current share price is $83.29 and its market capitalization is $27.1 billion.Bearish or Bullish?Lockheed's biggest strength is unfortunately also its biggest weakness. The company relies heavily on the U.S. government for funding. At a time of U.S. budget cuts, this is not a very good position for the company to be in. The Department of Defense is likely to have to cut more than half a trillion dollars out of its budget over the next ten years, this will lead to a significant decline in Lockheed's revenues. All four of Lockheed's business segments have been severely damaged by this as all four have important contracts with the Department of Defense.Lockheed has poured money into the development of the F-35, an aircraft which is meant to replace aircraft across the armed forces in the army, navy and air force. However, Lockheed has run into serious problems which has delayed testing more than two years to 2016 casting doubt on the company's ability to meet its targets which could lead to some order cancellation from international customers and perhaps even the US government.The costs of production for the F-35 are also quickly rising out of control. They have almost doubled to roughly $390 billion since first being commissioned in 2001. This could well lead to worse profitability for Lockheed in the new future and cuts in research and development as it seeks to retain its competitive edge. Furthermore, if the costs and timeline do spiral out of control, then this will after the average cost of its aircraft as it will produce less over the long run eliminating some of the economies of scale it could benefit from. Therefore, this could damage the net profit it makes off the F-35.However, Lockheed does have many important redeeming qualities. The company still has a wonderful product portfolio and has been allowed by Congress to sell most of its products on an international scale leading to increased revenues. The firm has also reduced its workforce significantly, laying off about 20,000 workers, to reduce its labor costs and raise profit margins.Furthermore, the U.S. government probably won't be keen to cut defence spending overly much due to its continuing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It still needs a lot of equipment to protect its troops and help ""win the war."" Congress has not been very forthcoming in authorising defence budget cuts and would actually probably prefer to raise the defence budget. Therefore, Lockheed is well positioned as the number one defence contractor to benefit off this.The election in 2012 is likely to play a big role in Lockheed's future. If a Republican administration is elected, then defence spending is unlikely to be excessively cut or cut at all, helping Lockheed hugely. However, if Obama is reelected then the future does not look too bright for Lockheed as huge defence cuts will likely go ahead and Lockheed will be one of the big losers of these cuts.ConclusionMorningstar gives Lockheed a fair value of $71.00 per share and gives it two stars. The Motley Fool is more generous giving Lockheed a 4-star rating and most of its users believe it will outperform the market. I believe that Lockheed is not a very attractive investment over the next few months and if I held it I would sell. However, if Mitt Romney becomes elected in the Winter then I would like Lockheed at its current price. At the moment, the election seems like a toss up so Lockheed's future is very much uncertain.All my data is from morningstar.com, unless otherwise stated.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
649041,27711,2012-06-10T10:23:32-04:00,,"It may be somewhat of a paradox, but Lockheed Martin could potentially be a major beneficiary of a worsening economy in the coming months. The reason for this is simply the increasing probability of a Romney Administration in the White House. With slowing job growth and erased gains in the market from its run earlier in the year, the recovery seems to have taken a turn for the worse, harming Obama's draw to voters. The economy has fared well under Republican presidencies for a multitude of reasons, but the benefit for defense stocks comes down to one: increased opportunities for government contracts.Even if Romney were to win, it does not become an open ended cakewalk for cash with defense companies; the superior company must be chosen. This is where Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) comes into play. Lockheed manufactures the most advanced fighter jets along with increasing its capabilities in cyber security and unmanned vehicles, giving it the best arsenal of products available to a constantly upgrading military. With a receding economy in the coming months, investing in the prospects of a Romney victory through defense is best done by purchasing Lockheed Martin; the company most likely to maximize the benefits of an escalation in military spending.Lockheed Martin holds the greatest prospects for success under a Romney Administration because of the superiority and performance of its products and their ability to emerge victorious in competitions for contracts from the United States government. Lockheed offers a variety of defense services, including cyber security, aircraft, unmanned vehicles, and missile systems, among others. Unmanned technology is constantly becoming more integrated and more important to the effectiveness of our military, and Lockheed is developing products that will serve as next generation capabilities. The RQ-170 Sentinel, a stealth reconnaissance drone, is representative of these efforts and should prove to exceed the abilities of its competition. Lockheed's product technology and quality can be seen in all of its services, but recently there was an example to prove just how good Lockheed truly is. The Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile reached 142 successful tests since its introduction in 1989, a number unmatched not only by other ballistic missiles, but by any space launch vehicle. If this is not a testament to Lockheed's exceptional ability to create advanced and all the while reliable products, I do not know what is.Despite its diversification of products, Lockheed has invested much of its near-term future in the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning. Both stealth and virtually unmatched in technology and ability, these planes are undoubtedly the future of fighter aircraft. The problem has not been the capability of the planes, it has been the expenses. It would not make sense to increase expenditures on conventional aircraft such as the Boeing (NYSE:BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet when efforts to modernize the military are constantly in effect, adding to the probability of a greater volume of orders. The F-35 gives the Navy an ability unlike any other with its stealth abilities paired with vertical take off, which is why it would be surprising if it did not become the future of U.S. Naval aviation, with the F-22 following a similar path in the Air Force. Lockheed Martin's excellent record in terms of products and advanced capabilities (even beyond the F-22 and F-35) place it as the front-runner to benefit most from an increased opportunity for government contracts.If the economic numbers in May serve as a precursor for the November election, Romney has a solid chance of winning. Romney has continually expressed his desire to reduce spending in many areas, but defense has not been one of them. As CNN Money points out, estimates have concluded that Romney would increase defense spending by $2 trillion over the next decade. There is no question that defense expenditures would rise, but the uncertainty lies in where it would be spent. Some military experts have expressed the need to revamp conventional forces, while others think that it is in the military's best interest to invest in more advanced capabilities, such as the F-35. To me, if such a large scale spending hike is going to the military, it is logical to make the military more effective and more efficient by investing in newer technologies such as unmanned aircraft and stealth fighter aircraft (F-22/F-35).Historically, defense stocks have fared well under Republicans for the precise reason that they will perform well under Romney. Under George W. Bush, prices of Lockheed Martin shares blew up, going from $20 to almost $120 a share (until the recession hit and it fell back to prices around $80, which is still a four fold increase). Yes, there were two wars under Bush that helped to propel the stock, but with growing tension in the Middle East over Iran's nuclear program, a continuation of American fighting in the region cannot be ruled out. Even if there are no more conflicts, the military's presence in Asia is being made a top priority and the potential threat of China gives more incentive to allocate money to the unrivaled new technologies that Lockheed is and has been producing. The defense industry's prospects under Romney are looking bright, and even brighter for Lockheed Martin.If you are considering investing in Lockheed Martin, there are some risks to be acknowledged. The most obvious risk is the re-election of Obama. While clearly the defense industry would advocate for a Romney victory as it is in their best interest, an Obama victory would not be detrimental to the military or to Lockheed. Obama has no intention of spending remotely as much on defense as Romney plans to, but that does not mean that he will neglect the necessity of revamping the military.Obama has not been as unfriendly to the military as he is made out to be. Do not forget that he allowed the strike on Bin Laden, has relentlessly approved drone strikes throughout the Middle East, and has not ruled out an attack on Iran. There is no evidence that would foreshadow a less military-friendly second term, especially with the need to boost military presence in Asia. Lockheed would still have the ability to succeed under Obama, but not nearly to the extent that it would under Romney and his defense spending policy. Nevertheless it would remain an attractive play.Another serious concern is a continuation of the inability to compromise and pass a budget. If our politicians are incapable of doing this, automatic, across-the-board spending cuts (including defense) will take effect. This is actually more worrisome than the possibility of another four years under Obama, because the automatic spending cuts would directly harm the defense industry, while an Obama victory keeps the industry where it is currently and still provides for potential contracts.An issue facing Lockheed in particular is the call by many military experts to renovate the nation's conventional forces, which would benefit Boeing products such as the F-15e Strike Eagle and the F/A-18 Super Hornet, and injure both F-22 and F-35 sales. This is a legitimate worry, but Lockheed does not solely rely on these two fighter jets and has a large and good enough variety of products to stay afloat if this decision were to be made (though I do not think that it will be). On the technical side, Lockheed fell through both its 50- and 100-day moving averages in May. Lockheed did not see the resistance that it would have liked, but with the way the entire market fared in May it is not as frightening as it may appear. Lockheed still faces challenges that generally stem from Washington, but its potential is strong enough to outweigh the risks.Lockheed Martin's extraordinary array of products give it a great chance to prosper under a President Romney. There is no saying whether or not Romney will win the election, but if unemployment and the general market (including Europe) does not get back on track rather soon, Obama is in serious trouble. The 200-day moving average is an important indicator for Lockheed, and if it is met with substantial resistance it may soon be the time to make an entry level position (and the 4.9% dividend definitely does not reduce its draw). It may still be hypothetical to an extent, but if Romney can defeat Obama and implement his defense spending increases, Lockheed Martin is in the premier position to maximize the potential of new government contracts.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in LMT over the next 72 hours."
676901,22742,2012-06-22T01:19:50-04:00,,"By Timour ChayipovDividend growth investing is one of the most popular strategies used by investors and when applied consistently over the long term it works well. The basic idea is for investors to buy shares of companies that have long histories of increasing dividends and hope that in 10 to15 years the dividend yields relative to invested capital will grow from perhaps 3 - 5 percent to a more comfortable 10 or 15 percent.We can describe this strategy with a simple formula:Y = D / ICWhere Y is the dividend yield on the original invested capital; D is the annual dividend per share which is a variable number that hopefully increases 5 to10 percent per year; and IC stands for invested capital which is a constant and equals the amount of the original investment.I would like to introduce a strategy whereby, instead of waiting for dividends to increase to a comfortable level, we can change the denominator of the ratio on the right-hand side of the formula from a constant number to a variable number, reducing it 10 percent or more each year, until the denominator becomes zero. What is our dividend yield on zero capital invested? If your guess is infinite, then you are right. And as we reduce our invested capital on one investment (or several simultaneously) we can redeploy our money to expand our portfolio holdings to increase the overall yield even more.This strategy assumes that you are buying stock in a company for the first time, but it can also be applied if you already own a stock at a price you are comfortable with and want to hold onto for retirement. To employ this strategy we must sell a long duration strangle against our established stock position. A strangle is a strategy in which we simultaneously sell a put option and a call option with different strike prices on each, but both with the same expiration (The call strike is above today's price level and the put strike is bellow today's price level).The premium received from a strangle will reduce our invested capital by as much as 15 percent to 20 percent immediately and then we repeat the strategy in each following year to reduce IC again and again, but usually by smaller percentages as we will often ""roll"" a position into the future (this process will be explained in greater detail both below and in examples provided on recommended stocks). By selling both a call option and a put option we accept two obligations: to sell our shares if the price of the underlying stock rises to above our call strike price at expiration or to buy additional shares if the price falls below our put strike price at expiration. This will all become clearer when we look at a detailed example later in the article. We can only have one obligation at any given time because it is not possible that price of stock will be simultaneously above your call strike and bellow your put strike.You shouldn't worry about these obligations because you always have three choices:Which one we choose depends on the stock price level, your opinion about the company's prospects or any number of other circumstances, including personal preferences and investment goals.Let's look at an example of how it works over several years:Let's assume that we are absolutely comfortable with owning Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) at today's price (June18, 2012) $85.0 (this is not a recommendation; we are using this is for example purposes only).So we buy 100 shares of LMT for $85 and sell two options:One January 2014 Put option contract with a strike price of $75.00 with a premium of $7.50 per share.The total premium we collect is $12.50 per share ($1,250), so our cost basis (Invested Capital) will be $85 - $12.50 = $72.50 plus we accept these two obligations:But, of course, it is also possible that neither of our option contracts get executed so we just initiate another strangle position and further reduce our invested capital (or cost basis).Let's look at a few different scenarios:Our Put option will expire worthless and we can sell a new one: January 2015 strike $80.00 at around $5.00.We have 2 choices on what to do with the call option contract: if we think that the price of LMT is too high and will pull back we simply allow the option to be exercised and sell our shares at $90.00 to get a profit $90.00 - $72.50 = $17.50 plus received dividends (if we make this choice we won't sell a new put option and will probably just wait for LMT to pull back to a more comfortable level before reestablishing a position again).Our second choice: if we think that $95.00 is fair price for LMT in January 2014, we can buy back our Call at a price of $5 (it will be in the money and cost 95-90=$5) and sell a new Call option with a January 2015 expiration, strike price of $100.00 and a premium of about $4.00.So, what we end up with in this scenario can be explained like this: we have $10.00 unrealized profit from owning the stock (moved from $85 to $95 and received dividends, plus we got additional premium $5 by selling a new put option and Lost $1 from rolling the Call option (bought back for $5 and sold a new one for $4). In this scenario we reduced our invested Capital by another $4.00 and now it will be $72.50 - $4.00 = $67.50.First: if we think that $70.00 is a very good price we can allow the additional 100 shares of LMT to be put to us at $75.00 (the strike price of our put option), our average price as stated earlier will be ($72.50 + $75.00 )/2 = $73.75 for 200 shares of LMT and at price of $70 our unrealized loss will be just $3.75 per share (but don't forget that we received dividends during the holding period). In this case we would sell two new January 2015 calls and two new January 2014 puts at strikes of 75 and 60 to get premiums of approximately $10.00 for each strangle and reduce our invested Capital per share $73.75 - $10 = $63.75 and then just wait for another year.Our second choice: the call option expires worthless and we sell a new January 2015 call option with a strike price of $75.00 for about $5.00.We buy back our troubled Put option at $5.00 (it will be $5 in the money) and sell a new one to expire January 2015 with a strike price of 60 and a premium of about $6.00.So, now what do we have: we still own 100 shares of LMT and have an unrealized loss of $2.50 per share (72.5 - 70 = 2.5), but received dividends to help offset. Plus, we got an additional premium from the new call of $5.00 and an additional $1.00 from rolling the put (we bought it back at $5 and sold a new one for $6) and reduced our invested Capital by additional $6 and now it is $72.50 - $6.00 = $66.50 per share.A little more advice to help implement this strategy:If you don't have the time to watch the markets for the best entry point simply follow our articles and we'll try our best to provide some good opportunities to initiate positions in the future.

641111,24114,2012-06-06T11:38:13-04:00,,"by Matthew SmithLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is a US-based public enterprise with global operations primarily in the defense, aerospace and data security industries. Over the years, the stock has gradually earned its place among the giants in the industry with significant progress in terms of achieving a greater share of the global market. The company has achieved this largely by maintaining a diversified portfolio of innovative products and specialized services, catering to a global market that stretches across five continents.This has provided Lockheed with the impetus necessary to establish itself securely in the specific industry. As a result, it has become popular among investors as a high-yield low-risk investment option. After analyzing the stock's latest financial indicators and looking at some recent developments that are sure to affect the stock favorably, I strongly believe that Lockheed is poised for higher growth in the current financial year.The stock has made a remarkable recovery this year after a rather inauspicious close to the previous financial year when net income fell by nearly 29% year-on-year on account of an unprecedented decline of 4.3% in sale of electronic and space systems. Lockheed is currently riding the high tide after reporting a 20% rise in profits for the first fiscal quarter which is mainly due to a sharp rise in global sale of aircraft. As a result, the stock has recently been a favorite among investors who are eyeing higher returns on investment.Lockheed traditionally earns the highest number of military contracts from the American defense department on an annual basis, largely owing to its high-tech state-of-the-art portfolio of products and services and for its impressive technological innovations. A number of recently awarded lucrative air-defense contracts promise to generate higher revenues for the business while also giving it an advantage over its peers. The company has received a five-year contract from the US Navy for installation of cockpits and integrated systems. The deal is valued at more than $1 billion and should greatly help the stock in its drive towards higher revenues and greater market share.Apart from this, Lockheed has signed another contract with the US Air Force for the installation and upgrading of missile defense and delivery systems and related security platforms. The deal is valued at nearly $21.5 million and will allow the stock to significantly widen its competitive moat in the defense industry.Therefore, even though investor skepticism for this particular industry is high, especially after the massive cuts that Pentagon is forced to make in its defense budget and cut-throat competition in the market, Lockheed continues to hold a strong position in the stock market by overshadowing its major competitors. A defensive beta of 0.62 has played an integral role in maintaining the stock's resilience against negative market forces. As a result, even the disturbing recent report on jobless claims has not hindered the stock from making an adjustment in its full-year forecast. Stockholders are, therefore, keen on maintaining their positions in the stock for higher returns on investment at a relatively low risk.Now that I have established why Lockheed is a safe and viable investment option, it is time to compare the stock's performance indicators with the three most formidable competitors in the industry to check whether they promise similar returns for investors.Boeing (NYSE:BA) is the biggest corporation in the global aerospace and defense industry in terms of market share and capital. It generates revenues mainly through researching and developing military technologies such as combat and stealth fighter jets, missile defense systems and unmanned aerial vehicles. However, Boeing has also tapped into the commercial market and acquired a massive share through the manufacture of commercial passenger and cargo jets among other similar aerial vehicles.This diversified product portfolio, along with an expanding global market, has earned the stock a wide competitive moat in the aerospace industry while a beta of 1.1 has offered the stock greater resistance against negative market-driving forces. The stock has signed a number of profitable deals this year such as the recent contract with Transaero Airlines on the manufacture and sale of four 787 Dreamliners. However, even though Boeing is a good investment option, Lockheed's recent defense contracts promise to generate greater cashflows, thereby offering stockholders higher returns on investment.Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) has managed to impress an identity of its own in the global aerospace industry, despite the presence of larger and more globally popular contemporaries like Boeing and Lockheed. Even in the stock market, Northrop has performed well, attracting the attention of returns-centric stockholders. However, the recent shift in market trends, which started back in June 2011, has had an adverse influence on the movement of the stock - as a consequence, growth has been sluggish.With its uni-faceted portfolio of products and services, Northrop has found it increasingly difficult to compete against bigger competitors that command a more diversified range of products as well as a massive share of the global market. As a result, prudent investors have largely shied away from investing in the stock, especially seeing how it holds little promise for higher returns on investments. I strongly believe that Northrop is better as a long-term investment option; investors seeking short-term high-yields are better off not purchasing the stock.Last, and perhaps the least favorite among investors in the aerospace and defense industry, Raytheon (RTN) is another multinational corporation that has managed to make its place among the major leaders of the industry with a marginally diversified products and services portfolio.However, Raytheon is not a widely popular investment option as of recently, particularly after an unprecedented shift in market trends. A fall in global demand for aircrafts and radical cuts in military budgets across the globe literally caused sale figures to nosedive. Although Raytheon has resolved to restrategize to win back the trust of investors, I strongly believe that it will take the stock some time to actually undergo the planned transformation. Therefore, it would be a fool's errand to invest in this volatile stock when Lockheed Martin is a safer and more viable option for investors.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
534691,21754,2012-04-26T22:40:06-04:00,,"This week Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) broke out from the pack of its competitors by reporting growth in both revenue and earnings (see earnings call transcript). Recent trends have seen defense contractors with declining revenue and some profit increases. The concern with Lockheed is this performance will continue despite the negative potential of defense spending reductions and a recent strike at their Fort Worth, Tex. aircraft production facility. Lockheed's stock closed Thursday at $91.70 just 54 cents below its 52 week high and $25.76 above its 52 week low.Lockheed has over the last year had growth in earnings thanks to an emphasis on cutting costs primarily reducing the size of their workforce and paying back pension liabilities. The last quarter it saw a decline in net income of 58 cents and profit by 17 cents a share. At that time the prediction for 2012 was $45 billion in revenue which remained consistent with previous estimates.The first quarter of 2012 was much better as net sales increased $700 million year-to-year with earnings of $2.02 a share. The company, though, did hold firm on its predictions of $45-46 billion in sales for the year although it increased projected profit $50 million to $5.075-$5.125 billion.Much of the improved performance was in the Aeronautics division. Sales grew by $554 million thanks to production of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), C-5B and C-130J transports and work on the F-16 fighter. The F-35 which is the most expensive defense program in world history will slowly increase its contribution to revenue as annual production rates increase. Right now the U.S. and its Allies are buying 30-32 aircraft a year but as the full rates of production are reached this number could easily double or triple.Lockheed also had increased sales at the Electronics Systems division while the Information Systems and Space Systems saw declines. Even so all four made operating profits with Electronics leading the pack at $541 million. Only Information Systems profit was lower then last year's.There has been some bad news for the company this past week. Workers at the Fort Worth F-35 production facility rejected the company's contract offer and went on strike. Previous strikes at the location have lasted upwards of 3 weeks and reports indicate that this one might last longer. The dispute as with many is over healthcare and pension proposals.The strike could have a significant impact on production of the F-35 at a time when the program already faces pressures from cost increases and schedule problems. These delays could cause production to be further stretched out and delayed which would negatively affect revenue and earnings from what is the key component of Lockheed's aerospace future.Overall the next few years will be difficult for the large defense contractors. Revenue and profit will be reduced from the recent past when the U.S. and its Allies were spending billions on the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many are trying to adjust to the new market by reducing costs including those related to personnel like health insurance and pensions. Manufacturing companies like Lockheed, Boeing (NYSE:BA) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) also have unionized components of their workforce that might lead to more strikes, delays in programs and reduced payments from the government.Lockheed has had a good quarter starting out but going into the rest of 2012 results might not be so upbeat. The stock price has seen good growth along with the market as whole and is certainly a winner from the dividend side of things. Keeping the price this high might prove more difficult unless Lockheed is able to lock in some big contracts, keep performing on the F-35 and further adjust its costs.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
761031,30811,2012-07-30T05:31:16-04:00,,"Shares of Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) have returned 11.50% over the past 6 months. At $90.20 per share, the stock trades at very close to its 52-week high of $92.24. The entire defense manufacturing sector has been unfavorable to some investors due to the reduced defense budget issue that the market has been focusing on for quite a long time. In my view, I believe the negative impact has already been baked into the prices for many of the defense stocks, and LMT is one of them. As such, I remain a buyer at LMT's current valuations given its attractive dividend yield, solid market position, and healthy financial fundamentals.In this article, I will illustrate some rationales that support my bullish view on LMT.My value analysis is based on a market comparable model. It includes Rockwell Collins (COL), Raytheon (RTN), General Dynamics (GD), and Northrop Grumman (NOC) as LMT's comparable peers. The estimated LMT stock value is then determined by equally weighting the valuations calculated based on the five peer average multiples - EV/Sales, EV/EBITDA, P/S, P/E, and EV/FCF.Accounting for the budget cut, market expects LMT to experience a 2-yr CAGR of 1.6% decline in revenues over the current and next fiscal years. The decline is more severe than the peer average, which is predicted to be declining at 2-year CAGR of 0.9% over the same period. But LMT's EBITDA will likely experience a growth of 2.1% compared to peer group's average decline of 0.1%. The firm's EPS growth of 3.1% is fairly in line with the peers' 3.9% (see comparable analysis table below).In terms of profitability, LMT underperforms the peer group in many of the margin metrics. Nonetheless, its ROE and ROIC are substantially higher than the peer averages (see comparable analysis table below).LMT's FCF margin is lower than the peer average, and the firm also assumes a high debt level, which results in a relatively lower interest coverage rate as well as current and quick ratios. But looking at those ratios on an absolute basis, they remain healthy (see comparable analysis table below).At the current price, LMT's dividend yield of 4.4% is significantly higher than those of the peers (see dividend yield table below).LMT's current stock price of $90.20 implies a 9.4% valuation premium over the five peer average multiples, which appears to be a reasonable level to me as the company should deserve the credits for its high dividend yield, relatively in-line and healthy financials, and solid market position in the defense sector (see relative valuation table below).Since 2001, LMT has increased its dividend per share from $0.44 to $3.25 in 2011, representing a significant 10-year CAGR of 22%. The strong dividend growth reflects management's commitment to return capital to shareholders (see chart below).Additionally, consensus estimates predict LMT's EBITDA margin to continue rising from the current LTM level of 10.4% to 11.7% in FY2014, implying the company's cash flow will likely be stable down the road as LMT has been able to maintain a operating cash flow to EBITDA ratio between 0.7x and 0.9x over the past 3 fiscal years. During the last 10 years, annual dividend paid only represents a small portion of the annual free cash flow, and the company appears to spend the rest of free cash flow on buying back stocks. Hence, the ample liquidity suggests LMT has the capacity to sustain continuing increased dividend payments down the road (see charts below).Bottom line, In light of a 4.4% dividend yield and a reasonable stock value, I recommend adding the shares in your dividend portfolio.Dividend per share chart is sourced from Capital IQ, all other tables and charts are created by author, and all financial data is sourced from Capital IQ and Morningstar.Disclosure: I am long LMT."

The consensus range is $1.61-$1.85 for EPS, and $10.31B-$11.01B for revenue, according to First Call. Lockheed reported mixed Q4 results, beating EPS but missing revenue estimates.

475511,25075,2012-04-03T11:08:06-04:00,,"Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) is a 100 year old technology company providing products and services in the areas of defense, space, intelligence, homeland security, information technology, and cyber security with interests in a number of countries around the world.The company employs 140,000 people and is one of the world's largest defense contractors. Over three quarters of all Lockheed Martin's revenue comes from U.S. government contracts. Its business is broken down into 4 units: Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, Information Systems & Global Solutions, and Space Systems.Recent Performance:From 2002 to 2011 normalized EPS has grown from $1.18 to $7.85 representing a compound average growth rate of 23%. Over that same time, dividends have grown at 25%. The numbers for the last 5 years are 6% and 21% respectively. Lockheed Martin continues to raise the dividend per share at a hefty rate even when EPS is not rising considerably, and as such the payout ratio has increased over the past 5 years from 22% in 2006 to 42% in 2011.Free cash flow over the last 10 years totals over $25B versus total net earnings over the same period of $22B. This is fantastic to see - free cash flow exceeding net earnings provides a lot of confidence.Pension plan contributions can get out of control with companies like Lockheed Martin and it is an important one to watch. In 2011 the company made a significant $2.3B in contributions to their pension plans. This compares to only $1.1B spent on dividends and $2.4B spent on share-repurchases.Quality Rating:(Click to enlarge)Source: intrinsic-valuation.comA low QR score of 49 warrants a closer look. Net debt to equity scores zero predominantly as a result of the huge share-repurchase program that has been in overdrive over the past 7 years. The company has been using its extraordinary cash flow generation to repurchase its own shares, thereby obviously lowering the share count (from 445M in 2005 to 340M in 2011) but also lowering shareholders' equity (from $7.7B in 2005 to $1B in 2011). We don't see Lockheed Martin's debt as a concern.The poor gross profit margin is a bit surprising - we would expect to see this a bit higher. Net profit margin is only a few percent less than gross meaning the vast majority of Lockheed Martin's total costs comes from producing their products.The poor free cash flow score is a function of a slightly inconsistent free cash flow over the last 10 years and a lack of serious free cash flow growth - but the reason for the lack of growth is that it has come from a high base - for example in 2002 net earnings were $500M whereas free cash flow was $1.6B.Intrinsic Value:(Click to enlarge)Source: intrinsic-valuation.comA reasonable margin of safety is on offer at the moment, and intrinsic value is forecast to rise. We plug Wall Street analyst estimates into our valuation formula, so the forecast intrinsic value is certainly dependent, amongst other things, on the accuracy of those analyst estimates.The margin of safety currently on offer may have come about due to a number of investors sitting on the fence pending the result of the presidential election later this year. Lockheed Martin contributes a significant amount of money to election campaigns, and with so much money sourced from the U.S. government, the company would no doubt keep a close eye on the political situation domestically.(Click to enlarge)Companies whose share-price has traveled sideways for a few years generally have impatient shareholders, who after seeing no share-price appreciation for so long sells out. Smart investors realize that a company with a rising intrinsic value and a share-price that has gone sideways for years is a buy - eventually the share-price will catch up to intrinsic value. It always does.The graph above explains why the company has been aggressive in its share repurchase program over the past few years - repurchasing shares when the share-price is below intrinsic value adds value to shareholders.Investment Grade Score:(Click to enlarge)Source: intrinsic-valuation.comWith a margin of safety of 20 and a quality rating of 49, Baxter achieves an investment grade score of 10 which places it at number 117 on the intrinsic-valuation.com Investment Grade Table. Lockheed Martin's dividend provides a floor for the stock meaning a considerable margin of safety and subsequent high investment grade score rarely presents itself.Conclusion:Lockheed's future looks secure, even with the threat of military spending cuts. It has a huge amount of backlog from all around the world, and is at the cutting edge of innovation. Most of the executive managers have been with the company for many years and own a significant vested interest in the performance of the company.Pension commitments need to be monitored closely, but with a dividend yield of 4.5% and a bright future, now looks to be a reasonable time to take a long term position in a strong company.Lockheed Martin is already a big company with a market cap of around $29B, so we can't expect future growth rates to be super high. But with its dividend and share-repurchase programs well entrenched, combined with a backlog of work that is at record levels, investors should expect to see reasonable EPS (as well as DPS) growth for the company well into the future.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in LMT over the next 72 hours."
469851,25159,2012-03-31T08:43:21-04:00,,"Mention ""National Defense"", and few associations come quicker to mind than Lockheed Martin (LMT). The company has been a leader in defense technology and equipment for decades now, and seems set to stay headed down the same road toward future horizons.Lockheed rises and falls with national defense. Or, more relevantly, spending on national defense. And since 2012 features a budget cut in that department, Lockheed may be in for a bit of a hit. That's not to say the company is down. By all means, Lockheed remains the clear-cut leader in the defense and aerospace industry. Experts give it the thumbs up to buy if you're looking to buy into this industry.The question then is not whether you'd want to buy Lockheed, but whether you'd want to buy any defense or aerospace stock. Either way, it's not going to be cheap. With Lockheed trading around $89.06 per share, you'll want to truthfully consider whether the investment is sage or not.You could spend the same and buy yourself more shares of competitor Boeing (BA), but you'll run risk with them too. See, it relies just as heavily on defense spending, but is failing to stay within budget on a contract with the Air Force. Boeing is already $900 million over budget, and, at the same time, it faces stiff competition in its aeronautics output with its own European competitors.So yes, it helps to have your competition struggling a little bit too. And maybe it's for this very reason that Lockheed was awarded a solid, $66 million follow-on contract with the Missile Defense Agency. The new money continues its development of Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) Weapon System. The contract continues Lockheed's work for five years and establishes it once again as the most advanced company in industry. Others simply can't compete in developing high-level weapon technologies like this.THAAD is the only missile defense system of its kind (""with the operational flexibility to intercept in both the endo- and exo-atmospheres to provide versatile capability to the warfighter""). Keep this in mind when you consider Lockheed, as it maintains its status as one of the global leaders in technology of this kind.But where money is coming in, it to also be leaking out. Lockheed has its own problems keeping budget with a military contract. The company is facing problems in the development of its F-35 warplanes, meant to be sold to several countries. Now, as reports have come out that planes are experiencing malfunctions, nations are reconsidering their bids and the US, along with Lockheed, are left to handle the bill.The most recent news has been good for the F-35, as it just completed its first midair, nighttime refueling mission. Still, Boeing has jumped on the opportunity of the F-35's delay to lobby Congress to invest in its own planes, the Super Hornet, a contract that could be worth up to $2.5billion.I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the best part of Lockheed stock, though. Lockheed pays high dividends. It has paid out at $1 per share for the previous two quarters, more than double what Boeing offers. Lockheed also features an EPS average of $7.80, which is also substantially higher than its biggest competitor, Boeing. So that certainly makes the stock a good one to own.A good stock indeed, especially when its dividend yield is 4.50%. That's almost double Boeing and well ahead of any other competitor. Of course, who knows how long Lockheed can keep this rate at, especially with more calls for budget cuts in the defense industry coming.So the choice is whether you can put up with the industry. Because it's not just Lockheed and Boeing enduring the roller coaster that is the defense industry, other companies are too. Take Raytheon (RTN), makers of the Patriot missile system. Its stock, too, rises and falls with industry news, and it sells a much pricier product than Lockheed's missile defense systems. It's also one that is not always as in demand. For a company can always sell defense, but it cannot always sell aggression.Other competitors, like Northrop Grumman (NOC) have fared well; Northrop  scoops up cheaper government contracts than Lockheed and Boeing. Northrop recently partnered with Lockheed to help its price keep level so far in 2012. It'd be nice to keep such mutually beneficial partnerships alive, but sooner or later the two firms will compete once again for a contract.Also competing in those contracts, especially for those smaller contracts is General Dynamic (GD), whose growth has been substantial enough to be considered one of the top five best growth stocks that Warren Buffett owns. The company expects nearly a 10% growth by the end of 2012. However, just as Lockheed, General Dynamic may be just one large failed project away from plummeting.Maybe these smaller (and take the word ""smaller"" with a bit of asterisk, as they are enormous companies, just not as enormous as Lockheed) companies are the wave of the future as the government contractors look to cut costs to reflect budget cuts. If this is so, however, you can expect Lockheed to adapt. It will remain a leader in an industry full of ups and downs.Unfortunately, though, the ups and downs are an inescapable part of the defense industry, especially when the company deals with the newest and most advanced technologies. You are going to have large investments and you are going to have failures. What you do know is that if the US continues to keep their defense budget high, and finance research and development for new weapon technologies, Lockheed will get contracts. And perhaps that's enough reason to buy Lockheed Martin stock for a specific purpose, like retirement.So, again, the question isn't whether you want to buy Lockheed stock, but, with more budget cuts surely coming, whether you want to invest in defense technology stocks at all.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
444761,24195,2012-03-20T06:22:37-04:00,,"Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT)Business description and background:ThesisWith estimated 2011 sales of $47 billion, LMT is the world's largest military weapons maker. In 2010, the company derived 84% of its net sales from the U.S. government, including the Department of Defense (DoD) as well as non-DoD agencies. Sales to foreign governments contributed 15% of net sales (up from 13% in 2009), with 1% of net sales to commercial and other customers. Lockheed Martin conducts business through four operating segments: Aeronautics; Electronic Systems; Space Systems; and Information Systems & Global Services.The law passed by Congress will cut into planned defense spending significantly, but it is not yet clear how much. In a best case scenario, which would include no further cuts, the base budget will fall slightly from FY11's $529 bn into the ~$527 bn range in both FY12 and FY13. In the worst case, Congress could fail to agree on further deficit reduction and the bill's trigger provisions would take effect, in which case the DoD base budget would drop to ~$472 bn in FY13. This will be a dire scenario for the DoD and industry, and therefore it is unlikely to occur, despite the fact that avoiding it means Republicans will likely have to agree to tax increases of some variety (likely the elimination of tax expenditures/deductions) and Democrats to entitlement cuts, which neither side has been willing to do thus far. One can assume a middle of the road outcome and organic growth forecasts in which Congress cuts defense spending by an incremental $180 bn over nine years, which would take the base budget to ~$508 bn in FY13.LMT had a spectacular year in 2011, returning 21% compared to only 1% for the other defense primes on average. In addition, while not all companies have reported yet, it is likely that LMT, at 2%, will be the only defense prime to deliver y/y organic growth in 2011. The stock no longer looks as cheap as it did entering last year, and with its dividend already at attractive levels it is unlikely that the company will substantially increase its dividend this year as it did last September. With its valuation more in-line with peers, a challenging fundamental outlook, and no clear catalysts may restrict the relative upside for the stock now. In addition, the F-35 program will continue to face a budget threat as long as the fiscal situation remains unsustainable. The budget situation could still rear its head again this year as sequestration is still the law of the land, and as long as this is the case we see continued overhang on the F-35 programWhile defense companies face organic sales declines in the coming years, balance sheets should remain strong and cash flows dependable, enabling management teams to continue returning cash to shareholders. Like many other defense companies, Lockheed Martin Corp has also approved up to $1 billion in August 2011 to an existing stock buyback program started in October 2010. The defense company's board of directors is expected to consider its next share repurchase program this fall. Defense companies have already been willing to return cash over the past several years, though the preferred vehicle-buybacks may be suboptimal, and direct transfers in the form of dividends would be preferable. Repurchases in the current environment is likely to be a bet on future defense budgets. To the extent that companies do return cash, however, it would be better to prefer special dividends to share repurchases. The lack of any substantial special dividends in recent years amidst the large volumes of cash that have been poured into share repurchase maybe a substantial and unnecessary risk to shareholder value. The stocks of the five leading defense large caps (excluding Boeing) now trade 20% below the average price at which they have repurchased stock over the past five years. This share repurchase activity has involved a very substantial use of cash - in total the five companies over the five years have repurchased $32 bn of stock, which for perspective represents 39% of their combined market caps today.Demand for military equipment and systems are primarily driven by growth in the procurement and R&D sectors of the U.S. defense budget. Based on U.S. Department of Defense statistics, from FY 00 (Oct.) through FY 10, the procurement and R&D budgets within the U.S. defense budget expanded at compound annual rates of 9.0% and 7.6%, respectively. However, Standard & Poor's expects defense budgets to decline going forward, due to pressure resulting from high U.S. budget deficits and increased entitlement spending.Return on invested capital, adjusted to exclude a large decline in stockholders' equity in 2008, was 17.9% in 2010 and 20.0% in 2009. The Aerospace & Defense industry recorded an average return on invested capital of 15.7% in 2010 and 14.6% in 2009. Free cash flow as a percentage of sales was 6.0% in 2010 and 5.1% in 2009, versus an industry average of 6.7% in 2010 and 7.5% in 2009.Management & StewardshipLockheed boasts of a strong and commendable management team with industry stewards. Robert J.Stevens is the Chairman and CEO of Lockheed Martin since April 2005. He is an industry veteran with over 30 years of experience in various organizations within government sectors including but not limited to Mosanto Company, Air Traffic management. Mr. Kubasik has served as President and Chief Operating Officer of LMT since January 2010. He previously served as Executive Vice President - Electronic Systems from September 2007 to December 2009, and as Chief Financial Officer from February 2001 to August 2007. Among its executive vice president's one can count Ralph D.Heath. Mr. Heath has served as Executive Vice President since January 2005. He previously served as Executive Vice President and General Manager of the F-22 Program from November 2002 to December 2004.The management and other insiders own around 0.1% of the company.ValuationWe have used the DCF valuation using conservative estimates to arrive at the fair value of LMT at $111 which represents a 23% premium to its current trading price.Disclosure: I am long LMT.Disclaimer: This discussion is for informational purposes and should not be taken as a recommendation to purchase any individual securities.

In Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) case, we think the firm is fairly valued at $72 per share, meaningfully lower than where it is currently trading. Our report on Lockheed Martin and hundreds of other companies can be found here.For some background, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index (click here for more info on our methodology), which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best.If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Lockheed Martin posts a VBI score of 6 on our scale, reflecting our 'fairly valued' DCF assessment of the company, its unattractive relative valuation versus peers, and bullish techinicals. We use Boeing (NYSE:BA), General Dynamics (NYSE:GD), Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), and Raytheon (RTN) as its peer group.Our Report on Lockheed Martin imagesInvestment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsLockheed Martin earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. We expect the firm's return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) to expand to 41.7% from 39.4% during the next two years.The company looks fairly valued at this time. We expect the firm to trade within our fair value estimate range for the time being. If the firm's share price fell below $54, we'd take a closer look.Lockheed Martin has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 6% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 1.4 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 86.6%.The firm's share price performance has been roughly in line with that of the market during the past quarter. We'd expect the firm's stock price to converge to our fair value estimate within the next three years, if our forecasts prove accurate.The firm sports a very nice dividend yield of 4.5%. We expect the firm to pay out about 50% of next year's earnings to shareholders as dividends. The company is included in our prestigious Dividend100 publication.Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital [ROIC] with its weighted average cost of capital [WACC]. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Lockheed Martin's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 35.4%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 9.7%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Lockheed Martin's free cash flow margin has averaged about 6% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow [FCFF], which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Lockheed Martin, cash flow from operations increased about 34% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 4% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Lockheed Martin's shares are worth between $54 and $90 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $72 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 9.2 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 8 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 0.2% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 2.9%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 9.3%, which is above Lockheed Martin's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 1.8% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Lockheed Martin, we use a 9.7% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $72 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that is created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Lockheed Martin. We think the firm is attractive below $54 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $90 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Lockheed Martin's fair value at this point in time to be about $72 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Lockheed Martin's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $86 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $72 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial Statements    Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
475081,25901,2012-04-03T08:23:50-04:00,,"I grew up some 15 miles from a SAC (Strategic Air Command) base. I used to lie on my back in the schoolyard grass gazing heavenward as the lumbering refueling tankers floated by and watch fighters streak through the blue, anticipating the thunderous sonic boom that almost always followed. The sky was checkered with contrails and the cold war was at its zenith.Times have changed. No Cold War. But I still have a fascination with military aircraft. Like many in my generation, I understand the importance of a strong defense capability. I like to keep tabs on defense company stocks. If the defense industry is sound, our country is safer.With that said, let's take a look at Lockheed Martin (LMT) from a value investor's perspective. Shares are trading close to the $90 mark. Lockheed is a large cap approaching $29 billion with a trailing twelve month price to earnings ratio of 11.39 suggesting the stock might be a bargain. The price to earnings growth ratio is slightly less promising, reporting in some 56 basis points above the ideal. Price to book is exceedingly high compared to what traditional value investors would consider acceptable at 28.77. Lockheed's return on equity, however, would exceed anyone's expectations at 118.59%. Quarterly year-over-year revenue and earnings growth are mired in negative territory at -4.30 and -28.90, respectively. As we move to the fundamentals signaling financial strength, value investors are again disappointed. Debt to equity and current ratios are 645.36 and 1.16, respectively. The former is abysmal and the latter, while 'textbook', doesn't mean much in view of the former. Lockheed does pay a fairly robust dividend, yielding 3.4%, supported by a fairly reasonable payout ratio of 42%. The fundamentals, taken as a whole, aren't terribly impressive.Before we press the eject button, I think we should research this company in more depth. After all, it has prospered for more than a century and is the wellspring of many premier fighter planes in our time; the F-16 Falcon, F-22 Raptor and most recently the F-35 Lightning II. Lockheed has also produced the greatest names in military air transport, such as the Hercules, Galaxy, and Super Galaxy airlifters.I dove into the income statement and observed that revenues and gross profits have been basically flat for the past 3 fiscal years. Net income has declined at an average of 5% annually. Total stockholder equity has plummeted by almost 75%. To this grim scenario, add the failure of congress to enact voluntary budget cuts, which may result in $500 billion in automatic cuts in defense spending, effective January, 2013, and the future of Lockheed begins to come into question. All this negativity could turn on a dime, however. Lockheed's future is largely staked on the F-35 and its variations. Much as a new therapeutic drug works its way the maze of tests, twists and turns that is the Federal Drug Administration, so wends the F-35F through the Department of Defense and, of course, the various congressional oversight and budget committees. So does this reduce investment in Lockheed to a gamble, much in the same way an investment in most biotechnology stock is a gamble? Noted value investing guru John Shapiro of Chieftain Capital Investments has slashed his holdings in Lockheed by 23% but, he hasn't closed his position entirely. Read into that what you will.Other defense contractors are facing challenges as well. The Boeing Company (BA) is trying to cash-in on Lockheed's software problems with the F-35. Boeing manufactures F/A-18 E/F Super Hornets and is pressing lawmakers and the Pentagon for $2 billion in additional funds to keep production alive. There are thousands of jobs at stake across several defense contractors which may influence lawmakers to aid Boeing in its quest to keep the Super Hornet alive. This would be a blow to Lockheed.Boeing is broadly diversified compared to Lockheed. Boeing has a substantial presence as a manufacturer of civilian aircraft and would undoubtedly be in a position to weather the loss of the Super Hornet. Lockheed, however, isn't in a favorable position to lose the F-35 Lightning.Boeing has a market cap more almost twice that of Lockheed and trades at about 14 times trailing twelve month earnings. It has a superior price to book at 15.69 and a return on equity that exceeds Lockheed's by 5.4%. Boeing's quarterly year-over-year revenue and earnings growth stand at 18.2% and 19.7% respectively, also superior to Lockheed's result. Boeing's debt to equity ratio (although far from stellar) is twice as nice as Lockheed's. The current ratios are comparable. Boeing's dividend yield is 2.3% with a payout ratio of 31%. Both these numbers are below Lockheed's. Boeing's 787 Dreamliner has been well received, but rising fuel costs and the inevitable havoc that reeks upon the airline industry's profits has the potential to derail Boeing's current position in the market.Other players in the defense industry, such as Raytheon (RTN), General Electric (GE), and Honeywell (HON) are no doubt concerned about the pending reductions in defense spending. The fate of these stocks are tied together in a hundred different ways and although this Gordian knot will hold for a while, it is anyone's guess how long that is.I plan to sit on the sidelines until I see which way the congressional wind blows on the question of defense cuts. Prudence may dictate that you consider a similar course. In any event, perform your due diligence on any stock that depends on the Department of Defense for a substantial share of its revenues.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
395811,24936,2012-02-27T17:22:58-05:00,,"A couple of days ago Lee Cooperman was on Bloomberg TV telling viewers that long-term Treasuries are the worst investments in the market. He is not the only one. Warren Buffett recently iterated similar arguments. Cooperman suggested that dividend stocks would be better for investors than the Treasuries. So we decided to compile the list of high dividend stocks smart money is buying. There are several names but in this article we will focus on Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) and Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB). This is the first in a series of articles.Lockheed Martin has a dividend yield of 4.53%, more than doubling the yield of long-term US Treasury bonds. The company has also been increasing its dividend payouts for 9 consecutive years. We think it is very likely that LMT will continue to raise its dividends in the future. Institutional investors recently increased their holdings by 0.53%. The company's fourth-quarter results in 2011 were not as good as those in 2010. It reported net income of $683 million on total revenue of $12.2 billion, versus $961 million net income on $12.8 billion revenue in 2010. However, we think the company's lower earnings are offset by its strong cash flow from operations and return on equity. LMT's net operating cash flow significantly increased by over 650% to $1.2 billion, while the average industry growth rate is about 50%.Our only concern about Lockheed Martin is its dependence on military spending which may be cut over the next few years. Analysts don't expect net negative developments though. LMT's current P/E ratio is 11.32 and its forward P/E ratio is 10.42 which implies a nearly 9% growth rate in earnings this year. Lockheed Martin is also cheap compared to Boeing (NYSE:BA) which has a current P/E of 14.26 and a forward P/E of 13.38. Although BA is expected to grow at higher rates than LMT (11% vs. 8%), the discount in Lockheed Martin's price compensates for that. Assuming that analysts' predictions are right, Lockheed Martin is a great pick for dividend investors.Campbell Soup Company also has a dividend yield of 3.46% and a positive institutional transaction of 1.53%. Similar to LMT, CPB's net income is also a bit lower compared to a year ago, while its cash flows are strong. For the 13 weeks ending January 29, 2012, CPB reported net income of $205 million on $2.11 billion total revenue, compared with $239 million net income on $2.13 billion total revenue for the same period a year ago. On the other hand, CPB's net operating cash flow increased by over 350% to $73 million. The company also has strong margins. Its gross margin is 40% and its profit margin is above 10%. We also think CPB is currently trading at a discount. It has a low current P/E ratio of 13.92, versus 16.44 for General Mills Inc (NYSE:GIS). A few other consumer goods companies, such as HJ Heinz Company (HNZ) and Kraft Foods Inc (KFT), also have higher P/E ratios than CPB (18 and 19 respectively). These are low growth stocks with annual expected EPS growth rates in the neighborhood of 7-8%. They also have similar dividend yields.What we like about Campbell Soup is that it increased its dividends by around 80% since 2004. However it didn't consistently increase its dividends. There were periods where they actually cut dividend payments or kept it constant for more than four quarters. That's why we can't recommend the stock to conservative income investors even though it's a little bit undervalued. We like Kraft better because it didn't cut its dividends even though there were periods where it kept it constant for more than a year. Kraft also more than doubled its dividends over the past 10 years. Currently it yields only 3.1%, so we recommend the stock to younger dividend growth investors.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
428711,24610,2012-03-12T18:24:37-04:00,,"Aerospace and defense is a big business. The items governments want in this realm are short-run items. There are much fewer F-16s sold than blue jeans, so there are less economies of scale - and they require much more precise engineering - a fail on the battle field costs lives, whereas if your alarm clock fails it is only a minor inconvenience.Ensuring that type of precision is an expensive venture - it takes talented professionals, precise construction and extensive diagnostic testing. And governments are willing to pay dearly for that precision.One issue is cost. The price Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) charges for its wares are not set by the company itself in many cases. For instance, in its deal with Japan, the price per plane was set through discussions between the U.S. and Japan. Lockheed Martin has to find a way to make it work. In this case, if it goes over budget or can't deliver by the deadline, Japan could cancel the contract, but as it stands that is one pretty payday.The cost of materials is also an issue. Smaller orders make it more difficult for Lockheed Martin to buy its raw materials in bulk, so in the case of the Japan contract it costs Lockheed Martin more to make the initial batch of four planes than it would to make all 42 were it awarded the full contract. There are fixed costs related to the company's infrastructure as well, like rents and debt payments. When the contract is small, the company has to spread its costs over fewer items, increasing its practical cost per plane.Next, there is the fact that these aerospace defense contracts are so large that a government could put a deal on hold. For instance, Lockheed Martin has a $15.1 billion deal ($3 billion higher than the GDP of Iceland, if you were wondering) with the U.S. government to make 179 F-35s over five years, but that deal is on hold right now in a bid for the government to save money. If Lockheed Martin was depending on that income, the delay could put the company in a bit of a bind. In addition to the restriction it could place on its operations, especially if the raw materials were already ordered, the company risks losing investors.Lockheed Martin beat analyst estimates on its fourth quarter 2011 performance (reported January 26) by 20 cents ($2.14 versus $1.94), and it has beat EPS estimates for the last six quarters. The company recently traded at $88.68 a share. After Japan issued a warning that it may cancel its contract with Lockheed Martin, Forbes revised its price estimate for the company, bringing it down to $86 a share - meaning it is overvalued by roughly 3% by its calculations. But there are analysts that say Lockheed Martin could reach $102 a share in the next year. If they are right, that would be an increase of over 15%. In addition to the upside, Lockheed Martin also pays a $4 dividend (4.50% yield), so investors buying in now could get a return as high as 20% over the next year.Lockheed Martin is also priced low - it has a forward price to earnings ratio of just 10.48 - and has decent earnings expectations. According to Yahoo Finance, Lockheed Martin's earnings are expected to grow by 8.20% per annum on average over the next five years, versus expectations of 12.85% for its industry. Most of this growth is expected to come in 2014 and beyond. Lockheed Martin's earnings are expected to grow by just 0.40% this year and 7.40% next year.Even at these low rates, Lockheed Martin has an intrinsic value of $88.37 a share, which is only marginally less than its current trade price of $88.68. In comparison, competitor Boeing (NYSE:BA) is trading at $74.13, has an intrinsic value of $69.39 and pays a $1.76 dividend (2.30% yield). On one hand, if Lockheed Martin's deal with Japan fails, Boeing could pick up the pieces. Its F/A-18 was one of the fighter planes Japan considered before settling on Lockheed Martin's F-35. But, without that, Boeing's outlook is only so-so. The company has a mean one-year target estimate of $84.73. Its sales are expected to increase by 15% in 2012, but that growth will be driven almost entirely by its commercial airlines segment. Boeing's aerospace and defense business revenues are expected to fall by 4.5% this year according to Standard & Poor's.Rival Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) recently traded at $59.93 a share with a $2 dividend (3.30% yield) and an intrinsic value of $58.33. It has a one-year target estimate of just $60.27, suggesting that analysts are not generally hopeful. Standard & Poor's estimates its revenues will drop 5% in 2012, after falling 6% in 2011. The decline is in part owing to generally more pressure from governments and defense budgets that are already stretched far but the other part is all Northrop Grumman. The company has an established policy of foregoing lower-margin business. This may help preserve the integrity of its brands but if no one is able to pay those margins right now the company is going to have to take the loss. Right now, it seems to me that Northrop Grumman is in a holding pattern. It may be a good investment once the market starts to recover but I doubt it. Right now it is losing a lot of goodwill in an industry that requires it. Going long is the only way I see to play to this stock, and even then there are better companies.Raytheon (RTN) is trading at $51.62 a share, pays a $1.72 dividend (3.30% yield) and has an intrinsic value of $42.32 (suggesting it is overpriced). The outlook for this company isn't any better. It has a mean one-year target estimate of just $51.77. Raytheon is much smaller than these other companies and I doubt it will be able to weather the storm as easily. Its current debt to equity ratio is low at 0.56 but so is its quick ratio, at 0.87. If it can't spark things up and it faces a short-term hardship, as it very well may given the current climate, that money will have to come from somewhere and the company doesn't have it. I think Raytheon has good upside potential over the long term but this is definitely not a shorter term play. I would look elsewhere.Looking at these companies, Lockheed Martin's intrinsic value is on par, its dividend is higher and it is the only company of these four with earnings that are expected to grow this year. Given its intrinsic value and its high dividend, I think that Lockheed Martin is a great deal for investors with a timeline of three years or more.Lockheed Martin is also positioned well given the current political climate. There are the issues between Iran and Israel to consider, the latter of which is one of Lockheed Martin's primary export partners. Israel ordered 20 F-35s from Lockheed Martin in October 2010 in a $2.75 billion deal. They are expected to be delivered from 2015 to 2016. Domestic spending needs to be considered as well. Lockheed Martin has a variety of contracts in place with the U.S. government. There is the $15.1 billion deal mentioned earlier, but there are also several more.Lockheed Martin is partnered with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for the transformation of the National Airspace System. Lockheed Martin has several operations support projects as well, including: one for the Department of Defense's Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) worth up to $900 million; a $94 million contract for technical support of the Distributed Mission Operations Center (DMOC) located at Kirtland Air Force Base, NM, among others; and a $921 million contract from the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command for hardware and services associated with the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) Missile Segment program.In other words, Lockheed Martin is in a strong position to excel. It is priced well, has great prospects and pays high dividends - what's not to love?Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
351451,21835,2012-02-08T15:37:54-05:00,,"Linked here is a detailed quantitative analysis of Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE:LMT). Below are some highlights from the above linked analysis:Company Description:Lockheed Martin Corp. is the world's largest military weapons  manufacturer, and is also a significant supplier to NASA and other  non-defense government agencies. Lockheed Martin receives about 93% of its revenues  from global defense sales.Fair Value: In calculating fair value, I consider the NPV MMA Differential Fair  Value along with these four calculations of fair value, see page 2 of  the linked PDF for a detailed description:Lockheed Martin is trading at a discount to 1.) and 3.) above. Since Lockheed Martin's tangible  book value is not meaningful, a Graham number can not be calculated. The  stock is trading at a 22.9% discount to its calculated fair value of  $109.33. Lockheed Martin earned a Star in this section since it is trading at a fair  value.Dividend Analytical Data:  In this section there are three possible Stars and three key metrics, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:Lockheed Martin earned two Stars in this section for 1.) and 3.) above. A Star was  earned since the Free Cash Flow payout ratio was less than 60% and there  were no negative Free Cash Flows over the last 10 years. Lockheed Martin earned a  Star for having an acceptable score in at least two of the four Key  Metrics measured.Rolling 4-yr Div. > 15% means that dividends grew on average in excess of 15% for each consecutive 4 year period  over the last 10 years (2001-2004, 2002-2005, 2003-2006, etc.) I  consider this a key metric since dividends will double every 5 years if  they grow by 15%. The company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders  every year since 1995 and has increased its dividend payments for 9  consecutive years.Dividend Income vs. MMA: Why would you assume the equity risk and invest in a dividend stock if  you could earn a better return in a much less risky money market account (MMA) or Treasury bond? This section compares the earning ability of  this stock with a high yield MMA. Two items are considered in this section, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:Lockheed Martin earned a Star in this section for its NPV MMA Diff. of the $53,640.  This amount is in excess of the $2,600 target I look for in a stock that  has increased dividends as long as Lockheed Martin has. The stock's current yield  of 3.85% exceeds the 3.1% estimated 20-year average MMA rate.Memberships and Peers: Lockheed Martin is a member of the S&P 500. The company's peer group includes: Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA) with a 2.3% yield, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) with a 3.4% yield and United Technologies Corp. (NYSE:UTX) with a 2.4% yield.Conclusion: Lockheed Martin earned one Star in the Fair Value section, earned two Stars in the  Dividend Analytical Data section and earned one Star in the Dividend  Income vs. MMA section for a total of four Stars. This quantitatively  ranks Lockheed Martin as a 4-Star Strong stock.Using my D4L-PreScreen.xls model, I determined the share price would need to increase to $233.71  before LMT's NPV MMA Differential increased to the $2,600 minimum that I  look for in a stock with 9 years of consecutive dividend increases. At  that price the stock would yield 1.39%.Resetting the D4L-PreScreen.xls model and solving for the dividend growth rate needed to generate the  target $2,600 NPV MMA Differential, the calculated rate is 8.7%. This  dividend growth rate is well below the 17.9% used in this analysis, thus  providing a margin of safety. LMT has a risk rating of 2.25, which classifies it as a Medium risk stock.Lockheed Martin is the largest defense contractor in the world and dominates  next-generation defense platforms. It owns supply contracts for key  programs such as the F-35, which assure multiple years of revenue.  However, U.S. budgetary concerns and the requirement for the U.S.  Department of Defense to reduce spending by $350 billion over 10 years  (possibly expanded to $950 billion) could negatively affect Lockheed Martin's  ability to increase its dividend.I am also concerned with the company's recent increase in its debt to total capital. As a mitigating factor,  its net debt is only $2.5 billion when subtracting out the $4.5 billion  of cash. Given these concerns, I will not add to my position at this  time, even though Lockheed Martin trades below its calculated fair value of $109.33.Full Disclosure: At the time of this writing, I was long in LMT (0.6% of my Dividend  Growth Portfolio) and long in UTX. See a list of all my dividend growth  holdings my income holdings here.Disclaimer: Material presented here is for informational purposes  only. The above  quantitative stock analysis, including the Star  rating, is mechanically  calculated and is based on historical  information. The analysis assumes  the stock will perform in the future  as it has in the past. This is  generally never true. Before buying or  selling any stock you should do your own research and reach your own conclusion."
369061,22251,2012-02-15T15:00:39-05:00,,"OverviewLockheed Martin Corporation engages in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, operation, and sustainment of advanced technology systems and products in the areas of defence, space, intelligence, homeland security, and government information technology in the United States and internationally. It also provides management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistic, and information services. It is the largest defence contractor in the world and operates through 4 segments:Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, Information Systems & Global Services (IS&GS), and Space Systems.It has an impressive inventory turnover of 20 times TTM as of the third quarter of 2011; in comparison, the industry average is 3.5-4.00. It's fairly high ROIC of 17% should enable it to achieve a revenue growth rate of 5% or higher.It's already sitting on a backlog of over $73 billion, and this backlog could be further boosted through satellite contracts for its space system business.It has a relatively low long-term debt to capitalisation of 61% in comparison to many of its peers whose number's surge past the 90% mark.It generates a huge amount of cash flow; for the first 3 quarters of 2011 operating cash flow stands at $3.03 billion and could top the $3.6 billion mark. It also sports a very large levered free cash flow of $2.76 billion.A vast majority of the historical data (key ratios) was provided by Zacks.com. This article contains a lot of key ratios and would be best for investors to get a handle on some of these ratios as they could prove to be very useful in terms of spotting potential winners.Levered free cash flow is the amount of cash available to stock holders after interest payments on debt are made. A company with a small amount of debt will only have to spend a modest amount of money on interest payments, which in turn means that there is more money to send to shareholders in the form of dividends and vice versa.Operating cash flow is generally a better metric than earnings per share because a company can show positive net earnings and still not be able to properly service its debt; the cash flow is what pays the bills.The payout ratio tells us what portion of the profit is being returned to investors. A pay out ratio over 100% indicates that the company is paying out more money to shareholders, then they are making; this situation cannot last forever. In general if the company has a high operating cash flow and access to capital markets, they can keep this going on for a while. As companies usually only pay the portion of the debt that is coming due and not the whole debt, this technique/trick can technically be employed to maintain the dividend for sometime. If the payout ratio continues to increase, the situation warrants close monitoring as this cannot last forever; if your tolerance for risk is a low, look for similar companies with the same or higher yields, but with lower payout ratios.Debt to Equity Ratio is found by dividing the company's total amount of long-term debt (debts with interest rates that have a maturity longer than one year) by the total amount of equity. A debt to equity ratio of 0.5 tells us that the company is using 50 cents of liabilities in addition to each $1 dollar of shareholders equity in the business. There is no fixed ideal number as it depends on the industry the company is in. However, in general a ratio under 1 is acceptable and ideally it should be in the 0.5-0.6 ranges.Current Ratio is obtained by dividing the current assets by current liabilities. This ratio allows you to see if the company can pay its current debts without potentially jeopardising their future earnings. Ideally the company should have a ratio of 1 or higher.Price to free cash flow is obtained by dividing the share price by free cash flow per share. Higher ratios are associated with more expensive companies and vice versa; lower ratios are generally more attractive. If a company generated 400 million in cash flow and then spent 100 million on capital expenditure, then its free flow is $300 million. If the share price is 100 and the free cash flow per share are $5, then company trades at 20 times-free cash flow. This ratio is also useful because it can be used as a comparison to the average within the industry; this gives you an idea of how the company you are interested in holds up to the other companies within the industry.Interest coverage is usually calculated by dividing the earnings before interest and taxes for a period of 1 year by the interest expenses for the same time period. This ratio informs you of a company's ability to make its interest payments on its outstanding debt. Lower interest coverage ratios indicate that there is a larger debt burden on the company and vice versa.Price to tangible book is obtained by dividing share price by tangible book value per share. The ratio gives investors some idea of whether they are paying too much for what would be left over if the company were to declare bankruptcy immediately. In general stocks that trade at higher price to tangible book value could leave investors facing a great percentage per share loss than those that trade at lower ratios. The price to tangible book value is theoretically the lowest possible price the stock would trade toQuick ratio or acid -test is obtained by adding cash and cash equivalents plus marketable securities and accounts receivable dividing them by current liabilities. It is a measure of a company's ability to use its quick assets (assets that can be sold of immediately at close to book value) to pay off its current liabilities immediately. A company with a quick ratio of less than 1 cannot pay back its current liabilities.Company: Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT)Basic Key ratiosGrowthDividend historyDividend sustainabilityIt has a relatively low pay out ratio and generates huge amounts of cash so it should easily be able to maintain its dividend payments for years to come.PerformanceProjected EPS growthEPS Surprises ChartFinancial StrengthValuationRelated Companies (Peer Group)Company : Boeing Co (NYSE:BA)Basic Key ratiosGrowthDividend historyDividend sustainabilityPerformanceFinancial StrengthCompany : Genl Dynamics (NYSE:GD)Basic Key ratiosGrowthDividend historyDividend sustainabilityPerformanceFinancial StrengthCompany : Northrop Grummn (NYSE:NOC)Basic Key ratiosGrowthDividend historyDividend sustainabilityPerformanceFinancial StrengthCompany : Raytheon Co (RTN)Basic Key ratiosGrowthDividend historyDividend sustainabilityPerformanceFinancial StrengthConclusionWe like LMT for the following reasonsThe markets are rather overbought and we would wait for a strong pullback before committing money to this market.EPS surprise chart, EPS growth and a large portion of the historical data used here was obtained from zacks.com.

321996,21445,2012-01-25T11:51:29-05:00,,"Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE:LMT) is expected to report Q4 earnings on Thursday, January 26 before the market open with a conference call scheduled for 3:00 pm ET. Analysts are looking for EPS of $1.94 on revenue of $12.31B. The consensus range is $1.82-$2.03 for EPS, and $11.99B-$12.55B for revenue, according to First Call. Lockheed beat both Q3 EPS and revenue estimates. On its Q3 earnings report, the company raised its FY11 EPS view to $7.40-$7.60 from $7.35-$7.55 vs. consensus $7.52. It also forecast FY12 sales to be ""flattish"" compared to FY11, citing looming defense budget cuts. Since Q3 results were released, the shares have advanced to fresh 52-week highs of $83.71. Despite this, they currently sit at approximately the same level as they did in late July of last year. Potentially large defense cuts for FY12 and beyond will likely influence the near-term direction of the shares."
314389,24491,2011-12-16T13:32:26-05:00,,"As part of our process, we perform a rigorous discounted cash-flow methodology that dives into the true intrinsic worth of companies. In Lockheed's (NYSE:LMT) case, we think the firm is fairly valued at today's prices. We think its fair value is in the high $60s per share. (Our report on Lockheed and hundreds of other companies can be found here.)For some background, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index (click here for more info on our methodology), which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10 (best).If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Lockheed scores a 6 on our scale (reflecting our ""fairly valued"" assessment but bullish technical evaluation). We'd only consider adding Lockheed to the portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter on significant share price weakness followed by improving technicals.Our Report on Lockheed Martin  images):Investment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsLockheed Martin earns a ValueCreation™ rating of excellent, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 44.3% during the past three years.Lockheed Martin has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 5.8% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 1.1 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 57.5%.The firm's share price performance has trailed that of the market during the past quarter. However, it is trading within our fair value estimate range, so we don't view such activity as alarming. The firm sports a very nice dividend yield of 5.3%. We expect the firm to pay out about 52% of next year's earnings to shareholders as dividends.Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Lockheed Martin's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 44.3%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 9.9%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of excellent.In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Lockheed Martin's free cash flow margin has averaged about 6.2% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Lockheed Martin, cash flow from operations decreased about 26% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 11% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Lockheed Martin's shares are worthbetween $44.00 - $88.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's HIGH ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $66 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 9.2 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 7.9 times last year's EBITDA.Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 0.9% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 3%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 9.5%, which is below Lockheed Martin's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 1.9% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Lockheed Martin, our model uses a 9.9% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $66 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.Our ValueRisk rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Lockheed Martin. We think the firm is attractive below $44 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $88 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Lockheed Martin's fair value at this point in time to be about $66 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Lockheed Martin's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate.The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $78 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $66 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

313001,24604,2011-12-09T16:00:05-05:00,,"Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is one of the world's largest defense contractors and the #1 provider of Information Technology services, systems integration, and training to the U.S. Government. LMT provides a broad range of products and services to the world’s governments and commercial customers, focusing on space and missile systems, electronics, aeronautics and information systems. It manufactures military aircraft such as the F-16, F-22, C-130 and F-35 fighters. The Joint Strike Fighter aircraft (F-35) will be the primary driver of earnings and revenue for the next 10-20 years. Orders for more than 3,000 F-35s from the US and 9 foreign countries have already been booked. Factoring in replacements, parts, and service the entire contract should be worth more than half a trillion dollars. The Pentagon currently plans to buy more than 2,400 F-35 aircraft in 3 different configurations, at a projected cost of some $380 billion through 2035. The F-35 has been developed with 8 foreign partners and LMT currently has 11 different nations looking to purchase the F-35. This is to be the fighter jet of the future whose main advantage lies in its versatility. It can be configured in 3 different forms making it adaptable for use by the Navy, Air Force and Marines. The F-35 is a very versatile fighter aircraft capable of vertical take-off and landing. It is also a stealth aircraft, which makes it almost completely radar invisible. Right now it is considered to be the most advanced fighter jet in the world. It is for these reasons that despite impending defense budget cuts Lockheed Martin’s F-35 contract will remain a primary driver of LMT’s future earnings. It will be able to replace 10 separate, soon to become obsolete, aging military aircraft now in use. All of our existing military aircraft which includes the F-18, the F-16 and F-15 are all 4th-generation fighters. The F-35 is the 5th-generation. LMT, with a $73 billion backlog, is the Pentagon's #1 contractor by sales and has projected the radar-evading F-35 would account for just over 20% of its revenue when it hits full production in the near future. LMT said it expects to sell about 750 F-35 aircraft to non US nations.A further look at the numbers reveals that share count has been dropping consistently since 2002 when there were 455 million shares outstanding. As of September 2011 that number had dropped to 321 million. They retired more than 25 million shares since the beginning of 2011, and management is likely to continue repurchases. Cash assets started the year at $2.26 billion, as of September 30, 2011, and that has risen to $4.57 billion. However, over the same time span LMT did take on an additional $2 billion in debt, bringing the total to some $7 billion. I expect to see more dividend increases and share repurchases. LMT’s dividend was recently increased some 33% to $1/Q, up from 75¢/Q, and now yields just over 5%. Lockheed has raised its payout for 9 years running. LMT is likely to return to long-term shareholders in the form of dividends and/or share buybacks some 90% of its $3.2 billion in 2011 cash flow.As to 2011’s earnings, consensus estimates are expecting $7.80/share up from 2010’s $7.23, and for 2012 earnings could approach $8.60.  Applying a conservative PE of 12 to those earnings projections, share prices should exceed $100. A PE of 12 is not unreasonable especially since LMT has a 10-year average PE of 16 and is currently trading at a PE of under 10. Heavy cuts in military spending seem unlikely to me in an election year, and even if they do come about would probably only drop modestly. And yet if the PE does not expand to more normal levels, that 5% dividend coupled with increased earnings should reward investors with a handsome total return. Disclosure: I am long LMT."
297286,24866,2011-10-03T15:07:37-04:00,,"With mounting fear over budget cuts to the Department of Defense, it has become clear that Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) and other security providers are destined for higher volatility as the trigger date approaches. While this will make for an obvious case study in political arbitrage, value investing is also relevant given the company's attractive multiples and jaw dropping dividend. The stock is currently trading at 8.4x forward earnings, has an EV/EBITDA multiple of 5.5, and offers a dividend yield of 5.51%. Analysts currently rate the stock slightly higher than a ""hold,"" but I find that management's commitment to returning cash to shareholders coupled with greater risk-adjusted returns provide for a very favorable risk/reward.Among peers, Lockheed has the lowest net debt measured as a percent of market value at 6.2% versus 6.4% for Boeing (NYSE:BA) and 8.1% for Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC). At the same time, management has increased dividends since 2005 and has returned more than 75% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Moreover, the share repurchase program has recently accelerated to $1B. This is a company that generates strong cash flow and has been unduly discounted to fears over budget cuts.Although Lockheed has tried cost cutting measures, it faces tremendous risk in handling rising pension costs and margins are expected to hover around the current 8.9% for the next three years. On the other hand, I see the top line being enhanced through what could by the largest DoD project ever: the F-35 JSF program. Lockheed is currently the main contractor for these joint strike fighters and will likely be able to weather spending cuts largely through due to this, a possibility that the market has not fully appreciated.In regards to political arbitrage, in my view, the cuts to defense will not be nearly as high as the market has anticipated. Should politicians fail to agree on a budget, automatic cuts will trigger and the DoD budget will be reduced to around $472B in 2013 from $529B in 2011. I am of the opinion that this is very unlikely to take place, although I imagine some in the media are bent on propagating that brinkmanship will inevitably end up in ruin. Ultimately, I think that it will be entitlements that will mainly get cut, rather than defense, since compromising safety in the eleventh hour is questionable while reining in third rail topics becomes permissible and convenient. In any event, I do not see cutbacks sinking the stock tremendously given new project developments. Investors could profit off of the high-risk adjusted returns while remaining protected through high dividends.Lockheed also has a number of sustainable designs: naval missile defense, the F-35 and F-22, SBIRS satellite recognition technology, Trident II ICBM, among others. Taxes are expected to additionally fall over the next two years. Below is a diagram of Lockheed's diversified segments:In addition, I project revenue growing as follows:Aeronautics: 11.2% to $14.7B in 2011, then by 9% the following year.ES: Flat at $14.3B, then an increase of 3.7% the following year.IS&GS: -5.4% to $9.4B, then by 4.1% the following year.Space Systems: -1.3% to $8.1B, then an increase of 3.7% the following yearConsensus estimates for EPS are that it will grow by 3.4% to $7.51 and then by 15% and 9.5% in the next two years.

293470,24778,2011-09-13T21:01:16-04:00,,"Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is a global security company that employs about 126,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. LMT’s business units are spread across four key groups -- Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS), and Space Systems.Goldman Sachs upgraded Lockheed Martin from sell to neutral on Tuesday, September 13.. It made the upgrade on the basis that it believes LMT will seek to up dividend payments in preference to share buybacks. As I write this LMT is trading at $72.76 per share, holding the middle ground between its 52 week high of $81.48 per share, and its 52 week low of $64.71 per share. EPS ratio is 7.92, PE ratio is 9.10, and its current yield sits just above 4% at 4.1528. The Goldman Sachs’ analysts predict that an increased dividend payout would increase its yield to between 5 - 6 % and potentially attract dividend income stream investors. In terms of sustained trading performance, LMT has trading consistently within two key price bands, across each of its 90 day and 5 year trading periods. 90 Day Trading Price Range   Over the last 90 days LMT has traded between upper and lower resistance levels of $80 and $75 (June and July) and upper and lower resistance levels of $75 and $65 (August and September). In my opinion it is currently testing its 30 day moving average and if it breaks $75 per share and can sustain this then it may mark the start of another slow successive growth period. Over its five year trading period LMT has traded between upper and lower resistance levels of $100 and $80 (2007 to late 2009) and upper and lower resistance levels of $80 and $65 (late 2009 to present 2011). If it can break the $75 barrier and remain there then the next test will be to start building share value to $80 and beyond.5 Year Trading Price Range Since 1995 the company has been paying a steadily increasing dividend to investors, from $0.175 in 1995 to $0.750 in 2011. Of interest is that its dividend payments have maintained this upwards growth, even during the global financial crisis, much of which can be attributed to a steady stream of revenue generated from its defense business and US federal government agency programs. With increasing pressure from Government seeking strategic spending reform across defense and other government agencies, LMTs revenue stream will come under increasing pressure. It has already begun work to flatten its overheads and recently implemented staffing reductions within its Space Systems and Aeronautic business groups.Its current debt to equity ratio is 1.53, an increase from 1.35 in its 2010 Annual Report. The last three years has also seen a slight decrease on Return on Invested Capital, from 21.7% in 2008, 19.9% in 2009, to 17.9% in 2010. In its 2011 Q2 financial results LMT’s management indicated that sales had increased by 2% for the quarter, and earnings per share had increased by 11% for the same period. They also sought to clarify funding cost over-runs ($900M) predicted by government in its assessment of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program. Management’s explanation of the JSF funding issues can be viewed in the 2011 Q2 transcript.In terms of the pressure from government to reduce overall defense and government agency costs, this needs to happen given the government's current financial balance sheet, but it will not happen where soldiers and security specialist lives are placed at risk (War on Terror), and it certainly won’t be at the expense of the USA surrendering its security technological edge over other key foreign agencies and military powers. In addition to this, the types of complex security programs that LMT undertakes are generational projects, in terms of design and development, manufacturing and delivery, maintenance and through life support. So while it will experience funding pressures in the short to medium term; its revenue cash flow is not going to dry up overnight. It needs to manage these pressures by controlling program and labor costs more tightly, reducing overheads, and making itself for attractive to longer term investors (particularly those seeking dividend growth and income streams as part of a conservative blue chip investment portfolio), which is exactly the reasoning behind Goldman Sachs upgrade for LMT stock. While the company has large throughput from defense and government agencies, its customer base is global, and spread wider than the immediate dependency of the United States government, which should assist it mitigating its revenue risk in the short to medium term. While it maintains its dividend growth and manages to balance debt against sales and revenue, then I believe it is a suitable stock for those investing with a long term (2-3 year) timeframe.

462801,25953,2012-03-28T09:11:59-04:00,,"Some years ago, when a foreign flying object ventured illegally into Canadian airspace, I read in an article how the Royal Canadian Air Force scrambled two jets to ""talk the intruder down"". I joked to my Canadian colleague that the pilots probably had to say ""please."" The Americans would have just blasted him out of the sky, I suggested, before saving myself from all six-foot-four of him by saying that Mounties are hard nuts and hockey rules.Maybe Canada's Department of National Defense [DND] will be less diplomatic next time such an incursion occurs, especially if it goes ahead with controversial plans to buy F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). Lockheed is probably the United States' most famous iron monger for flying weapons. Yes, the company has some issues to grapple with and, yes, the Canada deal has rattled Ottawa, with accusations that the DND commandeered negotiations and never gave Lockheed's competitors a chance.But it is my opinion that these events will only strengthen Lockheed's resolve, simply because the F-35 program is unmatched anywhere in the world. What even the most skeptical dove cannot deny is that the F-35 could be at the forefront of the aerial weapons race once all its shortcomings are solved. Lockheed has invested too much to see it fail. It is, after all, the only fifth-generation fighter jet that patrols the global skies. It is the iPod among the DVD players. It is Windows to all other operating systems, though, at the moment, the plane is more Vista than W7.In a world where modern warfare is won in the sky, the DND knew there was only one bidder worth talking to. According to media reports, DND officials met 21 times with Lockheed over six years compared to seven meetings with Boeing (NYSE:BA), which sells the F-18 Super Hornet, and eight sessions with Eurofighter Typhoon maker BAE Systems (OTCPK:BAESY).Reports have emerged that Nato, the US government, Japan and other foreign markets are thinking of watering down contracts to be part of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Lightning II program. Despite this, the company expects to sell at least 700 planes over the next decade. That's not bad for a supposedly iffy product.In addition, the program received a major boost last week when the company announced that it had successfully conducted the first ever F-35 night refueling exercise in its history at Edwards Air Force Base, California. On March 22, U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Peter Vitt rendezvoused with an Air Force KC-135 tanker in the night sky and gratefully accepted fuel through the F-35's boom receptacle. I believe this is a significant stepping stone.Also, it is not like Lockheed's main competitors are making the most of its problems. Boeing, for example, is struggling to fulfill its obligations on its contract with the Air Force to develop a new KC-46 refueling tanker. The program is already $900 million over the target price of $4.4 billion for the initial development contract and $400 million above the overall price of $4.9 billion, according to Reuters.Stepping away from the defense sector for a while, Boeing is facing stiff competition from the European Aeronautic Defense And Space Company (OTCPK:EADSY) and its double-decker commercial long-haul airplane, the Airbus 380.It is not only vibes about the F-35 that gives Lockheed a positive outlook. On Tuesday, Lockheed announced that it had received a $66 million follow-on contract from the Missile Defense Agency to press ahead with developing the successful Terminal High Altitude Area Defense Weapon [THAAD], the world's only technology that enables a country to intercept missiles from inside and outside the Earth's atmosphere. This is the revitalization of the Star Wars defense system from the Reagan era, except now there are no Soviets to complain about it.Apart from Boeing, Lockheed's other rivals are active but yet to reach F-35 stratosphere. Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) is emerging as an important player, though it has yet to truly break out and land a multi-million dollar deal. Northrop, along with BAE Systems, another Lockheed competitor, is this week plugging their Joint Light Tactical Vehicle program. Not to be outdone, Lockheed has announced its own optimized JLTV offering at lower costs.Raytheon (RTN) is one of the world's leading defense companies and is not burdened with the task of selling planes to countries wary of new aerial technology. It is famous for its family of Patriot missiles. The name alone makes it untouchable but, as already mentioned, Lockheed is into missile defense, an industry that is likely to win more customers who are looking at ways of cutting costs.Lockheed shares traded at about $91 on Tuesday and the company enjoys a decent EPS average of $7.83. Revenue has increased steadily, if not dramatically, over the past four years, while net income has decreased slightly with the company earning $2.66 million at the end of 2011.Only Boeing beats Lockheed in terms of profits, with $4 million, but the Seattle giant has a tradition of being stingy with its dividend payouts. Lockheed has paid $1 per share for March 2012, the second straight quarter it has done that, more than double that of Boeing, despite having only a quarter of Boeing's $4 million worth of net cash flow.Lockheed is committed to a program of 50 per cent of available cash going to its shareholders. Certainly, the company is going through some testing times, as are all in the defense industry. However, I believe Lockheed rises above them all in terms of products that are alluring and necessary going forward.One thing it has that the others don't is the F-35. As Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) customers endured Vista until something better came along, the F-35 program, I am confident, will survive, especially with practically zero competition for fifth-generation jets.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
296270,23757,2011-09-27T15:48:23-04:00,,"The federal government is broke. They depend on borrowing from China and other investors to pay the bills. At least that is what we are constantly told. Both parties are proposing massive federal budget cuts. So why would we be dumb enough to buy a defense contractor such as Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), let alone the defense contractor responsible for biggest contract the DoD has undertaken, the JSF program, that has been plagued by cost overruns?Looking beneath the headlines, many of these risks aren’t what they first appear to be. Let’s take a look at each issue individually.Federal Government Spending Despite what the media and Congress might have you believe the federal government is not broke and it most certainly does not borrow money from anyone, let alone China. The U.S. federal government (I’m combining the federal government, Federal Reserve and Treasury Department for ease of explanation purposes) is monetarily sovereign ... that is it operates a non convertible, floating exchange rate, sole issuer currency system. The one and only entity that can issue dollars is the U.S. federal government. Comparisons of the federal government to states, businesses or households or non-monetarily sovereign currency using nations such as Greece or Italy are flawed.The federal government spends money by simply marking accounts in computers up or down. It then issues T-securities to “mop up” the excess reserves in the banking system that any spending in excess of tax receipts created. Taxes do not fund the federal government’s spending. The budget deficit is simply the amount by which the government has provided net assets to the private sector in excess of tax receipts. The national debt is therefore nothing more than an accounting identity equal to the net private sector savings. It is not some mythical burden our children need to pay off.Federal government spending is then only constrained by two things. The first is inflation, which with unemployment over 9% is not a threat. The second is the political will to spend, which right now is the biggest sticking point. The DoD has already published its plans for reducing expenditures which, to the extent they impact defense contractors, have already been priced in to the stock. Additionally, Washington seems to have no appetite for further DoD budget reductions. Both the president and Congress have been zeroing in on Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security for cost savings.I realize the information about how the monetary system works is new to most people. For more information on how the federal government spends and how the monetary system works I recommend the following links:Articles by Warren Mosler (more in depth)Soft Currency EconomicsThe Trade DeficitFed/Teasury OperationsAlso, check out this article by John T. Harvey on Forbes (generally shorter and easier to read).We Spend As Much On Defense As The Next X Number Of Countries Combined In 2010 U.S. military expenditures (including the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan) were approximately $687B. Critics frequently then show how this figure is larger than the next X number of countries combined. Well, of course it is. The U.S. military essentially subsidizes security for the Western world.From the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review:In plain English, “basically everyone we work with is incompetent but us.”Additionally, NATO action in Libya shows just how dependent NATO nations are on U.S. support. It was only the U.S. that had the capability to neutralize Libya’s integrated air defense network (assuming it was functional). The NATO coalition was also dependent on U.S. intelligence gathering and targeting specialists, and as the war dragged on eventually dependent on U.S. munitions stocks. (Source here).Finally while U.S. military expenditures are high in absolute dollars they are at low levels when put in a proper context at only 4.7% of GDP. At the height of the Vietnam War military spending reached 8% of GDP. Backing out the wars and other overseas operations the base DoD Budget was $527.9B or 3.6% of GDP.Military Budget Overview It is well known that the DoD is reducing its budget. What isn’t as well known is what portions of the budget are being reduced and how the cost savings are being deployed. In short the DoD is reducing manpower and restructuring to save money to invest in new weapons systems and capabilities.The DoD base budget is broken down in to multiple categories. The categories most important to defense contractors make up what is called the Investment Account which includes Procurement and Research, Design, Testing, and Evaluation (RDT&E).The DoD budget request for fiscal 2012 is $553B.Click to enlarge charts The proposed budget for FY2013 through FY2016 shows slowing top line growth. (Source: DoD FY2012 Budget Request Overview here)In order to meet these proposed budgets the DoD has undertaken a $178B cost savings program composed of $78B in reductions from the DoD and $100B of reduction from the services (Army, Navy and Air force). The $100B the services save will be reinvested.The DoD’s $78B in savings comes primarily from:The $100B reduction for the services is shown on the following table. As we can see the items receiving the smallest budget cuts are weapons system programs. So what is the DoD going to do with the $100B in projected savings?To start, $28B will be spent on “must pay” bills such as staff expenses, training and maintenance. Also, $70B will be invested across the three major services mainly in acquiring new weapons systems or modernizing existing weapons systems.Highlights include:Additionally, defense contractors haven taken to using the tactic of scattering the work of large profitable contracts over politically important Congressional districts. No senator or representative wants to be the man or woman who cast a vote that cost people in their district jobs. Once programs are deeply ensconced it is very tough to kill them. Exhibit A for this would be the multi-year squabble over when to shutdown the F-22A production line that only ended with the threat of a presidential veto.In the end, despite what the headlines say, the defense budget is projected to grow by low single digits with an emphasis on modernizing the armed forces by continuing to purchase new systems or upgrade or refurbish existing platforms. A majority of the areas that most big name defense contractors serve will still be a (slowly) growing sector.Military Procurement ProcessOne of the most frequent criticisms leveled at defense contractors and weapons system procurement is that projects almost always end up delayed and over budget. Frequently it is the defense contractors that are cast as the screw-ups costing average Joe taxpayer more money. In many cases the blame lies with the military’s policies and not the defense contractor.First, the initial cost estimates are almost always fantasy land numbers, and it is widely known there is no hope of those numbers being met. Also, the military has a bad habit of changing the parameters of a project multiple times throughout its life cycle. Add to that the fact that many projects entail the development of new or cutting edge technology and the delays and cost overruns are no surprise. In fact in the latest budget request the DoD says just that:The main thrust of the DoD to rectify the problems will be changes within the DoD itself. The DoD is not hanging defense contractors out to dry and simply shifting the blame on them. While there will be some changes to how contracts are written in the future a majority of the changes are within the DoD and apply to how they will conduct business.Given the nature of the procurement process and the fact that the JSF is one of the most technologically challenging programs currently in development it should be no surprise that the System Development & Demonstration (SDD) phase of the program is over budget. Additional details regarding the JSF program are discussed in the “Lockheed Martin Overview: Aeronautics” section.Lockheed Martin Overview Lockheed Martin is the world’s largest pure play defense contractor. In 2010 Lockheed derived 60% of its revenue from the DoD, 24% from other domestic governmental agencies, 15% from international customers, and 1% from commercial clients.The company is organized in to four divisions: Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, Information Systems and Global Solutions (IS&GS), and Space Systems.Aeronautics DivisionLockheed’s Aeronautics division is its largest and accounted for $13.2B (or 29%) of revenue in 2010. Aeronautics derives 81% of its revenue from domestic customers and 19% from international customers.Aeronautics business linesThe U.S. Air Force has a big problem. Its main frontline combat fighter aircraft are old (with the notable exception of the F-22A). Not just a little old, but very old. According the Air Force in 2008 the average age of its aircraft was 24 years, the oldest in its 61 year history.The current Air Force inventory of frontline fighter aircraft consists of 267 F-15C/D models, 223 F-15E models, 1,262 F-16C/D models, and 187 F-22A models. The F-15C/D air superiority models are a circa 1972 design built between 1979 and 1985 with various upgrades along the way. The F-15E long range interdiction model is a circa 1979 design that was built between 1985 and 2001 with various upgrades along the way. The Air Force’s most numerous frontline fighter is the F-16C/D models that are a circa 1974 design built starting in 1984 with various upgrades along the way. The F-15 and F-16 models are considered fourth generation fighters. The only modern fifth generation fighter in service is the F-22A Raptor, a 1997 design whose production line is set to close in 2012 after producing 187 aircraft. Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor for the F-16 and F-22 while Boeing (NYSE:BA) is the prime contractor for the F-15.The Air Force is essentially left with two options: Either procure more newer aircraft per year or refurbish existing inventory to extend their life and upgrade their capabilities. Currently the plan for frontline fighter aircraft is to replace aging aircraft with the new Lockheed Martin product the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter (JSF).From the JSF Program website:We believe that the JSF program is the most attractive asset in LMT’s portfolio. With the scheduled closure of the F-22A production line the JSF is the Air Force’s only option for procuring a frontline fifth generation stealth fighter. With the emerging threat of the new Chinese J-20 stealth fighter we believe it is highly unlikely significant cuts will be made to the JSF program. The Air Force essentially has no choice but to go forward. It would take decades and untold billions to start a new frontline fighter development program and bring production up to a reasonable level. It also can’t just “make do” with older inventory as those will need extensive rebuilding and modernization to extend their service lives and make them capable on the next generation battlefield. In short the Air Force is stuck with the JSF.Finally most of the JSF delays and cost overruns have been due to the short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) variant. The conventional take off and landing and the carrier version which make up 85% of the planned production run have been certified by the DoD in 2010 as proceeding satisfactorily. While Lockheed’s margin on the SDD phase of the program may come under pressure due to cost overruns once production begins to ramp up margins will increase. Indeed, the same thing happened with the F-16 program where each successive production lot saw Lockheed increase margins. Also, despite the problems with the STOVL variant the Marine Corp has called that version essential and that they have no plan B.Additionally with the F-22A banned from export and the production line shutting down the JSF program will be the only fifth generation fighter being offered to international customers. Israel is expected to be the first international customer to receive deliveries. Other international customers will be the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, Canada, Turkey, Australia, Norway and Denmark. Altogether 3,100 F-35s are expected to be procured by 2035.The F-35 Lighting II JSF made up 12% of Lockheed’s sales in 2010.Other major Aeronautics products and programs include the C-130J and legacy C-130 support, C-5A/B/C support, C-5M modernization, and Advanced Development Programs (ADP) which includes the infamous Lockheed Martin Skunk Works.Backlog at Aeronautics is expected to be stable to up.Electronic Systems Electronic Systems is Lockheed’s largest division and accounted for $14.4B (31%) of net sales in 2010.Major programs include sea-based elements o the U.S. missile defense system, the Aegis Weapons System (found on every DDG-51 destroyer), the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile system and PAC-3 missile, and the Freedom Class (aka the normal looking monohull one) Littoral Combat Ship (LCS).All major programs are important parts of the DoD’s budget going forward. The Aegis Weapons System is an absolutely critical component of every navy destroyer being built and currently in service. More information on Aegis can be found here. The THAAD missile system is the only missile defense system that can protect against atmospheric and exo-atmospheric threats. The program has also garnered a high level of international interest. The LCS is the Navy’s new smaller warship designed to deal with coastal threats. The ship may generate international interest but it would be up against stiff competition.Backlog at Electronic Systems is expected to be stable to up.Information Systems and Global SolutionsIS&GS accounted for $9.9B (22%) of net sales in 2010.IS&GS primarily provides communication, automation and data integration services. Major civil programs include the En Route Automization Modernization contract with the FAA and the Hanford Mission Support contract for the DEA. The core programs for the intelligence business line are, as one might guess, classified.Backlog at IS&GS is down and falling.Space Systems Accounting for only $8.2B (18%) in revenue for 2010, Space Systems is Lockheed’s smallest division.Major programs include the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS), Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), Advanced Extremely High Frequency System (AEHF), GPS III system, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R-Series (GOES-R), the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile, Orion CEV and Space Shuttle processing, and several classified systems.Backlog at Space Systems is expected to be stable.Major Programs Overview  (Source: Lockheed Martin 2011Q1 Earnings Presentation)Competition The defense industry is characterized by wide economic moats for those contractors working on major programs. The DoD has also employed a policy of making sure all the major players stay in business by spreading contracts around. For example although Lockheed is the lead contractor on the JSF many other contractors play a role. Also the Navy decided to build both classes of the new LCS ship, one a Lockheed design and another a design lead by General Dynamics (NYSE:GD).Major domestic competitors include Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) and Boeing in Aeronautics and Raytheon (RTN) in Electronic Systems. IS&GS is the most competitive field with just about every major contractor having a similar division and plenty of smaller niche contractors compete in this area as well. Boeing is the main competitor for Space Systems.Valuation Lockheed Martin is currently trading at historically low valuations. Lockheed currently trades at a P/E of 9, a Price/Sales ratio of X and a Price/Cash flow ratio of .5. Over the past 15 years Lockheed has traded at an average P/E of 17 and median P/E of 16. Over the last 10 years the average P/S and average P/CF have been .8 and 10, respectively.Based on analyst estimates and our own estimates we put together the following table that shows the value of Lockheed’s equity under several different scenarios. The notes following the table detail the reasoning for our assumptions.Click to enlarge Notes on the Valuation:1) FY2012 revenue for the base case is slightly below analyst estimates of $47.62 to reflect a more sluggish state and local government spending environment than expected (affects IS&GS).2) Aeronautics EBIT margins median 11.7% over the past six years. We slightly lowered margin to account for near term cost pressures with JSF.3) Electronic Systems EBIT margins median 12.1% over past six years.4) IS&GS EBIT margins median 9.1% over past six years.5) Space Systems EBIT margins median 10.8% over past six years.6) LMT records pension liabilities using FAS but is reimbursed for pension costs under CAS. Ultimately all pension costs related to domestic government work are fully reimbursable.ConclusionLockheed Martin has perhaps the best portfolio of core programs including the JSF crown jewel. Despite the headlines the defense spending environment is still attractive as the DoD is intent on modernizing its forces.Defense contractors and Lockheed in particular offer a hedge against continued consumer weakness. If Washington goes through with cutting spending on social programs and raising taxes it will further slow already anemic economic growth. Because Lockheed is largely uncoupled from the consumer environment we believe it offers a good hedge against this outcome.Finally, should we be wrong and the economy strengthens (and thus tax receipts rise) Lockheed should benefit in a DoD environment with less budget pressure.Either way, the country’s military needs new weapons systems and Lockheed is one of the companies leading the way to build them.Disclosure: I am long LMT."
301903,21445,2011-10-25T11:52:51-04:00,,"Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE:LMT) is expected to report Q3 earnings on Wednesday, October 26 before the market open with a conference call scheduled for 11:00 am ET.Analysts are looking for EPS of $1.81 on revenue of $11.74B. The consensus range is $1.72-$1.91 for EPS, and $11.51B-$12.20B for revenue, according to First Call. Lockheed beat both Q2 EPS and revenue estimates. On its Q2 earnings report, the company guided its FY11 EPS view to $7.35-$7.55 vs. consensus $7.27. It also reaffirmed FY11 revenue estimates of $46.0B-$47.0B vs. consensus $46.64B. Since Q2 results were released, the shares have traded in a V-shaped pattern, falling sharply and making a 52-week low in August, then rallying nearly 20%. They currently sit at approximately the same level as they did in late July. A $2.5B share buyback program and a 33% increase in the dividend announced in September weren’t enough to propel the shares out of their recent trading range. Potentially large defense cuts for FY12 and beyond have likely weighed on the shares."
283111,24670,2011-07-29T12:25:49-04:00,,"Defense firms have underperformed during the last six months, mainly due to concerns over budget cuts. President Obama has called for $400B in defense spending reductions over the next decade, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have started to wind down. With the need to reduce our national debt, it is highly probable that future defense spending will be significantly lower than in the last decade. This will impact the six major defense contractors, but how much and how will this impact their valuation? I examined Lockheed Martin and found that even with low growth assumptions, the downside risk appears limited based on an intrinsic DCF valuation. Obviously the market is subject to swings due to macro and emotional factors. In Lockheed Martin’s case, this could create a buying opportunity, provided that defense cuts don’t go too much beyond what has been requested. Lockheed’s (NYSE:LMT) HeadwindsWhile Lockheed Martin is the largest defense contractor in the world, internal and external forces will pressure its growth and margins over the next decade. Lockheed Martin relies on the U.S. government for 84% of its sales (64% from Department of Defense, 20% from non-defense agencies), but this source of funds will decline as supplemental funding for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars winds down and deficit concerns lead to budget cuts. With major defense firms strongly competing for fewer dollars, and the U.S. government in control of pricing and contract terms, Lockheed Martin’s top-line growth will not match that of the last decade. Furthermore, Lockheed Martin has experienced cost overruns with its F-35 fighters due to production issues and higher input costs. With fixed-cost contracts making the manufacturer more accountable for going over budget, Lockheed Martin’s operating margins will be strained until it can consistently and efficiently meet its production and cost targets. In addition, Lockheed Martin’s growing pension liability and high debt-to-equity ratio will also impact its margins more in the expected low to declining-growth environment. Combined, these factors have limited the recent performance of Lockheed Martin and other defense firms, but the downside risk may not be as bad as the news suggests and the 3.7% dividend appears to be safe. Corporate Strategy Lockheed Martin focuses on being a platform provider specializing in aerospace and electronic technology systems. It has core competencies in aircraft design (Aeronautics), enabling persistent global surveillance (IS&GS), missile systems (Space Systems), and systems integration (Electronic Systems). Over the last decade, Lockheed Martin has sold off divisions that did not fit with these competencies to focus corporate efforts [1] and maximize synergies.[2] It also partners with other defense contractors to provide complete solutions to its customers. More recently, in an effort to cut costs and streamline operations, Lockheed Martin reduced its top-level management by 600 employees through a voluntary separation program and realigned its businesses to match its strengths with customer needs. The firm also plans to cut more jobs depending on the scale of the government budget cuts.Competitive AnalysisLockheed Martin competes with many companies to receive contracts from the U.S. government, but the majority go to six major firms: Lockheed Martin, BAE Systems (OTCPK:BAESF), Boeing (NYSE:BA), Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and Raytheon (RTN). Of these firms, Lockheed Martin maintains the leadership position as the largest defense contractor. The U.S. government is careful to distribute contracts among these firms to ensure competition and multiple suppliers; there is incentive to avoid additional consolidation among the larger firms. As long as Lockheed Martin continues to innovate and to avoid legal and quality issues, it should continue to receive a significant portion of the government contracts. However, while the U.S. government provides a fairly stable revenue stream that reduces some risks to the firm, government work is also highly regulated and offers limited margins, especially given the current political concerns over the budget deficit. In general, commercial aerospace firms have higher ROIC than defense firms and offer greater growth opportunities, though with higher risks. The SWOT analysis discusses specific issues and characteristics in more detail. The Valuation section will incorporate this information into a DCF valuation.SWOT AnalysisAs the largest weapons manufacturer in the world, Lockheed Martin has brand recognition and size in its favor. While heavily dependent on U.S. government funding (84%) and possessing little pricing power, Lockheed Martin has diverse capabilities and products, allowing it to pursue both defense and non-defense contracts within the aerospace and defense industry. Currently, Lockheed Martin’s product revenues come mainly from military aerospace applications, whereas half of Boeing’s revenue comes from commercial aircraft[3] and 28% of General Dynamics’ revenues are from non-U.S. military sources.[4] Any application of technologies to commercial applications would help to grow and balance Lockheed Martin’s sources of revenue. For example, there is increasing demand for security systems including: satellite tracking systems, complex data security, and fingerprint ID technology. In addition, Lockheed Martin is pursuing more foreign contracts to expand international sales. The firm also continues to make strategic acquisitions to add new capabilities to core product divisions and to extend relationships with key customers.U.S. military spending is projected to slow or decline, but the F-35 Joint Strike fighter, unmanned aircraft and missiles, and information technologies remain priority areas, and Lockheed Martin has expertise in all of them. Lockheed Martin’s technological expertise and strong R&D give it the advantage with respect to new aircraft, missile, and satellite technologies. These capabilities should allow it to keep pace with technological changes. While Lockheed Martin’s product lines address several of the military’s on-going priorities, the government controls the terms of the contracts and the amount of funding, which is on the decline due to deficit and cost concerns. Last year, only 30 of 43 planned F-35 fighter purchases were approved by the House Armed Services Committee, a reduction of 25%.[5] The government is also shifting toward more fixed-cost contracts, which places the burden of any cost overruns on the producer. 35% of Lockheed Martin’s contracts are fixed cost, and it has experienced delays and cost overruns with the F-35 program. The U.S. government is currently reviewing the long-term operating costs of the fighter, which are projected at $1T.[6] Lockheed Martin is working with the U.S. government to reduce these figures. The firm is also struggling with containing production costs. It received just one of five bonuses in 2010 due to missed production targets, and paid 30% of cost overruns on a recent order of F-35s. Until Lockheed Martin improves its production operations, margins will be reduced due to these issues.Lockheed Martin will need to be mindful of its operating costs; EBIT has declined to its lowest level since 2006, falling from a pre-recession high of 11.6% to 8.7% in 2010.[7] With little pricing power and an increase in fixed-cost contracts, managing costs effectively will be critical to improve operating margins. Margins may also be impacted by legal and cleanup costs related to pending environmental actions. Lockheed Martin has been designated a potentially responsible party by the EPA at some of its facilities and former facilities. These issues place significant pressure on Lockheed Martin’s operating margins, and thus far, the firm has not demonstrated the ability to slow the decline. Estimated Impact of Defense CutsGrowth in total defense spending is projected to slow or decline in the coming years. For fiscal 2012, the U.S. government requested $553B for the base Defense budget. This represents a $27B increase over the prior fiscal year. However, supplemental funding requests for the global war on terror decreased by $41B.[8] In addition to the winding down of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, political concerns over the deficit may limit defense appropriation growth going forward. With the U.S. federal deficit reaching new heights, the government will be pressed to cut defense spending, as it makes up 20% of the overall budget based on Congressional Budget Office data. President Obama’s deficit reduction panel recommended $100B in defense cuts by 2015 to reduce the deficit. President Obama recently went further by calling for $400B in defense cuts over the next 10 years.[9] A quick estimate suggests that this could impact Lockheed Martin’s annual revenue by approximately $2B (4.3% of Lockheed’s 2010 Annual Revenue), assuming even distribution of the cuts.(Click to enlarge) Valuation and Cash Flows A DCF valuation was created using the previous five years of annual financials as a baseline, and then adjusting some levers to account for changes based on my analysis of Lockheed Martin’s future business environment and challenges. These adjustments included:The model yielded an estimated value of around $91 per share, which is close to the analysts’ mean estimate of $87 (Yahoo Finance). This intrinsic value is contingent on the accuracy of the lever values, with the discount rate and EBITDA as a percent of revenue levers having the greatest sensitivity. For comparison, with a 10% discount rate, the value is $77, slightly above the current price of $75. With the trend toward fixed-price contracts, increasing input costs, and more complex advanced technology, there is a greater chance of Lockheed Martin experiencing delays and cost overruns, which it will now be more responsible for, so the lower EBITDA margin seemed to be a reasonable assumption. Obviously if Lockheed Martin can improve on this, its valuation will be higher.Since the $400B in cuts probably excludes supplemental war funding, I reduced the growth rate even further to test a lower-growth scenario. I admit that it is unclear to me how much of the supplemental funding actually flows to Lockheed Martin or other firms, but regardless, I would expect overall revenues to increase at least a little each year due to inflation once the initial cuts have occurred. After giving Lockheed Martin three years of negative growth (-4%,-2%,-1%), and changing the long-term revenue growth to 2%, the model yielded a valuation of around $64. So even with larger initial cuts and then lower growth, the downside risk appears limited based on the recent price of $75. Again, this is all dependent on what the government actually does and on other model assumptions.In terms of the dividend, Lockheed Martin pays out a little over $1B in dividends annually. This is readily covered by its $2B+ in annual free cash flow and its cash balance. In the models, including the low-growth scenario, free cash flow to equity (excluding the new debt for the pension liability) easily covered the dividend in each year. Therefore, the dividend appears safe and could increase, though the company has also been repurchasing shares at a steady clip (~$2B each year, 2006-2010). RecommendationDespite the concerns over U.S. defense budget cuts, the deficit, the end of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and production cost issues, Lockheed Martin continues to be a profitable company. While the firm may see slower or even negative growth in the near-term, the U.S. government is sure to continue spending on defense, and there will be international opportunities for older technologies. As one of just six major defense contractors, Lockheed Martin will receive its share of these contracts. If it can improve its operational efficiencies, the firm can maintain or even grow its margins, despite increased use of fixed-cost contracts.Based on the presented DCF models, even with low-growth revenue forecasts and reduced EBITDA margins, Lockheed Martin appears to be slightly undervalued at current levels ($75). If more significant defense cuts come to pass, the stock could fall 15%, but the dividend appears well covered by the cash flows and balance sheet cash. The firm has also been consistently buying back shares, which will support EPS and the stock price. I don’t expect this stock to increase as rapidly as industrials less dependent on defense sales, such as Gardner Denver (NYSE:GDI) or perhaps Boeing. However, if you are looking for an industry-leading, stable firm with a solid dividend and slow growth, Lockheed Martin is a candidate for your portfolio.Endnotes[1]McHale, J.

281406,21835,2011-07-25T05:14:29-04:00,,"Linked here is a detailed quantitative analysis of Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE:LMT). Below are some highlights from the above linked analysis:  Company Description:  Lockheed Martin Corp. is the world's largest military weapons  manufacturer and is also a significant supplier to NASA and other  non-defense government agencies. LMT receives about 93% of its revenues  from global defense sales.  Fair Value:  In calculating fair value, I consider the NPV MMA Differential Fair  Value along with these four calculations of fair value, see page 2 of  the linked PDF for a detailed description:  1. Avg. High Yield Price 2. 20-Year DCF Price 3. Avg. P/E Price 4. Graham Number  LMT is trading at a discount to 1.) and 3.) above. Since LMT's tangible  book value is not meaningful, a Graham number can not be calculated. The  stock is trading at a 15.5% discount to its calculated fair value of  $93.5. LMT earned a Star in this section, since it is trading at a fair  value.  Dividend Analytical Data: In this section there are three possible Stars and three key metrics, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:  1. Free Cash Flow Payout 2. Debt To Total Capital 3. Key Metrics 4. Dividend Growth Rate 5. Years of Div. Growth 6. Rolling 4-yr Div. > 15%  LMT earned two Stars in this section for 1.) and 3.) above. A Star was  earned since the Free Cash Flow payout ratio was less than 60% and there  were no negative Free Cash Flows over the last 10 years. LMT earned a  Star for having an acceptable score in at least two of the four Key  Metrics measured.   Rolling 4-yr Div. > 15% means that dividends grew on average in  excess of 15% for each consecutive 4 year period over the last 10 years  (2001-2004, 2002-2005, 2003-2006, etc.). I consider this a key metric  since dividends will double every 5 years if they grow by 15%. The  company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since 1995  and has increased its dividend payments for 9 consecutive years.     Dividend Income vs. MMA:  Why would you assume the equity risk and invest in a dividend stock if  you could earn a better return in a much less risky money market account  (MMA) or Treasury bond? This section compares the earning ability of  this stock with a high yield MMA. Two items are considered in this section, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:  1. NPV MMA Diff. 2. Years to > MMA  LMT earned a Star in this section for its NPV MMA Diff. of the $13,637.  This amount is in excess of the $2,600 target I look for in a stock that  has increased dividends as long as LMT has. If LMT grows its dividend  at 15.0% per year, it will take 1 year to equal a MMA yielding an  estimated 20-year average rate of 4.1%. LMT earned a check for the Key  Metric 'Years to >MMA' since its 1 year is less than the 5 year  target.   Memberships and Peers: LMT is a member of the S&P 500. The company's peer group includes: Boeing Co.  (NYSE:BA) with a 2.3% yield, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) with a 3.0% yield and United Technologies Corp. (NYSE:UTX) with a 2.2% yield.  Conclusion: LMT  earned one Star in the Fair Value section, earned two Stars in the  Dividend Analytical Data section and earned one Star in the Dividend  Income vs. MMA section for a total of four Stars. This quantitatively  ranks LMT as a 4 Star-Strong stock.  Using my D4L-PreScreen.xls  model, I determined the share price would need to increase to $140.24  before LMT's NPV MMA Differential increased to the $2,600 minimum that I  look for in a stock with 9 years of consecutive dividend increases. At  that price the stock would yield 2.14%.  Resetting the D4L-PreScreen.xls  model and solving for the dividend growth rate needed to generate the  target $2,600 NPV MMA Differential, the calculated rate is 9.6%. This  dividend growth rate is well below the 15.0% used in this analysis, thus  providing a margin of safety. LMT has a risk rating of 2.00, which classifies it as a Medium risk stock.  LMT is the largest defense contractor in the world and dominates  next-generation defense platforms. It owns supply contracts for key  programs such as the F-35, which assure multiple years of revenue. The  company will see significant upside in Aeronautics, with nearly $20  billion in annual revenue projected by 2015, mostly as the result of  production increases of the F-35.   However, U.S. budgetary concerns and a large unfunded pension plan will  likely slow earnings growth, and thus, dividend growth. I will continue  to add to my position as long as LMT trades below its calculated fair  value of $93.50 and as my allocation allows.

Last month, The Financial Times reported that Lockheed was setting its sights on international sales in the wake of cutbacks to U.S. government spending. Further attempts are seen as they struggled to reduce their costs through the buy-out of senior executives, reducing employees and consolidating facilities.Despite these austerity measures, increasing revenue and diversification initiatives, Lockheed remains bloated with high capital expenditures and remains subject to the highly competitive nature of the defense industry.In the last decade, over 50% of profits have been spent on capital expenditures. Lockheed must spend large amounts of its revenue in new facilities and equipment to stay competitive, which has eaten into the company’s profit making abilities.Although Lockheed’s revenues have been consistently rising over the past 10 years, its margins remain razor thin. The highest net income margin achieved has been 7.53% in 2008 and has been declining ever since due to government cutbacks and the competitive nature of the defense industry.Lockheed has been on the right path in reducing its costs to address the decline in government spending, but there are still major potholes that impede greater and sustainable profitability.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

233722,23958,2010-11-01T04:59:49-04:00,,"Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE:LMT) is the world’s largest defense contractor, with operations that exceed those of competitors such as Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Northrop (NYSE:NOC). The stock, which is a high dividend achiever, set an all time high in 2008, before falling off a cliff and finally making a recovery in early 2009. However, recently the stock's prospective has come into question again as a tightening defense budget from the United States looks to threaten earnings growth. As you can see in the chart below, the stock has been unfavorable with investors recently, pushing it down to a P/E ratio of 10, and 60% of sales. Lockheed, being the biggest defense equipment manufacturer in the world, has a big, well known brand with a strong client base - including the US government - which accounted for 85% of Lockheed’s revenue in 2009. The company generated $11.3 billion in revenue in 3Q of 2010, a 6% increase YoY. In its recent earnings release (see earnings call transcript here), the company reported diluted earnings per common share of $1.57, compared to $2.07 from Q3 '09. The decline in earnings wasn’t due to ineffective operations, but rather a higher tax rate the company faced all throughout 2010 compared to 2009, and a $178 million charge on a voluntary executive separation program, which the company believes will save more in the long run than the cost of the program. Also, in its footnotes for its most recent 10-Q, the company noted a onetime income tax expense that was charged $96 million dollars, due to the effects of the 2010 health care act. However, the profitability trend for the company has been strong despite a hold down in recent quarters.One thing I absolutely love about Lockheed Martin is that the managers have always looked to increase shareholder value. The company has already repurchased 169 million shares outstanding in this fiscal year, and announced another $3 Billion share buyback last week. Since 2002, the company has been taking advantage of its strong free cash flow, and slowly returning cash to shareholders through share repurchase and increasing dividends. In 2006, Lockheed Martin paid an annual dividend of $1.25 a share a with a yield of 1.4%. Since then the dividend has increased 111% and will equal an annual $2.64 a share for 2010. With its recent increase from .63 cents a share to .75 cents a share, 2011 dividend is expected to come in at $3.00 a share, up another 14%.In terms of valuation, Lockheed Martin presents a great opportunity for the conservative investor. As already mentioned, Lockheed is a cash generating machine, producing strong free cash flow quarter after quarter. For the most recent quarter, Lockheed reported operating cash flow of $3.4 billion with free cash flow of $3 billion. Its current P/CF is better than the S&P500’s average and its own 5YR average, and in line with industry average. P/S of 0.6 is significantly lower than its 5YR average and the industry and S&P500 average. ROE and ROIC has grown significantly in recent years, further justifying the effectiveness of the management. In 2002, ROE was 8.19% and ROIC was 3.65%. Since then both have grown to 78.49% and 35.42% respectively. Despite the growth, in the last couple of years, the shares have lagged as the market fails to recognize the growth in operation and earnings.For the aggressive portfolio, Lockheed Martin may not be the most attractive play. But for the conservative portfolio, I believe Lockheed Martin should be one of the largest positions in that portfolio. The continuous growth of ROE and ROIC, along with share buybacks and rising dividends, give investors a lot of return for their money. The stock has room for capital appreciation also, as the market undervalues the stock because of short term cyclical changes. Of course, before buying, conduct your own due diligence.Disclosure: No positions"

The tepid quarterly results have since triggered downward revisions of estimates among analysts.Third Quarter HighlightsLockheed Martin’s third quarter 2010 earnings came in at $1.57, a penny shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.58 and way below the year-ago quarterly earnings of $2.07. However, the reported quarter’s results were affected by a one-time charge of $178 million related to VESP (Voluntary Executive Separation Program). Through VESP the company retrenched approximately 600 executives, or about 25% of its total executive headcount.Although effects of the retrenchment program would prove to be beneficial to the company over the long-term, it would also have to absorb the near-term bumps in earnings. In contrast, year-ago quarterly earnings were boosted by an unusual tax benefit from the resolution of an IRS examination, which increased earnings by $58 million.The lower trend was reflected on the revenue front also, where Lockheed Martin reported quarterly net sales of $11.4 billion, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.6 billion by $203 million. However, the company smoothly sailed past the year-ago quarterly revenue of $10.8 billion by $608 million.Lockheed Martin finished the third quarter of fiscal 2010 with a backlog of $70.5 billion of which $24 billion belonged to the Aeronautics segment and $21.2 billion to the Electronic Systems segment. However, total backlog fell 8.7% compared to fiscal-end 2009 backlog of $77.2 billion.(Read Zacks' full coverage on this earnings report: Lockheed Reeling from Retrenchment)Agreement of AnalystsLockheed Martin’s backlog in recent times has fallen steadily from $77.2 billion to $70.5 billion. The Obama administration’s ire against high cost large platform defense programs may put into jeopardy quite a few Lockheed Martin’s revenue generators like the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellite system, VH-71 presidential helicopter, Transformational Satellite Communications (TSAT) and missile defense.The axe is now looming large over defense primes in general and Lockheed in particular with Defense Secretary Robert Gates’ innovative plan to save more than $100 billion over a period of five years.Lockheed Martin’s Aeronautics business is expected to witness margin headwinds due to a paradigm shift in delivery mix from high margin F-22 series fighters to low margin F-35 series fighters. The Information Systems & Global Solutions business is also expected to lose its sheen somewhat in 2011 with the expected downsizing of the federal IT budget. The company expects the federal IT budget to shrink 2% – 3% in 2011 over the 2010 level.As a result, following the release of third quarter results, estimate revision trends among the analysts depict a negative bias for the company’s earnings in the forthcoming period. Over the last 7 days, 9 of the 22 analysts covering the stock have made downward revisions for the fourth quarter, with estimates for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011 being lowered by 2 and 12 analysts, respectively.The number of upward revisions on the contrary has been fewer. While 6 analysts have increased their estimates for the fourth quarter, no upward revision has taken place for fiscal 2010 in the last 7 days.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsLockheed Martin is the largest U.S. defense contractor with a platform-centric focus that guarantees a steady inflow of follow-on orders with a leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs.The company continues to benefit from strong defense spending on a number of its platform programs like the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, C-130 Hercules transport aircraft, the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3), the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellite, the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), the Aegis Weapons System for mobile and sea-based missile defense and the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system.As a result, the magnitude of estimate revisions is modest following the third quarter results. Over the past 7 days, estimates for the fourth quarter have gone down by 4 cents to $2.11. While estimates for fiscal 2010 and first quarter of fiscal 2011 have been lowered by 9 cents each.Our RecommendationThe ongoing trend of governmental delays in program decisions coupled with program cancellations has affected the fortunes of the defense industry in general and Lockheed Martin in particular.The tepid recovery rate of the U.S. economy raises fears of another axe on defense. GDP growth averaged 2.7% in the first half of 2010, but decelerated sharply to 2.4% over the second quarter of 2010. The Zacks forecast of GDP growth for the second half of 2010 is now just below 2%. This culminates into a GDP growth rate of 2.3% in the whole of fiscal 2010. We now see greater downside risks to our GDP forecast for the second half of 2010, which may affect government spending on defense.Lockheed carries a sizeable pension liability. The company's operating earnings can be affected by high pension costs in lower interest rate environments. Faced with a bearish market, a drop in the value of securities and a reduction in discount rates, the company has recognized non-cash and after-tax reduction of stockholders' equity of approximately $7.25 billion due to the re-measurement of pension plans as of December 31, 2008.The company bucked the trend in fiscal 2009, helped by higher returns on pension plan assets with an after-tax increase in stockholders’ equity of approximately $495 million. However, the company expects higher pension expenses to the tune of $2.2 billion in fiscal 2010 due to the continued amortization of losses incurred in 2008.Lockheed Martin’s third quarter results of 2010 were affected by a one-time charge of $178 million related to the VESP (Voluntary Executive Separation Program). Through VESP the company retrenched approximately 600 executives, or about 25% of its total executive headcount.The company expects that a substantial amount of the costs of the VESP will be recovered in future through pricing of its products and services for U.S. Government contracts. However, there exists an element of risk till the amount is actually recovered.The near-term outlook does not look promising due to the looming defense budget cuts, a receding order backlog, headwinds in margins, execution risk of major programs, cost over-runs, higher pension liability, and risk regarding retrenchment cost recovery adding to the pile.We do no expect the situation to improve significantly in the near future. We would advise investors to keep away from the Zacks #4 Rank (Sell) Lockheed Martin stock. Over the longer term we are Neutral on the stock."

In the reported quarter with an EPS of $1.45, the company topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.35. However, this was lower than the year-ago quarterly earnings of $1.68. In the reported quarter earnings were affected by the elimination of the tax deduction for Medicare benefit costs reimbursed. This charge decreased net earnings by $96 million, or 25 cents per share.Lockheed Martin also fuelled its EPS growth through lower outstanding shares which decreased to 377.7 million from 397.5 million in the year-ago quarter. A pension accounting adjustment also negated $110 million in the quarter, $4 million less than the year-ago quarter.On the revenue front, Lockheed Martin reported quarterly net sales of $10.6 billion, a 3% increase over $10.4 billion in the year-ago quarter. The upside in sales, YOY came from higher numbers from the Aeronautics and Information Systems & Global Services (IS&GS) segment, which grew by 5% and 4% respectively. Of the rest, Electronics Systems (ES) and Space Systems segment remained steady.Operating profit however fell 7.1% YOY to $982 million in the reported quarter. Profits fell across the board barring the ES and SS segments which remained steady.ES segmental performance was neutral due to growth in operating profit from air defense programs and tactical missile programs, which were offset by lower volume on fire control systems.SS segment witnessed growth in operating profit in Space Transportation and Strategic & Defensive Missile Systems programs. But this was offset by a decline in Satellites programs.Operating profit for Aeronautics segment decreased by 9% in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the first quarter of 2009. The decline in operating profit primarily was due to decreases in Combat Aircraft, which were partially offset by increases in Air Mobility and Other Aeronautics Programs.Operating profit for IS&GS segment decreased by 4% in the reported quarter compared to the first quarter of 2009. During the quarter, operating profit declined in Intelligence and Defense programs, which have more than offset the growth in Civil programs.Lockheed Martin ended the first quarter of fiscal 2010 with cash and cash equivalents of $3.3 billion compared to $2.4 billion at the end of the year-ago quarter. The company generated $1.6 billion of cash in operating activities at the end of the reported quarter, compared to $1.2 billion in cash generated in the year-ago period. Long term debt remained stagnant year-over-year at $5.1 billion.Lockheed Martin finished the first quarter of fiscal 2010 with $75 billion of backlog, of which $26 billion belonged to the Aeronautics segment and $21.1 billion to the ES segment.Lockheed Martin has however, revised downward its fiscal 2010 earnings range to $7.00 – $7.20 from the earlier guidance range of $7.15 – $7.35. For fiscal 2010, the current Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate is $7.22, with estimates clearly on the far side of the ridge. Overall, 10 of the 17 analysts covering the stock have revised their estimates downward for fiscal 2010 in the last 30 days.Lockheed Martin is the largest US defense contractor and will continue to benefit from higher defense spending. The core defense budget for fiscal years 2010 and 2011 outlined a ceiling of $531 billion and $549 billion, respectively, or growth of approximately 4% above the fiscal 2009 budget.

The contract has a potential value of $5  billion spread over 10 years.    Under the contract, Lockheed Martin will repair and maintain the fleet  of special operations aircraft, ground vehicles, weaponry and  electronics equipment as well as manage a global supply chain of parts,  warehouses, and depots. The company will also manage and upgrade the  command's critical infrastructure, from secure IT networks to worldwide  facilities. Lockheed Martin will work with the Special Operations Forces  Support Activity to implement leaner and more efficient business  processes that will deliver more reliable, responsive support at lower  costs and on shorter timelines.      Lockheed Martin remains a key player within the military space and  continues to benefit from strong defense spending. The company’s  customer base includes the U.S. Government, foreign governments and  other commercial buyers. Lockheed’s traditional defense focus appears  strong, with increasing interest from domestic and international  customers. The company mainly competes with Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA), General Dynamics  Corp. (NYSE:GD), and Northrop Grumman  Corp. (NYSE:NOC).    We believe Lockheed Martin has significant upside potential in future  based on Obama Administration’s focus on Smart Power application and  cyber security. Lockheed Martin finished the first quarter of fiscal  2010 with a backlog of $75 billion.  Lockheed Martin is slated to release its second quarter results of  fiscal 2010 on Jul 27, 2010. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the  quarter currently stands at $1.78, lower than the year-ago quarterly  earnings of $1.88.    Lockheed Martin has one of the strongest balance sheets among its peers  with a low long-term debt-to-capitalization of 55.6% after first  quarter-end 2010 (Zacks industry average was 93.2%). Lockheed continues  to be a strong cash generator with its annual operating cash flow  touching approximately $3.2 billion during fiscal 2009. Management is  also prudent in returning a substantial portion of its free cash flow to  shareholders through share repurchases and incremental dividends.    However, we believe all the above-mentioned positives have already been  taken into account in the current share price of Lockheed Martin. This  justifies the Zacks #3 Rank, which indicates a short-term “Hold”  recommendation. Considering the company’s business model and  fundamentals, we retain a long-term “Neutral” recommendation on the  stock."

197361,21523,2010-04-06T15:18:56-04:00,,"Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is the largest defense contractor in the world by  sales.  Some 85% of sales originate from the U.S. federal government,  particularly the Department of Defense (DoD).  Another 13% comes from  foreign partner governments, and only 2% come from the private sector.   The current company was formed by the 1995 merger of Lockheed,  historically a defense aerospace company, and Martin Marietta, which was  known for its space systems.The remnants of the mega-merger can be seen in Lockheed Martin's four  operating segments.  Aeronautics (27% of sales, 30% of profits) makes  and maintains some of the well-known military jets and transport planes,  such as the F-16, F-22, and C-130J.  Lockheed has a long history making  fighter and stealth jets, dating back to famous planes like the SR-71  Blackbird and F-117 Nighthawk.Space Systems (19% for both) is the ""Martin"" part, making satellites,  space-based missile systems, and space transports.  Electronic systems  (27% of sales, 31% profits) makes missile systems, naval sensor systems,  electronic spy equipment, etc.  Finally, Information Systems &  Global Services (IS&GS) is engaged in general information technology  activities for various departments within the government.A Magic Formula investment in Lockheed Martin is a defensive play in  more ways than one.  The company is one of the few major government  contractors, with a long history, significant trust, massive scale (in a  limited market), and accrued experience that simply cannot be  duplicated by potential competitors. All give the company a truly wide  economic moat.  Additionally, defense spending is largely protected from  wild economic swings, as witnessed by net growth in the defense budget  over the past few years, despite a major draw-down in Iraq.  Fast moves  in technology have required continued investment in upgrading military  equipment.  In short, Lockheed is a not a stock that is going to give  you a 100% one-year gain, nor is it likely to lose your shirt for you.Over the next year, probably the major underlying fundamental  catalyst in either direction are developments in the F-35 aircraft  program.  The F-35 is one of the largest new aircraft endeavors in over  30 years.  The plane is designed to replace several existing units  across several branches of the military, including the F-16 (Air Force),  F/A-18 (Navy), and AV-8B (Marines).  It will also replace the expensive  F-22 program (also a Lockheed product), which winds down in 2012.  The  expected order volume for the F-35 could reach over 3,000 units.  To put  this in perspective, the 30-year old F-16, probably the world's most  ubiquitous fighter jet, has had just over 4,500 units build in its  entire lifetime!  The F-35 program could be worth a combined 1 trillion  dollars to Lockheed in equipment and maintenance contracts.  It is a  major component of the company's future.Not without risksOf course, a program this high profile has seen issues.  The software  is still incomplete and not as reliable as needed.  The test side has  run about 6 months behind in building and qualifying prototypes.  In  February, Defense Secretary Robert Gates withheld over $600 million in  payments due to delays and cost overruns.  More bad news would be  detrimental to Lockheed's stock price, particularly over a short 1-year  holding period.It should be said that the F-35 program does not appear to be in  danger of being outright canceled.  It is clearly a high priority for  the DoD.  Operational and tactical metrics have been stellar.The other major consideration is the overall level of defense  spending.  Fortunately, both budgets under President Obama have exceeded  expectations for defense spending.  Lockheed's programs have been  well-supported.  Despite some rumblings about major project cuts or  reformed procurement, I think it is likely that defense appropriations  will not be a major factor here, given the variety of other political  concerns of the moment.ValuationSo, we have to look closely at Lockheed's valuation.  Currently, the  stock sells at a Magic Formula-adjusted earnings yield of 12.65% - a  decent number.  A few things to consider, though.  First, defense  contractors are not historically a high-multiple sector.  Lockheed's  5-year average earnings yield is 10.7%, so there may not be as much  valuation growth potential as we want.  Also, the past decade has been  very kind to defense contractors.  Lockheed's 10-year trailing growth  numbers (15% compound annual profit growth) are not likely to be  duplicated.I have a neutral rating on Lockheed - the stock looks just about  fairly valued.  The F-35 is a nice catalyst, but it probably will not  start contributing to the bottom line for a few years.  On the other  hand, both the company and the stock are relatively predictable, selling  below historical valuations, and delivers a nice 3% dividend yield.   Lockheed makes a better multi-year or dividend play than a one-year  Magic Formula pick.Disclosure: Steve owns no position in any stocks discussed  in this article."
185195,20568,2010-01-28T16:17:22-05:00,,"Before markets opened Thursday, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) reported strong fourth quarter fiscal 2009 results and raised its fiscal outlook. In the reported quarter with EPS of $2.17, the company beat both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the year-ago EPS of $1.98 and $2.05, respectively.However, Lockheed Martin’s net earnings increased only $4 million to $827 million in the reported quarter compared to $823 million in the year-ago quarter. The upside in EPS was fueled to a large extent by lower outstanding shares, which decreased to 381.9 million from 400.7 million in the year-ago quarter.In a reversal of fortune, pension accounting adjustment negated $114 million from the quarter while in the year-ago quarter this adjustment had added $32 million to earnings. The spike in pension liability was due to the lower value of the company’s retiree fund.Behind the Headline NumbersWith $12.5 billion quarterly revenue, Lockheed Martin beat the year-ago result of $11.1 billion by 13%. The upside in sales year over year came from higher numbers across the board, but especially from the Space Systems segment (SS) (28%). Of the rest, Aeronautics and Electronics Systems (NYSE:ES) grew a respectable 13% and 12% year-over-year, respectively. However, the Information Systems & Global Services segment (IS&GS) grew only marginally -- 2% year-over-year. Fiscal 2009 revenues also increased 6% to $45.2 billion from $42.7 billion in fiscal 2008.Operating profit also rose 13% year-over-year to $1.4 billion in the reported quarter. The growth was seen across the board with the exception of the IS&GS segment, which fell 10% year-over-year. Of the rest SS segment rose 43% while Aeronautics and ES segment grew 15% and 11%, respectively. SS operating profit escalated due to higher volume and improved performance on government satellite programs.Lockheed Martin ended fiscal 2009 with cash and cash equivalents of $2.4 billion compared to $2.2 billion at year-end fiscal 2008. The company generated $3.2 billion of cash in operating activities at the end of fiscal 2009, compared to $4.4 billion in cash generated in fiscal 2008. Long-term debt increased to $5.1 billion at the end of fiscal 2009 from $3.6 billion at the end of fiscal 2008. Lockheed Martin finished fiscal 2009 with $78 billion of backlog, of which almost $26.7 billion belonged to the Aeronautics segment and $21.9 billion to the ES segment.Lockheed Martin’s upside in earnings came as a surprise since earnings estimates were going down over the past month, with the quarterly Zacks Consensus estimate going down by a penny in the last 30 days. Overall, three of the 22 analysts covering the stock revised their estimate downward for the fourth quarter.In fiscal 2009, Lockheed Martin earned $7.78 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $7.59 but falling behind the fiscal 2008 EPS of $7.86. For fiscal 2010, the current Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate is $7.42, with estimates clearly on the rise. Over the last 30 days, four analysts raised their estimates. Also the company raised its fiscal 2010 EPS guidance range to $7.15 – $7.35, from its previous guidance range of $7.05 – $7.25."
230935,20568,2010-10-19T17:02:31-04:00,,"Lockheed Martin Corporation’s (LMT)  third quarter 2010 earnings came in at $1.57, a penny shorter than the  Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.58 and way below the year-ago quarterly  earnings of $2.07. However, reported quarter’s results were affected by a  one-time charge of $178 million related to the VESP (Voluntary  Executive Separation Program). Through VESP the company retrenched  approximately 600 executives, or about 25% of its total executive  population.Although effects of the retrenchment program would prove to be  beneficial to the company over the long-term, it has to absorb the  near-term bumps in earnings. In contrast, year-ago quarterly earnings  were boosted by an unusual tax benefit from the resolution of an IRS  examination, which increased earnings by $58 million.Operating StatisticsThe lower trend was reflected on the revenue front also, where Lockheed  Martin reported quarterly net sales of $11.4 billion, lagging behind  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.6 billion by $203 million. However,  the company smoothly sailed past the year-ago quarterly revenue of $10.8  billion by $608 million.Lockheed Martin finished the third quarter of fiscal 2010 with $70.5  billion backlog, of which $24 billion belonged to the Aeronautics  segment and $21.2 billion to the Electronic Systems segment. However,  total backlog fell 8.7% compared to fiscal-end 2009 backlog of $77.2  billion.Segmental PerformanceAeronauticsAeronautics sales increased 7% year over year to $3.3 billion boosted  by higher volume sales from C-130J. There were seven C-130J deliveries  compared to four in the year-ago quarter. However, this was partially  offset by lower volume on the F-22 program and a decline in sales on  F-16 and other combat aircraft programs.There were six F-16 deliveries compared to eight in the year-ago  quarter. Segmental operating profit, however, was at the same level of  $396 million while operating margin shrunk by 90 basis points to 12% in  the reported quarter.Electronic SystemsElectronic Systems sales increased 10% year over year to $3.5 billion  due to higher sales volume. Sales increased in all the three lines of  business. The increase at Mission Systems & Sensors (MS2) mainly was  due to higher volume on ship & aviation systems, radar systems and  surface naval warfare programs, which partially got offset by lower  volume on undersea warfare programs.The increase at Global Training & Logistics (GT&L) primarily  was due to growth on readiness and stability programs, which was  partially offset by lower volume on simulation & training programs.  The increase at Missiles & Fire Control (M&FC) primarily was due  to higher volume on fire control systems. Segmental operating profit  increased by 5.2% to $425 million, while operating margin shrunk by 50  basis points to 11.9%.Information Systems & Global SolutionsInformation Systems & Global Solutions segment’s quarterly sales  increased 7% to $2.5 billion. In the reported quarter, sales increased  in Civil and Defense programs but declined in Intelligence programs.  Civil programs volume was boosted principally due to higher volume on  enterprise civilian services.Defense programs sales increased primarily due to higher volume on  mission and combat systems activities. Sales in Intelligence programs  declined mainly due to lower volume on security solutions. Segmental  operating profit increased by 2.4% to $217 million while operating  margin shrunk by 40 basis points year over year to 8.6% in the reported  quarter.Space SystemsSpace Systems’ segmental sales decreased by 5% to approximately $2  billion. In the reported quarter sales declines at Space Transportation  and Strategic & Defensive Missile Systems business (S&DMS) were  partially offset by growth in Satellites business.The decrease in Space Transportation business principally was due to  lower volume on the Orion and space shuttle external tank programs.  Lower volume on defensive missile programs resulted in lower S&DMS  sales.The sales growth in Satellites programs primarily was attributable to  higher volume in government satellite activities, which was partially  offset by lower volume on commercial satellites. Segmental operating  profit remained at the same level of $235 million year over year. The  segment only witnessed a spike in operating margin of 50 basis points to  11.9% during the quarter.Financial ConditionCash and cash equivalents of Lockheed Martin were $2.7 billion versus  $2.4 billion at fiscal-end 2009. Long-term debt remained stagnant  compared to fiscal-end 2009 at slightly above $5 billion. However, at  the same time debt-to-total capitalization rose to 56% from 55% at  fiscal-end 2009, primarily due to repurchase of common stock.Lockheed Martin generated $3.4 billion of cash in operating activities  in the first nine months of fiscal 2010, compared to $3.8 billion  generated in cash in the year-ago period. The company year-to-date  repurchased 19.8 million shares for $1.6 billion and distributed $700  million as cash dividend.OutlookLockheed Martin has revised downward its fiscal 2010 earnings range to  $6.75 - $6.95 from the earlier guidance range of $7.15 - $7.35. The  company also revised downward its revenue outlook for fiscal 2010 to a  range of $44.9 billion – $45.9 billion from earlier guidance range of  $45.5 billion – $46.5 billion.Our TakeLockheed Martin is the largest U.S. defense contractor, with a  platform-centric focus with a steady inflow of follow-on orders with a  leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs.  However, the ongoing trend of governmental delays in program decisions  coupled with program cancellations has affected the fortune of defense  industry in general and Lockheed Martin in particular.Thus in the near-term we would advise to keep away from the Zacks #5  Rank (Strong Sell) Lockheed Martin stock. Over the longer term, we are  Neutral on the stock."

Analysts are looking for EPS of $1.99 on revenue of $12.47B. The consensus range is $1.84-$2.09 for EPS, and $12.15B-$12.65B for revenue, according to First Call. On October 20, the company raised its FY09 EPS guidance to $7.40-$7.60 from prior $7.15-$7.35. It also expects its FY11 and FY12 revenue to grow roughly 5% due to the expansion of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. It is clear that Lockheed executives believe the company will grow top and bottom line results over the next several years specifically because of this program. A recent report from Reuters claiming that the government plans to cut production of the plan by 122 planes through FY15 did little to discourage that positive sentiment. Concerns about cost overruns and delays have only added to investor anxiety. While short term results will not be affected by the F-35 program, it’s clear that the 2-5 year growth estimates of the company rest squarely with its success or failure. On January 6, Goldman Sachs downgraded the company to Sell from Neutral and lowered their price target to $64. On January 7, it was downgraded to Neutral from Buy at Broadpoint, with a $73 price target. In both instances, challenges to the F-35 program were cited. The stock has traded sideways in recent months in a very narrow range. An earnings surprise will likely be needed to break it out of this channel."

Specifically, here is what he said:Since that time, Lockheed reported quarterly earnings that were 13% better than consensus estimates and they raised the quarterly dividend by 10.5% to $.63 cents per share starting in December. However, the company forecasted fiscal 2010 earnings per share slightly below where analysts’ estimates had pegged them and the stock sold off in reaction. At Ockham, we have a longer term investment focus and believe that the market overreacted to the conservative forecasts. From our standpoint Lockheed actually performed reasonably well in the previous quarter and raising the dividend is a signal of confidence from management. The implied dividend yield of the next four quarters comes out to about 3.5%.  We are not blind to the challenges LMT faces with pension liabilities and the possibility of reduced defense spending ahead, but by our methodology the stock is too cheap trading at less than ten times the lowered 2010 earnings guidance (as well as 2010 analysts’ estimates). The fundamentals strengths of cash earnings and revenue growth have continued to improve recently as well.Apparently in light of recent developments, Cramer has shifted his perspective on Lockheed as of Monday night’s show. Although Lockheed beat estimates, Cramer referred to it as a bad quarter and said that Lockheed is suffering from a priority shift at the Pentagon. According to Cramer, Lockheed is saddled with programs that the Pentagon no longer wants, while Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) has the sort of capabilities that fit the goals that the military is looking to achieve in Iraq and Afghanistan. This is a clear reversal from his opinion of just two weeks prior, and it is his purgative to change his opinion as more evidence is made available. While he may be right about the shifting priorities from the Pentagon, we are sure that Lockheed will not be caught unaware with no alternative course of action. They will continue to compete for contracts same as they always have, and for now we are not overcome with concern for future sales. From our perspective, he seems to have written off LMT for dead rather quickly (especially considering his bullishness two weeks ago).As for Northrop Grumman, we have a Fairly Valued rating at the current price levels. They certainly had a nice quarter in terms of gaining business, which we cannot overlook. We will consider an upgrade on these shares when the new revenue begins to improve their ability to generate cash earnings. As for right now, Ockham’s take is that the value play remains Lockheed, and they have only become more Undervalued in the past two weeks.Original post"

(More at this link here. We initially said tomorrow. We regret the error.)Lockheed, Bechtel and other mainline contractors have long been on our list of alternative energy companies to watch. Although startups often come up with innovative, clever ideas, it will be up to these large outfits to transform the concepts into reality. They are the only ones with the technology, talent, time and money. Lockheed has employees who've spent more time in land use hearings than probably all of the solar startups put together.So far, Lockheed hasn't seen unimpeded success. It signed, and then cancelled a deal to build at 290 megawatt solar farm with Starwood. Clearly, though, that's not the last deal for the company.As a result, expect to see green become a barbell market: A lot of small companies competing to get acquired or sign strategic alliances with large companies.

As the markets were weighing the impact on defense stocks of a change in administration, the credit bubble burst bringing future government spend on the sector into question. LMT stock today is down 35% from its high of $120 (Q3 of 2008) while the S&P is down just 20% in the same period. This leaves LMT trading at around $75 with a P/E of 9.92, well below its long run average of 15. Throughout the current recession, LMT has remained profitable and has had no issues pertaining to credit.The outlook for the industry is unpredictable at the moment as the recessionary environment is the priority of governments around the world. The United States government, the company’s largest customer is also currently occupied with ongoing concerns such as health care reform and energy initiatives in addition to programs to stimulate the economy. Longer term, large annual deficits and federal debt may have an impact on government defense spending. While the ultimate size of future defense budgets is uncertain, it is currently indicated that overall defense spending will continue to increase over the next few years but at a lower rate of growth than has been seen.LMT’s customers are split as follows: 84% of net sales to the US government, 13% to foreign governments, 3% to commercial and other customers. The US government is a very stable customer, as they have a military reputation to uphold and they can print money. Despite all the talk about decreased government spending on defense, this will not be sustained long term as our world slowly returns to a multi-polar system. These developments will only bring an increase in defense spending as governments attempt to maintain their countries’ defence capability in the global arena. This is already demonstrated by the high level of negotiated backlog LMT has; approximately $80.9 billion, of which 58% will still be remaining after one year. Regarding the uncertainty of government spending going forward, LMT feels it is well positioned to take advantage of areas where the government has already indicated increased funding; namely intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) support for the warfighter, cybersecurity, helicopter maintenance and training, and lift, mobility, and refueling aircraft. LMT provides a diverse product offering to the industry and is well positioned to take advantage of these areas of increased spending while other segments may suffer. This company may have been knocked for being in an industry with such an uncertain near-term future, but it is well positioned to thrive within it.Additionally, the company is pursuing a strategy that will see itAreas of opportunity the company foresees areThe company expects revenue growth to exceed the growth in the Department of Defence’s budget, as LMT’s revenues historically have not been dependent on supplemental funding requests.The current debt to capital ratio of approximately 57% is high due to a reliance on one major customer – this affects the estimated equity risk premium. Using 60% as the long run target debt/capital ratio, 5.2% as the cost of debt (current yield to maturity) and 11.1% as the cost of equity (equity risk premium added to cost of debt), yields a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the firm of 6.41%. As a quick return on invested capital (ROIC) is 24.3% for the last 12 months, earnings power on an equity value per share basis (EPV) is expected to be significantly greater than net asset value per share (NAV).A thorough valuation of LMT shows an EPV of $85.4 and a NAV of $48.5. This is in line with ROIC (replacement value of balance sheet) of 9.27%, which is greater than WACC. The competitive advantage which gives rise to the EPV-NAV discrepancy seems highly sustainable as it is based both on relationships (government connections) and capabilities (proprietary technology). Additionally, there are high barriers to entry in this industry as the government is generally a captive customer of LMT for upgrades, parts and service. It would be very difficult if not impossible for a competitor to take away market share from any of LMT’s existing products.The value of growth plays a part in the valuation of LMT as the company has a stated goal of growth, both organically and through acquisitions, which will add value with ROIC being greater than WACC. The 5-year average growth in net-income of 20%, while likely not sustainable in the long run, lends credibility to assuming a long-run growth rate of 3%. Applying a value of growth multiplier to EPV at this rate of growth yields an intrinsic value for LMT of $108.5 per share.As always, I recommend incorporating a margin of safety in order to account for sensitivity in my calculations. A reasonable margin of safety implies an entry price of approximately $76. As such, I believe LMT is a great purchase at its current price of around $75.Disclosure: Long LMT"

BrightSource plans to build a number of plants in California's Mojave Desert to meet those contracts (see BrightSource, PG&E Sign 1.3GW Deal in California and BrightSource Inks 1.3GW SoCal Edison Deal).BrightSource uses a ""power tower"" design -- a field of mirrors, or heliostats, to concentrate the sunlight and heat the water atop of a central tower to make steam to power a turbine. Its first plant, a 110-megawatt solar thermal station in Ivanpah, Calif., is set to begin construction in 2010 and begin operation in 2012.Lockheed, on the other hand, will use a parabolic trough design, using 3,000 100-meter reflective troughs to focus sunlight on fluid-containing tubes that carry the heated fluid to a heat exchanger to generate steam (see Solar Thermal: Which Technology Is Best?).California's investor-owned utilities like PG&E and Edison are under a state mandate to include 20 percent of its power mix with renewable electricity.Arizona Public Service also has a mandate to provide 4.5 percent of its power from renewable sources by 2014.But its project with Lockheed and Starwood, along with its deal to buy power from a 280-megawatt solar-thermal plant that Spanish developer Abengoa Solar plans to build, should bring the utility to 9 percent renewable energy by then, according to The Arizona Republic, which also cited the $1.5 billion plant cost (see Abengoa Q&A: Heating Up the Solar-Thermal Market).Other large-scale solar thermal projects are underway in America's Southwest, which has some of the best sunshine in the world for the large-scale power plants (see NREL Hunts for Solar-Thermal Hot Spots).In Nevada, Solar Millennium plans to develop a 250-megawatt solar thermal power plant and sell the power to utility NV Energy. That plant is set to start operating in 2014 (see Green Light post).Despite the utility hunger for solar power, the high costs of building solar thermal power plants, combined with the ongoing credit crunch and economic downturn, have stymied some other startups hoping to enter the field.In January, solar-thermal startup Ausra said it was exiting the power producing business to focus instead on selling its equipment and technology to other developers, calling the power plant building business ""way beyond"" the startup's capabilities (see Inside Ausra's Big Change).And Pasadena, Calif.-based startup eSolar, which wants to develop tower-style solar thermal plants, said in February that it would sell the rights to develop 500 megawatts of its contracted projects to NRG Energy (see With NRG Deal, eSolar Shifts From Power Provider to Equipment Maker and eSolar's Transformation Continues With Indian Deal).Lockheed and Starwood have much more money than a typical startup, of course. Their deep pockets could give them, along with other large-scale companies getting into renewable energy, a leg up during these credit-constrained times, Greentech Media analyst Daniel Englander notes (see Barbarians At the Gate)."

Bethesda, Md.-based Lockheed was to be the general contractor for the project.""APS understands that after the major subcontractor agreements were negotiated, the size and the final risk profile of the engineering, procurement and construction contract, among other factors, were the reasons Lockheed Martin decided not to go forward,"" the utility said in a statement.Lockheed and Starwood couldn't be reached Wednesday night. We will follow up with the companies Thursday morning.Although few details were available to explain the contract termination, the brief statement by APS provided a glimpse of how difficult it is to plan and build such a large-scale power project. There has been no shortage of super-sized projects being announced by solar thermal power plant developers, but whether they would be built remains a big question.Lining up financing is one significant hurdle. Investors are typically leery of betting on technologies in an emerging market, even if the technologies were first developed decades ago. They want lots of guarantees from the project developer, and that increases the costs and risks associated with each project. There aren't many large-scale solar thermal power plants in the world, and the largest cluster was built throughout the 1980s in California.The Starwood project, called Starwood Solar I, would have been the largest solar thermal power plant to serve the Phoenix-based APS, the largest utility in Arizona.APS also has signed a deal to buy power from a 280-megawatt solar thermal power plant to be developed by Abengoa Solar. This project, called Solana,is set to materialize near Gila Bend, about 70 miles southwest of Phoenix. The developer plans to disclose the project's financing in the first half of 2010, APS said.Greenwich, Conn.-based Starwood teamed up with Lockheed in 2007 to pursue solar power projects, and the Starwood Solar I was the first, publicly disclosed project. Starwood would line up the financing and own the power plant while Lockheed would draw from its deep experience in engineering and construction.Starwood and Lockheed had intended to complete the project in 2013.The power plant would've been located on 1,880 acres in Harquahala Valley, about 75 miles west of Phoenix.The solar thermal power plant would have made use of 3,000, 100-meter parabolic troughs, which are curved mirrors that concentrate and direct the sunlight to heat oil-filled tubes running along the mirrors. The heated oil is would be used to generate steam to run a turbine for electricity generation.The parabolic trough technology is considered more proven than other approaches to produce solar thermal power because nine parabolic trough plants totaling 354 megawatts in capacities have been operating in California's Mojave Desert the past three decades.APS said it's working on deals to replace the lost contract with Starwood. The utility plans to announce a small centralized power project and a distributed power project by the end of the year."

The higher strike price is at a sell target price where I would not mind if the stock is called away.

quarterly dividend will increase by 20% to 42 cents per share. This is
the sixth increase in the company’s quarterly dividend since 2003. The dividend is payable Dec. 28, 2007 to holders of record on Dec. 3, 2007.With
this announcement, the dividend rate of the company has gone from
$0.12/ quarter to $0.42/quarter over the past 4 years.  This
substantial dividend growth rate, of nearly 24% over the past 5 years,
is certainly worthy of further investigation.The company also
announced its Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of an
additional 20 million shares under its share repurchase program. The
share repurchase program was initiated in October 2002. Through June
30, 2007, the company had repurchased a total of 88.1 million shares,
out of the prior share authorization of 108 million shares.In
the first six months of 2007, Lockheed Martin repurchased 14.4 million
shares. As of June 30, 2007, approximately 412 million shares of common
stock were outstanding on the company’s balance sheet. Shares may be
purchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.We have previously discussed, at length, about who benefits from stock repurchase programs and how a company can create shareholder value, this makes Lockheed’s repurchase and dividend growth numbers are fairly intriguing.In addition, Lockheed’s dividend payout ratio at 20.25% is below that of the industry, leaving room for reinvestment into th ecompany in order to fund future growth.Speaking of growth, Lockheed Martin has grown its earnings per share at an astounding 125 % over the past 5 years.

The deal also extends the continuation of the Navy's missile program. Deliveries under the original contract called for the production of 425 missiles from 1989 through 2007.

33557,20219,2007-04-26T03:05:18-04:00,,"The outlook for Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is stable. The US Defense budget is expected to rise a meager 14.3% over the next 4 years, from $439B in 2007 to $502B in 2011, roughly 3% a year. This however does not include special supplementary budgets for the war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan and the war on terrorism (which is less specific). Analysts are expecting a continued improvement in margins. What is little known is that part of this improvement is due to an accounting change. LMT has five divisions: We estimate for 2007 a 3% decline in revenue for the Aeronautics division and a 6% decline for the Space division. The decline is Space should be offset with an 11% increase in the IT division.   Change in Accounting   Instead of awarding a contract to LMT, then sub-contracting components to others, LMT formed the United Launch Alliance with Boeing (NYSE:BA). According to this new procedure, contract revenue does not appear on LMT's statements, only the relative portion of income. This will automatically improve margins. Margins could hit 10.5% in 2007, compared with 8.9% for 2005. When comparing margins in the future, this change has to be taken into account for the Space division. The higher margin does not necessarily imply an improved execution environment. There are no changes in our estimated 2007 EPS; $6.20. We realize that Q1 contains $0.21 in extraordinary gains; however we anticipate an offset in Q3. LMT recently guided upwards from $5.80 - $6.00 to $6.20 - $6.35. US Navy Cancellation We (CrossProfit) view the Navy's cancellation for a new prototype shallow water warship as a blessing in disguise. LMT should concentrate on aeronautics. When getting into something that you are second best at, production overruns are inevitable. General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) should fair better in this naval commission though rumors have it that G-D could use a little help from Poseidon. LMT 1-yr chart  Disclosure: No conflicts."

One of the reasons behind his “buy” recommendation and US$108 price target, which represents upside of roughly 14%, is the company’s strong cash flow.
Free cash flow was about US$1.4-billion, or two times net income, Mr. Shapiro told clients in a note.
Lockheed also raised guidance by US$100-million.
The analyst boosted his earnings per share estimate for 2007 by US30¢ a share to US$6.40 and for 2008 and 2009 by US10¢ per share.

The nation's largest defense contractor by sales, the cancellation is not expected to have much of a financial effect on Lockheed. The cancellation came after more than a month of negotiations in which Navy Secretary Donald Winter demanded Lockheed accept a fixed-price contract, part of the Navy's attempt to stem chronic cost overruns. According to Adm. Charles Goddard, the Navy's top program officer for ships, ""We would like to have had this ship, but we have to have it at a price we can afford."" From an initial cost of $220, the first LCS prototype has ballooned to between $350 million and $375 million, leading to the cancellation of a second prototype. Lockheed is still completing the first LCS prototype and will be allowed to compete for future naval contracts.

25111,20491,2007-01-25T07:43:29-05:00,,"Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE:LMT) spent another quarter firing on all cylinders. But an analyst with CIBC World Markets warns that investors shouldn't let the company's track record lull them into a false sense of absolute security.
The U.S.-based aircraft and defense contractor is scheduled to release fourth quarter earnings today.
Myles Walton with CIBC World Markets said Lockheed Martin has consistently exceeded market expectations and should report record-breaking sales of $10.7-billion for the quarter, up 4%, from the same period the year before.
He predicts earnings for the quarter will hit a record high of $1.48 per share, versus a consensus of $1.45.
As a result, he has raised his price target on Lockheed shares to $103 from $97.
Investors are accustomed to Lockheed Martin's performance but there are always macro risks to consider, like fluctuations in the climate for defense spending, Mr. Walton said. Especially when a single client, like the U.S.government, accounts for about 85% of sales.
A stop work order this month on combat ships Lockheed Martin was producing for the U.S. Navy, in order to evaluate escalating costs, is the first real blemish on the company's record, but is not expected to have a negative impact on the company, he said.
Lockheed Martin is also participating in the Joint Strike Fighter program, the largest U.S. weapons development project in history that's currently entering into the development phase."

Note Q1 revenues grew only 1% to $9.28b, short of analysts' estimates of $9.52b (Bloomberg) - $9.57b (Thomson). Lockheed said its revised sales forecast is a result of its acquisitions of Management Systems Designers [MSD] and RLM Systems. The higher EPS guidance is credited to operational improvements expected across all segments (for $0.14 - $0.19 per share), as well as the $0.21/share gain in Q1 from unusual items. It repurchased 7.6 million shares valued at $739m in Q1.

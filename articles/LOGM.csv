4329509,104119,2020-03-04T12:29:37-05:00,"Since I wrote my bearish piece on LogMeIn a little over 2 years ago, the shares are down about 27% against a gain of 10% for the S&P500.
        The company is obviously less expensive now, but I still think it's overpriced because the problems I wrote about earlier persist.
        There's little upside between the current market price and agreed merger price, so I think investors would be wise to sell now.
        Taking the risk that things don't go smoothly for an extra 1% upside makes little sense to me.
        I think Francisco Partners and Elliott Management are massively overpaying for this company.","In my previous, bearish, article on LogMeIn (LOGM), one of the points I made is that PE multiples matter. At the time I wrote the article, the shares sported a PE of over 1,100 (!), which gave me pause. Now that the shares have come crashing back to Earth and now sport a PE just under 17, I need to update my analysis. Also, the company has obviously posted financial statements since, and so I need to investigate whether the negative relationship between revenue and earnings lingers. Finally, the company hit my radar again this past December because there’s a merger on the table, and I want to talk about the significance of that. Let’s get to it.For those who missed it the first time, I’ll repeat what I pointed out in the previous article. As the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City reports:The following graphic demonstrates this point well.Source: The P/E Ratio and Stock Market Performance by Pu ShenThere’s obviously no way to determine this conclusively, but it is interesting to ponder the extent to which current market nervousness is caused by Coronavirus fears, and how much is related to excessive valuations that we’ve seen for some time. My gut response is that a market that has gotten ahead of itself is far more susceptible to fears of this sort than one that is more reasonably priced.With that as backdrop, it’s worthwhile thinking about the relationship between trailing and forward forecasts at LogMeIn. Although the disconnect between trailing earnings and forward forecasts are not as egregious as when I first wrote about the company, there is still a problem in my estimation. At the moment, the company has trailing twelve month (TTM) earnings of -$.01. The forward PE according to Seeking Alpha is about 17 times and about 22 times according to another service. This is obviously not a precise science. In my analysis, I’ll split the difference and assume that these shares have a forward PE of about 19.5 times. Holding all else constant, the market is currently forecasting that LogMeIn is going to grow earnings from a small loss to $4.36. Markets have a history of being optimistic, but this would be a stretch.In my previous article, I made much of the fact that growing sales didn’t seem to translate into higher earnings. This situation has persisted, as the following from the latest 10-K reveals.Source: LogMeIn 10-K, 2019Sales growth has certainly been impressive in this case, with revenues growing at a compounded rate of about 31.7% over the past five years. The problem relates to the fact that total operating expenses have grown at an even faster rate of 33.6% over the same time period. I posed the question in my previous article on this company and it remains unanswered. If huge increases in sales haven’t led to increases in earnings, what will?Also, shareholders have seen their slice of this company generally severely diluted over the past several years, with shares outstanding growing at a compounded rate of about 14%. I’ve written at length about the negative effects of dilution, and it’s no different in this case. Long term shareholders have, in my way of thinking, been robbed of returns as management has sliced this pie ever thinner. To put my problem with dilution in some kind of context, consider dividend payments.Source: LogMeIn 10-K, 2019As we can see from the above cutout from the latest statement of cash flows, the company paid just over $64.55 million in dividend payments in 2019, which translates into $1.30 per share. Had management held share count to the level of 2015, that same $64.55 million would have generated dividends per share of $2.50. Obviously the shareholders of 2015 (and 2016, 2017, and 2018) have been hard done by in my opinionThree months ago, the company decided to sell itself, as is described in this excruciatingly opaque section of the latest 10-K.Source: LogMeIn 10-K, 2019Got that? For my part, I’d never advocate “kill all the lawyers” as some people have done on occasion. I would be willing to force them all to take a remedial writing class, or perhaps get hooked on phonics. The relevant issue here is that, according to the terms of this deal, shareholders will receive $86.05 per share (1.1% above the current price). There will be no competing bids. In my view, there will be no further action on this stock. I think the people who are buying it are overpaying for it, given what I’ve already written about, but for my part, I’m recommending investors sell in the public market today. Waiting for the deal to go through for a measly extra 1% return makes no sense to me. On the other hand, the past week has reminded us all that the world is notoriously difficult to predict. If there is potential for any hair on this deal, that $86.05 price may disappear. Thus, on a risk-reward basis, it makes sense to take the money and run at this point."
4354372,104952,2020-06-17T16:46:10-04:00,"All LogMeIn's businesses are in the fast-growing UCC, IAM, and customer engagement/support markets.However, it faces more disruptive and efficient competitors like Zoom, Zendesk, TeamViewer, Okta, or RingCentral in all segments.Growing at only ~4% each year while consistently spending ~35% of revenue on marketing spending, LogMeIn needs a major refocus.","We believe that LogMeIn (LOGM) faces tough competitions across all of its business segments. It faces the likes of Zoom (ZM) and RingCentral (RNG) in communications, Okta (OKTA) in IAM (Identity and Access Management), and Zendesk (ZEN), TeamViewer (OTCPK:TMVWY) and many other privately owned players in customer/IT support. The company was well-known for its remote desktop solution before it made a series of acquisitions and merged with Citrix's (CTXS) GoTo business in 2016. As of 2019, the GoTo business made up over 50% of the company's $1.3 billion revenue, with growth declining to a low single-digit over the last two years. We think that LogMeIn may need a major refocus. We will assign a neutral rating on the stock for now.Upon its merging with GoTo in 2017, LogMeIn was eyeing the opportunities to be market leaders across three attractive technology segments: UCC unified collaborations/communications, IAM, and customer service.(source: LogMeIn's roadshow document in 2016)However, these are also the segments in which we see fast-growing players like Zoom in UCC, Okta in IAM, and Zendesk in customer service. Most of these players consistently grow at 20-40% YoY and continue to gain market shares. On the other hand, LogMeIn's growth since the acquisition has been decaying rapidly to ~3.5% in 2019.(source: stockrow)Consequently, LogMeIn looks very far away from where it expected to be. Despite the attractive TAM opportunities and consistent spending in sales and marketing, it has not seemed to gain a meaningful share of the market. Within the same period, LogMeIn has spent 35-37% of its revenue on sales and marketing annually. This level of spending is on par with most +20%, 30%, or 40% growers we regularly cover in SaaS space.(source: logmein website)In our view, LogMeIn's lack of brand integration in light of its past acquisitions may have also affected its underperformance in marketing. LogMeIn has 19 different brands at the moment, which can potentially lead to spreading its marketing effort too thin. Some of its GoTo offerings and LogMeIn-branded offerings, for instance, will benefit from more integrations, which we think should drive efficiencies in its go-to-market and simplifying its marketing messages.Zendesk has done it in recent times, wherein it unified a few brands it acquired under different functional categories that have straightforward names (Support, Guide, Chat). In that sense, we believe that a strategic product portfolio review, which may involve LogMeIn retiring some of the less successful offerings while consolidating some of its brands, can potentially offer upsides. It will not be a straightforward task, however, given the number of different offerings and teams LogMeIn has to reorganize. It also means increasing LogMeIn's investments in R&D. Since 2016, LogMeIn's R&D spending as a percentage of revenue has dropped from ~16% to ~13% in 2019. This figure has relatively been lower than its peers, such as Zendesk or Okta, which typically spends +25% of revenue on R&D.LogMeIn has a strong balance sheet. It had ~$189 million of cash and cash equivalents as of Q1 2020, while the business has a relatively consistent double-digit FCF (Free Cash Flow) margin over the last three to four years.(source: stockrow)As such, LogMeIn can always use the dry powder to either repurchase shares or pay dividends through another capital return plan. In 2017, the board approved a three-year capital return plan, which would return over $700 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.We have a mixed outlook on LogMeIn. At expected 4-5% revenue growth with declining gross margin, it is difficult to justify an overweight position on the stock. On the other hand, it still has decent offerings across various attractive spaces such as UCC, IAM, and customer support, along with a strong balance sheet that would help in any potential turnaround situation. In our view, LogMeIn lacks a strategic direction. Despite the seemingly attractive ~3x P/S, which has also fallen from ~6x in mid-2018, we will maintain our neutral rating on the stock."

        5 Ideas for social distancing.
        1 Remote working investment idea.","I work remotely for months at a time. When I say ""remote"", it does not just mean away from the office. In my case, it is a long way from much of anything. Here is how I do it.It is important to have great information technology. I have someone who is able to set up my computers at my office, home, and remote office so that they work identically. You need all of your files to look just the same and be accessible instantly. In my case, I needed to sink four miles of cable to my remote office in order to have high speed connectivity. It is worth it. We have Bloomberg terminals set up, computers, and even our physical desks and files set up identically.I try to avoid going completely to pot, even when no one is looking. So, morning rituals are key. I try to keep mine more like an early 1960s husband leaving for a corporate job than a 2010s blogger flopping around his basement. Shower, shave, kiss the wife (or whomever it is that you kiss) and leave for work. I wave goodbye to the kids and tell them that I am leaving, even though leaving involves a commute of about fifty feet. I specifically did not want a covered walkway to my office because I wanted some sort of sense of separation.Meetings are mostly pointless anyway, so I don't miss them too much. That being said, they take on more meaning when they are impossible for swaths of the year. So, I try to make some effort at meeting face-to-face, typically in New York City, on both ends of my time apart. I meet with my investors, potential investors, managements of the companies we have invested in, and sources I rely on for information.I feel like I work alone. But that is a fairly incomplete picture. At a given moment, I am thinking, reading, or writing, but that is only possible because of a half dozen people who make that possible. Someone else is monitoring the live portfolio that minute. Someone else is answering my calls. Someone else is taking care of our investors' day-to-day questions. Someone else is moving cash around to the proper accounts so that I always have money to invest. A few others are balancing the books. It would be impossible to have a solitary moment for thinking if I didn't have that help. A lot of work goes into making it look easy.Accountability is crucial to working remotely. I like to think of myself as my only audience and toughest critic. But forcing myself to confront other audiences and critics helps keep me sharp. It is crucial for me to have a strong general partner, so I always feel as if we are in this together, even when I am physically isolated. Everything that I do impacts him directly; that is a big responsibility in terms of how I invest my money, energy, and reputation. I need to put up strong years for my investors and, ideally, strong months when I am away. Working remotely is not a vacation and if performance stumbles, that distinction could be lost on people who count on me. Blogging and writing articles has been a key part of accountability too. With some tangible output, you know that I have not fallen through the ice or been trampled by moose. But it also forces me to come to a point on a specific investment thesis and hold it out there for criticism (sometimes mean, sometimes weird, but often on point and value adding).Liberty is an end in and of itself, but it does not have much practical point if you do not use it. What do you want to do and where do you want to do it? For me, I want to exploit capital market mispricing. I want to do so on the south shore of Rangeley Lake. These are not obvious answers or obviously compatible, but they are my answers. With the right technology, schedule, face-to-face time, support, and accountability it seems to have worked well.There is a little path from the office down to the water. It could be a temptation to wander down to a lake with a tidy row of little boats instead of getting work done. However, it is also a motivation. Is a project really worth it? If it is, I try to get it done efficiently. If not, then it is probably safer to skip it than to tinker on marginal projects. I always have something convenient that would be more fun to do. That is what keeps me honest in terms of prioritizing investment ideas. That is also what keeps me bolting from my desk when the market closes on Friday afternoons.Well if you wait long enough, anything is bound to come into fashion. Skipping meetings, staying clear of others, no awkwardly trying to figure out if you’re supposed to shake hands or air kiss at a drinks party? COVID-19 is terrible, but social distancing is wonderful. I never really identified as an introvert until I read Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking. After that I realized that there wasn’t necessarily something wrong with preferring to work mostly on my own. But once the global pandemic hit, many others have joined me in social distancing whether or not they want to. My hope is that we can somehow defeat the pathogen without letting anyone know. But until this comes to an end, I have been thinking about how to exploit it for profit.One idea is to buy LogMeIn (LOGM). Francisco Partners and Elliott are buying it for $86.05 in cash. Debt financing is committed. It secured approvals from the US, Germany, Austria, and the target’s shareholders. Now they just need PUC, CFIUS and FCC approvals. They should get them by June. The $6.10 net spread offers a 39% IRR if it closes by then. LOGM shareholder Thoma Bravo encouraged the deal.What’s left? PUC approvals in CA, GA, HI, LA, MD, MS, NV, NJ, NY, PA, TX, and VA should be secured in May. That is when they can syndicate the deal’s debt. Their merger agreement explicitly carves out pandemics from their material adverse effects clause. There is no reason to expect the COVID-19 pandemic to have a disproportionately negative impact on this one company.ConclusionI’ve been socially distancing long before this virus hit and will continue long after a vaccine is available but being refused by hippie anti-vax moms in Oregon. In this short period while the rest of the world is joining me in my preferred non-social arrangement, I’m looking at a few ways to profit, such as QIAGEN (QGEN), Tech Data (TECD), Graf (GRAF), and Kemet (KEM). Today I add LogMeIn (LOGM) to that list."
4269390,101693,2019-06-10T09:12:02-04:00,"I believe that LOGM is a company without a real competitive advantage.This is why LOGM has resorted to M&A to compensate for its lack of differentiation.After a long string of mergers and acquisitions, LOGM is now finally starting to roll out a unified all-in-one UCaaS solution for SMBs. I believe this can make or break the company.However, I think there are many uncertainties and risks surrounding the company at this time. Furthermore, its niche is increasingly competitive.In my view, LOGM doesn't offer enough potential upside to investors to compensate for its risks, competitive environment, and lack of differentiation.","LogMeIn (NASDAQ: LOGM) is a classic example of a company suffering from the effects of lacking a sustainable competitive advantage. If you simply look at LOGM’s valuation metrics, you might be fooled into thinking that the company is cheap (or even fairly valued). However, the reality is that LOGM is a company with a distressed business model as its niche market becomes increasingly overcrowded. LOGM's lack of differentiation has put pressure on its margins and slowed down its growth, which has translated into a lower share price since 2017. Currently, LOGM is launching a Hail Mary with GoToConnect, which is an attempt at differentiating itself from the rest of the pack. However, in my view, this is not enough to justify an investment in the company at this time.LogMeIn is a company that operates in the cloud sector. These types of stocks have been generally profitable investments for the past few years. This is because they’ve benefited from the ongoing transition towards the cloud. Nevertheless, it seems that LOGM’s shareholders haven’t been as fortunate. After all, since 2012, LOGM has underperformed the First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (SKYY) (a cloud ETF) by a wide margin.Source: Yahoo Finance. Since 2012 LOGM’s shares have increased at a 9.99% CAGR while the SKYY ETF has grown at a 15.35% CAGR.Such performance is puzzling because the company was once a growth stock that traded at a premium. In fact, you can see in the figure above that since 2017, the shares have pulled back over 40% from their all-time highs. So what happened?Well, before we get into it, it's essential to understand the history of the company. You see, one of LOGM's original products was a virtual private network (or VPN) called Hamachi. However, since its humble beginnings in 2006, LOGM has pivoted towards becoming a “communication as a service” company. This means that LOGM’s products and services are now centered around the concept of replacing businesses’ in-house communication infrastructure and software with LOGM’s cloud-based solutions and hardware.On the surface, this sounds like a potentially very profitable niche. However, the reality is that the UCaaS market is exceptionally competitive. There are many alternatives that SMBs can use for communicating among them: Skype, WhatsApp, Messenger, Google, Microsoft, and many others. Plus, there are many other smaller UCaaS providers like LOGM itself. So it’s fair to say that the UCaaS market is highly competitive, and maybe even saturated at this point.Source: uctoday. As you can see, the list of UCaaS providers is enormous. It's so long that the figure above is just an excerpt.Hence, LOGM’s increasingly competitive market has adversely impacted its results. After all, LOGM used to be a growth company in the hot new cloud market. Now it’s just another UCaaS provider in a crowded market. This is evidenced by the fact that LOGM used to grow its revenues at a 40%+ growth rate in 2009, but by 2012, its growth slowed down to 16%.Since then, LOGM has resorted to acquisitions to reinvigorate its growth. Case in point, in 2012, LOGM acquired Bold Software, and growth ticked up once again and reached almost 20% by 2013. Then in 2015, LOGM acquired LastPass (a password manager). After that, LOGM merged with Citrix in 2016, which gave the company access to the GoTo family of products (more on that later). However, M&A didn't stop there because shortly after that in 2017, LOGM acquired Nanorep (primarily a provider of chatbots for customer support). Lastly, in 2018, it divested from Xively (which was LOGM’s failed attempt at IoT) and acquired Jive (a pure UCaaS provider).As a result, most of the company’s growth has come from M&A rather than organic expansion. In my view, this is typically a sign of a company without a clear vision. However, I do think that LOGM is now a much more focused company on UCaaS than it ever was before. Still, it remains to be seen if management is capable of integrating all of these acquisitions in a commercially successful ""all in one"" UCaaS solution for clients. If this is the case, then all of that M&A would be justified. However, more importantly, it would serve as a great starting point for future growth.Source: Fuze. Voice over IP (VoIP) is an essential component of the UCaaS market. LOGM’s current IP is perfectly positioned to take advantage of this niche that’s forecasted to grow at a 20.58% CAGR until 2024.So, if LOGM successfully integrates its acquisitions, then this could fuel a new wave of growth going forward. Nevertheless, for now, it appears that LOGM's investors are waiting for management to ""deliver the goods."" After all, LOGM now should have enough IP and know-how to produce its long-promised unified UCaaS suite. This unified offering is supposed to be enough to separate LOGM from the rest of the pack and give it a sustainable competitive advantage.Moreover, here is where LOGM’s GoToConnect enters the picture. This is the company’s highly anticipated all-in-one UCaaS solution. We’ll see this product’s results in the next earnings call. However, according to management, the initial reception appears to be quite good. Moreover, if this product is all that it’s touted to be, it could be LOGM’s main growth driver going forward.Source: LOGM’s 2018 10-K. In LOGM’s last earnings call, management mentioned that they expect GoToConnect to help total revenues increase by 25% YoY in 2019.Plus, it would provide LOGM with a unique competitive advantage over its peers in the UCaaS space. Nevertheless, I think it’s prudent to wait until the next quarterly report to see if this is the case indeed.However, the real issues are whether or not LOGM’s growth and business model are sustainable. I think investors are asking: does LOGM have any long-term competitive advantages? Is the long string of acquisitions going to solidify the company's future? Alternatively, did management waste precious resources on M&A? will LOGM show organic growth at some point in the future? Or will it always depend on acquisitions for further expansion?These are the questions that I think the market is discounting. Moreover, the truth is that it's impossible to know for now. After all, it could be that GoToConnect proves to be a hit product that revolutionizes the space, which would allow LOGM to grow leaps and bounds once again. However, it’s also entirely possible that this product flops or underdelivers, which would likely translate into depressed net margins and slow earnings growth.Currently, there's no real, sustainable long-term competitive advantage for the company. This is why the company has to resort to new acquisitions continually. If it didn't do this, LOGM would have become irrelevant a long time ago. After all, this is why LOGM’s net margins have fallen so much from 2010 at approximately 20% to 2018 at roughly 6%.Typically, I'd perform a DCF or some financial model to obtain the company’s fair value. However, I think it’s impossible to predict with accuracy LOGM’s future results at this point. This is because LOGM’s all-in-one UCaaS solution could be a hit, but it could also be a flop, and there’s no way of telling for now.Nevertheless, if we look at the company's valuation metrics, it's evident that LOGM is not expensive. It sports a low 14.33 forward PE and a cheap PB ratio of 1.25. However, if you look at the company’s EV/EBIT ratio of 43.83, it appears expensive. While at the same time, its D/E ratio is actually quite healthy at 0.11.So, either way, LOGM is a mixed bag. It's neither extraordinarily cheap nor extremely expensive. Its revenues are growing, but since margins are so thin, it doesn’t translate into many additional profits. It has an exciting IP but operates in a highly competitive space with little room for product differentiation.All in all, LOGM appears neither too good or too bad. Its valuation is also OK, at best. Lastly, its prospects are OK, at best. Simply put, LOGM is OK, at best.Source: uctoday. GoToConnect's logo.In my view, LOGM’s business landscape is only going to get even more competitive in the future. Thus, the real issue is whether or not investors are adequately rewarded for these severe risks that they're undertaking when they invest in LOGM’s shares. Personally, I believe that this is probably not the case. After all, I think investors should require a much steeper discount for a company that’s essentially betting its future success on one new, unproven product.Investors should look for companies with sustainable long-term business models that enjoy competitive advantages. However, LOGM is quite the opposite of that. It’s a business that requires constant R&D expenses just to keep up with the competition. Moreover, LOGM has been forced to compete on price at times, which is a sign of businesses with sub-par or undifferentiated products. Furthermore, LOGM has consistently resorted to acquisitions to spur growth, which is another sign of an uncompelling business model.Hence, LOGM’s shares might look fairly valued if you simply look at the numbers. However, in my view, its business doesn’t have any competitive advantages. This is why growth has slowed down, margins have compressed, and management has resorted to M&A. Quite frankly, I think that investors should look elsewhere for value because LOGM's value proposition is not compelling enough for investors.Thank you for reading, and good luck."
4285507,35181,2019-08-14T12:10:22-04:00,"LogMein has single-digit YoY revenue growth TTM and forecast for 2019.LogMein has an unacceptable 80% gross renewal rate.The company fails the Rule of 40 due to low revenue growth.I give LogMein a neutral rating. If not for the fact that the stock price has been falling for 1 1/2 years, it would be a Sell rating.","LogMeIn, Inc. (LOGM) is a company with a lot going on. Not only is it competing in three market segments but is attempting to assimilate large acquisitions and integrate and restructure the product lineup for improved growth and profitability. While the stock can be bought at a reasonable price, that is just about the only thing I like about this investment.(Source: LogMeIn)While LogMeIn is operating in three large market segments, the competition is fierce and the company is only achieving single-digit revenue growth, something I don’t find appealing. Nor do I find the gross renewal rate of 80% satisfactory for a SaaS business model.The high-growth portion of the company is only 25% of revenues while the rest of the business is stagnant and losing market share to competitors. The recent resignation and replacement of the board chairman is a big red flag, and I believe this is signaling that the company has dropped the ball.LogMeIn also fails the Rule of 40 primarily due to the less than stellar revenue growth. For all of these reasons, I have to give LogMeIn a neutral rating. If not for the fact that the stock price has been falling for the last one- and one-half years, I would consider giving the company a Sell rating.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)Looking back at the Dec 2017 Investor Presentation Slideshow, LogMeIn management indicated that the company’s product portfolio was comprised of 50% growth and 50% legacy. Just a little more than one year later, the FY 2018 Earnings Call Slides indicated 25% “rapid” growth assets, yet the company would only achieve 5% total revenue growth exiting 2019.(Source: LogMeIn)What happened in one year?It appears that LogMeIn dropped the ball after making some large acquisitions which included the GoTo product line from Citrix Systems (technically a merger), and Jive Communications. The big clue lies in the class action lawsuit Wasson v. LogMeIn:I checked the Q4 2017 results earnings call transcript and at that time, the gross renewal rates were approximately 75% on an annualized dollar basis “across all product lines.” In 2019, this figure has gone up to 80%. In my opinion, even 80% is unacceptable. This means that LogMeIn is losing 20% of its customers every year, clearly indicating that the product suite is not sticky. Most SaaS businesses have at least 90% renewal and many above 95%.Another disturbing indicator is that company management did not provide the Net Dollar Expansion Rate, a metric commonly quoted by SaaS companies. For instance, Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (ZM), a direct competitor of LogMeIn, had a Net Dollar Expansion Rate of 130%+. Given LogMeIn’s poor customer retention rate, it is no surprise that management has avoided mention of the expansion rate.I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated YoY sales growth for the 82 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV, ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, LogMeIn is sitting just below the trend line, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is slightly lower than its peers, given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that LogMeIn is fairly valued relative to the average stock in my digital transformation universe.High-growth companies generally sacrifice profits for growth, and traditional value factors such as P/E ratio are not meaningful. Therefore, I focus on other metrics such as the ""Rule of 40.""The Rule of 40 is a metric used by software companies to help them achieve a balance between growth and profitability. The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate plus profit adds up to 40% or more, then the company has balanced growth and profit and is financially healthy.There are several different ways of calculating the Rule of 40:Growth - The standard growth metric is to use the Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) growth rate. For my Rule of 40 calculation, I use percentage sales growth TTM. There are three reasons for this: (1) ARR is not always available, (2) most SaaS companies grow not only organically but also by acquisition, and (3) many companies are in the middle of a transformation to SaaS and have a significant amount of product sales.Profit - I have seen many variants for the profit metric. Some analysts use EBITDA margin, others use operational cash flow margin or free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin, as I believe that is the most meaningful factor from an investor perspective.LogMeIn's revenue grew by 9.7% for the most recent twelve months. Prior growth was distorted due to acquisitions.(Source: Portfolio123)LogMeIn had a free cash flow margin of 19.9% for the most recent twelve-month period.(Source: Portfolio123)LogMeIn's YoY revenue growth was 9.7%, while free cash flow margin for the trailing twelve months was 19.9%. Therefore:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 9.7% + 19.9% = 29.6%Since the Rule of 40 calculation comes out lower than 40%, I conclude that the company has work to do in order to balance growth and profits.LogMeIn competes in three market segments. These are Communications and Collaboration, Engagement and Support, and Identity and Access. LogMeIn has been actively acquiring companies over the last few years, and some of them have been pretty large acquisitions. These include the merger with Citrix Systems in order to acquire the GoTo product line and Jive Communications. It is clear that LogMeIn has struggled with these acquisitions and is now losing market share to Zoom and other competitors.I find the SaaS company metric of 80% gross renewal rate to be unacceptable. In fairness, the company is restructuring its product offerings for improved marketplace acceptance, but it is too early to evaluate how this is going.While I find LogMeIn to be fairly valued, I don't appreciate the thought of buying a SaaS stock with single-digit revenue growth which also causes it to fail the Rule of 40. For these reasons, I give LogMeIn a neutral rating."
4242698,33291,2019-02-20T21:01:04-05:00,"LogMeIn is down 15% here and shares look attractive at $82.The Street hates changes and unknowns, but often these situations are attractive to catch a rebound.Although 2019 will see revenue growth, it's in 2020 and 2021 that double-digit organic growth and a big ramp up in EBITDA and free cash flow generation are likely.","LogMeIn, Inc. (LOGM) is on our radar after putting out pretty strong numbers for its Q4 and its fiscal year. We thought the quarter was generally positive, the overall long-term outlook for growth was bright. However shares are down 16% since reporting earnings. We believe there is opportunity to acquire shares for a rebound, but long-term investors should find EBITDA growth prospects compelling. In short we see shares as a buy in the $80-$82 range.So what is going on here? Well, LogMeIn is a leading provider of cloud-based connectivity. Essentially it is not the earnings report that is driving shares lower, but it was an announced management change and a large savings plan/shift in strategy. This has the Street worried. However, 9 times out of 10 in our BAD BEAT Investing approach we profit in plays like this. As such we are recommending this trade for a bounce, but also see long-term opportunity.Take a look at the recent action:Source: BAD BEAT InvestingThe key here is that shares are plummeting, but they have not challenged December lows. In the very simple and easy to understand chart above, we see support heavily at $77-$78, which is where shares bounced off of twice in recent months. We see a buying opportunity here at $80-$82, and for those who are stubbornly patient a second buy zone is highlighted under $80. A stop loss of $75 here is recommended, and we are looking to take profit at $89+ for a trade. Longer-term, should growth projections be met, there is ample room for shares to move higher.The numbers were pretty solid in the most recent quarter, so this rings of a BAD BEAT. Both the Q4 and fiscal 2018 exceeded expectations and guidance of the company. It was quite stellar.Source: Q4 earnings presentationA few highlights to be aware of for Q4 were that GAAP revenue was $310.2 million and non-GAAP revenue was $310.7 million, both exceeding the Street's expectations. In addition, GAAP net income was $25.4 million or $0.49 per diluted share and adjusted net net income was $75.5 million or $1.47 per diluted share, well above the $1.41 expected. EBITDA growth is incredible. The growth here was $97.4 million or 31.4% of GAAP revenue and Adjusted EBITDA was $118.7 million or 38.2% of adjusted revenues.For the year things were strong as well. GAAP revenue was $1.204 billion and adjusted revenue was $1.208 billion, well above expectations. GAAP net income was $74.4 million or $1.42 per diluted share and adjusted net income was $283.0 million or $5.39 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations was $404.0 million or 33.5% of adjusted revenue and adjusted cash flow from operations was $443.0 million or 36.7% of adjusted revenue.What is more, the company has a decent balance sheet and is taking care of shareholders. The company closed the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $148.7 million and $200.0 million of borrowings under its existing credit agreement. It also gave $309.3 million back to shareholders. This included $247.1 million of share repurchases and $62.2 million of dividends.Shares are tanking because the company announced a board succession plan. The Street hates unexpected changes and it is responsible in part for some of this selloff.LogMeIn's co-founder and Chairman, Michael K. Simon, will resign from the board, effective May 30, 2019 and his position as Chairman effective March 1, 2019. The Board has named Robert Calderoni, who is currently serving as a member of the Board, to succeed Mr. Simon as the Company’s Chairman. The Street doesn't like this. It also hates an announced restructuring, but we like it as it will save millions as the company seeks to drive growth:Source: Q4 Earnings Presentation and Strategic Shift To help save finances and these growth initiatives, LogMeIn has planned to undergo a global restructuring plan. We think it rings of opportunity. The plan will cost a lot up front ($75 million of strategic investment, plus costs to streamline business lines) and this will weigh on 2019 earnings. However, the moves are being done to streamline operations and reallocate resources to better align with the above growth acceleration goals.Of particular interest here is the work to expand the company's global reach. For example, the plan for the unified communications and collaboration, or UCC (you can read more about the business lines here), which includes perhaps the most well known product, GoToMeeting, calls for significant investment for international expansions. For client engagement and support, or CES products, the company is investing for scale. And scale means growth. The company is also really looking to develop its identity and access management-as-a service, or IDaaS suite, and get the complete suite launched, which offers a market opportunity of up to $8 billion by 2025.  Use of digital payments are increasing in the banking and financial sector. This in turn has resulted in a growing need for security to protect data through identity and access management solutions. Because virtualization has resulted in a greater number of banking functions operating online it has increased vulnerability to cyber-attacks. So the need for IDaaS is expected to have a high potential growth in this segment over the next few years. This restructuring will be done by the end of fiscal year 2019. According to management, the company should save anywhere from $25-$27 million a year following the reorganization, while setting the company up for increasing revenues.In our opinion the decline is far overdone and is an overreaction to the ramp up in capital investments as well as the management changes. But make no mistake, the selloff isn't completely based on nothing. There will be a fiscal impact in 2019, and the bottom line will get pinched, although revenue growth is expected.For the year, revenue is going to grow. We are looking for full year 2019 revenue to be in the range of $1.24 billion to $1.27 billion. But with expenses set to be incurred there will be declines on the earnings front. Below is the company's guidance:Source: Q4 earnings presentationEBITDA is expected to be in the range of $300 million to $305 million, or approximately 24% of GAAP revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $407 million to $412 million, or approximately 33% of non-GAAP revenue. Note this is all down from 2018. So the Street is making adjustment for the new numbers. For the full year, the company delivered annual revenue of $1.2 billion, adjusted EBITDA of 37% and earnings per share of $5.39 .Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $248 million to $252 million, or $4.90 to $4.97 per diluted share. So running the numbers, that has the Street concerned. However, the expenses are being incurred to help streamline the business long-term. At $80 per share, shares trade at just 16 times forward earnings. That is attractive in this space, especially with 2020 and 2021 growth in mind:Source: Q4 earnings presentationWhat matters most is the longer-term. We believe that so long as 2019 targets are met the Street will price in the future expectations, and revalue shares higher. The growth projections are quite impressive. While we never like to rely solely on management forecasts, it seems analysts agree that there is growth potential. With forecasts for growth in 2020 and most analysts rating the stock a buy or a hold, even after this selloff, we think there is room to catch a bounce, both from the a fundamental standpoint longer-term, and from a chart perspective.There is no doubt that LogMeIn had a strong fourth quarter and a strong year. Every metric exceeded guidance and analyst expectations. The company is experiencing huge growth in its key markets. The reset valuation is reasonable following the 2019 spending plan and management shift. We think $80-$82 is attractive to look for a bounce, when considering the future. The major investment plan is designed to accelerate growth, and although 2019 will see revenue growth, it is 2020 and 2021 where we are expecting to see double-digit organic growth, and a big ramp up in EBITDA and free cash flow generation. We think you should consider this name."

While its growth products keep growing rapidly, and gaining market share.The capital return plan continues, and the company paid investors $61 million.

I would wait to see how the turnaround plays out.","LogMeIn (LOGM) has reported its financial results for Q3 2019, with stable revenue growth and earnings, but signaling that the numbers may worsen in the next quarters.The company experienced another weak quarter, with revenue growth up slightly from the previous quarter, but deferred revenue and calculated billings indicate that such a growth is of low quality, and that it may fall further (even to a negative rate) in the next quarters.But LOGM is trying hard to turnaround this situation by actively responding to higher churn rates and competitive threats, improving its product line, and reducing prices. It is also strengthening its position in international markets.Its growth products are growing rapidly, and gaining market share. This is favorable, and may be of great help as they grow their participation in total revenues.The capital return plan continues, and LOGM paid investors $61 million during the quarter. I see this plan as a red flag, as it has no place in a growing company with a lot of market share to gain.At this time, it wouldn't be smart to make an investment decision on LOGM. I would wait to see how the turnaround plays out, and how the management responds to any obstacle on the way.(Finviz)Revenue for the quarter increased 2.6% Y/Y (1.2% Q/Q) to $316.9 million. The growth rate was slightly better than in Q2, but still too low. At least the Q/Q rate suggests that LOGM could reach its desired 5% rate going into 2020.(Author with SEC filings)As the company didn't report its backlog or remaining performance obligations, which is (in my opinion) the ultimate leading indicator of future revenue growth, I will use deferred revenue and calculated billings to measure the quality of the revenue growth.Deferred revenue was $392.8 million at the end of the quarter, with a decent growth rate of 5.2% Y/Y, but down from 7.1% in Q2. What worries me the most, is the growth rate on a Q/Q basis, just -4%. Comparing with the same quarter of 2018 and 2017, the rate was -2.2% and 5.9%. I don't know how the management expects to drive revenue growth up, without the support of deferred revenue.(Author with SEC filings)LOGM doesn't provide the standard billings measure that most SaaS companies do. But it is easily calculated by adding this quarter's revenue to deferred revenue, then subtracting prior quarter's deferred revenue. The reading for the past four quarters is not very pleasant. Billings growth during this quarter was only 0.1%, down from 6% in the previous quarter.(Author with SEC filings)Deferred revenue and (calculated) billings are indicators of the performance of revenue in the future. With this in mind, I can't figure out how LOGM will achieve higher revenue in Q4.See the chart below, and notice how the combination of low deferred revenue growth and billings growth in one quarter, tends to lead to lower revenue growth in the next quarter. So, with lower growth on both indicators, I doubt that LOGM be able to achieve its revenue goal for the next quarter.(Author with SEC filings)The guidance for Q4 is a revenue (non-GAAP) of $319-321 million, EBITDA of $89-90 million, non-GAAP net income of $68-69 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $1.39-1.40.(Q3 2019 Earnings Release)LOGM continues to disappoint in the international arena, with revenues decreasing in the same fashion as the past two quarters:(Q3 2019 10-Q)It is relevant to note that LOGM is intensifying its presence in markets such as the UK, Germany and Ireland, with the full availability of its GoTo Suite, and very positive initial responses from customers and channel partners. It expects to launch GoToConnect and GoToRoom in Australia during Q4.Revenue from the UCC segment decreased 2% Y/Y (flat Q/Q) to $171.8 million, one percentage point lower than in Q2. This is the second quarter in a row, where LOGM sees negative revenue growth in its UCC segment. This bad performance was achieved even with the strong performance of Jive, with a 37% growth Y/Y, reaching $37 million during the quarter.Revenue from Identity and access management (IAM) was $102.4 million, growing 14% Y/Y (an acceleration from Q2's 12%) and 4.2% Q/Q. Revenue from LastPass was $22 million, with an astonishing 64% Y/Y growth.And revenue from Customer engagement and support (CES) was $42.7 million, down 3% Y/Y, in line with Q1 and Q2.(Q3 2019 10-Q)The gross profit was $235.7 million, almost flat from $236.1 million Y/Y, with a margin of 74%, also down Y/Y from 76%. This quarter's gross margin was the same as Q2's, but it may come down in the coming quarters, as LOGM continues to launch new versions of its products, and lowers product pricing to be more competitive in the marketplace.The composition of operating expenses is changing from a year ago, as LOGM intensifies S&M expenses to improve its overall growth rate. I don't like the fact that R&D expenses are decreasing, considering the weakness experienced by its UCC and CES solutions in the marketplace, especially with the strong presence of Zoom Video Communications (ZM) in the UCC segment, which is rapidly taking market share from LOGM. ZM is doubling R&D expenses on a Y/Y basis, and its products seem to have a better pricing and user experience than those of LOGM.I believe that LOGM should be investing aggressively in its offerings, instead of its sales force. Keep in mind that its sales organization is one of the less efficient of the SaaS space. For example, during 2018, LOGM spent $383 million in S&M, and is expected to add only $55 million of revenue during 2019, an efficiency of less than 15%.In contrast, ZM is almost 10 times as efficient on its sales efforts. Off course, in the case of LOGM that has ~80% in gross retention rates, it is difficult to grow revenues without large expenditures in S&M. I will not compare LOGM with ZM on retention rates, because they report the ratio in opposite ways (LOGM with gross numbers, and ZM with net numbers). Although I can tell you that ZM features a net retention rate above 130%.EBITDA for the quarter was $82.2 million (26% margin and down 12.5% Y/Y), and adjusted EBITDA was $109.3 million (34.5% margin and down 5%). See the earnings release for non-GAAP reconciliations.Net income for the quarter was $5.1 million (1.6% margin and down 60% Y/Y), with a non-GAAP figure of $68.7 million (22% margin and but down only 5.8% Y/Y). Free cash flow was $64.6 million, up 12.5% Y/Y and a margin of 20.4%. And EPS for the quarter was $0.10 (non-GAAP $1.39).In a continued effort to regain market share and boost revenue growth, LOGM launched a new version of GoToMeeting with a lower pricing structure. This version is expected to deliver a better video experience, alongside a simple and intuitive user experience.The management says that these changes have generated positive early feedback from customers, prospects, and industry watchers. But it is early to arrive at conclusions about performance. For example, to see the effect on gross retention rates, which is the best indicator of product success, LOGM needs at least twelve months of data.LOGM continues to pay a $0.325 quarterly dividend, that represents an annual yield of ~2%, as part of its 3-year capital return plan of $700 million in share repurchases and dividends. During the quarter, it returned $61 million to shareholders, including $16 million in dividends, and $45 million in share repurchases.I wouldn't invest in a company with only 1.5% share of its TAM, which is returning cash to investors, instead of investing those funds to grab as much market share as it can, in the least time possible. In my opinion, either its industry growth prospects are decreasing, and the TAM is not as big as LOGM claims to be, or the management is losing the forest for the trees. Anyway, a capital return plan is a red flag.With the revenue growth rate so depressed, valuing LOGM with a revenue multiple is not as meaningful as in previous years. See the chart below and compare the stock with some of its closest peers on revenue growth. The stock seems significantly undervalued from that perspective.(YCHARTS)From the peer group, only Oracle (ORCL) is growing at a lower rate than LOG, but ORCL is a huge company with stable revenues and earnings, alongside a steady dividend. Taking revenue growth into account, we can see that Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD) and Automatic Data Processing (ADP) are growing at more than twice the speed of LOGM, so they deserve to trade at higher revenue multiples.(YCHARTS)Valuing the stock with an earnings multiple gives us a similar picture: CSOD and ADP with the highest readings, while LOGM and ORCL at the bottom, with very close numbers.From this perspective, LOGM is entering value territory, and nowadays, investors seem to be focusing on value stocks. If LOGM is able to turnaround its negative revenue growth in the UCC and CES segments, and to maintain a steady growth rate (even a low rate), value investors could push this stock higher to as much as twice its current price.After years of +20% revenue growth, LOGM has lost appeal with growth investors, while entering value territory. The company experienced another weak quarter, with revenue growth up slightly from the previous quarter, but deferred revenue and calculated billings indicate that such a growth is of low quality, and that it may fall further (even to a negative rate) in the next quarters.But LOGM is trying hard to turnaround this situation by actively responding to higher churn rates and competitive threats, improving its product line, and reducing prices. It is also strengthening its position in international markets.Its growth products are growing rapidly, and gaining market share. This is favorable, and may be of great help as they grow their participation in total revenues.The capital return plan continues, and LOGM paid investors $61 million during the quarter. I see this plan as a red flag, as it has no place in a growing company with a lot of market share to gain.At this time, it wouldn't be smart to make an investment decision on LOGM. I would wait to see how the turnaround plays out, and how the management responds to any obstacle on the way."

All supported (sometimes created) by software systems and “apps”. It is a continually developing and improving activity which can become (under the right circumstances) a rich and long-lived business.One of the software producers most-recognized by computer users, both professional and individuals is Adobe, Inc. (ADBE). Its digital imaging aids permeate the digital marketing community and the non-professional individual photographing community. Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Systems for macOS and Windows. Photoshop was created in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll. WikipediaHere is how dozens of software vendors' prospects are currently perceived by investment-market professionals.Figure 1(note: all materials from blockdesk.com have been approved for use in this article)Upside price rewards come from the behavioral analysis (of what to do right, not of errors) by Market-Makers [MMs] as they protect capital they must put at risk from possible damage from future price moves. Their forecasts of potential reward (best upside likely price change) are measured by the green horizontal scale.The risk dimension is of actual-experience price drawdowns at their most extreme point while being held in previous pursuit of upside rewards similar to the ones currently being seen. They are measured on the red vertical scale.Both scales are of percent change from zero to 25%. Any stock or ETF whose present risk exposure exceeds its reward prospect will be above the dotted diagonal line. Best reward-to-risk tradeoffs are to be found on this map at the frontier of alternatives, down and to the right.Currently the most-advantaged on just a risk~reward basis are MSCI, Inc. (MSCI) at location [5], MicroStrategy Incorporated (MSTR) at [9] and Ellie Mae, Inc. (ELLI) and LogMeIn, Inc. (LOGM) at [2].This map is a good starting point, but it can only cover some of the investment characteristics that often should influence an investor’s choice of where to put his/her capital to work. The table in Figure 2 covers the above considerations and several others.Figure 2The Figure 2 table has two distinctive parts. The first 4 numeric data columns [B]-[E] are products of the analysis of current behavior of market professionals. Those columns and the one headed Range Index report what that behavior implies about the current expectations of investment professionals for the likely range of stock or ETF prices in the coming 3-4 months.The remaining columns report what actual market price activity produced when prior forecasts for each stock similar to those of today were used to manage investments under a common portfolio discipline. The Range Index column tells what percentage of each stock’s current forecast lies below the current market price. Under the Sample Size column heading a count of the number of prior forecasts with Range Indexes like today’s is indicated, along with the total number of all forecasts available from the past 5 years of market days.Thinking about the credibility of the current forecasts, the proportion of those similar prior forecasts that could produce a capital gain profit becomes a significant measure. It demonstrates the capability of the forecasters to be helpful to the wealth-building investor. Its proportion as a percent of the prior forecasts sample is in the column headed Win Odds.The Win Odds has an important impact on the Realized Payoff column next to it, where the NET gains of all the prior forecasts in the sample are reported. These results include the actual losses taken under our standard portfolio management discipline TERMD, applied to all forecast situations. TERMD sets the top of each implied price range forecast as a sell target for that single forecast. When first reached within the next 3 months’ closing market price that forecast position is closed so that the expanded capital can be immediately reinvested the following market day. If not reached in 3 months the position is closed and reinvested, regardless of gain or loss.The Risk~Reward Tradeoff map of Figure 1 presents upside forecast prospects to be pitted against actual prior worst-case downside price exposures during TERMD holding periods. The flavor of the prospective reward carrot, the column headed in the Figure 2 table as %Upside Sell Target, was muted there by the worst-tasting next-column experience headed Maximum Drawdown.That point is viewed as the most likely high-stress point to cause an untimely termination of the adventure. A termination then would be at the least productive, most damaging point. Instead, committing the discipline’s full 3-month time investment (but not beyond) might achieve potential recovery to profitability, perhaps even to reach the forecast sell targetBetween the target “cup” and the %Payoff “lip” serious adjustments to commitment enthusiasms can (and usually may) occur. They are indicated by the column headed Cred.Ratio where the Realized Payoff accomplishment is contrasted with the %Upside Sell Target offering.This more critical Reward~Risk comparison draws on the Win Odds (and its complement) to condition the Realized Payoff and the Maximum Drawdown as indicated in the Odds-Weighted columns.Figure 2’s rows provide all these important dimensions issue by issue for the more promising securities in Figure 1. They are accompanied by similar boldfaced measures of SPY to give a taste of “the market” as most frequently observed by the investing public.At the bottom of the table simple averages of the listed stocks offer comparisons of the group with SPY and with a much broader population of over 2,700 stocks and ETFs as measured on this day. The full population data often reveals overly optimistic sell targets and abysmal payoff results. In contrast, the population’s “top10” issues, ranked by their odds-weighted prior forecast histories, typically present annual rates of capital accumulation in the +75% to +90% range and even above, as they do now.Often the more attractive issues fairly quickly resolve their (for whatever reason) underpriced condition, producing a “speed” of capital gain which enriches the CAGR of a portfolio. A more useful condition to those investors whose situations face potential time-defined financial needs to be met by the portfolio sooner than it would likely be able to satisfy. An Active Investment Management strategy able to selectively shift capital into and out of such opportunities often is a solution to such needs.One tool to identify the presence of such opportunities, and to choose between them, is show in Figure 3.Figure 3The orientation of this map is like that of the Reward~Risk Tradeoffs in Figure 1; good is down and to the right, not-so is up and to the left. Items in the white Payoffs area at left have achieved average Win Odds by amounts less than 80 out of 100, and those in the extreme upper left corner may also have had negative % payoffs from prior forecasts at current RI-levels.Present market prospects, as represented by SPDR S&P500 Index ETF (SPY) at location [1] offer coming price change payoffs better than some Software stocks and less than others. But it does so at very high historical odds of performance in the next 3 months, based on its past 5 years’ price performance following forecasts like today’s.The more interesting alternatives here are those with high odds for a profitable investment experience, but with a better-than-market-index prospect. Best of the group in payoff prospect is MSTR at [4], but its profitability odds fall to only 2 out of 3. The odds for ELLI at [9] rise to 8 of 10, and MSCI at [2] has an almost 19 out of 20 history.Best odds in the group is Blackbaud, Inc. (BLKB), provider of software support to organizations seeking donations from supporting charitable donors. Its only caution is that the stock’s current forecast is so attractive (a low Range Index of 1) that in 5 years that has only happened 24 times – less than once in ten weeks, on average. But it has been followed by reaching its sell target each time, in about two months – 45 market days. A small, but powerful, credible sample.Perhaps best-known to investment professionals is MSCI, Inc.(NYSE:MSCI), a spin-out of Morgan Stanley which originated from the creation of price indexes for groups of market securities, used by analysts and money managers internal to the parent. The independent (?) company now offers investment decision support tools to the entire investment industry.More familiar to individuals may be LogMein (LOGM), a provider of internet cloud-based communication services assisting group meetings free of attendee re-location inconveniences, along with other communication services.Opportunities for near price-change capital gains appear to be better among less-well-known vendors of software and related services than for some giants, like Adobe (ADBE) or Microsoft (MSFT). The prospect for double-digit gains at a double-digit basis-points per day rate exist in BLKB, MSCI, and LOGM, making them attractive as buys in an Active Investment Management strategy such as TERMD."

        Shares initially climbed on the result, but quickly faded giving up all gains.
        Company's core operating segment, unified communications collaboration services including video conference tools continue to lose market share with declining revenue in Q2.","LogMeIn Inc. (NASDAQ:LOGM) has a history as a public company since its 2009 IPO and has emerged as a leading software-as-a-service ""SaaS"" firm. The stock has been under pressure over the past year down more than 50% from its all-time high set in early 2018 based on slowing growth and narrowing margins. LogMeIn has made a number of acquisitions in recent years leading to a larger operational profile, although implementing a streamlined and consistent strategy has been difficult with management this year announcing a global internal restructuring. Sentiment on the stock has been poor over the past year leading to earnings estimates that have trended lower and overall poor sentiment. The company announced Q2 earnings on July 25, which exceeded otherwise low expectations supported by an overall stable financial profile. On the other hand, we see long term growth challenges remaining particularly as they related to intense competition from emerging rivals in its core business segments. This article recaps the latest earnings release and includes our view on where LOGM is headed next. LOGM stock price chart. source: FinViz.comLOGM reported a GAAP EPS loss of $0.13 (adjusted EPS of $1.17), with the adjusted figure down 11.4% compared to $1.32 in Q2 last year. Revenue of $313 million was basically in-line with expectations but notably up just 2.4% year over year highlighting one of the more concerning aspects of LOGM; the weak trend in growth. The GAAP loss was driven by a combination of higher operating expenses and a large amortization of acquired intangibles which management removes to reach the adjusted EPS figures. LogMeIn has beaten the headline EPS consensus every quarter going back at least 4 years since 2015 in an impressive streak. The result this quarter however was something more akin to kicking over lowered goalposts as the estimates had been trending lower in recent months with the quarterly adjusted EPS estimate as high as $1.21 as recently as May. LOGM Q2 Earnings Result. source: Company IRWe notice overall weaker margins this quarter with the gross margin declining to 74.2% from 76.2% in the period last year. Management's own ""adjusted EBITDA"" margin declined to 30.52% from 35.9% last year. Sales and marketing expenses was one of the culprits, increasing 22% year over year related to the ""growth acceleration plan"" according to management comments in the conference call. The plan announced back in Q1 as part of a ""global restructuring"" was initiated in order to better address the market evolution and ""streamline our organization and reallocate resources to better align with our growth acceleration goals."" Based on the trend in revenue, it appears LOGM still has some work to do.In terms of guidance, the full year outlook remains the same from the Q1 guidance update. Management expects revenue between $1.252 billion to $1.262 billion, which if confirmed would be an increase of 4.2% requiring an acceleration in the second half of the year for the targert to be reached. The adjusted EBITDA margin guidance of 33% is halfway between the figure in Q2 and last years' result.There are many moving parts to the LogMeIn business, but at its core is the unified-communications-collaboration ""UCC"" platform that has been the bread-and-butter starting with the signature ""GoToMeeting"" video conference software along with related products. The company claims the UCC segment competes in a $50 billion addressable market that is growing at 8% per year. That's a problem as the segment for LOGM which represents 55% of revenues actually posted declining revenues of 0.8% y/y in Q2.LogMeIn Q1 2019 market opportunity. source: LOGM IREmerging competition Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) has been a big industry development, essentially driving a transition in the market away from LOGM and traditional competitors like Cisco's WebEx (NASDAQ:CSCO) and similar products from Adobe Inc (ADBE), Oracle Corp (ORCL), and Microsoft Corp (MSFT) that are now seen as legacy solutions. Zoom Video in particular only operates in the UCC segment and grew revenues 103% in the past quarter reaching $122 million. Zoom is set to surpass LOGM in terms of revenues and users in the UCC segment by next year with revenue guidance of $535-$540 million this year that could still grow by 40% into 2020 according to consensus estimates. In contrast, LOGM management is looking for the UCC segment growth in the single digits. A re-branding of various products under a streamlined ""GoTo"" platform is meant to counter the innovations Zoom has introduced in recent years. LOGM segment revenues. source: Q2 10-QOn the other hand, the smaller segments, Identity as a Service ""iDaaS"" and Customer Engagement & Support ""CES"", are now the growth markets for LOGM iDaaS. Q2 revenue growth in iDaaS of 13% was indeed above the market segment growth of 11% according to management. CES on the other hand, has also presented declining revenues this year of 3.2% for the first six months which is also concerning. Overall, there are plenty of reasons to remain cautious on LogMeIn's outlook. LogMeIn has a couple of positive factors going for it including a relatively strong balance sheet with no net long term debt, and positive free cash flow. Considering the large decline already in its shares, this is now entering the value category with a forward P/E ratio of 14x and forward enterprise value to EBITDA at 9.0x. The company also pays a dividend with a current yield of 1.8% which represents an annual payout of $63 million covered about 4-times from free cash flow of $275 million. All things considered, this to us is more of a ""value trap"" as we are skeptical of the growth outlook and management guidance. LOGM averted a disaster with a relatively solid earnings report that beat subdued expectations. The financial profile is stable with no net long term debt while the company continues to generate positive free cash slow. These positive factors are balanced by the trend of weak growth and concerns related to emerging competition in its core UCC segment. The next few quarters will be crucial for management to confirm that the ""growth acceleration"" plan is working. We remain bearish and more skeptical on the brand momentum and see more downside in the stock."
4178896,104310,2018-06-01T15:17:39-04:00,"LogMeIn is a Massachusetts-based tech company providing cloud-based solutions with respect to communication and remote access to clients across US, UK, and other countries.The company delivered a good result for Q1 2018, but the stock fell sharply due to management’s over-optimistic projections from the past.However, the fundamentals continue to be solid, and our assessment of the stock indicates that it has a strong support at $105 with a good investor upside.","There are two strongly contradicting views with respect to LogMeIn, Inc. (NASDAQ:LOGM), the Massachusetts-based software company dealing in cloud-based communication solutions. The first view is that of the analysts following the stock who have a strong belief in the fundamentals and who are extremely bullish about the stock. The contradicting view is that the management has been extremely over-optimistic in its financial projections, and that the valuation multiples of the stock are too high, so there is no real upside.Our analysis of the stock supports the view of the analysts that the stock could provide about 20% returns in 2018 from the current stock price. LOGM's stock has a strong support at $105, and there is no reason for investors to panic until the stock falls below this price.LOGM is a technological firm providing cloud-based collaboration and connectivity products and services in order to enable secure connections between different Internet-enabled devices. The company's solutions include online meeting, secure remote access, screen sharing, password security solutions, and customer service outsourcing solutions. Its core market of operations is the US, but it also has a presence in the UK and other countries. The company has two main revenue streams: subscription charges for its cloud-based offerings, and professional charges for its one-time services. The company is hardly fifteen years old and has its headquarters in Woburn, Massachusetts.LOGM is one of the few stocks which has had a consistent track record of beating analyst expectations, both in terms of revenues and EPS. As we see in the extract below, since 2015, there has been hardly one occasion where the company has failed to beat the analyst expectations.Source: LOGM EarningsThe previous quarter was also a solid one for the company. GAAP revenue was as high as $279.2 million, showing an increase of about 49% over the $187.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. The company posted a net income of $29.7 million with a diluted EPS of $0.56 as compared to the loss from the corresponding quarter of the previous year. The EBITDA was $113.6 million and was as much as 40.6% of the revenues. Another positive aspect was that the company was able to convert more than 50% of its revenues into operating cash flows. It generated $154 million of operating cash flows which are higher than the EBITDA number and is a sign of a fundamentally solid company.However, the problem with the results which led to LOGM's share price falling was that the management missed out on the guidance from the previous quarter. In its communication to investors, the expected revenues and EPS for the quarter were as high as $303-305 million and $1.29 respectively, but the results failed to beat these numbers by a long shot.After the recent fall in price, it is expected that the management of LOGM might be more cautious and might provide relatively conservative estimates in its guidance.Source: Historical Data from LOGM; Estimates based on calculations by Baptista ResearchSource: Historical Data from LOGM; Estimates based on calculations by Baptista ResearchA company like LOGM has a very strong foreseeability of revenues because it adheres strictly to the SaaS model. The fixed retainer fees that the company earns from its clients from time to time significantly reduce the constant need to aggressively spend on marketing and sales. Also, LOGM is known for having a very low client attrition, which implies that the percentage of satisfied clients with the company is high. The company has seen a very interesting growth story, starting from the Boston market and growing to become a global leader in its field. The recent $1.8 billion merger with Citrix's Go-To Product family that took place in 2017 was an important landmark. This is the reason why we see LOGM's revenues triple in the previous year. The management continues to be on the lookout for relevant acquisition targets in order to fuel growth. Meanwhile, LOGM's management has also built a solid portfolio with software like LastPass (a password management tool) which are market leaders in their respective fields.Despite all these positive factors in favor of the company, our projections of LOGM's revenue follow a conservative approach. After the results of the first quarter, we believe that the management will marginally fall short of its revenue target of $1.2 billion. However, it will achieve reasonable success in terms of margin expansion at the EBITDA level, but the net income will fall marginally short of the $100 million mark.There is little deviation expected in terms of working capital management as the turnover ratios have been more or less stable over the years. Also, the capex has been reasonably predictable. This would result in the generation of a good free cash flow of about $309 million which adds to the financial strength of LOGM.An interesting aspect of LOGM is the analyst consensus for the past three months. As we can see in the extract below, 10 out of 12 analysts hold a BUY rating on the stock and the balance 2 have an OVERWEIGHT and a HOLD rating respectively.Source: LOGM/MarketWatchIf we look at the targets set by these analysts in the extract below, we see that the lowest target set is by Robert W. Baird at $130. Most of the other analysts following the stock are reasonably confident of the fact that it will reach the $135 mark, and the highest projected price of LOGM is by Mizuho, which is as high as $145.Source: LOGM/FinvizIn our analysis, we have used a three-way approach in order to determine our projected price for LOGM. We started off with analyzing the candle chart of the stock in order to determine the support and the resistance. As per our observation from the extract below, the stock has a strong support at $105. Now, the current market price of LOGM fell to around $108.1, which is dangerously close to this support, so it would be interesting to see if the trend reverses or not. Given the good fundamentals, we would like to believe that the stock will follow the analyst opinion and start its upward movement soon.Source: Yahoo FinanceThe first key resistance that it faces will be at the $117 mark. It is possible that the stock price will continue to hover around this mark until the company gives a stellar quarterly result. Once it breaks the $117 resistance, the next resistance is at $130. This price target could not be determined using the chart and hence we had to use the second step of our approach, i.e. the Gann's Square of Nines. $130 is also a critical resistance, and we believe that it would be a safe point for investors to exit their positions after realizing a return of around 20%In order to reaffirm our target price of $130, we have used our projected revenue and profitability numbers above and applied our projected valuation multiples to them. These multiples have been determined based on our analysis of LOGM's industry peer group.Source: Historical Data from LOGM/Morningstar; Estimates based on calculations by Baptista ResearchAs we can see in the table above, for a projected price of $130, there would be a reasonable amount of multiples contraction with the EV/Sales finally falling below 6 and the EV/EBITDA at around 20.1, which is far more reasonable than the levels at which the stock was trading in the earlier years.The valuation and projected price of LOGM in this article are specific to the date of the analysis, i.e. 30th May, 2018. We must emphasize that these projections are dependent on a number of factors - LOGM's continued realization of the quarterly revenue growth, profitability, free cash flows, and the other assumptions taken into account.Although we are reasonably confident of our projections, our analysis cannot be directed to providing any assurance about the achievability of the forecasted price. There is a possibility that the actual results of the company are different from the projections as a result of unexpected events and circumstances, e.g. loss of a key client by LOGM, working capital issues resulting in poor cash flows, a strongly negative market sentiment making the stock price fall below the support of $105 (in which event, the stock will become a short candidate), a change in the LOGM management, changed investor perception regarding the software services sector, trade recession, war, and so on.Lastly, we would like to clarify that we had no interaction with the LOGM management and it did not comment on the achievability or the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying the financial forecasts.Today, LOGM is in a very interesting situation. The stock is dangerously close to its support of $105, and this could be termed as an accumulation zone. Long-term investors could buy the stock in small quantities and average their investment price if the stock breaks the $105 support.Despite the management's over-optimism, we are reasonably confident of the company's fundamentals, and we believe that the stock could go as high as $130 by the end of 2018, which is an appreciation of about 20% over the current market price. The stock is also a decent pick for long-term value investors, and there is a good chance that it will beat the NASDAQ returns in 2018."
4195218,21815,2018-08-06T05:48:42-04:00,"The company was plagued by what management described as execution problems and the shares sold off big time.While the direct financial impact doesn't seem to warrant the extent of the share price decline, this exposed the possibility of wider competitive issues.Much of its business is facing tough competition in slow growing markets and price increases are not a long-term viable strategy.The company does generate lots of free cash which it can use to innovate out of these markets, and to some degree it is successful in doing that.","LogMeIn (LOGM) provides a portfolio of cloud-based communication and collaboration, identity and access, and customer engagement and support solutions. The shares sold off big time (25%+) after the Q2 earnings:And it's not hard to understand why. At least management was brutally honest when they argued (Q2CC):The resulting 25% fall wiped out years of progress, as it happens:We have a feeling this is a little excessive (Q2CC):What are the costs:However, despite these mishaps, the company still actually managed to exceed revenues above the top guidance range in Q2.So there was significant compensation:But given the market reaction, there are obvious fears the situation is more serious. Management did a pretty good job allaying these fears, at least for us. Basically the problem was one of execution, not a market problem:Management argues that heads have rolled, there is a new manager for the unit, the CEO himself has a more hands-on approach, and there were also personnel changes in engineering and product roles; as their focus was too much on next generation stuff, they sort of forgot the basic bread and butter stuff a bit.Management is confident that given time, the changes will work as these were execution problems; there is nothing inherently wrong with their market position. Jury is still out but guidance predicts fairly minimal damage.In a way, it was a little curious as one analyst mentioned, as some of the practices (like moving customers into annual contracts and auto renewal) were deemed good strategy.While that might be true, management argues that they did extensive DD on where the customer friction was produced talking to a lot of them so they're confident they've got it right this time.Management did concede that the competition is increasing, with Skype for business, WebEx and Zoom improvements. But management argues that after having made the changes in production and engineering, they're confident they'll get improvements online as they regularly did in the past.How has the company been doing longer term? Pretty well as it happens, especially of late.LOGM Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsAcquisitions have been part of that and Jive Communications for $342M (+$15M on achieving certain milestones) on February 8 of this year is the most important of these.Jive is a cloud based VoIP service for enterprise that blends well with LogMeIn's collaboration applications like GoToMeeting and join.me. This one really is growing, by 26.4% in Q2 to $24.2M. It will produce some $75M in revenues in 2018.In the Identity business, sales of LastPass grew over 70% y/y, and in the customer engagement and support business, Bold360 ai, their AI-powered digital customer engagement product had a strong Q2 after the Q1 introduction.A handy overview from the Q2 10-Q:The C&C business (where the troubles originate) grew 5% y/y and constitute 57% of total revenues. However, excluding Jive (recently acquired), growth was only 2% y/y.Identity and access grew 18% y/y and now constitutes 29% of revenues. The growth of LastPass is especially impressive (>70%).Q3:FY2018:LOGM Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsThe above are GAAP margins and were affected by stuff like share-based compensation and purchase accounting.The Jive acquisition has had a mildly negative impact also on non-GAAP margins as it has a somewhat higher cost base.LOGM Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsCash flows have more than tripled over the past year and a half, and what about this (Q2CC):From a cash perspective, there doesn't seem to be a whole lot to worry about, in fact quite the contrary. There is a fair amount of share-based compensation but not much, if any dilution apart from the odd share sale to pay for an acquisition. The latest one, Jive, was paid in cash and debt.LOGM Stock Based Compensation (TTM) data by YChartsThe jump in shares outstanding in early 2017 was the result of the acquisition of the GoToMeeting app from Citrix (CTXS), and according to SA contributor Bert Hochfeld, this acquisition has been responsible for the large improvement in financial metrics through taking advantage of synergies and cross-selling opportunities.LOGM EV to EBITDA (TTM) data by YChartsWhat is also really odd, given the 25% price reaction to the troubles in the collaboration sector, is that analysts have, on average, hardly taken down estimates.For 2018, they expect an EPS of $5.23, but this was $5.27 before the earnings call, exposing the troubles and the reduced H2 guidance. Of course, one has to also take on board that Q2 EPS was a beat itself, by $0.07 to $1.32. Next year, analysts expect an EPS of $5.80 (down from $6.03 before Q2 earnings).Lest one forgets, the shares also yield a 1.44% dividend.The execution mishap, while not terrible in and off itself, nevertheless exposed broader risks the company is facing. We see several risks to the story:The space in which the company operates is rather crowded and quite a few of the competitors are much bigger and better financed, starting with Alphabet/Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) with HangOut, Microsoft (MSFT) with Skype, Cisco (CSCO) with WebEx, Amazon (AMZN) with Chime, Zoom, Slack, etc.We would argue that the combination of these is especially dangerous, as there is no shortage of competitors willing to pounce on price increases (and/or execution mishap).And this in fact happened when Zoom aggressively pounced on the company's mishap, and one of the ways it did this was by offering discounts, and management implicitly recognized that pricing was an issue (Q2CC):There is the subtle difference between the dollar renewal rate with its long-term target of 75%, and the actual customer retention rate which is considerably lower given the price increases.It seems to us that on a narrow basis, the 25% price decline was somewhat exaggerated, for various reasons:However, there are wider competitive issues that the mishap exposed, which is the tough competitive landscape and the reliance on price increases which is a dangerous strategy in most cases but especially in such a low-growth, competitive environment.It could very well be that the execution mishap has exposed the price increases as a non-tenable strategy, at least for now. The company needs to get its execution back to where it belongs and its innovation machine adding value to the basic products.In the meantime, there is the large cash flow to enjoy and the company does have a few high growth areas which just might be able to keep the company growing at 10% a year, but the jury is definitely out."
4213816,70365,2018-10-24T10:54:37-04:00,LogMeIn is a cloud-based software as a service company serving primarily the millennial workforce.The company has developed an uncanny ability to report earnings that surpass analysts' expectations and has planned for 10X expansion.Simple multiple valuation techniques suggest LogMeIn's shares are very likely poised for further growth.,"Shares of fast-growing SaaS company LogMeIn (LOGM) have recently corrected from their all-time highs which presents an unparalleled ‘buying the dip’ opportunity. With a 10X expansion target and intriguing company values, LogMeIn is ready to take the high road.LogMeIn is a fast-growing company operating conferencing SaaS targeting primarily the millennial workforce. Last year, the Boston-based company became a constituent of the S&P MidCap 400 index, replacing Triumph Group Inc. (TGI) which took the company’s previous position in the S&P SmallCap 600 index. Most of the company’s revenue is derived principally from subscription fees from its customers who comprise of large multinational companies as well as small and medium enterprises and individuals. Besides a relatively well-diversified portfolio of various initiatives and services, the company is built on a unique set of values of being accountable, thriving together, advancing confidently, collaborating openly and engaging fearlessly.Even though the company experienced a little weakness in some areas of its business according to the latest quarterly earnings call transcript, in the long run, it seems to be on the right track. During the call, William Raymond Wagner, the company’s CEO and president, disclosed that particularly renewals for its collaborative and communication business were a bit disappointing, but overall felt optimistic which is also apparent from his concluding statement below:Over the last five years, LogMeIn has showcased an unbelievable ability to exceed analysts' revenue and earnings estimates. During the last five-year period, the company exceeded analysts' annual earnings expectations in four out of five years. On average, LogMeIn's positive earnings surprise totaled approximately 27 percent. This is relatively rare to see and generally a good sign of hidden profitability reserves. Moreover, as can be noticed in the latest quarterly earnings call, the company managed to build a rich analyst audience consisting of reputable analytical firms and investment banking houses.Skimming through the 2017 December investor presentation, I came up to a slide that was particularly interesting. The slide (which can be seen below) displays the company’s current market opportunity and an expanded market opportunity based on the analysis of the global web conferencing market. From a quick calculus, the company has a 10X expansion target in place which is a very positive sign going on. As outlined in the company’s latest 10-K filing, to accomplish it, the company intends to continue acquiring new customers, increasing its sales to existing customers, expanding its service portfolio, and pursuing strategic international acquisitions.Source: LogMeIn's 2017 December investor presentationPlugging in LogMeIn's financial statements' figures into my DCF template, the company appears to be slightly undervalued. Under the perpetuity growth method with a terminal growth rate of 2 percent, constant 30 percent annual revenue growth over the next five years and 6 percent EBIT margin, fair value of the stock comes at US$35. Under the EBITDA multiple approach of a discounted cash flow model, the intrinsic value per share value of the company stands roughly at US$161 if we assume that the appropriate exit EV/EBITDA multiple in five years' time is around 10x.Source: Own Excel modelBased on a different valuation technique commonly-called as Peter Lynch earnings line, LogMeIn's shares look a little more attractive. Using the Fast Graphs forecasting calculator with a 25 percent adjusted operating earnings growth rate assumption, the company's intrinsic value by the end of December FY2023 is forecasted to hit US$406, which implies a total annualized rate of return upside potential of more than 30 percent.Lastly, in the light of revenue variation of LogMeIn's popular earnings line for the projection of intrinsic per share values of the company, LogMeIn's shares appear also solidly undervalued. According to my model, assuming 30 percent annual revenue growth, zero annual equity dilution factor, a price-to-sales ratio of 4x, the company's per-share intrinsic value by the end of 2021 is forecasted to be roughly US$217. This suggests an average potential annualized rate of return of also more than 30 percent in the following years.Source: Own Excel modelAs you can see, the company's intrinsic value estimations greatly vary. Due to the company's high depreciation, depletion & amortization to sales ratio and changes in working capital to changes in sales inputs, the perpetuity growth version of a discounted cash flow model produces a rather very small intrinsic value figure. As the company still seems to be in its growth phase as recent revenue growth development suggests, these key model inputs are very likely to change as the company matures. Therefore, price-to-sales and price-to-operating earnings correlation lines working with the company's historical multiples may serve as more accurate estimators of the company's shares' future intrinsic value.To sum up, LogMeIn is an outstanding company which appears to be even on a path to exponential growth and not only from the financial statements’ perspective. In terms of valuation, I believe investors should put more weight on price-earnings and price-revenue correlation lines as they may better indicate the future intrinsic value of the company. Despite an apparent contemplation of what worked well (Jive, LastPass and Bold360 initiatives) and what did not (renewals of its collaborative and communication businesses) in the latest quarterly earnings call, LogMeIn’s shares are very likely set to make new highs and provide a superior long-run rate of return. Lastly, almost debt-free balance sheet, healthy margins (TTM EBIT of 6.3 percent) and solid R&D spending (15.8 percent of annual revenues vs. 14.5 percent software & internet global industry average) make the company well positioned to overcome any potential general economy turbulence which may lie ahead.Author's note: To bring similar articles to your attention, please consider subscription of my SA feed by clicking on the ''Follow'' button at the top of this page.Disclaimer: Please note that this article has an informative purpose, expresses its author's opinion, and does not constitute investment recommendation or advice.

By skipping to Figure 3 you can avoid much of what you may already know.Over two dozen stocks, plus SPDR S&P500 ETF compared to one another by their risk/reward trade-off prospects.The same stocks, plus SPY, are ranked by their risk/reward odds-weighted forecast near-term payoff prospects in basis points/day.Comparisons are made with the 2700+ current forecast population average, and the average of its best-ranked 20-stocks current prospects.","LogMeIn, Inc. (NASDAQ:LOGM) and Ellie Mae, Inc. (NYSE:ELLI) are attractive ahead of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and MSCI, Inc. (NYSE:MSCI), while more than half the group should be avoided.Assembling our usual daily MarketMaker (MM) hedging-derived near-term (3-6 month) price range forecasts for the Computer Software Vendor stocks, their Reward-to-Risk tradeoffs are pictured in Figure 1.Figure 1All materials presented here have been approved by blockdesk.com.Upside price rewards come from the behavioral analysis (of what to do right, not of errors) by Market-Makers as they protect their at-risk capital from possible damaging future price moves. Their potential reward (best upside likely price change) forecasts are measured by the green horizontal scale.The risk dimension is of actual-experience price drawdowns at their most extreme point while being held in previous pursuit of upside rewards similar to the ones currently being seen. They are measured on the red vertical scale.Both scales are of percent change from zero to 25%. Any stock or ETF whose present risk exposure exceeds its reward prospect will be above the dotted diagonal line.Best reward-to-risk tradeoffs are to be found on this map at the frontier of alternatives, down and to the right. In this case from Intuit Inc. | NASDAQ (NASDAQ:INTU) at [16] to LOGM at [13].Additional dimensions of concern to investors appear as we look more deeply into how well the MMs’ forecasts have been met by subsequent market price actions. These are presented in Figure 2.Figure 2The Figure 2 table has two distinctive parts. The first 4 numeric data columns are products of the analysis of current behavior of market professionals. Those columns and the one headed Range Index report what that behavior implies about the current expectations of investment professionals for the likely range of stock or ETF prices in the coming 3-4 months.The remaining columns report what actual market price activity produced when prior forecasts for each stock similar to those of today were used to manage investments under a common portfolio discipline. The Range Index column tells what percentage of each stock’s current forecast lies below the current market price. Under the Sample Size column heading a count of the number of prior forecasts with Range Indexes like today’s is indicated, along with the total number of all forecasts available from the past 5 years of market days.Thinking about the credibility of the current forecasts, the proportion of those similar prior forecasts that could produce a capital gain profit becomes a significant measure. It demonstrates the capability of the forecasters to be helpful to the wealth-building investor. Its proportion as a percent of the prior forecasts sample is in the column headed Win Odds.The Win Odds has an important impact on the Realized Payoff column next to it, where the NET gains of all the prior forecasts in the sample are reported. These results include the actual losses taken under our standard portfolio management discipline TERMD, applied to all forecast situations. TERMD sets the top of each implied price range forecast as a sell target for that single forecast. When first reached within the next 3 months’ closing market price, that forecast position is closed so that the expanded capital can be immediately reinvested the following market day. If not reached in 3 months, the position is closed and reinvested, regardless of gain or loss.The Risk~Reward Tradeoff map of Figure 1 presents upside forecast prospects to be pitted against actual prior worst-case downside price exposures during TERMD holding periods. The flavor of the prospective reward carrot, the column headed in the Figure 2 table as %Upside Sell Target, was muted there by the worst-tasting next-column experience headed Maximum Drawdown.That point is viewed as the most likely high-stress point to cause an untimely termination of the adventure. A termination then would be at the least productive, most damaging point. Instead, committing the discipline’s full 3-month time investment (but not beyond) might achieve potential recovery to profitability, perhaps even to reach the forecast sell targetBetween the target “cup” and the %Payoff “lip” serious adjustments to commitment enthusiasms can (and usually may) occur. They are indicated by the column headed Cred.Ratio where the Realized Payoff accomplishment is contrasted with the %Upside Sell Target offering.The more critical Reward~Risk comparison draws on the Win Odds (and its complement) to condition the Realized Payoff and the Maximum Drawdown as indicated in the Odds-Weighted columns.Because of the inter-weaving of these columnar dimensions the more critical matters revolve around the Win Odds of (H) and the relationship of the forecast rewards potential of (E) to accomplished net payoffs of (I), measured in (N). Win Odds below 75 and Credibility Ratios below 0.80 usually are not likely to be competitive where a broad range of investment candidates are available.Figure 2’s rows provide all these important dimensions issue by issue for the more promising securities in Figure 1. They are accompanied by similar boldfaced measures of SPY to give a taste of “the market” as most frequently observed by the investing public.At the bottom of the table simple averages of the listed stocks offer comparisons of the group with SPY and with a much broader population of over 2,700 stocks and ETFs as measured on this day. The population data often reveals overly optimistic sell targets and abysmal payoff results. In contrast, the population’s “top20” issues, ranked by their odds-weighted prior forecast histories, typically present annual rates of capital accumulation in the +75% to +90% range and even above.The wealth-building score is measured by the portfolio’s compound annual growth rate, or CAGR. Each holding in the portfolio contributes its part, given the emphasis of capital commitment dedicated to it. Here each available candidate is viewed as having an equal participation prospect on an all or none basis at this point in time and opportunity.But CAGR is the meaningful standard. It makes the “speed” of wealth accumulation critical because the efficient use of time provides a non-financial leverage in attaining the portfolio’s goals. Recognizing that time presents a powerful (pun intended) function in the CAGR equation’s calculation, an understanding of each investment candidate’s time investment is important. In the financial community the “speed” of reward is measured in units of “basis points per day”. A basis point is 1/100th of one percent.Under the portfolio management discipline of TERMD, the holding periods of capital commitment to various positions may be quite uneven. This is in contrast to the usual methods of measurement for portfolio performance, looking at all holdings during equal calendar periods. That style of measurement tends to encourage buy&hold investing strategies which result in grossly inefficient capital utilization when the significant leverage of time is considered.This kind of passive investment management behavior is a hangover of 20th century investing economics when making holdings changes was quite expensive. At that time serious opportunity for positive reward increments was required to justify the cost of making holdings changes. Payback periods measured in multiple months to years could often be encountered.Advances in transaction technologies now present paybacks of days to hours, with trends spurred by incentives among competing service providers.When measuring the attractiveness of investment candidates in a wealth-building mission environment it makes sense to rank them by their demonstrated rates of capital accumulation. Figure 2 does that in their bp/day order, the last column on the right.The ranking tends to favor stocks with recent favorable experience and degrade those with extended unfavorable market history. The potential for demonstration of significant change in trend may encourage some overstaying positions or new investment choices with an investment losing its market-competitive edge. But it also impedes a too-eager repetition of falling-knife experiences where ultimate recovery may be reasonably expected.PTC, ACIW, CHKP, GIB, CA, MDSO, EXC, CTRL, NUAN, CSOD, CTXS, MANH, FEYE, MSTR, AND ECOM are all in the latter category – about half of the stocks in the group . But perhaps their recovery potentials, when more clearly arrived, may still provide attractive (and fulfilled) rankings.When this level of analysis is focused on the odds for profitable experience and size of likely payoffs we have the comparisons of Figure 3.Figure 3The orientation of this map is like that of the Reward~Risk Tradeoffs in Figure 1; good is down and to the right, not-so is up and to the left. Items in the white Payoffs area at left have achieved average Win Odds amounts less than 80 out of 100, and those in the extreme upper left corner also have had negative % payoffs from prior forecasts at current RI-levels.For market-reference we include S&P500 Index ETF (SPY) at [3] to provide a sense of aggregate opportunity and achievement. It turns out that the best current combination of Odds and Payoffs is in LOGM at [12], with ELLI at [15] a close contender, depending upon the investor’s preferences between scale of payoff and assurance of outcome. Many of the pictured computer software stocks are more appealing than SPY at this time and these prices.A broader market lookThe upside-to-downside prospects of our population of 2700+ MM price-range forecasts is compared in Figure 4, where the day’s distribution of Range Indexes are displayed.Figure 4Range Indexes tell what percentage of the entire forecast range lies below the current market quote for the security at the time of the forecast. It is like a “normalized” price tag. Cheap securities are at the left, expensive ones are on the right.A look at how many are to the right of 50, where upside and downside prospects are equal, gives a pretty good indication of how widespread a price decline threat exists.The fact that approaching 25 securities are stacked up at the left end of the scale, and at least as many more have RIs below zero (price now below forecast low) are further indicators that overall market pressures are more likely to the upside than down.The summary lines of Figure 2 confirm that there are at least 20 stocks with highly attractive near-term capital gain expectations, most with odds better than 8 out of 10 of being profitable.Figures 5 and 6 provide a look at how the price range expectations of MMs for LOGM and ELLI have been moving recently.Figure 5Figure 6Just because some media person has never seen a market index number before as high as it is now (or recently has been) doesn’t mean “the end is near.” Careful selection may well be a good practice, since experienced, well-informed market professionals are identifying several “quality” stocks where waiting for the development of a better outlook is advised. LOGM and ELLI appear to be opportunity leaders at the moment, and MSFT and MSCI are close behind.Please remember this is a near-term evaluation, suggesting CAGR price gain opportunities far above multi-year trendline price growth street estimates for the group. What may appear as more attractive in a few months, providing future price-compounding capital growth opportunities may be very different from the then less attractively-priced current investment competitors.

4112848,98236,2017-10-11T07:58:37-04:00,"LogMeIn is a company that is starting to show the impact of its spin-merger transaction with Citrix.Investors and analysts continue to believe, to some extent, that the company can achieve double digit top line growth.I think the company derives most of its revenue from markets with declining growth, characterized by hyper-competition and with major differentiators other than inertia.Investors may not realize just how much of this company's reported numbers are a product of sustained and significant price increases.The impact of Amazon's new service, Chime, in the key LogMeIn space of Web Conferencing is not yet known and probably not knowable-but it is not favorable for LOGM.","LogMeIn (NASDAQ:LOGM) - A well run company, but not a category leader in its key growth space. It's also dealing with intense competition from larger rivals in markets with either declining growth rates or which have become saturated!Valuing a good company and indeed any company with double digit growth expectations is an art and not a science. Sometimes valuations become detached from reality and are predicated on specific parts of a methodology that really are unlikely to happen. And sometimes companies are so well run there isn’t too much room for upside.It has been more than 8 months now since LogMeIn merged with its primary competitor in the remote access space, the “GoTo” operations of Citrix (CTXS). It has been one of the more accretive transactions of its kind in the software space, and the reported metrics so far have been excellent.LogMeIn used to be considered to be a hyper-growth company. It has enjoyed phenomenal success with many products. But along the way, the products got old, competitors appeared and growth replacements have not quite been found-at least at the necessary scale. The company's EPS forecast already includes almost all of the cost synergies it expected when it bought the operation of GoTo. And the company specifically declined to enlarge the forecast for those synergies on this latest conference call. But more important to me, the company didn't explain how it would be able to grow faster than its market as a whole within its three lines of business. Indeed, there is evidence that the reverse is a more likely outcome. I feel at this price and with the knowledge I have at the moment, avoiding the shares makes sense. I first wrote about LOGM almost two years ago when the shares were in the low $40’s. The shares have enjoyed a great run, partially because of the staggeringly positive deal the company was able to put together with Citrix to acquire the “GoTo” set of solutions from that company. That deal dramatically changed the financial model of the company.As mentioned, most of the cost synergies that were forecast at the time of the merger have already been achieved-significantly earlier than had been forecast. So far, the company has been unwilling to forecast that cost synergies will be greater than those forecast-but at this juncture, it seems quite possible that the company will continue to be able to improve operating expense ratios. I will return to that subject later in this article.Some cross-selling goals have also been realized. The CEO said during the latest conference call that cross-selling goals in the latest quarter had exceeded company expectations and that over 90% of sales reps successfully cross-sold products from the expanded portfolio.Overall, non-GAAP earnings per share had been $1.66 in the year before the merger was announced. The current First Call consensus estimates for non-GAAP EPS this year are $4.05 rising to $4.85 in 2018. Earnings per share are probably more than double where they would have been absent this transaction. The transaction has had the impact that had been forecast by management, and the financial basis for LOGM has been totally recast.The problems I see in terms of evaluating the company’s outlook are two-fold. One of those is that the company has taken actions within its market franchise that appear a bit questionable. It appears that a good bit of the strong operational performance achieved so far this year is the product of substantial price increases, not an avenue that can be continued much longer without undermining the company’s competitive position.The other issue is that the merger has left the new company with a far lower percentage growth outlook. Much of its revenues are now derived from a saturated segment of the IT space. Obviously, all of the businesses it bought from Citrix had, at best, mid-single digit growth prospects when they were owned by Citrix. That is why Citrix was willing to sell them.And based on the strategy of massive price increases, the long-term growth opportunity for the GoTo portfolio is likely even less now than it was under the Citrix ownership. The outlook for 2018, particularly in terms of the consensus expectation for revenue growth, is going to be very hard to achieve, without price increases or some blockbuster new product. At the moment, the company is in the process of shifting GoTo subscriptions to an annual basis. Last quarter, about 90% of new subscriptions that were sold, were sold on annual plans. The company has now reached a 40% penetration of annual subscriptions in its base, and it is starting to test converting existing customers to annual prepaid subscriptions. This has had, and will have the impact of improving cash flow from operations. Indeed, much of that was already seen in Q1 of this year, although that is, inevitably, a one-time effect. Will this new sales tactic improve retention rates? As illustrated in the linked blog earlier in this article, the price of LogMeIn bundles, looked at on an annual basis, is now starting to reach proportions more likely to be examined far more carefully by users than had been the case previously when billing was monthly and prices were significantly lower.In addition to the strategy of moving to annual contracts, the company also has raised prices sharply for several other important products. Here is a link that is likely to be of interest to investors as it foreshadows what might happen to the company if other users take the same path. I have linked here to a blog from a competitor. The blog, while obviously biased, shows the magnitude of the price increase. Linked here is another advertisement that shows the price differentials in yet another market segment. I am fascinated with the euphemism that the company uses with regards to dramatic price increases-it calls what it has done pricing work and acknowledges that it has accelerated that work this year.LOGM management asserts it will maintain a 75% renewal rate, more or less indefinitely. On this latest conference call, no one thought to challenge that assertion. Perhaps the company will do so in the short term mainly because the company uses a dollar based retention metric in its calculation. But at what point does the price increase strategy stop delivering returns? I certainly would not want to be involved with the shares on the long side when that happens. I have linked here to an analysis of LOGM competitors in just one business segment. These competitors are not household names. But for that matter, neither was LogMeIn for many years. I think that the 20 million users shown for Splashtop qualify it as a real competitor that may constrain future price increases in the areas in which it operates.One of the keys to analyzing LogMeIn going forward will be its retention rate. With the kind of price differentials illustrated in some of the links above, that metric would seem to be under some threat. It is hard to know how the price increase will work on renewals and overall revenues. It is rare to see price increases in the IT world of this magnitude and on such a sustained basis, although there have been some in recent years that have ultimately been successful. But LOGM's price increases are accelerating without revenue growth accelerating. That suggests it is losing customers at an accelerating rate. It doesn’t seem likely that increasing prices can be a successful long-term strategy and might bring into question what the actual potential growth is for LOGM.A couple of years ago, LOGM was a much smaller company with a number of high growth segments. Top-line growth typically exceeded 20% and occasionally reached 30%+. While the company always had a couple of significant slow-growth segments, including of course, its historical core of remote access products, much of its portfolio was achieving performance at a hyper-growth cadence. Those high-growth segments have continued to perform and to grow, of course. The problem, at least for this writer, is that these high-growth segments are now far smaller components of LOGM’s overall business than had heretofore been the case.Further, as the sites linked above suggest, it seems as though LOGM, in the wake of the merger has chosen to attempt to attempt to push the envelope, and perhaps then some, with regards to pricing on its mature product lines. While this is apparently producing a positive impact on the company’s operating results in the short term, inviting competitors back into the market by both stretching out lease terms but more importantly escalating prices is likely to prove to be a fraught strategy over the coming years.The products on which price have been raised, are those products that come from low growth/no growth markets. No one is going to mistake remote access as a major growth opportunity under the most optimistic scenario. And, for sure, product differentiation is very hard to come by and what there is of that is often-times not of substantial value to users. I think the question of just how much of a premium LOGM can command for undifferentiated, essentially no-growth solutions, ought to weigh heavily in evaluating the investment merits, or lack thereof, for this company.While inertia is always the best friend of a company with a large installed base, inertia can be upended if users have to pay noticeably larger bills simply to have the same functionality One thing that strikes me in terms of what has been going on is the type of pricing feedback that can be seen in the most cursory search of that topic. Just how far can LogMeIn stretch its price increase strategy? Just how much have price increases been contributing to the strong financial results the company has been able to achieve?Needless to say, there are no answers that are readily available. On the last two conference calls, no one was focused on trying to understand the price increase strategy. There were no questions asked regarding the impact of price increases in terms of revenue growth or how the company would be able to grow faster than its market while trying to sell un-differentiated solutions at increasingly less competitive prices. For the years that I recommended LOGM shares, it always had a decent price advantage, particularly compared to Citrix. It is really difficult, I think, to logically recommend the shares of a vendor whose customers find its products to be too expense and are deserting it at a noticeable cadence.LogMeIn is a relatively well-loved company within the community of 11 analysts that report their ratings to First Call. At this point it has 8 buys and strong buys and 3 holds.LOGM has set a targeted growth rate of 10% + for the next several years coupled with 30% CFFO margins, and the return of $700 million in capital during that period. Needless to say, I am more than a bit dubious. Basically it is my dis-belief of the target that has motivated me to write this article. . The shares would probably be a good enough buy if readers believe management’s forecast. But the shares are certainly on unstable ground if the concerns I have expressed above are valid.For some years now, the central pillar of LOGM’s growth has been its Web Conferencing application. Before the merger, LogMeIn sold JoinMe and Citrix sold GotoMeeting. In particular, LOGM had been able to grow in the Web Conferencing space because JoinMe was significantly less expensive than most competitors. There are many other competitors in the space including Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), who offers its HangOut product and Microsoft (MSF) selling Skype. Cisco's WebEx (CSCO) and Adobe (ADBE) are other market leading products.As many readers are likely aware, in February, Amazon (AMZN) announced a service called Chime that is offered through AWS. Amazon Chime is designed to compete in the broadly defined space for unified communications services. It is basically a remote meeting service for audio and video meetings. Chime is likely to be a very appealing service for many based on ease of use features. I have no intention of attempting to evaluate Chime versus Go to Meeting or JoinMe. I have linked here to a review of the service as well as to the Amazon pricing table.During the Q1 conference call, LOGM reported it had experienced no competitive losses to Chime. Given the way Chime is priced, it would be surprising if any field sales rep would have known about a particular loss to a Chime instance.The issue as I see it is not Chime by itself, although given its pricing and the pervasive nature of AWS, it is certainly a serious threat. What I see, however is that the strongest anticipated revenue growth driver for LogMeIn and the one that is counted on for the most growth in terms of dollars, is populated with a host of strong and aggressive competitors.In addition, most market research analysts believe the market itself is only growing at about 8%/year. The study linked here shows an 8% CAGR and there are other studies with similar conclusions/ If the market growth is 8%, if differentiation is hard to come by, if the two horses that LOGM has in the race are not quite thoroughbreds, and if there is a new horse from a renowned stable on the track-well I think the risks of LOGM failing to achieve its targets are quite high indeed.I have linked here to the latest Garner Magic Quadrant that covers Web Conferencing. This study, which is the most recent Gartner product covering the space (November 2016), was, of course, compiled before the advent of Chime. The results as depicted, speak for themselves. Gartner is certainly not the only evaluator of substance that provides this kind of analysis. On the other hand, the ratings for both LOGM and its now acquired Citrix solution (GoToMeeting), make it more than a bit of a stretch to believe that the combined entity is going to grow faster than the market. In fact, the reverse is probably the case.At this point the company is still in the process of evolving a long-term strategy. It would, to be sure, be easier to handicap some of the company’s initiatives with a product road map of some level of specificity. The company does plan to share its strategy with investors before the end of the year.But it seems clear that one piece of the strategy is going to be Web Conferencing and other solutions that revolve around what the company calls a re-imagination of the meeting experience. The company has a first-ever analyst day scheduled for December 19th to discuss what lies ahead. I will try to evaluate future growth potentials for the company, with what is visible and what seems reasonable.LOGM groups its products in different clouds which can make tracking revenue opportunities for specific products a bit daunting. The company reports specific numbers for each one of its clouds. Overall, the company’s current pro-forma growth rate, net of currency fluctuations is about 6%. So, it needs to double that cadence to match current First Call consensus expectations.The company’s largest cloud is called collaboration. Collaboration has been growing at about a 6%-7% rate most recently. This cloud is 55% of the total company revenues. The company saw its identity and access management cloud, currently 28% if revenues grow by 9%, including some currency tailwinds. The company’s service cloud, which is its smallest business unit at 17% of revenues shrunk by 4% last quarter. Behind these numbers are a 75% dollar based renewal rate these last two quarters. The actual renewal rate by user count is self-evidently far less, depending on what the weighted average price increases have been. It has been many years since this company has chosen to report anything like Annual Revenue per user statistics. Based on what is partially visible, it appears that about 40% of the installed base turns over each year. No wonder the company is trying to move its GoTo base to annual subscriptions.Collaboration cloud, at this point is essentially composed of the company’s web-conferencing products and the company’s telephony products which are called OpenVoice and Grasshopper. OpenVoice is one of many teleconferencing products while Grasshopper is a Voice over IP product that is basically a virtual business phone system. Neither of these latter products ranks at the top of their respective category and both of these solutions compete in very crowded markets..Just what factors other than pricing are going to enable LOGM to do more than hold its own in the midst of cutthroat competition isn’t immediately obvious. And how Amazon’s new product will ultimately impact the market is not yet knowable. It certainly is not going to be a positive factor for any competitor. At some point, it seems reasonable to imagine that LOGM will not have two very similar products that are not really differentiated sold by the same sales force. Given the Gartner survey, I anticipate the future sales of LOGM’s JoinMe will be sunsetted. How that might work out in terms of market share is something that is not really knowable. But it is not a factor that is going to lead to market share gains any time soon. I personally think that this business segment is one that is very vulnerable to competitive pressures and will be a business area in which pricing actions that produce incremental revenues become increasingly more difficult.As mentioned, web conferencing is a growing market with a CAGR of almost 8%. LOGM's results suggest it is losing some market share. How it will be able to turn that around is a topic that has not been addressed specifically by the company and has seemingly not been a topic of concern to analysts, at least in reviewing questions on the last two conference calls. Too many horses with a muddy track sloped uphill usually are not going to produce great results.The company’s identity and access management product offerings are the company’s 2nd largest cloud and this cloud shown the fastest growth so far this year. I think if one could look at the underpinnings of the growth, more than all of it is coming from pricing actions and that in point of fact there has been negative user growth in LogMeIn Pro, Central and GoToMyPC. The risks to growth in this particular space are substantial because the space itself is no longer growing in terms of users and is not expected to do so into the future.Last Pass was bought by LOGM about 2 years ago. It is a product that allows users to store encrypted versions of their passwords in the cloud which can be unlocked with just a single password. There are more than a few alternatives to the product. LastPass was generating less than $11 million in annual revenues when it was bought and apparently revenues have now grown to $14 million over two years, an impressive result. That said, however, the overall size of LastPass is certainly not of a scale to move the growth meter for LOGM in any meaningful fashion.LOGM’s third and smallest cloud is Service which has shrunk so far this year. Many of its products such as Rescue and GoTo Assist are old and have seen their markets stagnate because of replacement technologies. BoldChat, which was recently rebranded as Bold360 is one of numerous products in the customer engagement market. It can be integrated into the LOGM Rescue application. The Live Chat market has been forecast to have a CAGR of 8% over the next few years. It also is a market with little brand loyalty that is ripe for a price war. It is certainly not likely to be a major growth driver for LOGM over the next few years.Xively is the company’s IoT offering. It is apparently reasonably successful platform, with revenues of about $30 million in the trailing 12 months. It competes most directly with Thingworx from PTC. The market for IoT platforms is growing quite rapidly and there is every reason to believe that Xively will at least maintain its market share. But it is simply too small at this point to be a major contributor to the growth of a company that is expecting revenues of $1 billion this year with 14% growth in 2018.Admittedly, this has been a very cursory summary of the various businesses that make up LOGM today. But given the growth of the segments in which they operate, the issues of pricing, commoditization and competition, and considering the recent track record of unit growth, it is very difficult for this writer to determine just how LOGM is going to grow double digits on an organic basis any time soon. Does that matter much to investors? Let’s take a look at company valuation to see if there is a straightforward answer.I think that valuation is a direct analog of the growth that can be expected over the longer term for this company. I think the valuation for LOGM share is high, too high really-simply because I do not believe the growth story and think that the company has many issues that are not fully discounted by the market. Just looking at consensus numbers will most likely produce a different result.At the moment, with 53.7 million shares outstanding, LOGM has a market cap of $6.2 billion. With net cash of almost $300 million, LOGM has an enterprise value of $5.9 billion. That works out to an EV/S of no less than 5.8X. That is an extraordinary EV/S multiple for a company with single digit growth, and not that cheap for a company growing at 14%.As mentioned earlier, on the latest conference call, LOGM increased its EPS forecast for this year to $4-$4.10 on a non-GAAP basis. Its GAAP earnings are materially impacted by the amortization of acquired intangibles and other one-time costs relating to the merger and are not worth discussing for investors. Stock based comp, which was $16 million last quarter represents about 20% of non-GAAP operating income which is not a particularly unusual number compared to many other software firms.Current First Call consensus earnings estimates for next year, have now reached $4.85/share. That is driven by a combination of 14% revenue growth, some share buybacks and continued cost synergies. At that level, the shares have a P/E of 24X. That would be a reasonable P/E if the company could sustain 14% growth. Given my view that the company will turn out lucky to sustain mid-single digit growth, the P/E is quite out of line and further, I do not believe that the company will earn $4.85 per share next year.On the last couple of conference calls, management highlighted the performance of operating cash flow as the company’s strongest metric. But looked at analytically, while the CFFO metric has indeed strong so far this year, this is not and is not likely to be a cash flow story as most people define that term. Overall, the company’s free cash flow metric last quarter came to $85 million, or 32% of revenue. While the company did enjoy a $15 million benefit from the growth in deferred revenues, much of that obviously was a product of the strategy of moving GoTo products to full year subscriptions. The other items in CFFO are mainly those reflecting the merger and other balance sheet items. The company’s free cash flow margin, now forecast to be 28% for the full year is more or less consistent with non-GAAP earnings. Capex, at this point, doesn't play a factor, as the company is eliminating rather than adding to its capital stock. In any event, the company is likely to have free cash flow of about $330 million over the next 12 months based on the forecasts it has provided and the current consensus. That’s a free cash flow yield of about 5.6%, good if the company is really growing at double digits and far less impressive if growth comes in mid-single digits, as I believe is the more likely scenario.I usually try to analyze the GAAP operating expenses in some detail. The value of such analysis in this situation is difficult to determine. The company is taking aggressive steps to achieve synergies and has said that it has already achieved the majority of them in Q2, significantly earlier than projected. That said, it would not surprise me to see the company find additional cost synergies as GAAP operating expense ratios remain quite high, again for the level of growth the company is producing on a pro-forma basis. Sales and marketing in particular at 36% of revenue and research and development at 16% of revenue, would seem to have room for further improvement, especially if the company starts to eliminate some of its product families as I think will happen over the coming quarters. For many years, LOGM was a hyper-growth story that was mis-appreciated and sold at a significant discount to peers growing at comparable rates. Now the opposite is the case. The company is forecasting that it will be able to grow its set of solutions at rates above the market. That might allow it to achieve double digit growth, although most likely actually doing so would take some significant market share gains.But the evidence, both in terms of the Gartner MQ studies, and actual revenue performance, do not suggest how that can happen. Indeed, I think that there are some huge areas of risk in the company’s model where it must compete with larger, aggressive vendors in what is at best a commoditized market and one that can readily see the emergence of price wars. It is hard not to be concerned about LOGM as an investment when much of its growth has come from price increases but the stage is set in some significant business segments to see the emergence of price wars.LOGM shares would be attractively valued if the company was in a position to grow at double digit rates and to achieve continued margin expansion. I do think margins are a lever that has not been fully exercised but I suspect top-line growth expectations will compress significantly. This is not the value/GARP story of the software world that some enthusiasts believe. I think that investors would do well to avoid the name until there is a better outlook for the company in some key markets."

Many have had Facebook’s ($450 billion) likeup thumb in our eye occasionally, but who is LogMeIn ($6 billion)?","LogMeIn, Inc. (NASDAQ:LOGM) is probably a much better wealth-building investment today than either Microsoft, Inc. (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB).Gutenberg in the 15th century helped Ben Franklin in the 18th century lay the groundwork for Microsoft in the 20th century to couple analytical and descriptive tools to the computer via software language to advance mankind to where Facebook in the 21st century could couple all that progress to global electronic communication via the Internet.LogMeIn heightens the scattershot broadcast unidirectional capacity of the Internet's written word to the multi-directional capacity of the spoken word among selected groups of individuals, making their use of TIME potentially far more efficient than otherwise. That at-the-moment ability to confirm the exchange of understanding is not a trivial development and presents a significant competitive advantage.For wealth-building investors the comparisons of present market capitalizations should be apparent, both for those with long-term investment horizons, and as we intend to present now, for those concerned with the more immediate.Our perspective, as usual, draws on the actions of the Market-Making community [MMs] as they seek to provide transaction liquidity for major institutional-investor funds typically managing Billion-dollar equity portfolios. Particularly in times like these their desires to make volume adjustments to their holdings takes on an additional sense of urgency.In ordinary times their size precludes participating in ordinary ""regular-way"" auction markets. They live in a ""deal"" world where ""other side"" of their desired trade gets lined up by the MMs in private negotiations with other like-sized players so the entire ""block"" trade gets executed at one price, at one time, for all participants.Usually a ""cross"" of instantly-balanced sellers and buyers is not available. So, the MM faced with the big-bucks trade order often may stop being just a sales agent, and become a principal by ""filling"" the imbalance and thus putting their own MM firm capital at risk of unwanted market price moves. That will only happen (and most often does) when a separate hedging deal in separate derivatives markets transfers that risk to other willing speculators. Those risk-takers often are knowledgeable proprietary-trade desks of other MM firms.The cost of that equity-market liquidity is borne by the trade-initiating institution, a part of the spread between what was initially sought as a transaction price, and what can actually be done of the moment. Their acceptance acknowledges the reality of what has been negotiated (but not yet closed) between the MM buyer and the prop-trade seller of the price insurance.Once the block trade is consummated, its price is posted on the public ""regular way"" markets to maintain transaction transparency. For stocks and ETFs thus involved, it is the ""deal"" markets run by the investors with the money muscle that lead the price parade, and the public investors simply follow along.The hedge price-change insurance deal's terms define the extremes of prices likely to occur during the lives of the derivatives contracts involved. In turn, prior experience with earlier, similarly proportioned forecasts provide a present perspective on what may be coming for prices in next near-term (3-6 months) markets.

Under the Sample Size column heading a count of the number of prior forecasts with Range Indexes like today's is indicated, along with the total number of all forecasts available from the past 5 years of market days. In the case of ANSS we have a critically small sample.Thinking about the credibility of the current forecasts, the proportion of those similar prior forecasts that could produce a capital gain profit becomes a significant measure. It demonstrates the capability of the forecasters to be helpful to the wealth-building investor. Its proportion as a percent of the prior forecasts sample is in the column headed Win Odds.The Win Odds has an important impact on the Realized Payoff column next to it, where the NET gains of all the prior forecasts in the sample are reported. These results include the actual losses taken under our standard portfolio management discipline TERMD, applied to all forecast situations. TERMD sets the top of each implied price range forecast as a sell target for that single forecast. When first reached within the next 3 months' closing market price that forecast position is closed so that the expanded capital can be immediately reinvested the following market day. If not reached in 3 months the position is closed and reinvested, regardless of gain or loss.The Risk~Reward Tradeoff map of Figure 1 presents upside forecast prospects to be pitted against actual prior worst-case downside price exposures during TERMD holding periods. The flavor of the prospective reward carrot, the column headed in the Figure 2 table as %Upside Sell Target, was muted there by the worst-tasting next-column experience headed Maximum Drawdown.That point is viewed as the most likely high-stress point to cause an untimely termination of the adventure. A termination then would be at the least productive, most damaging point. Instead, committing the discipline's full 3-month time investment (but not beyond) might achieve potential recovery to profitability, perhaps even to reach the forecast sell targetBetween the target ""cup"" and the %Payoff ""lip"" serious adjustments to commitment enthusiasms can (and usually may) occur. They are indicated by the column headed Cred.Ratio where the Realized Payoff accomplishment is contrasted with the %Upside Sell Target offering.The more critical Reward~Risk comparison draws on the Win Odds (and its complement) to condition the Realized Payoff and the Maximum Drawdown as indicated in the Odds-Weighted columns.Figure 2's rows provide all these important dimensions issue by issue for the more promising securities in Figure 1. They are accompanied by similar boldfaced measures of SPY to give a taste of ""the market"" as most frequently observed by the investing public.At the bottom of the table simple averages of the listed stocks offer comparisons of the group with SPY and with a much broader population of over 2,700 stocks and ETFs as measured on this day. The population data often reveals overly optimistic sell targets and abysmal payoff results. In contrast, the population's ""top20"" issues, ranked by their odds-weighted prior forecast histories, typically present annual rates of capital accumulation in the +75% to +90% range and even above.The wealth-building score is measured by the portfolio's compound annual growth rate, or CAGR. Each holding in the portfolio contributes its part, given the emphasis of capital commitment dedicated to it. Here each available candidate is viewed as having an equal participation prospect on an all or none basis at this point in time and opportunity.But CAGR is the meaningful standard. It makes the ""speed"" of wealth accumulation critical because the efficient use of time provides a non-financial leverage in attaining the portfolio's goals. Recognizing that time presents a powerful (pun intended) function in the CAGR equation's calculation, an understanding of each investment candidate's time investment is important. In the financial community the ""speed"" of reward is measured in units of ""basis points per day"". A basis point is 1/100th of one percent.Under the portfolio management discipline of TERMD the holding periods of capital commitment to various positions may be quite uneven. This is in contrast to the usual methods of measurement for portfolio performance, looking at all holdings during equal calendar periods. That style of measurement tends to encourage buy and hold investing strategies which result in grossly inefficient capital utilization when the significant leverage of time is considered.This kind of passive investment management behavior is a hang-over of 20th century investing economics when making holdings changes was quite expensive. At that time serious opportunity for positive reward increments was required to justify the cost of making holdings changes. Payback periods measured in multiple months to years could often be encountered.Advances in transaction technologies now present paybacks of days to hours, with trends spurred by incentives among competing service providers.When measuring the attractiveness of investment candidates in a wealth-building mission environment it makes sense to rank them by their demonstrated rates of capital accumulation. Figure 2 does that in their bp/day order, the last column on the right.The ranking tends to favor stocks with recent favorable experience and degrade those with extended unfavorable market history. The potential for demonstration of significant change in trend may encourage some overstaying positions or new investment choices with an investment losing its market-competitive edge. But it also impedes a too-eager repetition of falling-knife experiences where ultimate recovery may be reasonably expected.SPY and NUAN are both in the latter category. But perhaps their recovery potentials, when more clearly arrived, may still provide attractive (and fulfilled) rankings.When this level of analysis is focused on the odds for profitable experience and size of likely payoffs we have the comparisons of Figure 3.Figure 3The orientation of this map is like that of the Reward~Risk Tradeoffs in Figure 1; good is down and to the right, not-so is up and to the left. Items in the white Payoffs area at left have achieved average Win Odds amounts less than 80 out of 100, and those in the extreme upper left corner also have had negative % payoffs from prior forecasts at current RI-levels.For market-reference we include S&P500 Index ETF (SPY) at [7] to provide a sense of aggregate opportunity and achievement. It turns out that the best current combination of Odds and Payoffs is in ANSS or LOGM, depending on your sample-size confidence in the odds or payoffs.Figure 4 pictures the past 6 months trend of daily MM price range forecasts for LOGM, and Figure 5 presents the MSFT trend of price range forecasts. FB is shown in Figure 6Figure 4Note: This is not a conventional price history ""chart"". It is a record of MM live-date forecasts of the stock's near-term (3-4 coming months) range of likely prices. Forecasts made on the dates indicated, not after the fact. The vertical price-range forecast lines of Figure 1 are split into upside and downside prospects by the heavy-dot end-of-day market quote for the issue on the day of the forecast.A measure of the imbalance between up and down possible price change implications is the Range Index [RI], which tells what percentage proportion of the entire forecast range lies below the current price. The thumbnail picture at the bottom of Figure 1 presents the distribution of RIs for the stock seen in the past 5 years.This is about as clear a picture as can be expected illustrating the relationship of Range Index to subsequent price changes, where the position of the heavy-dot contemporary price to the forecast range extremes is how the RI is determined.The wide spread of LOGM's Range Indexes provides a current-price opportunity for substantial capital gain, with limited downside prospects, supported by ample prior experience.Figure 5MSFT's current Range Index is at its most frequent level, not offering any special timing opportunity.Figure 6Here the impact of lack of control of members' private information shows up in the MMs' recently lowered forecasts of prospective price ranges.LogMeIn presents an attractive buying opportunity for near-term capital gain, with increasing recognition by the MM community likely as a longer-term prospect. Its already-recognized competitors of Microsoft and Facebook do not have as favorable near-term prospects, and may have longer-term competitive disadvantages.Please remember this is a near-term evaluation, suggesting CAGR price gain opportunities far above multi-year trendline price growth street estimates for the group. What may appear as more attractive in a few months, providing future price-compounding capital growth opportunities may be very different from the then less attractively-priced current investment competitors.

4063070,98236,2017-04-18T12:21:00-04:00,"LogMeIn will be reporting its first results as a new entity in a few weeks.The company is most likely to achieve guided results given that substantially all of its revenues come from subscriptions.The company is expected to reach $1.06 billion in revenues this year within an addressable market of only $3.6 billion.The transformation that the company will need to address is an aspirational $30 billion opportunity almost impossible to conjure at this point.Without such a transformation, the specifics of the company's solutions make it difficult to believe that the company will be able to create consistent top line growth of 10%.","LogMeIn: Some thoughts about contextThat Winston Churchill was one of the most articulate statesmen of the 20th century is undoubted. When looking for a quote for articles on SA and elsewhere, I can often find something apposite in his writings.And when I decided I wanted to take a look at LogMeIn (NASDAQ:LOGM) now, a few months after the company went through a spin-merger transaction in which it wound up buying the GoTo business of Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS), I couldn't find a more appropriate turn of phrase than his comment about something being not the beginning of the end but the end of the beginning. The progress of LogMeIn going forward will have very little to do with the results that the company compiled in the past.Churchill used the phrase in the course of giving thanks for the results of the battle of El Alamein in which the British finally defeated Rommel and ended the threat the Germans posed to the Suez Canal and the Middle East. He basically proclaimed that going forward, the Allies would be on the offensive and while much hard fighting remained, the tide had turned. And so it proved although the Russian success at Stalingrad and the American successes in the Pacific were needed to seal the deal.LogMeIn has been many things over the years. It started life as a company with technology that allowed it to underprice Citrix in the remote access space and yet still deliver a competitive user experience. Over the years, it used its technology and some acquisitions to expand its footprint dramatically such that it has been offering a bushelful of solutions, with no one dominant theme, although with aspirations of becoming a major player in the Internet of Things.It was at that phase of the company's evolution that I first wrote an article about the company on Seeking Alpha more than a year ago. Would that all of my recommendations perform in that fashion - and essentially for reasons that were far different than the evolution I thought most likely back then. The shares are up more than 90%, and, primarily as a result of the transaction, EPS, which was $.35 in Q1 2016, is now expected to be $.74.But the real question for investors and those writing articles is really now what? The company has pivoted its business so that while profitability is far greater than it has been and is expected to go higher still, percentage growth is likely to be far less than the LogMeIn of a year ago. What is the magnitude of the transaction's accretion likely to be and over how long does that scenario play out? And what about the rest of the business and all of the other opportunities I was looking at a year ago?Will this company have the ability to manage such a large and diverse portfolio without a few mis-steps along the way? In some ways, the company has returned to its roots with the combination of the two leading remote access products. But in other ways, it continues to offer a variety of different solutions in different markets.I last commented about the name shortly before its initial report as a combined entity. The shares are essentially unchanged since then and have underperformed the software index by a few percentage points. In reviewing expectations and company commentary, I have come to the conclusion that there are serious risks, not reflected in current valuation, in terms of the company's ability to achieve double-digit organic top line growth.While the capital allocation strategy that has been announced is a positive for some investors, it is really not of a magnitude to move the meter. At this point, the future of the company's core solutions is not known and how it will deal with directly competitive products still remains a mystery. It seems unlikely that it will continue to sell everything it currently offers, and yet the impact of eliminating products is unknown and not forecast.The company has an analyst day upcoming sometime in the third quarter - presumably in September that might clarify the product and investment roadmap. But I suggest, given the valuation and the material risks I see in operating this business, that investors stay away. That does not mean I believe that the company missed the quarter it will report in May.I do not think that will be the case. But I wonder about guidance and I wonder when the impacts of trying to compete with itself in selling its core solutions will start to impact operational performance. At this point, there are many less exposed names that offer equal or greater growth for a lower price.The trouble with TAMsI write about TAMs all of the time. What other metric is so useful in describing the runway available to a vendor? Small revenues, large TAM = strong growth opportunities. And, of course, the reverse is true. But while the use of TAMs can provide cover for conclusions that an author wants to draw, the fact is that the metric is very subjective. During the last conference call, LOGM management talked about a $30 billion TAM with a CAGR of 9% overall for the company's markets.The largest part of this company's TAM are its assets in the remote collaboration space and the company has a strategy to be a major player in the Unified Communications and Collaboration (UCC) space. But the company really does not play in the UCC space as most people think of it. I don't really think this is a matter of semantics. I think it goes to the heart of the issue of the company's runway and how it will ultimately deal with the problems inherent in having two key products compete with each other.Currently, the company has two apps, JoinMe and Go to Meeting, that facilitate web conferencing. It is really the heart of the new company contributing more than 50% of the revenues of the new organization. The set of solutions included here also includes OpenVoice, which is a conference call service that Citrix offered. And it includes an app called Grasshopper, which is a service for small businesses that serves as a virtual switchboard. I am not sure to what extent it can be said that LOGM is a participant in the UCC space or that its growth rate is going to be materially impacted by the evolution of UCC offerings.Precisely how and when LOGM becomes a real player in UCC is not something that is particularly easy to determine. It obviously has bits and pieces of a solution - but not a unified solution. How and when it is going to integrate its offerings is not immediately clear.The simple part of the merger is going to be the elimination of duplicative facilities. Real estate and sales team integration are obvious opportunities that will almost certainly be realized. Over time, the company will be able to eliminate duplicate sales and marketing expenses. Based on past experience, with similar kinds of mergers, the cost synergies that will be developed are likely to exceed the company's current forecast.The real issue as I see it isn't cost synergies but what is going to happen to the two competitive nameplates in the market. The question of which solution will survive has not yet been articulated. And a further question is going to be how the users of one service or the other will react to being ""orphaned"" so to speak. Will they investigate competitive alternatives such as Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) or even Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Chime (NASDAQ:AMZN) should that really become a focus for AWS?These days management says its focus is on the SMB space in terms of web conferencing. But how large is that space and how does it relate to a $14 billion TAM? In fact, the TAM for what LOGM currently does is far smaller - web conferencing is said to be only a $2.4 billion market in which much of LOGM's growth had been coming from competitive inroads into Citrix GoTo offerings.The UCC space is flooded with competitors of all shapes and sizes with all kinds of solutions. Trying to pivot from being a supplier of web conferencing services to something much more complex and competitive is not something to be undertaken lightly or with any overwhelming expectation of success.About 25% of LOGM's revenue is derived from what it describes as remote access tools. To an extent this is a ""grab-bag"" category but it has some of the same issues in terms of TAM that are true for Web Conferencing. But re-naming the space in order to develop a large and growing TAM is essentially the same as pouring old wine into new bottles. It really doesn't make the wine taste better or provide a better user experience.The company describes its offerings as part of the cloud-based identity management market to develop a TAM of $6 billion for the space. But I am just not sure that I understand what the deliverable is going to be that can be called cloud-based identity management. And even more to the point, how the deliverable, if there will be one, can compete with a flood of point players in the space that are identified here, is not apparent.The solutions that are offered by LOGM in this business area are hoary to say the least and rival this author in terms of antiquity. But at the moment, LOGM offers its own pay version of LogMeIn and GoTo is the Citrix equivalent. It seems almost self-evident that part of the consolidation process has to be that one or the other of these offerings needs to reach its sunset and enjoy a well-deserved retirement. It has been years since these services were generators of growth and additional engagement.The other components of this space are Central and LastPass. Central is a service that has been around for many years now and offers users a technology that automates the deployment, monitoring, search, sharing remote print and multi-monitor display features. It is widely installed and just as widely copied. LastPass is a service that LOGM acquired a bit less than two years ago.It is, as the name suggests, a service for the management of passwords. It is a basic tool that allows users to enhance security by making sure that passwords are given to authorized users and are not borrowed or otherwise mis-appropriated. Like the other products offered by LOGM, LastPass is sold using a freemium model and it competes against many other similar services.Identity and access management is a broad category with a large TAM. Depending on the precise definition used, some market research firms say it is larger than the $6 billion used by LOGM in its presentation. And the market researchers say that the space has a CAGR of 13%. And for sure, some of the products that are offered by LOGM are in the space - but its largest revenue contributor, remote access, has long since ceased to be a growth opportunity and has been saturated for some years now.Again, the devil here is in the details. If LOGM had a product road map that was going to produce an integrated solution that would vie for leadership in the access management space, it would at least represent an analysis and handicapping. But that is simply not the case at the moment. Market researchers look at the space and identify 20 or 30 vendors - but sadly no mention is made of LOGM. It has either to improve the new bottles or actually get some new wine with which to fill its bottles.The third area of the new company's business is currently focused on providing customers with a remote support capability. The products that LOGM sells are called Rescue and BoldChat. It also includes Xively, which is a messaging service for IoT applications. When Rescue and Chat were first launched, they were considered by many to be innovative and best of breed.And when the solutions became available, they essentially became a necessity in many enterprises. Probably most readers have used either or both apps at one point or another. There are very few help desks in the enterprise world that do not offer some kind of remote support and chat has become equally ubiquitous.But again, the company has suggested that it will pivot from supplying point solutions to becoming a factor in the customer engagement space. After all, a TAM of $2.6 billion - the current metric is not exciting while a TAM of $14 billion, which is the current size of customer engagement space, may beguile some.It is not entirely apparent as to what the company's specific product road map might be to move to becoming a real competitor in the customer engagement space. It isn't too surprising that LOGM might want to rename what it plans to do in the space as Customer Engagement but describing the solutions it offers as customer engagement... I will leave readers to insert the hyperbole.As one can see, there are literally dozens of specific solutions that compete with Rescue and with BoldChat. These days, most industry analysts seem to think that Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) is the leader in the chat support space. Rescue may still be the leader in the remote IT support space - but that is not a growth market these days.The customer engagement market is no doubt large and growing in double digits according to most industry analysts. It sounds like it would be a good space in which to be - but it is not evident, at least to this writer, that LOGM is part of the conversation.Gartner says its definition of customer engagement is a market of $26 billion that is growing at 12%. The report linked here says that there are no fewer than 404 vendors engaged in customer engagement of one kind or the other - just not LogMeIn. The report linked here identifies more than 330 vendors offering chat solutions. I'm not even sure that I know how LOGM could pivot and integrate Rescue and BoldChat so they might become growth engines in the customer engagement space.What I can see happening is for the company to eliminate duplicative offerings that are its inheritance from its parents. What I certainly do not know is what the company's road map might be to develop an offering that either competes more effectively within the crowded markets it already serves or pivots the set of offering so that it really does have at least a shot of being considered a vendor in the customer engagement space. Paraphrasing Dr. Johnson, and his often quoted commentary regarding patriotism, the mis-use of TAMs is the last refuge of management, they are excessively promotional.If LOGM doesn't turn out to be a growth company, does it matter?It is a bit difficult to assign valuation metrics for a company such as this that in the midst of putting together the elements of integration. The current First Call consensus revenue forecast implies that there will be limited organic revenue growth this year based on the run rate analysts are projecting of $260 million in revenue for the June quarter (the spin-merger transaction was finalized on 1/31/17). Last year, on a pro-forma basis, revenue for the combined business that makes up the new entity was $1.020 billion.During the course of the conference call, management said that the company's products are targeting markets with a combined addressable opportunity approaching $30 billion and with a combined aggregate CAGR of 9%. With all respect to this management, and the fantastic transaction, which it has engineered, I think that such an assertion is being more than a bit economical with the truth. The TAM for the product sets that LOGM sells currently would appear to be just more than 10% of the TAM it aspires to address. it would be surprising if the aggregate CAGR in the company's current spaces is as much as mid-single digits.How the company is going to address a TAM of $30 billion as opposed to $3.5 billion is not immediately apparent. Yes, I can read the same words on a chart that everyone else can. But what specifically does it mean to ""leverage voice, screen sharing, video and chat capabilities to broaden collaboration offerings?"" What is the deliverable that the company plans to introduce? What precisely does it mean to ""capitalize on convergence of customer support and service by delivering unified capabilities?"" What are users going to buy or subscribe that will be offered by LogMeIn? It isn't apparent, at least at this time.Further, it is simply hard to see how or why the company would want to continue to support duplicate/competitive nameplates that it now owns. Which will survive - JoinMe or GoTo Meeting? How will the company really be able to continue to sell both of those products both simultaneously and effectively? And when it chooses one or the other as I think is more or less inevitable, how much might the revenue loss be? When all is said and done, I think that there are cost synergies significantly beyond the $100 million forecast by the company at this point.But I think that even with the cross-selling opportunities, it is logical to expect that dropping duplicative products will have some impact on reported revenue growthAt the moment, analysts are giving this management the benefit of the doubt and are forecasting that revenue will grow by a bit more than 10% organically in 2018. (Again, that is adjusted for the month this year before the merger was consummated). For that to happen, the company will most likely have to continue to achieve strong growth within its collaboration portfolio.I simply do not think there is much growth to be had in selling Go To My PC or LastPass. But how LogMeIn might be able to take two very similar products that it offers to the same group of prospects at the same time is something that baffles me. And exactly how the company is going to deal with all of its other duplicative products that it now offers is equally unclear.I think that this company's current valuation is very much a function of expectations that it will be able to achieve its aspirational goal of 10% growth as soon as 2018. But I think the odds of that actually happening are less than many investors currently realize.ValuationLogMeIn for all of the years that I have known of it and followed it has been something of a growth story. Some years ago, it was one of the pioneers amongst companies that leased their solutions. Back then, the company was perceived as being part of the universe of hyper-growth names developing amongst vendors that led their software as a service.Along the way, it ran into a couple of speed bumps related to its freemium marketing model and its pitfalls and some changes to its product strategy that led to disappointing guidance for some period. The company also had some difficulties with being able to consistently grow Central and Rescue revenues at consistent levels.The company, prior to the recent transaction, had developed a financial model that related to strong profitability and decent growth rates. It was in that context that the company's shares were valued before the impact of the transaction became the driving factor in the company's valuation. The company would typically forecast 20% top line growth, CFFO margins above 30%, and most of the time the company expected to see a pattern of rising margins.It currently foresees a 10% growth cadence after the current year with rising margins and an adjusted free cash flow margin of 25%. I do not buy into the 10% CAGR for the reasons cited above but I think the company's margin goals are very attainable.The company has begun what it describes as a disciplined capital allocation program in which more than 50% of the company's free cash flow will be returned to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. The balance of free cash flow is to be used for strategic M&A. The dividend rate on the shares is less than 1%, but it does represent a change from prior cash return strategy.The company has an outstanding share count of about 52 million in the wake of the merger. Yesterday's closing price of $103/share thus produces a market capitalization of $5.35 billion. The company's full-year expectation for revenue, including the one-month contribution of GoTo prior to the acquisition, is about $1.06 billion. So that represents an EV/S of a bit more than 5X, certainly a rather elevated metric for 10% growth.The company is forecasting non-GAAP EPS of $3.73 at the midpoint. That level of EPS would result in a P/E of 28X. The company is forecasting that stock-based comp will be $73 million or $1.40 in EPS. Last year, looking at the ""old"" LogMeIn, stock-based comp was noticeable and rising rapidly. Overall stock-based comp came to 12.5% of revenues last quarter and it represented 50% of reported non-GAAP EPS. In the prior year, stock-based comp had been 10% of revenues and had been 36% of non-GAAP EPS.It is perhaps worth noting that prior to the announcement of the spin-merger transaction, the company had experienced a noticeable acceleration in operating expenses looked at on a GAAP basis. That trend was halted in Q4 as the company prudently chose to delay expenses in sales and marketing and research and development. I think it is fair to observe that the operating metrics of the ""old"" LogMeIn were under some degree of stress and challenge prior to the announcement of the transaction.As mentioned, the company is forecasting a free cash flow margin of 25%. Last year, for what it is worth, the company's free cash flow margin was 23%. Overall, the company is projecting that free cash flow will be about $260 million. That would be a free cash flow yield of 4.85%. Last year, a little less than 50% of the company's free cash flow was derived from stock-based comp. This year the company is projecting that stock-based comp will be 28% of free cash flow.The decline in the contribution of free cash flow to earnings and EPS is more apparent than real. Last year the company had major costs in conjunction with preparations for the spin-merger transactions. This reduced reported non-GAAP EPS and CFFO below ""normalized levels"" and was partially responsible for the outsize contribution of stock-based comp.It is hard to find a basis for suggesting that LogMeIn shares are a great bargain using company projections. Given my own concerns that the company's top line growth forecast may prove difficult to realize, valuation is more than a bit extended. Bulls on the name, and there are more of those than analysts expressing caution, believe that the company's analyst meeting scheduled for some time in Q3 will make the growth strategy clear. I think that it is a bit more rope than I would be willing to provide this company, given its current valuation. I do not think that the risk/rewards favor investors at this point."
4138056,104119,2018-01-17T11:53:20-05:00,"Research indicates that high P/Es don't necessarily lead to high growth. This may pose a problem for LOGM investors.LOGM is ambitiously priced relative to its historical earnings growth.With a current P/E of 1101.36 and a forward P/E of 24.72, that means that LOGM has a forecasted growth rate of ~4,300%.","LogMeIn (LOGM) makes a leading remote access and file-sharing software for professionals and home users. LOGM caught my attention because it is very highly valued on a P/E basis. Even though it appears to me that P/E has fallen out of favor with some due to its ubiquitousness, I believe it is useful to remind ourselves of how very critical it is.As the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City reports:They found a worse relationship regarding higher P/E ratios and stock price appreciation, where high P/Es were followed by lower stock price appreciation during the subsequent decade:P/E ratio and stock price growth in the following 10 years. Source: Kansas City Fed.In my opinion, if paying more for earnings doesn't correlate with increased earnings or stock growth in the future - in fact, higher ratios are negatively correlated with price appreciation - then it's better not to overpay for each dollar of earnings.That brings us to LOGM. Right now, its P/E is at 1109.55, 21 times the industry average P/E (51.67). That means that, for its P/E to fall back down to the industry average, either LOGM's stock will have to fall significantly or its earnings will have to increase. As we now know, it may not be worth overpaying for earnings, as the Kansas City Fed shows that high P/Es don't necessarily pay off with higher growth or price appreciation in the future - and LOGM's P/E is significantly higher than industry norms.Let's investigate its earnings.Indeed, LOGM has had some significant sales increases over the last trailing twelve months. The problem is that these sales increases haven't led to an increase in its earnings.This leads to the natural question: If huge increases in sales haven't led to increases in earnings, what will? The situation gets worse when we consider that LOGM's TTM revenue and TTM income are actually negatively correlated, with a negative correlation of -0.37 (a slight improvement from July 2017, when its sales and earnings were negatively correlated to a tune of -0.68).Why is LOGM's net income so consistently low? Because, among other things, its SG&A and COGS increase in tandem with its sales.A scalable company maintains or increases its level of performance profit and efficiency margins as sales volumes increase. With a negative operational margin (-3.09%) and low profit margin (3.68%) (YCharts), it seems to me that LOGM has a current problem with its scalability.LOGM's profitability problem may be, in part, a function of SG&A and COGS increasing in tandem with sales.Source: YCharts.Over the period captured above, sales are up 229%, while COGS is up 412% and SG&A is up 165%. What this says to me is that LOGM is not scalable in its current form. More sales meant equal or greater COGS.To that point, its sales are correlated with SG&A to a point of 0.993, with sales and COGS at a correlation of 0.998 (calculated using YCharts). In my opinion, this is troubling for investors, as it may mean that, without any non-sales staffing cutbacks, it will be a challenge for LOGM to translate future sales growth into profits for investors.LOGM may be one of the best remote access programs out there, with generally favorable reviews. They're not all positive, with complaints of rapid price increases from some of its customer leading to some pissed off consumers. Regardless, even if this were the best program in the world, with not a peep of criticism, I would still recommend investors avoid it until it shows some significant bottom line improvement. With a current P/E of 1101.36 and a forward P/E of 24.72, that means that, holding all else constant, LOGM has a forecasted growth rate of ~4,300% (author's calculation).To me, this indicates that the market is being excessively optimistic in regards to LOGM's future earnings - especially in light of its earnings growth to date. In my opinion, in light of LOGM's current stagnant earnings growth vis-a-vis its sales, such an optimistic growth rate is unwarranted, and investors would be wise to avoid it."

In any event, the deal was likely valued on a ‘team and technology’ basis, and given the current high demand for artificial intelligence-enabled technologies, the price appears to be not unreasonable.As of June 30, 2017, LogMeIn had $285 million in cash and marketable securities and total liabilities of $845.6 million, which included deferred tax liabilities of $388.3 million.The company generated $192.8 million in cash flow from operations for the six months ended June 30, 2017, so combined with its cash position, the firm had ample financial resources to pay the approximately $50 million in total cash compensation for the acquisition.LogMeIn acquired Nanorep to bolster its intelligent customer engagement platform, Bold360. This system provides a combination of real-time personalization, intelligent automation and channel optimization that follows customer transitions from one communications channel to another.As LogMeIn CEO Bill Wagner stated in the deal announcement,LogMeIn wants to expand its presence in the customer engagement market, so has acquired Nanorep to help clients improve their customer service and increase customer engagement, thereby improving brand loyalty.I agree with LogMeIn’s management and concur on their acquisition of Nanorep.

4046851,24992,2017-02-16T15:15:55-05:00,Stock is trading at 13x the S&P 500.Miraculous results needed over next 12 months to justify share price.Company suffers from rising revenues but flat net income syndrome.ChartMasterPro downward target price of $80.00.,"Shares of LogMeIn Inc (NASDAQ:LOGM) are up about 98% over the past 12 months and in this article I'm going to suggest reasons why it makes sense for current shareholders to sell and other investors to avoid the stock at these levels.There are a few reasons for this. There's a very weak correlation between revenue and net income, which prompts the question: if rising revenues can't generate the source of sustainable shareholder returns, what can? In addition, the stock is morbidly overpriced. I'll be modeling the assumptions built into price, and forecast what has to happen to bring this company to a point where it's simply twice the value of the overall market.For those who don't want to get into the weeds, I'll jump right to the end. Holding all else constant, in order for LogMeIn to become simply ""badly overpriced,"" it would need to grow revenues about nine fold (that 900%!). Smart acquisitions aside, this would be a miraculous result, and I don't recommend relying on miracles as a sound investment strategy.Modeling What Is Required for a ""Cheap"" 50 Times MultipleLogMeIn's net income turned positive in Q3, 2008, and over the next four quarters it earned approximately $5.7 million. As of the most recent four quarters, the company earned $7.02 million. Additionally, net income has been quite volatile since then. This volatility makes modeling the company challenging, but I'll try it by holding all else constant and asking the question: what will have to happen to revenue in order to bring EPS to a point where the shares are twice the current S&P 500 PE? Given the historical margin of about 2%, in order to bring this company to a point where it would be simply ""very expensive"" (at twice the current market multiple), revenue would need to increase about nine-fold.Weak Correlation Between Revenue And Net IncomeThe nine months ending September 2016 relative to the same period in 2015 highlight one of the principle difficulties with LogMeIn. While revenue increased about 27% from 2015 to the same period in 2016, net income actually fell.This isn't an aberration as demonstrated by the following graph that plots the relationship revenue and net income at LogMeIn. Do you notice the seeming disconnect between rising revenue and flat net income? People who do data analysis visually deserve the junk they get, so I actually ran a correlation on these two functions and have found, unsurprisingly, a very weak correlation between the two. The coefficient of correlation is only equal to about r=.205, and the slope (amount of change in y per unit increase in x) is only about .02. Finally, the coefficient of determination is only about 4%, which means that only about 4% of the variation in net income is explained by the variation in revenue. So the bottom line is that revenue is growing very robustly, but the company has a demonstrated inability to turn those rising revenues into net income. Net income is what compensates investors. Net income is the source of sustainable stock buybacks, growing book value and dividends.The StockThe stock is obviously very expensive relative to the overall market as it's trading for approximately 13 times the S&P 500. It's also expensive to its own history.Technical SnapshotThe shares are currently testing the $95.00 support level which has held since December 2016. As you know, we like to anticipate technical signals if our fundamental analysis supports what we see on the charts. We believe that the $95.00 support level will not hold and that the shares will drop to the $80.00 over the next six months.Today we will buy the LOGM 16JUN17 89 Put Options which will provide us with approximately 5x leverage on our short trade. Our initial stop-loss exit signal will be a daily close above $97.50.For investors in the shares we recommend you sell to avoid any further decline in the share price.ConclusionThe technology here is interesting, and some of the acquisitions have been intelligent and should bear fruit for years to come. The difficulty is that all of the good news and more has already been baked into the stock price. If the company continues to execute well, the shares may not move much as expectations are already high. If the company missteps slightly over the next few years, the shares will get hammered. Thus, there is a negatively skewed risk reward here and I strongly recommend current investors sell and others avoid LogMeIn."
3892616,98236,2016-02-12T14:08:32-05:00,LOGM announced a strong Q4 with beats on both the top line and bottom line.LOGM's guidance disappointed with Q1 EPS forecast to be $.30 vs. a prior consensus estimate of $.38.An objective analysis of guidance suggests that it is exceptionally conservative and is likely to be readily exceeded.The company has had a long history of providing conservative guidance that it subsequently beats significantly - and that was actually the case in 2015.The company appears to be enjoying exceptional traction with a couple of its growth initiatives including Join.me and BoldChat that should enable 20% top line growth.,"Introduction and Recap of 2015 FinancialsLogMeIn (NASDAQ:LOGM) announced the results of its fiscal Q4 that ended 12/31 and its 2015 year after the market closed on February 11th, 2016. The results were a significant beat on both the top and the bottom line. Revenue growth for the quarter came in at 27%, significantly faster than any other quarter during the course of 2015 and a strong result when compared to Q4 2014 when revenues were up by 33%. Some of the growth increase was the result of LOGM purchasing LastPass October 9, 2015. LastPass probably added about 7%-8% of revenues incrementally - it is a bit difficult to determine because of the impact the acquisition had on the company's legacy identity management solution.EPS was $.51, a beat of $.04 from prior expectations and up by almost 50% from the prior year. Operating cash flow was $14 million, mildly disappointing when compared to cash flow of $15 million in Q4 of 2014. Deferred revenues of $137 million were flat compared with Q3 but up 30% compared to Q4 of 2015. The acquisition of LastPass added about $7-$8 million of deferred revenues - the organic growth in the metric was about 23%. Historically, deferred revenues growth for LOGM is greatest at the start of the year in the wake of strong contract renewals that are signed at the end of each year. This tends to seasonally weight cash flow as well into Q1 when it has been significantly greater than 50% of total revenues.Cash at the end of the quarter was $208 million, down from $246 million at the end of Q3 but up from $201 million at the end of the prior year. All of the decline was a function of the LastPass acquisition which cost the company $110 million at the time of the closing in October. LastPass is a crucial component of the company's strategy in the identity management space. There had been some concern expressed by a cohort of LastPass users that LOGM would hike the price which had stood at all of $12/user/year or $120/for a 10-year deal. It is likely that over time, LastPass will be integrated into other LOGM offerings, and that its new pricing will eliminate some of the anomalous pricing the company had been offering. The fact is that LastPass remains dramatically cheaper than most of the alternative solutions and users who like the functionality are going to pay for the revised pricing.Obviously the company achieved strong results for the quarter exceeding expectations for most critical metrics. The company does not provide an explicit bookings metric and given the nature of most of what it sells, the revenue attainment provides a realistic view of the company's business during the quarter. The fact that Q4 revenues grew significantly faster than any other quarter during the past year is significant - there was no evidence that the momentum of the company's remote meeting product, Join.me has abated - it apparently grew about 40% during the quarter and the company has apparently enjoyed some renewed traction from its remote access maintenance products. Concerns voiced by some that the company's price increases and its tweaks to the"" Fermium"" model might have a negative impact on users seem to be ill-founded at this point.Margins both for the year and the quarter were reasonably strong. EBITDA margins for the quarter, which is what this company focuses on, reached 27.5%, a bit above the guidance range. GAAP cash flow for the year was 25% of revenues.Guidance - An Old Story in Slightly Different Clothes!The headline from Briefing.com shouts that LogMeIn issued mixed guidance for Q1 with revenues guided above the consensus and EPS significantly less than prior expectations. The company is guiding to EPS of $.30 - the consensus forecast had been $.38. For the full year, revenue guidance is slightly above prior expectations with EPS close to prior expectations. Revenues at the mid-point of guidance are expected to be $324 million with EPS at $1.74. I think it's worth pointing out that at this time last year the company forecast 19% full-year revenue growth, 22% EBITDA margins and $1.34 in EPS. The company printed EPS surprises every quarter last year with Q1 EPS reaching 22% above guidance, the greatest surprise of the year. As a result of the guidance, the shares are down about 12% this morning and that is in the wake of their 38% drop since the start of the year.I think that it's a mistake to take any company's guidance as gospel. Obviously, no one outside of a company has the ability to look at internal forecasts and evaluate the sources of those forecasts but there are such things as testing for how reasonable the forecasts are in the context of what is actually known. For one thing, this company has had a history of significantly underestimating EPS, sometimes by extreme amounts. The divergence, for those with memories of the intermediate past, was greatest in 2012 which destroyed the stock at that time until the consensus finally caught up to the numbers that the company was achieving. But it would be prudent to simply dissect some parts of guidance and test for likelihood.The company is forecasting growth of $53 million in revenues for the year and yet it is going to enjoy more than a $20 million bump from the acquisition of LastPass. The business area that it calls Collaboration Cloud, which is one-third of total revenues, grew 40% last quarter and there were no acquisition - that was all organic growth and was greater than any other quarter in the year. Even the company's laggard business area, Service Cloud, was up 9%. Self-evidently, and even taking a small amount of FX headwind into account, the numbers just don't seem to add up. If the Collaboration Cloud grows at 30%, which would be down considerably from 2015 growth rates, it would mean that the rest of the business was growing at negligible rates - and that seems quite inconsistent with management commentary about the success the company was having with some products such as Rescue and BoldChat. It would be really difficult for the company to double revenues over the next 3-4 years, which is the CEO's reaffirmed goal, if the first year was to have organic revenue growth of barely 10%.The company's margin expectations also seems to be a bit more conservative than seems reasonable from other management commentary. The company had full-year EBITDA margins of 22% in 2015. It is forecasting that Q1 EBITDA margins will be 18%-19% and that ""EBITDA margins will grow considerably during the year."" And yet full-year earnings guidance, at the top of the range, is just 7% above the level that was achieved in 2015. Not to put too fine a point on it, but it seems as though the company is really expecting to grow EBITDA margins and that is simply not consistent with an EPS forecast just 7% greater than was achieved in 2015.I think it would be very easy to put together a scenario that suggests that the company achieves 20% organic growth for the year plus $20 million of growth from its acquisition of LastPass which would bring total revenues to $335-$340 million, and if margins do no better than maintain their levels of 2015 that would presumably yield EPS of greater than $2.00 with concomitant improvements in cash flow and free cash flow. No one would ever publish those kinds of numbers and given the format for my articles, neither will I. But I think investors ought to expect that LOGM will achieve dramatically better financial performance this year as it has much of the time in the recent past, particularly when compared to what are likely to prove to be modest consensus expectations.Some Comments on the CommentsWhen I wrote about this company a few weeks ago, I tried to cover many of the key product initiatives that were likely to animate growth. I will just focus on a couple of specifics that were highlighted during the conference call. The company's hottest product continues to be Join.me which is software that facilitates remote meetings. Join.me is now 10% of total LogMeIn revenues and has apparently maintained growth above 40%. Last year the company added a video capability and it has just added a new operator's console. Obviously video is a huge boon if a user wants to conduct a remote meeting. Most remote meetings feature charts and graphs and being able to see them on video is a substantial benefit for most users. I can't really speak about the benefits of a new console but one assumes that LOGM incorporated lots of suggestions from its users in an effort to improve ease of use and enhancing intuitive capabilities.But underlying everything, the fact is that facilitating remote meetings is simply a strong market opportunity and will be so for years into the future. The savings in both cost and time of holding remote meetings that eliminate travel and allow the economical engagement of more users is hard to quantify. But it has been seen as enormous almost from the time it was pioneered a few years ago. I'm really not qualified to evaluate the benefits of Join.me vis-à-vis either Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO) WebEx or Go to Meeting by Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS). I'm sure there are those who use the different products who have strong preferences one way or the other. But one fact is hard to challenge and that is that Join.me is dramatically cheaper than either of its two competitors and given its current market share the idea that either of them is going to launch a price war to squash this company does not seem well grounded. I might also suggest that with the impending split of the Citrix, the parent of Go to Meeting, it seems unlikely that the company is likely to take any significant competitive initiatives in the near term.The company CEO also highlighted its Bold software and BoldChat products. I think most readers have had interactions with customer service representatives over the web and in real time. No one really enjoys talking to a machine - even the most intelligent voice response systems are still based on speaking with non-humans. The specifics of the paybacks for using Live Chat are startling according to industry analysts. There is supposedly some huge increase in conversions, a dramatic decrease in transaction costs and a substantial increase in transaction size. The major competitor in the space is a company called LivePerson (NASDAQ:LPSN). The latest results for LivePerson suggest that it has essentially stopped growing, so it seems likely that BoldChat is a market share gainer of some magnitude. LOGM plans to introduce video this year, which I think will make Chat more useful for many consumers like this writer and the CEO talked about the integration of Bold with mobile devices which is clearly an important market trend. Again, it is hard for me to do much more than comment on the numbers - LivePerson revenue growth has stalled and LogMeIn revenues in the space are growing smartly.ValuationWhatever else is true, it is evident that almost all companies with cloud products and companies that had high valuations have seen much of those valuation premiums melt as quickly as an ice cream cone under a July sun. I'm going to use the current price of about $39/share as I write this in most of my calculations and I won't try to go off the reservation by talking about what I think are a more reasonable set of expectations. For the record, the company's shares are now selling at 3.1 EV/S with a P/E on forward earnings of 22X. The company is forecasting adjusted EBITDA of about $78 million. At that level, the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to enterprise value is less than 10X which is quite low for a company growing at 20% or more on the top line. I would guess that under the scenario that can be projected relatively to top growth and margins, that cash flow from operations would be in the order of $99 million although a significant part of that is coming from stock-based compensation.Overall, with the recent profound stock price haircut, the shares are selling at exceptionally reasonable levels, particularly if the company can maintain the level of top line growth that management spoke to during the conference call.Summary:LogMeIn printed another solid quarter that actually saw an acceleration in growth from the levels achieved earlier in 2015. The company offered guidance that some find displeasing and the shares have declined noticeably in today's trading. It is my belief that the guidance will prove to be quite conservative based on my deconstruction of company revenue trends and some look at the company's historical performance. The company continues to make progress in its IoT initiatives that it hopes to integrate with the offerings of 3rd parties such as Dassault (OTCPK:DASTY) as well as its own Rescue and Bold set of solutions. The company has many opportunities to rationalize pricing and packaging in order to enhance revenues and deliver a better congruence of value versus price to its customers. I think that the balance of risks and rewards clearly favors investors significantly in the wake of an almost 40% share price pullback in the first six weeks of 2016."
3559386,78265,2015-10-08T10:10:19-04:00,"With a P/E of 210.67 and forward P/E of 39.59, LOGM has a one-year price-implied expected earnings growth rate of 430%.And receding margins. And a inconsistent history of earnings surprises. And a negative correlation between revenue and net income (-.404 for you math nerds out there).We can't predict the future, but we know that optimism in stock valuations is a raw deal for investors. Avoid.","We're humble enough to admit that we can't predict the future. Many things can cause an overvalued stock to crash. We don't try to be great prognosticators, and we advise against relying on analyses that make too many predictions about the future. Most predictions fail, with the average ""expert"" only slightly more accurate than dart-throwing chimps.So it stands to reason that we really don't like predictions when those predictions are overly-optimistic (or pessimistic). We find that being overly bullish - or overly bearish - in a prediction interferes with objectivity, with bullish investors only seeing the good, and bearish investors clinging to the bad. In our opinion, both offer predictably poor results to investors.When we encounter optimistic priced-implied earnings expectations, we get really nervous. Optimism makes us nervous because there are so many ways that that optimism can be displaced, with high valuations as unstable as Sornette's ruler balanced on a finger. The unstable position caused by that optimistic valuation is the source of instability. It's not like a specific event like one bad quarter, or a bad acquisition etc. creates the instability. Collapse comes because the price itself is unsustainable. A potential poor earnings announcement is the catalyst we use to explain the collapse after the event. We can't predict when something that's optimistically priced will drop, but it will happen. It's a matter of ""when"" and not ""if."" In our view, that's a bad trade for investors, one that maximizes downside and limits upside.LogMein (NASDAQ:LOGM) is one such optimistically-priced company. LOGM is a provider of cloud-based services, with products that include LogMeIn Backup, LogMeIn Hamachi, AppGuru, BoldChat, and Cubby.One of the ways we can judge the optimism of the market is to compare the current and the forward P/E multiples. If the forward P/E is too low, that may be a sign that the market is too optimistic about the company's immediate future. LOGM, with a P/E of 210.67 and forward P/E of 39.59, has a one-year price-implied expected growth rate of 430%. We believe that earnings forecast is too optimistic for this company, especially in light of the history of inconsistent earnings surprises at the firm.Source: Zacks.comConsider the scenarios:It's not all terrible, though. The company has lots of cash and little debt. The problem is that its margins have been in decline the last five years, with ROA down -80.2%, ROE down -74.3%, operating margin down -82%, and profit margin down -83.5% (all TTM, YCharts). Further, LOGM has failed to turn its growing revenue into growing profitability for shareholders. We ran a correlation analysis on revenue and net income over the past five years and found a negative (?!) correlation of about -.404 between the two. If rising revenues won't generate net income (the source of sustainable shareholder wealth), what will?Investors, we consider LOGM's diminishing margins + failure to turn growing revenue into growing profits + a checkered history of missed earnings + high valuation + high price-implied expectations to be a toxic mixture. Taken alone, they are each a reason to give pause to the stock. Combined, they represent a very high level of risk to shareholders. Avoid."
4040151,98236,2017-01-27T11:34:59-05:00,"LogMeIn's spin merger transaction in which it is acquiring the GoTo assets of Citrix will be finalized on January 31st.The shares have had a strong run as investors have come to appreciate the strong accretion the transaction means for current LOGM shareholders.At current prices, further significant appreciation seems far less likely and it would not surprise me to see the shares pressured when the company offers initial guidance.While the transaction offers significant and substantial financial accretion, it provides challenges in terms of redefining LOGM as a growth business. I believe it is time to reduce LOGM commitments.The time scale for success in that endeavor is certainly more likely measured in years more than quarters and carries a significant level of risk.","LogMeIn-Even shooting stars can burn outThe stock market is toppy, frothy, ripe for a correction. One way I know that is when I see some of my older recommendations such as LogMein (NASDAQ:LOGM) appreciate beyond what I had expected. The shares have soared beyond my fondest expectation and no longer represent the value I have seen over the past year. I believe that the spin-merger transaction in which LOGM is acquiring the ""GoTo"" businesses of Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS) will prove to be a great transaction in terms of financial accretion. I feel confident, as well, that the cost synergies that have been forecast will be exceeded. But at the end of the day, much of the new company is going to be made of assets that have limited growth opportunities. LOGM shares, in the wake of its recent appreciation, are priced as though it will be able to achieve consistent growth at levels comparable to past rates. That is simply not going to happen. I think investors might do well to take profits here and revisit the name should the current valuation prove to be ephemeral.I initially wrote about LogMeIn on this site a bit more than a year ago. The shares have appreciated by 82% since that time, compared to the IGV index which has increased by 16% over the same span. In the wake of the company's announcement of its transaction with Citrix, I commented that the deal was a great opportunity for LOGM and so it remains. What has changed is the share price that has appreciated from $86 just after the announcement of the deal, to almost $110 as I write this Thursday morning. I would like to think that all of my recommendations would have similar track records but they do not and sadly will not.I have two purposes in writing this article. One of those is to suggest that investors might consider taking profits in LogMein at this point and move to the sidelines. The article is being written from the point of view of LOGM shareholders and of potential shareholders of the new company. Except as necessary, I am not going to comment on the quarter or the outlook recently announced by Citrix. I don't want to suggest that the outlook has dimmed in some way for the new LogMeIn, just that much of or perhaps all of the good news has been well disseminated and discounted.My other purpose is to try to take a look at what the combined business will be when it starts its life next Wednesday and what are its prospects. No one should imagine that such a complex transaction as this is will see all of the potential synergies realized on day 1. Combining two brands is a tricky undertaking, and to some extent this is a case, in size at least, of the mouse swallowing the cat.The Transaction ReviewedLogMeIn and the GoTo elements of Citrix are merging. The new company will have pro-forma revenues of just over $1 billion with 13% growth, a non-GAAP EBITDA margin of 29% and a 21% free cash flow margin. LOGM and CTXS shareholders will each own half of the new organization.In the most recent shareholder presentation, that was prepared for investors in support of the pending merger, management forecast that it would achieve cost synergies of $65 million in the current year and by an additional $35 million through the end of year two. Most of the savings is forecast to come from the consolidation sales and marketing function with other major synergies to be achieved in research and development, general and administrative and IT optimization.The company hasn't formally forecast revenues for the new organization although it is expecting that EBITDA margins will improve 600 basis points next year and that the free cash flow margin will reach 25%.Longer term, the company is expecting a CAGR of 10% with revenues reaching $1.35 billion by 2019 and with EBITDA at 39% of revenues along with a free cash flow margin that should improve along with the improvement in EBITDA margins. The new company is targeting to use more than half of the company's projected $250 million of free cash flow generation to provide for both dividends and share repurchase. Neither Citrix or LogMeIn have previously paid dividends but with far slower growth than heretofore, the new LOGM can afford to pay dividends.The new enterprise will wind up with the #2 position in the web conferencing space and will be the market leader in both remote access and remote support. The current TAM of the company's 3 segments is just $3.5 billion/annual revenue. In order for this merger to work over the next couple of years, it will be necessary for LOGM to pivot its sets of solutions to a much wider market with solutions that address Unified Communications/Collaboration, Identity and Access Management and Customer Service/Contact Centers. This will be an arduous and fraught undertaking and the scope of the task and its difficulty is perhaps under-appreciated by investors.The new senior management team will primarily come from the current LOGM business and the CEO and CFO of the new company are veterans of LOGM. Michael Simon, LOGM's founder will remain as Chairman. The merger is expected to become effective on 1/31/17What's the new company to look like both strategically and financially?LogMeIn has scheduled its Q4 conference call for the end of February at which time it will give specific guidance for the new business. Presumably the guidance is going to look a lot like the forecast provided in the road show. This company has a long history of providing very conservative guidance that often has a short-term negative impact on share values. More often than not, however, the subsequent results are far more pleasing to investors. In that regard, the company's forecast at the end of Q1 2016 was received quite negatively despite the strong results of the quarter that was being reported; ultimately, when Q2 results were reported, the financial results were a significant beat although the beat was overshadowed by the announcement of the spin-merger transaction. I would be surprised if the company's initial forecast was anything other than ultra conservative.The new outstanding share count is projected to be 54 million which would create a market capitalization for the shares of about $5.9 billion. At the end of the 3 rd quarter the company had a net cash balance of about $180 million. The merger agreement calls for the payment of $1.50 in cash to current LOGM shareholders, as well as a cash contribution of $25 million from Citrix to the new venture. $.50 of the dividend payment was made in Q3 and the balance will be paid half in Q4 and half immediately before the merger becomes effective.The Q4 and closing dividend payments will aggregate about $26 million. LOGM as a stand-alone business has been generating about $25 million/quarter in free cash flow. My guess is that the new company will start out its life with $230 million in cash and an enterprise value of $5.7 billion.I will assume for the moment that the company will forecast $1.1 billion in revenues for the current year and that indicates that the EV/S will be 5.6X. I think that is an extended valuation for a company that needs to dramatically reconstitute its parts and do so in a relatively constrained timescale. It's my opinion as well, that a cash balance of $200 million is far below a reasonable level of cash on the balance sheet. I don't know what will be done to increase cash balances; my guess, however, is that the capital structure may well engender a secondary share offering.As mentioned, the company has forecast an adjusted EBITDA margin as opposed to an earnings per share outlook. The company is likely to exclude the expenses of the merger transaction in its non-GAAP earnings. The major differences between adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP earnings are going to be taxes and depreciation. The company is currently accruing a tax rate of 32% and depreciation has been running at 6% of revenues.Last quarter the company achieved an adjusted EBITDA margin of 29% ($25 million) and reported non-GAAP EPS of $.56 ($14.7 million). The company's target EBITDA margin by 2018 is 39% based on the $100 million synergy plan. Because of the issues of timing, I imagine that the company will target an adjusted EBITDA margin for 2017 at 33%. Using the current tax rate and the same depreciation percentage yields an EPS estimate of just a bit greater than $3.30. That is a P/E of around 33X, again a somewhat elevated number for a company with a CAGR of 10% that is unlikely to be realized the first year or two of this combination.Management has forecast that the free cash flow margin for the combined company will be 25%. That seems unlikely as the current free cash flow margin is 29% and it was 36% in 2015. So, I will use a free cash flow expectation of 29% or $320 million for 2017. That is a free cash flow yield of about 5.7%. That is not a bad free cash flow yield but neither is it extraordinary. I think that much of the cash generated will be needed to enhance the balance sheet. Most enterprises are going to expect higher cash balances with an IT vendor than the level with which the new LOGM will start.With growth now forecast to be 10%, none of these valuation metrics presents some unusually attractive level. They are either stretched or in line. So, the question really is, are there revenue synergies that might create a company with a higher growth rate to better justify the new valuation metrics.The strategy of the pivotLogMeIn has always been a relatively complex company with many product offerings which have had different growth rates and different margin performances. Management chose to put some focus on developing an IoT offering rather early in the game. It offers a product called Rescue Lens which allows users to integrate their own apps into a platform that offers mobile video support. It offers remote maintenance capabilities in which centrally located personnel can ""rescue"" a PC or a mobile device, or can conduct a chat session with a user to trouble shoot problems. It is developing an offering that combines Chat and other IoT elements of its IoT platform called Xively which is supposed to become the latest and greatest support platform in the market. Its' Central and Last Pass offerings are part of a suite of solutions that the company categorizes as identify and access management products.Prior to the merger, the company's fastest growing product was JoinMe, a web based meeting service that was significantly undercutting the cost of GoTo Meeting, part of the now acquired solution that Citrix had offered.The company's service cloud includes the LogMeIn remote access product as well as Central and Rescue. It was 28% of revenues and growing at 7%. Much of the revenue from the Citrix GoTo products fall into that category although its GoTo meeting product is probably the absolute largest single revenue contributor. In Q4, the Citrix GoTo business produced $174 million of revenues up 5% from the year earlier level. So the math, in terms of a Q4/2016 snap shot, is that the new LOGM will have $206 million in revenues (71% of the total) growing at a bit less than 6% and it will have $83 million of revenues, (29% of the total) growing at 25%+. That is a blended growth rate of 11%. (Note that the above numbers are for respective Q4's combined-Q4's are typically the largest quarter of the year and so it is not appropriate to annualize the $174 million of revenue contribution reported by Citrix for GoTo in Q4.)Management has got a plethora of decisions to make and lots of risks in putting this merger together. Ultimately it is inevitable that it is going to kill some products, and rebrand others. The roadmap to do that is still more than a bit indeterminate at this point. It is clearly much simpler to forecast cost savings, which is mainly a function of specific management decisions, then it is to forecast revenues.Renewal rates in the space for both companies have been and are likely to remain at 75%. Is there a chance that some of the Citrix customers who pay significantly higher prices than LOGM customers choose to migrate now that the solutions are all coming from a single source?LOGM has been attempting to raise its prices for years now-will it be able to use the merger as an avenue to do so or are the ""ankle biters"" in this space too pervasive to try to maximize revenues. Is there a danger of cannibalization now that one company owns both of the major solutions in the space?LogMeIn has a variety of newer businesses that need lots of management care and attention to bring them to a more mature state. Does management have the bandwidth to run several high-velocity, nascent businesses and yet focus on realigning the company's core products to address the relevant market?I can't imagine that the new enterprise will not seek to kill some of the older, slower selling components of its new product line and to prune some of its new product initiatives simply in order to try to manage the new business without any nasty surprises. I think, therefore, that it would be surprising to see the company guide for much more than 8% growth in the 1 st year of its new business, simply to avoid disappointing investors.At the moment, none of the 5 analysts that have posted estimates on First Call have chosen to try to include the impact of the merger on their numbers. But I have to believe that it will be somewhat difficult for analysts to recommend the shares if my estimates on reported earnings and revenues turn out to be reasonable.According to First Call, of the 9 analysts who rate the shares, there are 4 holds, 4 buys and a strong buy. I would be concerned that there are likely to be some downgrades, simply because of the risks involved in putting this combination together, despite the accretion that is likely from the transaction for LOGM holders.Longer TermI do not think that LOGM management will necessarily be successful trying to run a business composed of a couple of growth stallions and a mass of dray horses. That kind of strategy often bedevils software vendors as the competition for both resources and management attention produces internal tensions that usually become dysfunctional. One sees the problems and the results in looking at companies that are attempting to work themselves out of legacy businesses that all of a sudden have become boat anchors and which have marred financial results almost indefinitely. Some obvious examples of these kinds of situations include both Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and IBM (NYSE:IBM). I assume that to some degree or the other, Citrix was willing to make a very good deal to sell its GoTo business in order to work out of some of those kinds of problems which perhaps have detracted from the performance of its complex of specialties and solutions.In LOGM's latest investor presentation it has laid out a strategy as to how it is going to create a growth businesses out of the collection of assets and capabilities it now owns. The most straightforward of these pivots, will be to try to transform the company's web conferencing business into an evolving market in Unified Collaboration. Many vendors have become involved in the Unified Collaboration space with many different approaches to winning wallet share. The principle strategies include the combination of voice, screen sharing, video and chat. The TAM for the UCC space is said to be $14 billion by 2020 providing LOGM with a huge runway and lots of opportunities to take its market position and leverage it. I think as well, the fact that Cisco is the principle competitor in the space, and that Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is focused on many different and dissimilar business issues, is going to be an advantage for LOGM.While there is likely to be some friction in the combination of all of the products that LOGM now has in the space including JoinMe, GoTo Meeting, OpenVoice (a conference call app) and Grasshopper, (an app that can be used to turn a typical I-Phone into a virtual business telephone system), I expect that this segment will offer the best percentage growth for the new company and it represents about 50% of total revenues.LOGM now has a very mature business that is going to need lots of surgery in order for it not to become a boat anchor in terms of prospective revenue growth. None of the major solutions that are offered in what LOGM calls its Remote Access space have high rates of growth. It is likely that in order to develop a competitive suite of Identity and Access management tools, LOGM will have to wind up buying some additional companies to integrate with its current set of remote access tools, Central and LastPass. This is probably going to be the area of the business that will be the most difficult to transform given the demand trends for the major offerings in the space. Fortunately, it represents only about 25% of the revenues for the new business.Over time, I expect that the business segment that LOGM describes as remote support is going to become the company's fastest growing segment. This part of the LOGM business is likely to have the easiest transition. Most of the current offering are LOGM products although there is overlap between Rescue and GoTo Assist. I wouldn't be surprised to see one or the other of those products killed as they seem very duplicative. The company has plans to introduce new offerings to enhance and integrate Rescue, BoldChat and Xively. Hopefully the launch will have better success than the company's now abandoned Cubby offering.From the point of view of investors, I think the immediate accretion and the cost synergies are already well recognized and are incorporated in the value of the shares. The difficulties of meshing so many moving pieces and re-creating a growth engine may not be so well understood or accepted by investors. The tasks facing this management the next couple of years are more than a bit daunting. Given the valuation of the shares, I think the risks have overtaken the rewards. I do not see any further positive alpha in this name. It is time,I think, to bid the shares a fond adieu and hope that they can be revisited in the future."
3229496,80135,2015-06-03T09:09:24-04:00,Online collaboration and remote access is gaining traction.LogMeIn is exposed to the growth of industry; investors are paying quite a premium for LOGM.This premium is not justified amid competition and lower barriers to entry.The stock is a sell with a fair value around $46.,"LogMeIn (NASDAQ:LOGM) is a technology company that belongs to the industry of application software. The company offers cloud based services for small scale commercial users looking for customer support, inter business communication and remote access to data/devices or VPN services.The company offers several products and services for collaboration, services and support, and IT management.Collaboration These services of the company allow users to interact online, arrange meetings and access devices remotely. Following are some of the collaboration services offered by the company.Join.me is a cloud-based software as a service that enables screen sharing and audio calls. The software has three versions: join.me, join.me pro, and join.me enterprise. LogMeIn only charges for premium versions that support audio conferencing and screen sharing.LogMeIn Pro is a network management tool connecting multiple devices to assist in the management of remote workers. These products allow platform upgrades, printing access, background services and other basic networking amenities for remote workers.Cubby is a cloud computing tool with synchronization feature for multiple devices. LogMeIn sells this software to clients who require secure online connection between remote devices.Services and Support This business of LogMeIn primarily provides customer support services to its clients.LogMeIn Rescue is an online troubleshooting software, which allows remote assistance through live chat and screen sharing by customer support staff. LogMeIn Rescue has big corporate clients such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Vodafone etc.BoldChat is a customer services software that allows businesses to interact with their customers through live chat, messages and emails. LogMeIn claims that BoldChat increases customer satisfaction as customer can directly access customer support staff if they require any assistance.IT management These services are used by internal and external IT professionals to manage computers and devices remotely. Services are as follows.LogMeIn Central allows IT professionals to access their devices remotely. User can also install software updates and automate IT tasks. Central is one of the premium services offered by LogMeIn, Inc.Medium is a password and identity management service delivered over the cloud. It is offered as a free product for single use and as a premium product for group or team use.Connected Products This business of the company offers Xively, an IoT product. The software connects manufacturers directly to their products allowing quick troubleshooting and information collection.Other services of LogMeIn include LogMeIn Backup, a remote backup service and Remotely Anywhere, a remote system administration tool.Revenue LogMeIn considers itself as a single division and treats its revenue as coming from one stream of operations. Major customers of LogMeIn are small and medium businesses, IT service providers, mobile carriers, customer service centers, original equipment manufacturers. Customers of LOGM normally provide subscription fee for the service they receive, which can be charged either annually or on monthly basis.LogMeIn has experienced persistent increase in its revenue over the years of its operations. LogMeIn has shown growth of 19.75% and 33.5% for 2013 and 2014 respectively. Revenue is expected to grow 19% during 2015. See the chart below: Source: SEC filings and Q1 2015 earnings releaseThe company witnessed the highest growth, 33%, during 2014. However, the growth is expected to return to 19% during 2015. The increase in revenue during 2014 was attributed to the growth of join.me pro, a premium collaboration platform. But, considerable amount of growth also came from the transitioning of users from the discontinued free LogMeIn remote access service to LogMeIn Pro and Central. Revenue got a boost from this transition during 2014. Going forward, the company won't have the free user base that is accustomed to use its remote service. Therefore, subscriber growth for LogMeIn Pro and Central will remain under pressure. All in all, 2014's topline growth is a tough comparison for future years.Industry overview  Growth of connected devices is affecting the way people work. Online collaboration is witnessing growth; remote access from multiple devices is also increasing. Enterprises are also relying on hosted service for customer support.70% of the employees work from alternate locations regularly. According to Gartner, users employ up to four devices a week to access office systems. This is the very reason companies are looking for collaboration solutions. 66% (pdf) of companies are actively looking, says Ovum Research.Enterprise social software market is expected to grow at CAGR of 23% during 2014-2018. Another report projects enterprise collaboration to grow at a CAGR of 9.4% during 2014-2019. Transparency market expects double digit growth in global outsourced customer care services.As a provider of services that enable collaboration, remote working and customer support, LogMeIn is set to benefit from these industry trends. However, the company faces high threat of substitutes as there are low barriers to entry. There are a lot of online collaboration and remote access services around. There are even established players like Citrix's (NASDAQ:CTXS) online division and Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO) WebEX. Therefore, we are unsure on whether LogMeIn will continue to replicate the overall market growth going forward.Thesis We are bearish on LogMeIn's stock based on following factors.There are very low barriers to entry and threat of substitute product is high. There are already many options on the market for online meetings, collaborations and remote access. LOGM is banking on join.me. But, there are lots of services out there. Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) offers connect; Citrix has GoToMeeting, Cisco's WebEX is also a competitor. Note that Cisco and Adobe are in Gartner's magic quadrant for web conferencing. Join.me may interest small scale customers amid attractive pricing but large companies normally rely or blue chips like Adobe and Cisco.The competitors of LogMeIn are established companies that can hurt LOGM through price wars. In our view, SMBs use join.me due to competitive pricing. Join.me offers PRO for around $15 with 250 participants while Citrix's GoToMeeting allows 25 participants for $39 per month. The point is that LOGM competes on price. And, large competitors can easily indulge in price wars. Case in point: Goggle (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft are making smaller players irrelevant in web services space through pricing, thanks to their scale.Discontinuation of free LogMeIn remote access service is a negative for paid subscriber growth in the long run. Choosing between offering a free product with premium services or a trial instead can affect the purchasing decision of potential subscribers. We think that subscribers are more likely to opt for free products with premium services instead of trial based products or services. That's why discontinuation of free remote access is not a good sign for LOGM's subscriber growth. As mentioned in the revenue section, LOGM's growth in 2015 is expected to slow down as compared to 2014. This indicates that the company's growth is slowing down in paid remote access as the accustomed free users already transitioned to paid services. All in all, the discontinuation doesn't bode well for LogMeIn's subscriber growth.Valuation and final thoughtsThe major counterpart of LOGM trades at a P/E of 47.79. However, considering high growth of LOGM, PEG is a better measure to judge the relative value. 1.63 PEG of CTSX imply LOGM is relatively expensive than Citrix.Further, earnings are expected to grow at 22% p.a. for the next five years, and the company trades at 31.13 times 2016 consensus earnings. A long approach to PE valuation follows:This approach to valuation reveals that LOGM is trading at 38% premium to its fair value. Note that a multiple of 22 is quite generous as discounted 2020 EPS is used.Looking at the implied growth rate of residual earnings, LOGM must grow at a perpetual growth of 10.6% to achieve current valuation. With five year growth of 22%, 10% perpetual growth seems a long shot. Source: PrudenaAs we can see both P/E and PEG measures show LOGM is overpriced as compared to other members of its industry. LOGM is overpriced even for a growth company as indicated by the PE valuation above. Even earnings growth to the north of 20% doesn't justify current valuation. Given the competition, lower barriers to entry and discontinuation of free remote access platform, we rate LogMeIn, Inc. a sell."
3993071,98236,2016-07-29T02:23:12-04:00,"LogMein announced a strong operational quarter earlier this week which included beating on the top line, EPS and a raise for the balance of the fiscal year.The announcement was greatly overshadowed by the deal, also revealed, in which essentially LOGM will acquire the ""GoTo"" assets of Citrix for stock in a transaction worth $2.2 billion.The transaction is massively accretive and much of the article details just how accretive the deal might be.The shares have appreciated sharply - more than 25% from levels just before the earnings and the transaction were announced.I think that the possibilities for revenue synergies are yet to be appreciated and the potential for cost synergies is probably underestimated as well. The shares can go higher.","When the minnow winds up dining on whale meat!LogMein (NASDAQ:LOGM) announced the results of fiscal Q2 on July 26th. The results were strong and included a significant EPS beat with almost 30% top line growth as well. In addition, management significantly raised outlook for the last two quarters of the fiscal year. I will discuss some of the details of the beat and the outlook later in this article.But the big news was not about the operating performance - by far the biggest news was the announcement of a Reverse Morris Transaction which in essence means that LOGM will acquire the ""GoTo"" properties of Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS) for about 27 million shares, or about $2.2 billion at current quotations for LOGM shares. In addition, as part of the overall scope of the transaction, LOGM is to pay its current shareholders dividends that aggregate $1.50/share before the transaction closes and Citrix will contribute $25 million to the new company, which is less than $.50/share based on a to-be outstanding share count of 54 million. In my opinion, and detailed below, the transaction will be highly accretive with many potential synergies. Despite the significant appreciation of LOGM shares in the wake of the announcement of the transaction, they remain a buy in my opinion.Citrix also announced a strong quarter in the context of their expectations. Both revenues and earnings were noticeably greater than the prior consensus expectations. The CFO announced that Citrix had increased its forecast for both Q3 and for the balance of the fiscal year.Citrix shares fell 3% in the wake of the earnings release although they have since recovered. Part of the knee-jerk drop may have been due to the strength exhibited by the shares prior to the earnings release but much of it was likely to be investor unhappiness regarding the price that was received for the company's GoTo properties. From my perspective, CTXS shareholders are receiving about $2.2 billion for a property that is generating $680 million in run rate sales, all subscription and that is growing at 10%. The specifics of GoTo's financial performance will not be made public for a few weeks. That being said, I do imagine that GoTo properties are reasonably profitable at this point. Inevitably, estimates for CTXS earnings will be impacted to a degree, but without more details it is hard to say how much. But the fact is that this is one of those rare deals in which both of the parties are winners. I think that the value of LOGM shares to be received by CTXS shareholders, coupled with the value of the remaining component of CTXS, is greater than would have been the case absent the transaction.Management had previously announced that GoTo was not a strategic asset in the company's strategic vision and under those circumstances getting 3.2X EV/S is not such a terrible transaction. Usually, companies having announced that something is for sale and unloved, do not get a really premium price for an asset.In any event, the balance of this article is about LOGM including the potential impact of the acquisition and the outlook for the to-be combined company. As I will detail below, the shares that will be distributed to Citrix owners are likely to appreciate from current levels and I would advise holding them - but I am not going to cover anything more in detail regarding CTXS and its valuation in this article. I do not think it is necessary to buy Citrix shares in order to get LOGM shares - there is probably an arbitrage to be had but the time frame for the transaction is long enough that I wouldn't like to invest on the basis of the potential premium to be had.Just how much whale is LOGM going to get to eat?The contemplated transaction is described as a Reverse Morris Trust merger. Essentially the minnow - that would be LOGM is to acquire and merge with the Citrix product suite known as GoTo, that would be the whale and wind up controlling the new venture. A Reverse Morris Trust merger is used when a parent company has a subsidiary it wants to sell in a tax-efficient manner. The parent company spins the subsidiary it wants to dispose of to the shareholders of the parent company. The former sub then merges with a target company to create a merged company. For this to work, the former subsidiary has to be considered the buyer of the target. Citrix shareholders will own fractionally more than 50% of the new entity. Most unusually, in this case, the surviving entity is to be LOGM whose executives will run the new company. As I will get to shortly, LOGM has gotten a great deal that is already partially understood by the market with the shares up about 20%.But essentially, LOGM is issuing 27.7 million shares of its stock to buy the GoTo business of Citrix which had revenues of $680 million last year, several times the size of the LogMein products in the space and actually twice the size of the current revenue projections for LOGM as a whole for 2016.LOGM currently has 25.8 million fully diluted shares outstanding in addition to some amount of stock options. Overall, LogMein's revenues for this year have been forecast to be about $335 million or about $13/share and the new entity will have 54 million shares outstanding with a revenue estimate of at least $1.015 billion or almost $19/share.In terms of earnings, management chose to focus on non-GAAP EBITDA. Non-GAAP EBITDA for LOGM has been forecast to reach about $86 million for full year 2016 as a mid-point. Non-GAAP EBITDA relates to a forecast for non-GAAP net income of about $51 million. The company accrues a non-GAAP tax rate of 30.5%.The press release announcing the transaction forecasts that the new company is expected to have a pro-forma EBITDA margin of 35% or $6.50/share and is expected to generate free cash flow in excess of $250 million or more than $4.60/share. EBITDA of $350 million and a tax rate of 30% should yield non-GAAP earnings of $245 million which would be about $4.50 in EPS once the cost accretion has been achieved. The current forecast for LOGM EPS for 2017 is $2.20/share.What might shares in the new business be worth?There are obviously many ways to approach that question, none of which are going to be without an element of healthy skepticism and of risk. LOGM shares have had what appears to be a high valuation primarily because this has been a rare company that has been profitable, and achieving rapid organic growth that derives all of its business from the cloud. From time to time there have been articles on this site suggesting that the shares are or have been overvalued.One of the crucial assumptions is going to be expectations for the growth rate of the new enterprise. No one is going to pretend that remote access technology is a high growth market. The application has been around for a while and whether it is saturated or not, it surely hasn't limitless growth potential. I was surprised to hear from the CEO of Citrix that its GoTo product line was growing at double-digit rates although perhaps the impact of Go To Meeting is sufficient to achieve significant growth.Most recently, LOGM has traded in the range of about $60/share which had been a market capitalization of about $1.6 billion. With its net cash balance of $180 million, it had an enterprise value of $1.38 billion and its sales had been forecast to be $335 million. So, the shares, in the most recent past had traded at 4.1X EV/S.The company reported an operating cash flow margin of 31% for the most recent quarter and of 39% YTD. Cash flow margins grew more in Q2 than in Q1. Cash flow margins are significantly greater than the current EBITDA margins, which do not include the increase in deferred revenues. At the moment, looking at the last quarter, that is a difference of $27 million or 16% of revenues.Again, absent lots more dialogue about the more specific outlook for the combined company which is not currently available, operating cash flow margins could be as much as 50%. CapEx for LOGM is small although it did increase last quarter. It has a run rate that is equivalent to 5% of revenues. (CapEx for LOGM is quite small because it uses a proprietary technology that improves the efficiency of the data centers it operates and is ideal for the kinds of usage engendered by its applications.) CapEx as a ratio will almost certainly be smaller still for the combined company but even using 5% of revenues might yield a free cash flow estimate of $450 million for the period after all the cost synergies have been achieved. A 5% free cash flow yield relates to an enterprise value of $9 billion or more than $160/share.What ought to be a target free cash flow yield - surely less than 10%. One can get lots of different but positive answers for valuation if a target free cash flow yield is even within hailing distance of levels that are consistent with other SaaS vendors.An investor would get a far lower valuation using EV/S as a valuation formula. At 4X the expected revenues from the combined company, the potential enterprise value is just $4 billion and that works out to $74/share. At 6X the potential valuation is $111.Finally, there is the non-GAAP P/E. Again, pre-transaction, the earnings estimates for this year had been about $1.90 rising to $2.20 in 2017. Those are P/Es of 37X and 31X on the closing price prior to the release of the merger transaction news. P/Es in the 30X range suggest a tentative value of in excess of $135/share if my logic trails and company adjusted EBITDA guidance is accurate. Even a 20X P/E yields a $90 price target.There are many different ways readers might approach the issue of valuation. I think that a range of potential fair value outcomes would be from between $90 and $135. Other readers are almost certain to feel differently, although.Again, valuation metrics depend on forward growth estimates and the forward growth of the new company will almost surely be lower in percentage terms than would be the forward growth of LOGM as it is currently constituted. How much slower, how profitable and as discussed below, with what potential revenue synergies are not questions that can be dispositively answered by this writer given the information at hand. LOGM hasn't been the best covered name although is likely to change a bit as it reaches over $1 billion in revenues and that will lead to a broad spectrum of opinions regarding the three questions above. And given LOGM's long history of ultra-conservative projections, it stands to reason that when guidance is provided regarding the outlook for the new company it is not going to err on the optimistic side. But I still think $86/share (the current price as of this writing) represents more than the sum of all of the concerns regarding integration risks and transaction risks and gives no recognition of potential revenue synergies.Writing Wednesday morning in the wake of the announcement I am not going to try to suggest to anyone that I have the kind of specialized skills and knowledge to forecast how LOGM shares might trade today or for the balance of the week. I first wrote about this name in January and then in February in the wake of Q4-2015 earnings. I thought the shares were a buy at that point when they were trading in the $50/share ranges. Obviously the question to be asked is whether or not the shares, now up more than 60% in six months are still a buy or is it time to move on. I believe that the shares still represent outstanding opportunity and are likely to produce positive alpha for the next several quarters to come.Just What are the Synergies to be had?Citrix CEO Kirill Tatarinov put it very succinctly and emphatically, this transaction is all about synergies. The ones listed in the press release are specifically $65 million by the end of year one post-merger and $100 million at the end of year 2. Those levels of projected cost savings might seem like quite a bit of a stretch in terms of finding synergies for a company that might be projected to be spending no more than $800 million on opex post-merger. My guess, for what it is worth, is like most of these projections it is probably quite conservative.There are significant scale economies that ought to be available for a company whose revenues are expected to be 3X greater than the current operations of LOGM. LOGM is a company that derives all of its revenues from subscriptions and has a marginal GAAP profits despite a gross margin of 86%.LOGM is spending half of its current revenues on sales and marketing. Part of the reason for that is despite the company's relatively small size, it supports numerous products that all need marketing effort. And not all of its product offerings really have the scale necessary to support significant marketing efforts. There is no reason to expect that the combined organization can't reduce the sales and marketing ratio substantially. I wouldn't be surprised to see the sales and marketing expense, just by itself, achieve savings at or in excess of $100 million that is the currently expected cost synergy within two years.Over the years I have almost never seen a company not surpass projected cost savings over time when putting together a merger of two overlapping products. Although the companies haven't released exact specifics, the Citrix GoTo set of products is almost 10X the size of the competitive LOGM product. LOGM is spending 13% of revenues on general and administrative expenses, and the general and administrative expenses rose 33% on a GAAP basis last quarter. That may not be so visible given that revenue growth accelerated to 28% this past quarter, but it is ratio simply never seen in billion-dollar software vendors.And LOGM's research and development spend is at 20% of revenues on a GAAP basis and grew by almost 40% year on year. Again, we do not know the detailed specifics, but the fact is that LOGM and Citrix have competed for years in the remote access and meeting collaboration spaces. Although it might sound heretical to say so, the functionality of the competitive products is more or less comparable. Over time, it seems very likely that the new company will attempt to develop a unified set of solutions and eliminate the expenses inherent in trying to sell and support two products that do the same thing.The synergies that are never discussed in polite companyNo part of the synergies identified by the two new partners are those likely to be realized from ending competition between the two major competitors in the remote access space. While there are, to be sure, more than a few other remote access solutions on the market, Citrix has been the market leader since it developed the technology and has been plagued by price competition from LOGM for as long as I have known LOGM. How much the end of competition between LOGM and CTXS will be worth is not knowable for an outsider to analyze and for obvious reasons the companies have not made it a part of their merger justification but it is surely a major factor in the benefits that are going to be achieved. I really don't have a specific idea as to what competitive scenarios are likely to emerge and since the merger is still six months away, none of us, outside of company management, really know what is going to happen when there is one team running sales and marketing. I think it is fair to believe that the two competitors will cease to compete directly on price and will no longer compete directly to try to capture potential enterprise clients. There is almost certainly lots that will be written by users who are complaining that they have to pay higher prices for a service that they have been able to buy for $40/computer - but that's the point it is $40/user.Citrix and LOGM are also vigorous competitors in the collaboration space where they offer Go To Meeting and Join Me, respectively. The competitive dynamics are the same - sort of - but different as well in that there is a 3rd major player, Cisco, (NASDAQ:CSCO) whose WebEx is the granddaddy and the market share leader. For some years JoinMe was the fastest growing revenue contributor that LOGM offered and it is a significant revenue component for the company. On the other hand, it has a really tiny market share given the size of both Cisco and Citrix in this space. Much of its competitive strategy has been based has, of necessity, been based on price. I will leave it those readers who have used the different technology to evaluate them as alternatives. So far as I am concerned, if one is shown how to launch the sessions, the end result is about the same. There will almost certainly be revenue benefits to go with cost benefits in amalgamating what today are two competitive solutions if for no other reason than ASP's will rise.It would be a mistake for me to pretend that I have some special knowledge that allows me to understand the likely revenue synergies of the combination in a way that I can offer quantification, but I imagine they will be substantial. The fact is, almost inevitably, the prices received per computer in these spaces by the new LOGM will be higher than has heretofore been the case. I doubt that anti-trust concerns are a significant element in this transaction, given the overall size or lack of size of LOGM compared to many infrastructure software vendors. It is rare to see two direct competitors with significant market shares merge but in this case, where the overall size of the acquirer coupled with the hazy definition of a relevant market makes it hard to imagine anti-trust objections. I just can't imagine that Cisco could argue with a straight face that the combination of JoinMe and Go To Meeting is going to injure it in a visible fashion.I would imagine the higher prices coupled with more effective marketing and an offering that will be able to tick every box and to fill in every hole is likely to produce more earnings gains than the forecast gains from cost synergies.Just by the way - How is the dog doing?Quite well thanks, but he is a mite hard to see given the size of the new tail. What I mean explicitly is that the parts of LOGM that do not have to do with remote access and which have been the heartland of growth for this company for several years are still doing well but their progress is now obscured by the transformation to be wrought through the Citrix transaction. It is ironic that when I first wrote about LOGM for SA earlier this year, one of the significant investor issues at that point was concerns about the company's dwindling growth in remote access and limited comprehension/visibility regarding the outlook for some of the other key products and verticals that have generated much of the company's revenues.The company offers solutions based on 3 different clouds. It has significant revenues that come from the Internet of Things offering called Xively, from its customer service products, which include BoldChat, Central and Rescue and from LastPass and Meldium, which are password managers. None of these represents a huge market opportunity by itself and as mentioned above the need to support lots of products with significant development and marketing costs has inhibited the growth of GAAP operating margins.LOGM has been able to grow its top line by 20% or more on an organic basis and that was the case last quarter. It has had a long history of earnings beats going back several years. When conditions have deteriorated for the company, and they have in the past, it was guidance and not current quarter operating performance that has been impacted. So, I have no reason to believe anything other than that the company will continue to print quarters above published expectations until the merger closes and detailed expectations have been completely reset.But regardless of the outlook for various pieces of the ""other"" LOGM, the value in the shares and their near-term performance will be dependent almost exclusively on investor outlook for the merged enterprise. At this point the dog is more in the nature of lagniappe rather than being the major driver in either the business or the valuation and investors will need to recognize that going forward.Summing Up!Obviously, there are many risks in what is eventually to be a complicated transaction. Execution will be key and how this combination is to be consolidated is not known at this point and will certainly not be a simple matter to consummate efficiently. But the upside share price opportunity would seem to allow for risks from execution and to still leave lots of room for positive alpha going forward."
2937036,21820,2015-02-20T18:26:56-05:00,"After years of 20% plus growth, LogMeIn guides for 17% growth in 2015.The company's guidance still managed to beat what analysts were forecasting.Company has a history of beating guidance and this new target looks extremely conservative.LogMeIn remains a buyout candidate with triple digit growth in a strong webconferencing market.","Earlier this week, high growth LogMeIn (NASDAQ:LOGM) reported fourth quarter and full-year earnings. The results were impressive, as they have been all year. Despite a strong earnings report and stock trading near 52-week highs, investors may start heading for the exits. The company released low guidance for the next year, which is well below recent strong growth figures. Despite this soft guidance, I think shares continue to be one of the best technology stocks for 2015.In the fourth quarter, revenue grew 33% to $59.9 million. Earnings per share of $0.35 beat guidance by $0.02. For the full year, revenue grew 34% to $222 million. This marked the company's fastest growth rate since 2010. Full-year earnings per share grew to $1.18, more than double the prior year's $0.55. These figures follow up an impressive third quarter, which saw join.me grow 100%.LogMeIn continues to focus on three main growth initiatives:· Fueling the continued growth of join.me· Increasing the value to SMB IT professionals· Accelerating the IoT (internet of things) market opportunity with the Xively platformThe join.me platform continued to be the key to the company's growth. The segment has seen triple digit growth each quarter. The company's collaboration cloud segment, which includes join.me, saw revenue grow 81% to $17.9 million in the fourth quarter. This was led by join.me seeing strong growth of first time users, conversions from free to paid, and higher average transaction sizes. Web conferencing remains a $2.4 billion market and this triple digit growth is seeing join.me disrupt rivals and gain serious market share.In the fourth quarter (read earnings call), join.me saw strong wins from companies like Canon and Microsoft. The company has a customer list that is incredibly impressive. This list includes some of the biggest telecommunications companies, the three largest computer manufacturers and nine of the top ten technology companies.The IT management segment saw fourth quarter revenue of $20 million. The company has already started integrating its recent purchase of Meldium to use as a bridge between employees and IT departments as an important offering. Service cloud revenue grew 8% in the fourth quarter to $21.4 million.I also not would completely rule out a buyout of LogMeIn by a larger technology company in related fields like Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) or Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS). With a market capitalization of $1.3 billion, I think LogMeIn could easily be swallowed by a company that might be afraid of LogMeIn's continual penetration and market share gains in several fields.LogMeIn announced early fiscal 2015 guidance figures. The company believes revenue will hit $260 to $264 million. LogMeIn also forecasted for first quarter revenue in a range of $60.2 to $60.7 million, growth of 23%. The full-year guidance calls for revenue to grow 17 to 19%. The guidance might be troubling to some for two reasons. First the full-year figure implies a weak second half of the year, after the first quarter numbers. Keep in mind that the company has seen compound annual revenue growth of 23% since going public in 2009. This guidance implies growth has finally slowed down, which might cause some to head to the exits.Investors should compare the figure to what analysts are currently projecting. Nine analysts on Yahoo Finance see the company posting full-year earnings per share of $1.28 and revenue of $257.7 million. Yahoo Finance also sees first quarter revenue of $58.71, from six analysts' estimates. So while LogMeIn's figures seem well below recent history, they are actually better than what the Street expected. Also keep in mind that LogMeIn has a history of beating estimates as it did with all four estimates on Yahoo Finance for the last fiscal year.Shares of LogMeIn hit new 52-week highs on Friday as investors continue to weigh the results of the full year and the next set of guidance numbers. Keep in mind that the fourth quarter numbers came in above guidance from the company that was already raised during the third quarter. The company's early guidance beats analysts' estimates, but also seems conservative compared to years of 20% plus growth, setting the bar for possible raises throughout the year or a healthy batch of beats. In the same right, any revenue miss or guidance revision downward could cause shares to substantially fall. I remain bullish on LogMeIn and think 2015 will be another great year."
2609995,41741,2014-10-30T10:04:35-04:00,LOGM beat consensus on the top and bottom lines.Yet another earnings beat supports our bullish thesis.We felt that LOGM could succeed with the rise of remote working.,"LogMeIn (NASDAQ:LOGM) managed to post 3Q earnings of $0.32 a share (topping $0.28 consensus) and revenues of $58mm (beating $56.3mm expectations). Both of these were well above the high end of company guidance. Driving this was EBITDA of $13.3mm and an EBITDA margin of 23%, which was above 3Q13 EBITDA of $9.2mm and 21% EBITDA margin.LOGM issued 4Q guidance that has revenues coming in at $58.4mm to $58.9mm and EBITDA of $13.4mm to $13.8mm with an EBITDA margin of 23%. EPS is expected to be $0.32 to $0.33, which is above previous consensus of $0.30. Full year 2014 is expected to generate $48mm in EBITDA on a 22% EBITDA margin. Meanwhile, EPS estimates for 2014 are $1.15 to $1.16, above previous consensus of $1.09.Shares are up 3% over the last week and now up 32% YTD.LOGM continues to pursue its strategy of breaking into the Internet of Things with its Xively product. It also snatched up a password management provider during 3Q called Medlium.We covered LOGM last year, noting that the risk/reward tradeoff was too compelling to ignore. Shares are up 50% since then. In the 2013 piece, we noted,This rang true, with the company crushing 3Q earnings, just as it did with 2Q earnings, which we covered here. Shares now trade at 35x forward earnings and 46x EV/EBITDA seems quite expensive. But its nearly 35% expected earnings CAGR for the next five years is double the industry average. With no debt and over $8/share in cash, we still think shares can hit $55 in the near term."
2601445,21820,2014-10-27T15:26:05-04:00,Join.me revenue grew 100% n third quarter.Addition of local languages and application integration supports upcoming growth for join.me.Company raises guidance above consensus range.,"Last week, LogMeIn (NASDAQ:LOGM) reported strong third quarter earnings. The report was enough to send shares of the company up 3% on the week. The company continues to see strong growth in many of its segments and looks well positioned in several hot markets. I recommended buying shares back in September on the strength of second quarter earnings. Strong third quarter earnings confirm a long-term bullish opinion.In the third quarter, LogMeIn had total revenue of $58.1 million, representing growth of 35%. The company reported $0.32 in earnings per share. Both of those figures came in higher than company guidance for the quarter.At the beginning of the year, LogMeIn reported three growth drivers. They were:· Growing join.me into a market leader in collaboration· Boosting value to SMB IT professionals· Accelerating IOT market opportunities with the Xively platformAll three of these areas saw strong performances in the quarter. Join.me continued to be the best item for LogMeIn with growth of more than 100%. IT management saw sales increase 33% in the quarter. The company saw 85% growth for its collaborative cloud and IT management segments. Gross margin improved to 90% in the quarter. Impressively enough, operating margins increased more than a full 2% to 19.8% from 17.6% in the prior quarter.In the quarter, international revenue made up 33% of the company's total. All major geographies saw quarter over quarter growth and year over year growth. North America and Europe saw year over year growth of more than 30%. Latin America continued to be the hottest growth segment with year over year revenue growth of more than 40%. Latin America also posted a revenue increase of 40% in the second quarter.If the quarter wasn't already strong enough for LogMeIn, the segment is bracing for future growth as well. In September, LogMeIn launched new international versions of join.me in the languages of German, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch and Brazilian Portuguese. LogMeIn also is launching marketing campaigns for the product in Western Europe. The language efforts should help LogMeIn sign up some new customers in international markets as it can cater to bigger businesses.LogMeIn also is boosting its value and presence by integrating the service with other applications. In the third quarter, the company expanded the integration of join.me with Google Apps, a service used by more than 5 million businesses. Just this past week, LogMeIn added integration of join.me with the Salesforce 1 platform.Xively is one area investors should be excited for in the future. The segment is still relatively small, making up around 1% of total revenue. However the company continues to believe in future growth saying ""Xively represents what we believe to be the single most important strategic initiative of the company.""Another area investors can focus on is LogMeIn's increasing share buyback program. In the third quarter, LogMeIn bought back $19 million of its shares. Recently, LogMeIn announced a new $75 million share buyback program. The company ended the quarter with $196 million in cash. It appears that the ideal usage will be small acquisitions ($15 million worth in the third quarter) and share buybacks.Yahoo Finance lists 2014 earnings per share estimates as $1.16. Revenue estimate is listed as $220.1 million for fiscal 2014. In 2015, analysts see earnings per share hitting $1.29 and revenue growing 17.0% to $257.4 million. LogMeIn issued fourth quarter guidance of $58.4 to $58.9 million for revenue and $0.32 to $0.33 for earnings per share. For the full year, LogMeIn has guided for revenue to increase 33% to a range of $220.5 to $221.0 million, ahead of analysts' targeted figure. The company sees earnings per share coming in a range of $1.15 to $1.16, even with consensus on Yahoo. A question came up on the conference call about 2015 guidance. The company failed to give guidance but sided with the range of 16 to 18% revenue growth saying, ""we think that's an appropriate place to be at this time.""Investing in LogMeIn really comes with two risks - valuation and growth rate. The company continues to see its shares trade at a premium when taking revenue or earnings into consideration. Shares trade at almost 40 times this year's earnings. LogMeIn also trades at around five times annual sales. Shares have a high valuation due to their impressive growth rate. However, going forward, the company's growth rate is dropping below 20%, which might question whether valuation has finally reached a peak.I think LogMeIn represents a strong investment opportunity. The company is growing in key areas needed by businesses to survive in the internet world we live in. Look for the company to post a strong fourth quarter earnings report and issue guidance. If guidance is above the 16% range analysts currently list, shares could be ready to once again break out."
3813536,98236,2016-01-15T14:17:09-05:00,"LogMeIn's shares have fallen by almost 20% in little over one month.LOGM has exceptional levels of non-GAAP operating margins for a SaaS software vendor.Essentially all of the company's growth comes from areas that are not tied to the remote access space.The company has a nascent offering, Xively, in the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) space that can potentially transform the company yet again.The company has a strong and experienced management team.","IntroductionLogMeIn's (NASDAQ:LOGM) shares have dropped by about 20% in a bit over one month with most of that decrease occurring in the last two weeks. Like many cloud companies, the shares of LogMeIn are controversial with articles in Seeking Alpha decrying both valuation and the company's market position. On the other hand, consensus analyst opinion regarding the company's shares is a respectable 2.1 on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 according to Thomson/First Call, with a 12-month price target averaging $82, from the 11 analysts who cover the company. While most investors rightfully take price targets with several grains of salt, the average price target is more than 43% above present levels.Investment ThesisI believe that the current share price decline affords investors with a decent entry point. While the company is reasonably followed given its size, there are still many popular misconceptions that surround the company's business and competitive positioning. LOGM's shares are the closest thing to a value play in the world of cloud based, Software-as-a-Service (NASDAQ:SAAS) vendors. That doesn't mean that the shares are a value play in the classical investing world. EV/S is still over 4 and the non-GAAP P/E based on consensus 2016 non-GAAP EPS estimates is about 32X.But the company does offer certain metrics that may appeal to value investors. It is achieving significant operating leverage, and it has been able to produce non-GAAP operating cash flow margins of almost 40%. In addition, the company has seen a significant increase in deferred revenue which suggests that contract signings are growing significantly faster than reported revenues. Deferred revenue reached $137 million last quarter, up 33% year over year and flat on a sequential quarter basis during the seasonally slower summer quarter.LogMeIn is basically identified as a company selling desktop, remote access solutions to PCs and laptops that are used in the home or remotely. While that is a significant part of this company's revenue stream and provides its name, its success in recent years has come from providing users with software that facilitates remote maintenance of both IT products and software as well as products that allow users to conduct remote meetings.While the traditional remote desktop market is not expected to show much growth going forward, the other markets in which LOGM operates are markets that are still under penetrated and have years of significant growth ahead of them. In addition, the company has an early entry into what is forecast to be a very large market opportunity, the Internet of Things (IoT). The company's IoT offering, Xively, is not going to contribute to revenues or earnings in a material way for a few more years; when and if it does, it has the possibility to transform the financial basis of the company. IDC in its industry analysis suggests that IOT revenues will surpass $7 billion by 2020, and while I think the accuracy of longer-term industry forecasts is questionable, I do think that it is reasonable to believe that Xively will be a meaningful contributor to growth and profitability for this company over the longer term.Analyst estimates for 2016 for EPS growth are relatively modest, in the range of 10% or so to around EPS of $1.80 per share, up from the $1.60 expected for 2015. The relatively modest growth expectations are, in part, due to an anticipated higher tax rate accrual. I expect that the company is likely to continue to exceed consensus earnings and revenue forecasts for at least another couple of years and that the current consensus earnings growth forecast of 25% for the next five years will likely be significantly exceeded.As detailed below, the company has a couple of unique twists in its business/technology model that make it both more profitable and much abler to generate cash than most SaaS-based high-growth vendors. That doesn't mean the company has or is likely to have the kind of high operating margins that some investors seek among the companies in their portfolio. Non-GAAP operating margins are likely to have been around 21% for 2015 which is up sharply from the 15% non-GAAP operating margins in the prior year but far below the operating margins that large, traditional software companies can achieve.BackgroundLOGM is one of the smaller public companies that has a completely cloud-based offering. It is a bit unique in that some of its offerings are sold to consumers and its single hottest product, called join.me, which facilitates remote access meetings, is a desktop offering as opposed to an enterprise solution. Although the company in recent years has moved much of its sales effort to the enterprise side of its business, it will be a long time before the company is not best known for its desktop solutions. That being said, because of the product mix of what the company sells, it collects most of its revenue on credit cards and thus has exceptionally low receivables. Days sales outstanding (DSO) are just 22, far less than comparable levels of most other software vendors. By comparison, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) has a DSO of 60 and Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) has a DSO of 66. Low DSO has allowed LOGM to reduce its capital intensity significantly. As a concomitant, low DSO also has been a factor in the company enjoying an operating cash flow margin significantly greater than its reported net income. The growth in receivables which is a significant capital expenditure for most software companies has a far lower impact for LogMeIn.In addition, the company's capex for infrastructure build-out is significantly less than other cloud companies. Capex for this company will probably be about less than $15 million in 2015. Just as a comparison, Splunk, which is just a bit larger, albeit growing revenues somewhat faster than LOGM, will have capex that will probably exceed $40 million in its current fiscal year. As a result, while Splunk is recording depreciation charges of nearly $20 million for the fiscal year that ends 1/31, LOGM is likely to have just $13 million of depreciation allowing the company to achieve higher levels of operating cash flow, free cash flow and EBITDA than might be anticipated from a cloud-based software provider of this size. Analysts expect that non-GAAP operating cash flow margin for the full year for LOGM will be close to 40%.Overall, the combination of low DSO and a far smaller infrastructure build out per dollar of sales than comparable companies has created a business model where operating cash flow for this company is substantially greater than reported non-GAAP income. The company's non GAAP operating cash flow during 2015 was probably in the range of $100 million. The company's reported non-GAAP profits will probably be around $40 mil. The company has a current market capitalization of just under $1.4 billion with an enterprise value of about $1.1 billion. LOGM's revenues are anticipated to have been around $270 million for 2015. Non-GAAP EPS for the period is estimated at $1.61. While this company is not one of those deep value software vendors featuring little or no growth, at 4.3X EV/S and with operating cash flow running at almost 9% of enterprise value, this company probably has among the lowest valuations amongst profitable cloud-based software vendors.One thing that investors might note is the relatively high gross margin the company enjoys. Most vendors that offer enterprise software via the cloud have gross margins in the range of 75-85%, reflecting the costs of creating the cloud infrastructure and the expenses of providing users with some level of customization. For example, CRM has gross margins of about 76% while SPLK has gross margins of 83%. LOGM gross margins are significantly higher at between 87-88%, reflecting a unique technology that minimizes storage requirements and computing requirements compared to those of other cloud application vendors. While most observers do not think of software vendors as having differentiated cost structures, this is one of the rare exceptions to that rule. While it's difficult to compare gross margins exactly with the two companies seen as LOGM competitors, Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) through its WebEx offering, it would appear that LOGM has significant cost advantages that it has used to enable price competition in competing against its two much larger rivals in the specific spaces where they coexist.LogMeIn, despite its relatively small size, has several unique and differentiated product offerings that are of significance in trying to determine the outlook for the company in the short term. In addition, the company has a major initiative in a space which is called the Internet of Things. Its product offering Xively is not a significant revenue producer currently but it has the potential to significantly transform the size of LogMeIn at some time in the next several years.Product OverviewConnectivity - 32% of RevenueLOGM as the name says was founded as a company to provide users with remote access to their PCs when they are working either at home or on the road. Simply put, by using the LogMeIn product and those offered by competitors such as Citrix, users can login remotely and they can access all of the files on their ""base"" PC and they will be able to work remotely. There are very few distinguishing characteristics regarding the products in the space. Having used the Citrix product Go To My PC for many years, and having also tried the LOGM solution, it's very difficult to distinguish between the two with regards to functionality. The main difference is that the LOGM product is far less well known than the Citrix offering and in turn costs far less.The market was pioneered by Citrix some years ago and penetration rates for the application have probably reached a peak. In addition, with the decline in PC shipments and the advent of tablets, opportunities to sell to new users or to add the application to new hardware are limited. When LOGM first started its business in this space, it actually gave away the base functionality of its product with the belief that it would be able to upsell a significant cohort of the free users who would subscribe to its premium service. As the market matured and as the scope of the company's target market diminished, management did away with the so-called ""freemium"" model last year with little apparent impact on the business.At this point, it seems that concerns regarding the potential for Citrix to crush LOGM in a price war are dramatically overblown. Given the relatively modest market share that LOGM has, the economics of a price war are seemingly heavily weighted against any Citrix action. In addition, the pending restructuring of Citrix, in which its traditional product families including all of the ""Go To"" suites are to be spun off into an independent entity also would seem to militate against CTXS taking any significant negative pricing action that would hurt its profitability.A few years ago, LOGM launched a product that it calls join.me. join.me is still marketed using a ""freemium"" model and LOGM is providing over 1 million free downloads of the software each month. The market for remote meetings is obviously huge and continues to grow at strong rates. join.me has been one of the principal growth drivers for LOGM, and I would be surprised if that did not remain the case for the foreseeable future. join.me costs about half the price of the competitive products from either Citrix or from Cisco (WebEx). Again, it is very hard to draw material functional distinctions between the three products in the space. Indeed, the most telling statistic in terms of overall user satisfaction for join.me is that the average new user doubles its usage of join.me during the first year after it converts a trial to a paid subscription.IT Management - 34% of RevenueWhat LogMeIn describes as its management suite of products is primarily built around three products. One of these, the recently acquired LastPass, is a password manager that has had a very loyal customer following who use it as part of a security solution. Central is a product that automates the access of staff to particular applications while Pro allows instant access to applications, desktops and data from anywhere. The sales strategy here is more or less similar to that of join.me in that free versions of the various products have been available and some cohort of these turn into paid customers who use a premium version with more features. These products have all been around for a considerable period and the growth potential is not huge although they basically are cash cows for the company. While relatively small, the LastPass product suite is a nice tuck-in acquisition that extends the company's footprint into the overall IT security space and which should be synergistic with the other IT management solutions that this company was already selling.IT Service - 33% of RevenueThe company offers two major products in this category. Its Rescue product is one of the largest selling support tools in the world according to several market research studies. It basically allows for centrally located technicians to take control of remotely located PCs and laptops and to resolve service issues for non-professional IT users. In one form or the other, Rescue has very significant market penetration, and while the market is not in its infancy, it is still enjoying double-digit growth. Growth potential probably is higher for the product that LOGM calls Chat. One sees Chat primarily used on mobile devices to enable sessions where centrally located technicians attempt to resolve service problems with the use of a typed interactive dialog as opposed to using call centers. For many customers, Chat delivers an experience far more satisfactory than that of an intelligent call center. Chat users prefer having an interactive dialog with an IT professional than in trying to use the common fault resolution menus that are typically available on web sites.Xively - 1% of RevenuesXively is LOGM's IoT set of solutions that allow customers to build IoT capabilities into their products. IoT is really in its infancy and most users are just experimenting with the technology. The products that LOGM sells will allow users to manage permissions and provide authentication and provisioning and facilitate high-speed communication between millions of devices. Xively has won a few significant design wins including Lutron which makes light switches, and Symmons which makes the Temptrol shower valves. Both of these products have relatively straightforward uses for the software. At what point IoT is going to become mainstream and whether LOGM can convert its technology into a significant business are questions that are not likely to be answered to any significant degree during the course of 2016. Certainly, the product suite has the potential to transform the scope of the company if it achieves widespread acceptance.Pricing and ChurnLOGM has far greater churn than is typical for many other companies that sell their product via a SAAS model. These days, management suggests that a blended retention rate for all of LOGM's offerings is in the 80% range. Most SaaS vendors have retention rates in the mid-90% range and even higher even when they offer users one-year terms. The company's remote access and remote meeting products are used by workers to some extent in an on-demand mode. Remote access meetings are typically created in an ad hoc fashion, and although the overall concept of remote meetings often is viral in organizations, most of the time users sign up for one or two or three events. Needless to say, the churn of remote access solutions is often based on the churn of the employees in a specific organization. If employees turn over, then so does their remote access status.LOGM uses highly tiered pricing in order to maximize its revenues with basic versions that are either free or cost very little and more useable versions that sell for quite a bit more. It would be less than objective not to point out that sometimes this kind of approach leads to unhappy users who think that they can solve their problem for a minimal price only to find out during the process that it will cost much more to actually do what they want. Needless to say, the company has and will continue to induce a certain amount of churn due to its aggressive pricing strategy.As an example, the company's Central product can be had in a minimum configuration for $499/year for 25 users but the Premium capability, as LOGM calls its most featured solution in this space, will cost $1,299 per year for 25 users. Frankly, one of the reasons that this company has achieved the margins it has at the size it has is a function of this tiered pricing which requires far less marketing effort than is entailed in selling massive installations to very large users. Although this appears to be a potential vulnerability to significant user dissatisfaction, there have been no signs that users are more than normally disgruntled. Most users seem to like the product well enough to pay what is required to remain LogMeIn customers.Investment SummaryLOGM is one of the few profitable small-cap vendors of SaaS solutions. While it has not achieved stratospheric growth percentages when compared to companies selling sexy big data solutions, it has been, for the most part, a consistent growth engine that has steadily extended its product footprint and has come to be a major competitor in one very hot market, that of remote access meetings and the major competitor in remote access service markets. The company has a unique and efficient way of storing user data that has enabled it to minimize its capex and to use ""freemium"" marketing models where appropriate although its strategy is clearly to transition from that type of sales tactic. All of this has led to consistent 20% top-line growth and cash flow margins that are now approaching 40%. While LOGM's shares do not have classical deep-value criteria within the SaaS space, their EV/S of 4.2X and their P/E of around 32X offer investors a favorable entry point, in my opinion.Suffice to say that this is not going to be a defensive name, and its share price is going to be volatile and subject to swoons during times of market stress. Although the company certainly has the cash flow and the free cash flow sufficient to pay a dividend, it will almost certainly choose to reinvest its cash into the Xively opportunity. With the founder Michael Simon having essentially retired at the start of 2016, it is conceivable that this company could be acquired although there have been no rumors to that effect in recent months. I would expect the company will continue its past practice of providing modest guidance that it is then most likely to exceed and I have no reason to believe that such a scenario didn't play out that way in the quarter that the company will report in early February. While I can't quite make the case that the shares are overlooked, neither do they have the valuations of some of the more faddish SaaS vendors. I think that the 20% share price pullback provides investors with a good point at which to start to build commitments."

While the $15 million price paid by LogMeIn doesn't double revenue overnight, it does provide the company with another tool in controlling business IT departments through a series of offerings. The acquisition is one of several reasons why I think LogMeIn can continue to shoot higher after a stellar track record.LogMeIn paid $15 million to acquire Meldium, a company based out of San Francisco. Meldium is a leader in password management for companies. Y Combinator was an original backer of Meldium. The company helps use auto log-ins for users on mobile applications and websites. Companies are able to control these log-ins and can change passwords and restrict access at anytime. Meldium works with Google Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer on computers, and many operating systems on phones, including iOS and Android.Meldium works with more than 1,500 different applications including popular ones like Dropbox, Google Apps, Hubspot and Wordpress. Meldium offers a freemium model, with its lowest plan of less than five users available for no charge. Here is a look at the plans currently offered by Meldium:· <5 users: free· 20 users/20 apps: $29 month· 100 users/50 apps: $79 month· 250 users/unlimited apps: $199 monthMeldium is a leader in SSO (single sign on), a growing market for IT professionals to control what employees are logging onto and can get information from. The acquisition complements AppGuru, a program launched by LogMeIn back in June, helping IT departments with the build your own app market.In the press release, LogMeIn says the move will ""build upon and accelerate LogMeIn's strategic initiative of empowering IT professionals to embrace, manage and secure today's cloud-centric, consumerized, workplace.""LogMeIn is a leader in the remote control, file sharing and systems management for businesses of all size. The company counts its products on more than 125 million devices worldwide.LogMeIn reported second quarter earnings back in July. The company's earnings per share and revenue beat analysts and also previous company guidance. Total revenue increased 35% to $55 million. Revenue broke down as followed:· Collaborative cloud: 28% of total, +80%· IT management: 33% of total, +35%· Service cloud: 38% of total, +10%The company highlighted several key growth areas on the call:· Launched join.me Enterprise in April for large companies.· Xively had win in the quarter with Lutron Electronics, a manufacturer of lighting and electronics offerings. Lutron also is big in the home automation market.· International revenue represented 34% of total, with Latin America seeing a 40% increase in revenue for the quarter.· Ended the quarter with $221 million in cash and $0 debt on books, which equals out to net cash of more than $7 per share.· Expects Xively to post triple digit growth next year, the company said, and ""Xively and our overall internet of things initiative, it is the number one strategic priority of this company.""· Join.me Enterprise increasing average transaction size.Analysts on Yahoo Finance list a 2014 revenue target of $217.5 million, an increase of 31%. Analysts list expected earnings per share of $1.09, nearly double the $0.55 posted last year. For fiscal 2015, analysts see earnings per share of $1.26. Revenue targeted is $255.2 million, a gain of 17.3%. While a 17% gain is nothing to sneeze at, I think it is a little conservative from analysts. LogMeIn raised its own guidance on the earnings call. The company sees full year revenue in range of $216.5 to $218.0 million. LogMeIn expects full-year earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.12.With the introduction of AppGuru, join.me Enterprise, the new acquisition of Meldium cross sold to current customers, and the increased focus on new high margin growth ventures, I think the company can post higher gains. I would expect revenue to increase more in the 20-30% range. LogMeIn will likely issue guidance later this year and will also be conservative with it, in my opinion.The risk here is valuation for some investors. LogMeIn shares trade at more than five times annual revenue. A price to earnings ratio for the current year is in the 40 range. This is high, but keep in mind this is a growth stock in a hot business sector. LogMeIn is taking business away from large tech companies like Cisco. While this is a promising move, it also leaves the company open as an acquisition target from a larger rival, to capture the growth LogMeIn has shown in key areas of build your own app and internet of things.Shares of LogMeIn have risen 43% in 2014. Some of the gains came from an activist investment stake of 5.2%, from the investment vehicle formerly known as SAC Capital. Strong second quarter earnings also sent shares up double digits in after hours back in July. Shares are now up 174% in a five-year period. Despite the sharp increase, I think shares have more gains ahead."
2317925,47911,2014-07-16T12:10:11-04:00,LogMeIn is set to release quarterly results on July 24 and could see a stock appreciation of 20%.A significant number of new users opting for the paid Join.me service in the June quarter would contribute to an upward revision.Revenues from the Xively platform could contribute significantly in the June quarter.Positive impact from the favorable outcome of the patent litigation case is likely.,"On April 29, 2014, LogMeIn (NASDAQ:LOGM) reported $49m in revenue and $0.22 EPS for the March quarter vs. the consensus estimate of $47.1m and $.21, respectively. They also upped guidance for the full year by roughly $10m. This resulted in the share price shooting up 12% to $44. We strongly believe that management will report another strong result for the June quarter and will up full-year guidance again on July 24. This should result in the share price just crossing the $50 mark. At the time this was written, the stock price was at $40, representing an appreciation of 20%. The detailed reason for our thesis is given below.Management's underestimation of the monetizing potential of the installed join.me base will result in a continuing positive surprise.LogMeIn is the most popular remote computer access software/app available in the market. It is the most preferred application among IT managers compared to other services such as GoToMyPC and TeamViewer, which are more popular among personal users. There were an estimated 6-9m users of LogMeIn Free when the company decided to discontinue its free service at the end of January 2014. This resulted in 200,000 users migrating from free to paid subscriptions by the end of March. This was an exceptional success by any standard. The management in their earnings call mentioned that they believe that all the likely conversions have already happened. We disagree with this slightly early assumption based on the following facts:The Xively Internet of Things project has started to deliver results.We can't think of another company that has so quickly taken the IOT (Internet of Things) platform from a mere conceptual stage to that of actual revenue-earning projects. While others are still talking about how in the future IOT will enable one's refrigerator to reorder milk and eggs, LOGM's Xively platform is already delivering that service to all the refrigerators of the New England BioLabs. (Though I must clarify that those refrigerators do not store milk and eggs, but rather enzymes for molecular biology applications and genomic research!)We believe that Xively's results will be better than expected and will contribute in management's upward revision of the annual guidance for the following reasons:LOGM declared the acquisition of Ionia on May 7. Ionia has delivered close to 300 cloud/IOT-based solutions prior to the acquisition. The June quarter will see revenues from the Ionia portfolio be included into LOGM's revenues. Also, with the greater sales and marketing reach of LOGM, it is likely that Ionia consultants would have won more contracts for this quarter vs. what they would have being on their own.The Xively platform is also being used to monitor professional stormwater management, air quality across Europe, and atomic radiation levels across Japan. Apart from the above projects, the biggest opportunity for Xively is for it to be used as an integrating platform by other vendors active in the space of remote monitoring and control. The Xively website lists four such vendors (Verdeva, Eelektron, Turbid and CurrentCost) as their existing customers. We believe that in the past management had slightly underestimated the growth of Xively platform. The IOT trend is certainly heating up, and Xively's success with their initial projects would mean that more prospective customers see them as a market leader in this space and will reach out to LOGM proactively for solutions.Appeals court upholds the non-infringement ruling in the 01 Communique Patent Litigation Case.In Sep 2010, Communique Lab, Inc. filed a patent infringement lawsuit against LOGM in a U.S. district court. The court eventually ruled in favor of LOGM, in June 2013. Communique then filed an appeal in the U.S. court of appeals. On June 3, 2014, even the court of appeals reiterated that there is no patent infringement by LOGM. With this ruling, we believe that the case is finally put to rest. In the past, patent litigation related expenses have weighed heavily on the P&L statements, so therefore there is reason to believe that with this expense going away the June quarter should be positively affected (though I must admit that this effect would be rather small).A robust research pipeline pays off with better-designed products.A simple look at Google's patent search shows that LOGM has close to 25 different patents filed with the U.S. Patent Office in areas such as network, storage, file/object transfer, and remote access. The company spends close to 15% of their revenues on R&D and is committed to continue investing in it. This is clearly reflected in the superior design of their products and is likely to continue paying them dividends in years ahead. LOGM's products are essentially user apps, where intuitive usability and superior design directly translates to market share.A short call by a hedge fund has temporarily depressed the price.On July 9, 2014, independent research firm Off Wall Street rated LOGM as a ""sell"" with a target price of $30. Their rationale is twofold: OWS believes that the market for remotely accessing computers is saturated, and IT firms are switching to other providers. We instead believe that the research firm is mistaking personal users switching as a proxy for IT firms switching, which is a gross error as we explained above. The research firm has also completely missed the existing revenue and potential growth of the Xively platform, as discussed above.LOGM's response, on their corporate blog, to the short thesis has been along expected lines, where they have reiterated the current performance and growth potential of their existing platforms. However, the important takeaway from is that LOGM clearly declares that join.me is expected to grow in the triple digits in 2014. This leads us to believe that it's not just the earlier free customers who are converting to Pro, but also a very healthy rate of new customers.Post the short thesis, Steven Cohen's Point72 Asset Management (known as S.A.C. Capital before SEC-related issues brought about a name change) has disclosed a 5.2% stake in LOGM.SummaryWe believe a significant number of new users opted for the paid LogMeIn PRO service in the June quarter. Revenues from the Xively platform could also contribute significantly in the June quarter. A positive impact from the favorable outcome of the patent litigation case is also likely.Continuous investment in product design and development makes the company a good long-term investment. Before the short call by Off Wall Street, the stock was trading at around $47 and now trades around $40. We expect the stock to trade around $50 after the June quarter results on July 24.Disclosure: The author is long LOGM. The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.

1843412,41741,2013-11-15T12:38:20-05:00,,"Even with all the hype that DropBox, Windows 8's remote access tool, and Google Chrome's remote control feature, might cut into LogMeIn's (NASDAQ:LOGM) market share, the company continues its up-and-to-the right growth trend when it comes to revenues.The stock took it on the chin back in 2012 due to serious weakness in its European-based customer care service cloud offerings. The rescue segment in Europe had very rapid growth, which was nearly 30% in 2011, but slowed to single digits in Europe in 2012. However, the company has since worked through that.Innovation is at the heart of what is driving, and will continue to drive LogMeIn higher. The company is no longer just a company that provides remote computer access; it has a number of new products that will more than double its addressable market.What's LogMeIn?The company's two staple products include LogMeIn Free and LogMeIn Pro. LogMeIn Free allows remote access to off-site computers or internet-enabled devices. LogMeIn Pro is its paid service that allows users to have more than 10 computers on its account. As well, its additional features include the ability for file transfers, remote sound, printing locally from remote computers, and file syncing. Its availability extends to the iPad, iPhone and Android devices. The big difference is that LogMeIn runs right from the Web browser, compared to other products that must be downloaded to your computer.Meanwhile, a couple of other notable products include Cubby, which is a cloud-based storage and sharing service, and LogMeIn Rescue, which is a Web-based customer care service to support remote computers without pre-installed software. Another service is BoldChat, a web-based live chat and click to call service.Remote management services include LogMeIn Central, a web-based management console. LogMeIn Hamachi is a hosted virtual private network, or VPN, that sets up a computer network among remote computers. Its latest game changer is Cosm, which is a hosted service for running Internet of Things applications (more on this later).TailwindsLogMeIn has a number of tailwinds that should help continue pushing the stock higher, eventually getting the stock over $40. The first tailwind is that LogMeIn's products are still being well received in the market. Toptenreviews.com puts LogMeIn's remote access features as one of the top in the business.Source: toptenreviews.comAs well, About.com has LogMeIn's services at a 4.5 star (out of 5) rating. cnet.com also has a very robust rating for LogMeIn Free, a five star rating, while the average user rating is four stars.The other key tailwind for LogMeIn is innovation. As mentioned, LogMeIn's Cosm (beta name), now known as Xively, is embarking into a very hot market known as the Internet of Things. This includes a number of smart devices, from connected heart monitors to environmental sensors. And the real beauty is that the Xively service makes it easy for developers to connect devices to the internet and each other. From there, developers can then build interactive applications based on device generated data. There have already been a number of interesting projects built using Xively, including the Visualight smart light bulb, which is an open source Wi-Fi enabled lightbulb.What's one of the greatest aspects of LogMeIn's embarking on the Internet of Things is the market opportunity. Consider the fact that there's over 1 billion PCs, yet, there are over 50 billion devices that could be impacted by the Internet of Things.So, what Xively is doing is expanding LogMeIn's total addressable market. For 2012, LogMeIn was tackling a $5 billion market that covered access/collaboration and customer care, and by 2015, it expects to have a total addressable market of $13 billion, thanks in large part to its attack on the Internet of Things and cloud storage markets.Source: LOGMOn the latest earnings call, CEO Michael Simon noted the benefits for companies interested in partnering with LogMeIn for attacking the Internet of Things. These include ""the ability to have smart connected products, very, very rapidly reducing both the cost and time to market and perhaps equally importantly, reducing, let's say, the risk that they've architected incorrectly or that the manageability isn't there."" Looking at it another way, LogMeIn believes that Xively and AppGuru could bring bookings of $10 million next year. While that doesn't sound like much (5% of 2014 expected revenue), it's a step in the right direction. Up until now, LogMeIn Pro has been driving revenue, and so, we believe we are in the early stages of a revenue diversification and growth trend with Xively.Going into Salesforce.com's Dreamforce 2013 conference this month in San Francisco, Chad Jones, LogMeIn's VP of Product Strategy, added:""The cloud has already had a profound impact on the way businesses approach the customer experience, and we believe that the Internet of Things has the potential to transform how businesses deliver tomorrow's connect customer experiences. We're excited to not only provide Dreamforce attendees with a glimpse into the Internet of Things, but provide real examples of early business adopters who are already applying integrations with Salesforce.com and the Internet of Things to reshape their customer experience.""Investment thesisBack in March LogMeIn decided to limit the number of computers LogMeIn Free users could have on their account. This is a key move to get more paid users, and, let's face it, $249 per year (for LogMeIn Pro) isn't going to break most small businesses. The interesting dynamic is that they have managed to gather a very large user base given its free program, and now its finally looking to leverage that base. So, how has this fared so far? Well, the company has managed to beat EPS over the last two quarters.And the sky has become the limit. Over the last month, 11 analysts have upped their fiscal '13 estimates, with 6 upping their '14 estimates.With the company exhibiting an ability to adapt to a changing market and provide a service that consumers want, it's no surprise that revenues are expected to hit all-time highs in 2014.Driving this record-breaking sales growth? 85% of its revenues are from small businesses, and let's face it, small business budgets have been one of the most strained during the financial crisis. With a loosening of small business' purse strings, we should see a number of companies that are willing to pony up for premium and pro services. Meanwhile, the other 15% of revenues are derived from large companies. LogMeIn still calls over 50 of the world's largest telecom providers as customers.The other beauty about LogMeIn's revenue stream is that 95% of its contracts are annual, and it has an 80% renewal rate. Assuming 558,000 paying customers, with an average $249 per year subscription, the value of LogMeIn's paid user base is right at $700 million, or $29 per share. Then, adding in net cash, the fair value of the company is north of $37. Analysts have an average price target of around $36.50, which is just under 15% upside. And all the analysts are either bullish or neutral, with 7 having a 'buy' or 'strong buy' rating, and 4 having 'hold' ratings.Bottom lineGoing forward, the company has a number of growth levers it can pull, including putting its cash hoard to work on making key acquisitions. The cumulation of LogMeIn's services allow users the ability to work remotely. The advantages to LogMeIn's products are there, where working remotely allows users to reduce IT costs by reducing redundancies of infrastructure and servers. The business model is also highly scalable, with a gross margin that's nearly 90%.With fair value around $37 and with the company currently trading around $31.50, we see the downside as minimal and LogMeIn offering a solid risk/reward opportunity. We also see the opportunity for a short covering rally as the days to cover is currently 10 days, with 8.7% of the float currently short. We see this as something billionaire Steve Cohen is banking on in addition to LogMeIn's growth opportunities, as his SAC Capital is the largest individual shareholder in LogMeIn with a 7.5% stake.LogMeIn has confidence as well: it replaced its $25 million buyback program with a $50 million program. So far this year, the company has repurchased $20 million of its shares. CEO Michael Simon pretty much summed up the program with his assessment of LogMeIn's business:""This increased share repurchase program reflects the confidence of our Management Team and Board of Directors in LogMeIn's long-term growth strategy and leverages our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation.""Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1187731,42041,2013-02-15T10:34:04-05:00,,"Shares of LogMeIn (NASDAQ:LOGM) are in the spotlight after remote-access software maker forecasted first-quarter earnings Thursday, much below analysts' expectations. The company expects first quarter adjusted earnings of 9 cents to 10 cents per share on revenue of $36 million to $36.5 million. Analysts were expecting earnings of 18 cents per share on revenue of $38.2 million.LogMeIn shares plunged more than 25% to below $18 after closing the day at $23.66 yesterday.(Click to enlarge)Revenue for the fourth quarter grew 14% to $37 million, in line with expectations. But the company predicted a revenue range of $154 million and $157 million for fiscal year 2013, below the $164 million expected by analysts, with an EPS range of 43-49 cents compared to the Street forecast of 81 cents.LogMeIn, which mainly targets small businesses and consumers, said it expects its tax rate to be around 50 percent in the current quarter, up from an effective tax rate of 39 percent in the fourth quarter. The company also announced a $25 million stock repurchase plan. The company also said revenue growth in Access and Collaboration will offset slower growth in both the RMM and Customer Care services.Current ValuationLogMeIn trades at 30 times trailing earnings. The company's expectations are for ~$0.47 in EPS for the current fiscal year, and the current stock price of ~$18 is 38 times that figure, compared to its peer average of 21x. LogMeIn has a stable cash flow generation, and when I look at the enterprise value implied by the current stock price, it is 33.50x trailing EBITDA, much higher than the rest of the industry.(Click to enlarge)LogMeIn earnings have not grown in correlation with its revenue, I'll like to see similar growth rates there. This will also explain why a ~5 percent decrease in revenue guidance, resulted in the almost 50% reduction in earnings forecast.(Click to enlarge)Moreover, the firm's free cash flow margin is deceptive, as it's significantly affected by the deferred revenue accountings; when adjusted for it, FCF will almost be flat. All told, I think in order to justify current valuations, LogMeIn will have to grow its free cash flow at a 10% rate for the long term, which doesn't look like a possibility now.In short, LogMeIn is expensive relative to its peers and also by many financial metrics. It is my view that after the weak forecast, the risk to LogMeIn fundamentals have overwhelmingly skewed to the downside, which presents a very clear and intriguing trading opportunity on the short side. However, I would wait for the shares to rebound to the mid-to-high $19 level, as the shares present an attractive risk/reward there. Around $20 is where I'll initiate a short position.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The stock made new highs on Friday and has benefitted from two recent upgrades. Let's examine.  LogMeln was first upgraded by J.P. Morgan a week and a half ago. Based on what we read and the technical action in the stock, we see potential upside into the low-to-mid $40s by year-end. Here are the brief bullet points from J.P. Morgan’s upgrade on Thursday: On Friday, the stock was upgraded by Piper Jaffrey. According to Piper, LogMeln will release another new product called One2Many next quarter. Although this product is expected to account for only 5% of 2012 revenues for the company, Piper feels that a higher multiple is warranted as the company proves its ability to add new products to its existing portfolio.  “Something new,” whether it is a new product, new management, or a new secular trend in an industry, is often the catalyst for outsized gains in a company’s sales and earnings and, ultimately, in its stock price. This could be the case for LogMeln. Traders quickly responded to Piper’s upgrade with consistent buying all day on Friday. It should be noted that volume only improved 10% over its average daily volume. The action was nonetheless still impressive.For now, we like what we see and would like to add to our small position in the name on pullbacks next week. We don’t envision this position becoming meaningful. Nonetheless, the company is an Apps play in the right space and we can easily see the market giving the company a much higher valuation should the current market tape improve into a strong up-trend in the coming months.Disclosure: Long LOGM"

As is usually the case, the stock backed off a bit once the hype of the deal dissipated, and by August the stock was testing the $16. IPO level. By the middle of this month the stock had successfully tested the initial price and broke to new highs in the low $20’s which is where the stock was positioned coming into the earnings announcement.The third quarter looked very positive with the company reporting revenue of $19 million which is up 32%. Earnings were also strong with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.12 compared to $0.05 last year. During the quarter the company generated operating cash flow of $7.1 million compared to $4.3 million last year, so the business model is certainly strong with the only question being how quickly and effectively management can scale in the future.Investors appear to have been disappointed with the company guidance for the fourth quarter. Management is guiding revenue expectations toward a range of $19.6 to $19.9 million which is 22% growth over the fourth quarter last year. Earnings should come in between 11 and 12 cents per share so the high end “only” represents a 100% increase over last year. Considering the last 3 quarters have shown a minimum of 200% growth in earnings per share, this number could be disappointing to investors who have bid up the price of LOGM based on aggressive growth assumptions.Looking at the financial strength of the company, it appears that LogMeIn is in a great spot to capitalize on growth opportunities with a strong war-chest of capital. Currently the company is sitting on cash of $121 million which includes $84.5 million which was raised in the IPO transaction. In the prospectus for this offering, the company announced that it intended to use the capital for development of new services, sales and marketing activities and capital expenditures. These investments should continue to assist the company in growing its customer base and developing strong revenue growth.One of the newest products (LogMeIn Central) appears to be generating revenue and strong interest within the firm’s customer base. Michael Simon (President and CEO) had this to say about the new product’s performance in the third quarter:Analysts are currently only forecasting 9% earnings growth in 2010 which leaves expectations at $0.59 per share. However, with a significant amount of cash, a positive operating business model, and growth initiatives underway, I expect these expectations to prove conservative. Employers are continually looking for ways to make their workforce more competitive and efficient and LogMeIn provides some excellent tools to drive these initiatives.Thursday’s trading has LOGM rebounding after two days of selling. It appears that investors are being offered a chance to buy stock at a discount before the stock continues to run ahead of company growth. I am strongly considering adding a position in this hot technology company to the ZachStocks Growth Model as we have a significant amount of cash on the sidelines waiting to be put to work. The stock certainly carries some risk with the high price tag, but based on management’s ability to grow earnings, I believe this could be a strong position for 2010.Disclosure: Author does not have a position in LOGM."

After all, LogMeIn raised $107.2 million or so in a stock market that stinks.The Wall Street Journal says hats off to Integral Capital Partners, an investor in LogMeIn and OpenTable. Others see the LogMeIn IPO as one of those fabled economic “green shoots” everyone is looking for. And while we’re at it, let’s cheer for the underwriters too. Congrats J.P. Morgan, Barclays Capital, Thomas Weisel, Piper Jaffray and RBC Capital. Rest assured the buy ratings will appear in a few weeks from those aforementioned firms.The rest of us, however, really don’t give a hoot about this circle of congratulations. Do you buy LogMeIn or not?Here’s my analysis of the LogMeIn prospectus:LogMeIn has 70 million connected devices and offers a bevy of services for PC rescue, remote management, backup and virtual network assess.Here’s the roster:LogMeIn has a big market to tackle: The midsized company to SMB market. And there’s plenty of runway: As of March 31, LogMeIn had 188,000 paying customers, up from 122,000 a year ago. There are also 22.1 million registered users with LogMeIn.The average selling price isn’t half bad. LogMeIn says in its prospectus.Intel is a partner. In 2007, LogMeIn cut a deal with Intel to built in LogMeIn connectivity to its components. Intel is also an investor.LogMeIn just turned profitable. For the three months ending March 31, LogMeIn reported net income of $1.5 million on $17.2 million in revenue, up from $9.9 million in the same quarter a year ago. LogMeIn turned its first profit in the third quarter of 2008. For 2008, the company lost $7.75 million on revenue of $51.7 million.It competes with Citrix and WebEx. Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS) is the primary competition for LogMeIn and it is entrenched in the enterprise and can extend downstream relatively easily. WebEx is another potential worry since it’s owned by Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). LogMeIn also expects to compete with “current or potential services offered by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).”LogMeIn has to convert customers to premium services. The company has 188,000 paying customers out of more than 22 million registered users. LogMeIn has to continue to convert those free riders.IT spending. LogMeIn does have an on-demand model, which in theory benefits from the recession but it plays in the SMB space, which requires a lot of evangelizing.SMBs are flighty. This passage sums it all up.Bottom line: LogMeIn looks promising and is definitely worth a spot on the watchlist. Buying on an IPO launch, however, rarely pays off."
146831,22829,2009-07-03T04:42:19-04:00,,"by Brenon DalyOne of the investment banks that profited the most from Wednesday’s  strong  debut of LogMeIn (NASDAQ:LOGM) wasn’t even on the prospectus. Instead, it was in the prospectus. McNamee Lawrence, an advisory shop with no underwriting business, realized a tidy little $2m windfall from the IPO.Heading into the offering, McNamee Lawrence held some 99,000 shares in LogMeIn that it picked up in late 2004 for helping to place the startup’s series A funding round, as well as other advisory work. McNamee Lawrence took a small amount of money off the table, selling some 21,000 shares at the $16 initial pricing of LogMeIn. That netted the bank about $336,000. It still holds some 78,000 shares, which had a paper value of about $1.6m, based on the price of LogMeIn shares on Thursday afternoon.Granted, the holdings of McNamee Lawrence are only a tiny slice of the overall 21.4 million LogMeIn shares outstanding. And the firm’s stake is a fraction of the major owners of LogMeIn, Prism Venture Partners and Polaris Venture Partners. Prism holds shares worth about $80m, while Polaris, which sold $7.4m worth of shares in the offering, still owns a chunk valued at about $59m.Still, the shares represent a nice windfall for McNamee Lawrence. (In addition, some of the firm’s partners put money individually into LogMeIn in the company’s seed round in early 2004.) Of course, the practice of taking paper as payment was pretty common across all kinds of service providers back in the Bubble Era, when startups routinely handed out options and warrants to cover bills from banks, lawyers and even landlords. After so many people got burned by taking worthless options and warrants in the early 2000s, however, cash returned as the currency of choice."

The Massachusetts-based company provides remote-connectivity solutions to small and medium sized businesses and plans to trade on the NASDAQ.Could a successful IPO cause some unintended consequences for tech M&A activity? According to Om Malik, ""A LogMeIn offering could result in more technology mergers and acquisitions. The possibility of more IPOs may drive up prices for likely buyout candidates, giving buyers a much-needed impetus to loosen their purse strings and snap up likely candidates.""

146095,20856,2009-06-30T03:00:47-04:00,,"As markets trade higher to start off the week, underwriters for the new LogMeIn IPO are likely drumming up interest in the latest offering to hit Wall Street.  The IPO market has been relatively slow over the past year as the bear market has reduced the amount of liquidity and made such offerings very difficult.  But the spring rally has made it possible for several new stock offerings to come to market helping companies raise much needed cash for their businesses.On the block for a possible offering this week is LogMeIn, Inc. (NASDAQ:LOGM) which is the primary provider of on-demand remote-connectivity solutions to small and medium sized businesses as well as individual consumers.  Essentially the technology allows users to log onto their home or office computers from any web browser, making sure that all data is easily accessible and yet still providing for secure connections in order to protect sensitive information.  There are several tiers of service offered including a basic free service all the way up to deluxe premium products.  As of March 31, the company boasted 188,000 premium accounts and continues to grow their subscriber base very quickly.The LogMeIn IPO is expected to raise about $67 million for the company, assuming the stock prices in the middle of the $14 to $16 expected range.  In addition to the 5 million shares being sold by the company, an additional 1,666,667 shares will be sold by existing shareholders which largely include private venture capital firms as well as company executives.  At this point it looks like the executives are selling a reasonably small portion of their holdings, which helps investors maintain confidence that the executives have an incentive to continue to grow the business.While the remote-connectivity concept is very useful and popular (especially for road warriors and those of us with dual home / business offices), only recently has LogMeIn been able to capitalize on its success and post a profit.  Looking into the financial statements, it is amazing to see how much money the company spends on sales and marketing.  In 2006, the company spent 88 cents in marketing expenses for every dollar received in revenue.  But the efforts appear to have paid off with revenue growing by 139% in 2007, 91% in 2008, and 73% in the first quarter of 2009.  As revenues have caught up with high fixed costs, the company is inching closer to profitability with the first quarter actually posting pro-forma EPS of 0.10.Although the growth is impressive, the price tag on the LogMeIn IPO may be a bit excessive.  Analyst expectations are still hard to come by, but annualizing the first quarter numbers, it is likely the company will earn 40 to 60 cents in 2009.  With the stock price likely to start near $15, the PE will be roughly 30.  When the market is healthy, multiples of 30 on growth stocks are commonplace and often expand to much higher levels.  But in an environment where consumer and business spending is constrained, it is likely that this multiple could prove a bit dangerous.The company has relatively little debt, so the threat of default is not an issue for investors.  However, the expanded advertising budget could quickly burn through new cash if corresponding revenue does not continue to flow.  The technology sector is highly competitive and LogMeIn believes that it will face threats from similar services in the coming quarters.  There is no guarantee that the company will be able to maintain its leadership in this niche business, especially with companies like Citrix Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CTXS) and and Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) using deep pockets to develop and promote similar products.The lead underwriters who handle the LogMeIn IPO are set to be JP Morgan and Barclays Capital, which are relatively well respected firms.  Thomas Weisel Partners, Piper Jaffray, and RBC Capital Markets are also on the deal ensuring that there will be a relatively wide distribution for the new stock offering.  With the market starting out higher this week, I wouldn’t be surprised to see the deal come at or above the high end of the range ($16 or above) and possibly trade up from that level on the initial deal hype.  These underwriters often do a good job of creating a perceived shortage of stock on the deal which can lead to more buying pressure on the day the IPO is launched.  But once the hype wears off in the following few days, LOGM will likely be vulnerable to a quick negative move.  At that point, any additional weakness in consumer spending or in the broad markets could push the stock down to the low teens or even single digits.So while the LogMeIn IPO may generate some near-term buzz and help to develop confidence in market liquidity, the deal appears a bit dangerous and I would not recommend holding deal stock beyond the first few days of trading.Disclosure Author does not have any positions in LOGM and does not have immediate plans to participate in the deal."
60191,21168,2008-01-15T05:39:33-05:00,,"I see that remote PC services start-up LogMeIn (NASDAQ:LOGM) is going to conduct an IPO on Nasdaq in the not too distant future, pointing up the vibrancy of the intersection of cloud computing and the personal computer. And the encouraging growth that LogMeIn has enjoyed
shows that cloud, remote maintenance and the long-term health of the PC
are all quite mutually compatible, thank you. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has it right
when they chime about ""software and services,"" just as there will be the need for PCs and the cloud services that they will increasingly rely on for a long time. So congrats to LogMeIn, they are a great bunch of folks. Disclosure: LogMeIn has been a sponsor of BriefingsDirect podcasts. I am sure glad I had that chat about the Web as operating system way back when with Mike and Joe. This intention of filing
seems only the beginning of LogMeIn's next phase. According to the
filing, LogMeIn plans to raise up to $86 million from the IPO, but this
could change. It may not be that large of a sum, but it shows how
Internet firms don't require the capital they used to to grow
substantially. And there's always the possibility of LogMeIn making
acquisitions to fill out its services and support portfolio. Nice
thing about the LogMeIn services is that they straddle the consumer,
SOHO, SMB and enterprise markets. The services can cut across them all
-- adding value while cutting costs on the old way of doing things.
Nice recipe these days. More telcos and service providers will need
such abilities too. As I've said, I expect to see more telcos buying software and services vendors
in 2008 to expand their offerings beyond the bit-pipe and entertainment
content stuff. If you can serve it up on subscription, do it
broadly and monetize the infrastructure in as many ways as possible."

Click here to find out more Â»Liberated Syndication (OTCQB:LSYN) is a long because it is in the middle of much-needed corporate governance and operational reform, the search for a new CEO, and a renewed focus on its bread and butter-podcasting. While the past few years have been discouraging for micro-cap investors, we believe that recent activist involvement will help unlock significant value for LSYN shareholders.LSYN is a mainstay of the podcasting world, having helped podcasters host and distribute their shows since 2004. Yet while the company was ahead of the curve in recognizing the power of podcasting, poor governance has harmed the company's reputation in the public markets.That story is beginning to change. A recent proxy campaign has shaken up a stagnant board, with activist investors starting to clean up governance issues. Critically, the long-standing CEO and CFO have either left or have been removed from their management duties.Simply put, years of poor capital allocation and excessive executive compensation made the company an excellent candidate for activist involvement. Now that it has happened, the company is in a great place to raise operating income margins, improve the core Libsyn product, and return free cash flow to shareholders.LSYN's story is one of a company that has made self-imposed mistakes, yet has had real staying power in a rapidly growing sector. A positive free cash flow SaaS business trading at around 12x EBITDA, we believe that the company has intriguing upside potential as a reinvigorated board and new management take the reins.The company is made up of two primary divisions: Webmayhem Inc. (Libsyn) and Pair Networks. Libsyn is the company's podcast hosting division while Pair is focused on web hosting and domain registration.LibsynLibsyn has been serving podcasters since 2004. The core of its value proposition is relatively the same then as it is today. The company offers tools like hosting, storage, bandwidth, and RSS creation tools, effectively letting podcasters release and distribute episodes to their viewers. The core technology of podcasting is relatively simple and hasn't changed much. Podcasters upload their edited shows to Libsyn and Libsyn provides the hosting, storage, and other tools needed to distribute their episodes to major podcast directories like Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Pandora, and more.Essentially, without using a hosting company like Libsyn or one of its competitors, podcast producers aren't able to access these crucial podcast directories.Hosting fees are persistent and made up around 76% of Libsyn's revenue in FY 2019 (70% in 2018). These hosting fees vary, with the lowest being $5 per month and the largest being around $150 per month. Like other SaaS tools, Libsyn's hosting plans offer different features, including those found below:Source: LSYN Investor Presentation.The main difference between these basic plans relates to storage limits. For podcasters who push episodes at least once per week, the Classic 50 and Classic 250 plans likely won't provide enough sufficient storage. For those podcasters who need even more storage, Libsyn offers two additional hosting plans.Source: Libsyn.LibsynPro, which is an enterprise solution that includes more sophisticated network features and dedicated support, comprised around 17% of revenues in FY 2019. LibsynPro offers features like multi-user account management, unlimited uploads of new content, advertising campaign management tools, and more. Some of the more well-known shows that use LibsynPro include the following:Source: LibsynPro.Libsyn's remaining revenue sources come from app subscriptions (3%) and advertising (4%).The basic value proposition behind app subscriptions is that podcast creators can get a custom app and website. From there, podcasters can offer subscriptions to their episodes and offer premium content. Subscriptions are offered on a one-month, six-month, or yearly basis, and the company takes a cut of the subscription revenue.Then, there is advertising. Libsyn's Ad Sales team works with agencies and advertisers to provide advertising opportunities for podcasters. That being said, Libsyn is still trying to figure it out. Year-over-year, advertising revenue fell from 10% to 3% of overall revenue due to decreased advertiser spending. This has been especially true during COVID-19, as advertisers have decided to cut back spending on ad campaigns. Ultimately, creating a compelling advertising product could attract even more podcasters to the platform, which will consequently lead to more sticky hosting fees.PairPair is actually older than Libsyn. Founded in 1996, it was one of the earlier companies that provided Internet hosting services. LSYN acquired Pair in December 2017 for about $16 million in cash and stock. While Libsyn gets the lion's share of the company's attention, Pair makes up around 40% of the company's sales.Similar to those in the podcasting space, designers and creators need a website host so that users can visit their websites. Web hosting companies like Pair rent out servers so that customers can easily and securely get their websites online. Not only that, but Pair and its competitors consistently monitor their servers so that customers' websites experience little (if any) downtime.Like Libsyn, Pair offers different types of hosting plans as part of monthly subscriptions. Its most popular hosting plan is its Managed WordPress plan, which makes it easy for customers to quickly design and host their WordPress websites.Source: Pair Pricing.Pair's more expensive plans offer virtual private servers or dedicated servers. These are more personalized plans that let users have servers specifically allocated for their use. They are specifically catered for businesses or fast-growing websites that need higher levels of security and performance.Source: LSYN Investor Presentation.Pair's bread and butter is Internet hosting. It made up 90% of Pair's revenue in FY 2019. That said, Pair also offers custom domains for Top Level Domains. This means that a user can visit Pair and obtain domains ending in dot-com, dot-org, dot-net, or other variants. Users purchase their domain for one to ten years and the price range of domain purchases varies from $4 to $70 per year.The Internet hosting and domain registration spaces are extremely competitive. Pair has plenty of competitors, ranging from hosting companies like Bluehost, HostGator, and Wix (WIX) to GoDaddy (GDDY) and Namecheap in the domain registration space. Hosting and domain registration are essentially commodities, yet Pair tries to differentiate itself through its focus on customer service and reliability.Upon first glance at the company's stock chart, you'd think that all has been smooth sailing since the spin.Source: Koyfin.The company has around a $93 million market cap, an enterprise value of around $82 million, and has around 87% gross margins (LTM). On its first day of trading in August 2016, the company had a market cap of only $3 million. There are plenty of tailwinds in the podcasting industry, from eye-popping acquisitions of hosting companies and individual shows to increasing numbers of shows and listeners year over year.Will all of that said, Camac Partners recently began a campaign against the company, eventually winning three board seats on the six-director board. In its initial correspondence with the company, the activist argued that ""It is long-past time for meaningful improvements at Libsyn.""Activist CriticismSo what gives? Much of the turbulence and criticism of the company comes down to management behavior, shareholder, dilution, excessive executive compensation, and poor capital allocation. You can read some of the commentary here, but the activist essentially argued that management has been significantly hampering the company's growth potential.In April 2019, Camac announced a special meeting request to propose the removal of all four existing directors. Camac has held around 6.5% of outstanding shares since 2017. After successfully gaining enough stockholder support to call for a special meeting, Camac and the company entered into a settlement agreement.Among the settlement terms included the formation of a strategic review committee (chaired by Camac's founder Eric Shahinian), the appointment of three independent directors (Shahinian, Bradley Tirpak, and Brian Kibby), the cancellation of restricted shares previously issued to Spencer and Busshaus and the reimbursement of $600,000 of Camac's expenses related to its activist campaign. Several days ago, Tirpak was appointed board chairman.Already, the newly constituted board has made progress in cleaning up some of the company's governance issues.Pared Back Executive CompensationNo discretionary bonuses were granted to executive officers in FY 2019, and the board did not adopt a long-term executive incentive compensation plan. In addition, any future incentive long-term incentive plans will be based on ROIC, free cash flow generation, and total shareholder return. With executive compensation being such a significant issue in the activist campaign, the new board members have moved swiftly to pare back excessive executive compensation. Long-term focus on ROIC and free cash flow generation is also an extremely positive step so that management's future incentives are aligned with shareholders.Correcting Financial Statement ErrorsThe new board members have also worked to fix the damage from some undiscovered errors. In late April 2020, an IRS audit revealed material errors from the FY 2018 financial statements. Specifically, the company miscalculated its NOL carryforward. Its $14 million NOL was overstated by $12.5 million, and the company should have been recording tax expenses in FY 2018. Along with amending the company's 2018 financial statements, the company owes its pending tax balance this year (which is around $585,000). Essentially, this error required the company to revise its net income number upward in FY 2018. While bookkeeping errors are never great, it's encouraging to see the new directors and CFO quickly fix these issues.A Renewed Focus on PodcastingThen, there is the strategic review committee. This is arguably the most compelling question for investors, as the podcasting industry has been home to many significant acquisitions in the past few years. The most notable is Anchor. In February 2019, Spotify (SPOT) acquired Anchor for â¬136 million (about $150 million). Anchor is one of the closer comps to the company and arguably its greatest competitor. Most notably, it offers podcast hosting services for free and offers monetization opportunities for its podcasting case. This was the most prominent acquisition of a podcasting hosting company in recent years.After spending several months on the strategic review process, the company announced that it would be pursuing organic growth opportunities in the podcasting space. It also appointed a merchant bank called West Arrow to act as a strategic advisor in evaluating potential M&A and growth activities. While an acquisition appears off the table for now, a renewed focus on podcasting and cleaning up internal governance issues may increase the odds of a potential acquisition in the future.New ManagementFinally, one of the most important developments in the company's story is that it is looking for a new CEO. Chris Spencer's resignation only occurred days ago and marks an end to Spencer's tenure at the company. Since 2001, Spencer was the CEO and President of FAB Universal, which was the former parent company of Libsyn.Simply put, we believe this is a positive step forward for the company. Yet while Spencer is out as CEO, the company is retaining him as an advisor to, among other things, assist the company with the strategic review and transition plan. He is still being paid his current year's salary and a $215,000 yearly salary for his consulting work through 2023, but he is also surrendering around 550,000 shares for failing to hit several milestones as CEO. Last quarter, the company also purchased approximately 1.35 million of Spencer's shares for around $3 per share.The board is beginning its search for new leadership. We're excited about the company's opportunity for the board to find a highly motivated CEO that can improve the Libsyn product, increase operating income margins, and return free cash to shareholders. Considering the newly constituted board, we are confident that the new CEO will be attuned to these concerns as the company continues to grow.In the meantime, company president Laurie Sims has taken on the additional role of COO. The company also announced that Richard P. Heyse would be its new CFO. While he has served as CFO for three publicly traded companies, Heyse has most recently been an interim CFO and consultant for private companies (like ACA Compliance Group). Heyse has a two-year employment term which can be renewed every year thereafter.The company was a great candidate for activist involvement. The governance problems were all too real. Putting these important governance considerations to the side, however, we believe that the pure economics and growth prospects are promising.Central to Libsyn's growth thesis is (1) bringing more podcasters onto its hosting platform and (2) keeping them on the platform.New User GrowthAs for the first objective, Libsyn is doing a great job. Looking at podcast show creation, growth has been promising. In the past three fiscal years, podcast show growth has increased by more than 20% year-over-year. Covid-19 has actually been relatively positive for podcasting. According to the company, April 2020 was even the second-largest increase in new podcast signups on record. In June, mobile listening for Libsyn podcasts hit an all-time high.Yes, there are major competitors (like Anchor) that offer free hosting. Libsyns's user interface, to put it lightly, is in need of an upgrade. Yet Libsyn still has positive name recognition and is known for its reliability. Well-known podcasters like Pat Flynn have spoken highly of the company.To address the outdated user interface, management is promoting Libsyn 5. It is the company's ""biggest project to date"" and is set to be rolled out later this year. Along with an updated user interface, the company is building out additional advertising tools for podcasters. This is an important opportunity for the company's new CEO, as some of the company's fiercest podcasting competitors are investing in monetization opportunities for their creators.In terms of overall growth, strong podcasting tailwinds will likely keep the growth story intact. Simply put, more individuals and companies are creating podcasts. It is estimated that there are over 1,000,000 podcasts. While niche creators and podcasters were at the forefront of podcasting, more SMEs and larger companies are participating. These larger enterprise clients are promising for Libsyn's growth story. They offer stickier revenue compared to individual podcasters who produce a few episodes and then give up.Not only are more consumers listening to podcasts, but those consumers are loyal and affluent. 45% of monthly podcast listeners have household incomes of over $75,000 and podcast listeners skew younger. We are still in the early innings of podcasting, yet individual creators and large companies are bullish on its potential. Simply put, the medium isn't going away anytime soon-especially because it has not yet been fully monetized.User RetentionAs far as the second objective, the company doesn't break out specific figures related to user churn and user retention. That being said, we believe that the quality of Libsyn's podcast roster is much greater than its competitors. By this, we mean that Libsyn podcasters are more active and are less likely to give up podcasting compared to free hosting platforms.The data isn't ideal, as it is from December 2018. However, a study from Daniel J. Lewis from The Audacity to Podcast is insightful. While free-to-use tools like Anchor and SoundCloud host more podcasts, they also host more inactive podcasts.According to Lewis, ""A shockingly high number of Anchor users have three or fewer episodes, indicating very new shows or very uncommitted podcasters.""Lewis found that 38% of Libsyn's podcasts were inactive and 8.1% had three or fewer episodes. This is significantly less than Anchor (58.3% inactive and 57.7% with three or fewer episodes), SoundCloud (59.5% inactive and 32.4% with three or fewer episodes), and Podbean (44.7% inactive and 24.7% with three or fewer episodes). Another 2018 study by Chartable found that Libsyn powered around 28% of the top 400 podcasts in the United States. This leads other notable competitors like Anchor and SoundCloud.While the data isn't as recent as we'd like, it raises the important point that Libsyn's quality of users remains very high. Libsyn is leading the field in retaining users while having a very active creator base.Then there is the question of user retention related to migration. The simple act of moving a podcast from one hosting company to another isn't overly complicated. Libsyn and its competitors offer pretty seamless migration options. However, there are risks.As users of the Libsyn platform ourselves, we can say firsthand that there are subtle switching costs. Not only may there be technical challenges in making the switch, but podcasters may see a drop in their download numbers. Along with this, switching to a less-reliable podcast host can lead to broken promises, technical challenges, and subpar support.A sign of Libsyn's stickiness is from user feedback. Some recent user commentary is below:Source: Reddit.We believe that Libsyn has some semblance of a hosting moat. While nothing is actually stopping podcast hosts from switching to another provider, inertia often rules the day. The main concerns for Libsyn would be customers moving away from Libsyn due to (1) extreme price sensitivity or (2) more features or monetization opportunities.It's hard to compete with free. Some of Libsyn's most cost-sensitive customers may find it compelling to switch to Buzzsprout, Anchor, or another free podcast host to avoid $15 or $20 monthly fees. The larger danger, however, is the fact that some of these free alternatives provide better statistics and monetization opportunities. A hosting company that offers hosting, in-depth statistics, and plenty of advertising opportunities-all for free-is arguably Libsyn's biggest threat.We'll see if Libsyn can respond through Libsyn 5 and more advertising opportunities for creators. That said, this isn't a winner-take-all market. The new CEO will need to focus on this opportunity as creators are looking for easy ways to monetize their work.Libsyn is clearly the most important asset at the company. It's a mainstay in a high-growth industry and will be the primary catalyst behind any potential acquisition.Like Libsyn, Pair's hosting and domain sales represent subscription sales (often for about one year, although they can be longer). While these sales are often sticky, Pair differs from Libsyn in that it can't rely on brand name recognition. Pair doesn't crack the top 30 in web hosting market share and domain name registration. Domains and web hosting services are cutthroat markets, and it's unclear whether Pair is going to break through the noise.In the meantime, Pair is overshadowing Libsyn's growth. The first six months of 2020 have shown slight revenue decreases in Pair revenue compared to the prior year. Yes, Pair is contributing fewer costs and operating expenses YoY. It is also generating some modest cash for the company. That said, the new management team needs to carefully consider Pair's next steps-especially with the company's renewed focus on podcasting.Notwithstanding the turmoil over corporate governance, the company's financials are still strong. In the selected annual financials below, you can also see that the company's financials look dramatically different after the Pair acquisition in late 2017.Source: Company financials and SOR estimates.Here is more recent quarterly data from Q1 2019. The company announced its Q2 earnings on August 14.Source: Company financials and SOR estimates.One of the most notable things is that the company's largest operating expenses are G&A expenses. Specifically, there was a 40% increase in SG&A expenses from FY 2018 to FY 2019 alone, primarily due to bonus accruals and legal and advisory fees.The good news is that the activist and new board members have made it a priority to substantially pare back executive compensation. Along with this, litigation fees-especially those related to the activist campaign-will dramatically decrease. We have already started to see this play out, as operating income YoY increased by over 100%. Last quarter's SG&A spend declined to 26.6% of sales, which is a major improvement compared to even last quarter. We expect SG&A expenses to continue normalizing, thereby increasing the company's operating income and operating margins.Along with this, the company has a solid balance sheet and generates significant free cash flow. The company's $19.4 million in cash represents around 21% of the company's market cap. Net debt is negative and capex is relatively stable year-over-year, representing about 1.5% to 2% of sales. Free cash flow was over $7 million in FY 2019. With such small capex requirements and persistent operating cash flow, the company has been able to build a solid cash balance notwithstanding prior management's poor capital allocation decisions.The company's ROC has also been very high in the past few years. We subscribe to Greenblatt's definition of ROC as EBIT divided by capital employed (net working capital plus net fixed assets minus excess cash). In FY 2018 and 2019, the company respectively had 4.08 and 3.68 million in EBIT and 3.87 and 4.5 million of capital employed, leading to ROC north of 80% for both years.In the end, what we have here is a small, promising business that has continued to grow amidst many self-imposed headwinds. In all likelihood, the new management team will commit fewer unforced errors and trim some of the bloated SG&A expenses that have occurred for years.LSYN is a small and often overlooked stock. As with many micro-caps, the company's stock is quite illiquid. There is no analyst coverage of the stock and the company does not provide guidance. An uplisting to NASDAQ or NYSE would be positive, yet the company has been talking about this for several years. We hope that the company more seriously pursues this idea in the near future.LSYN currently trades at around 12x EBITDA, 34x earnings, and a little more than 3x EV/sales (all numbers LTM). Historically, the company has received a discount due to its poor corporate governance, checkered past, extremely small size, and presence on the pink sheets.Most of the company's purest comps are privately held or are consolidated within a much larger company (like Anchor). The purest publicly traded comp is Audioboom Group plc (BOOM). Audioboom is a self-described ""leading spokenâword audio platform for hosting, distributing and monetizing content."" It has a market cap of Â£27 million, trades at an EV/sales of 1.14 and generated around $22 million in revenue in FY 2019. That said, Audioboom delivered an extremely low 22% gross margin and has around negative $7 million in EBITDA. Acast (OTCPK:CAST), another LSYN competitor based in Sweden, consistently generates losses.LSYN is clearly on another level, as has almost always generated positive net income and positive free cash flow. There is a good argument to be made that the company should be trading at a multiple equivalent to a smaller cap SaaS company, due to the company's recurring revenue streams, asset-light structure, and growth opportunities. Per data from Aswath Damodaran, the standard SaaS company trades at around 20x EBITDA, 67x earnings, and 7.5x EV/sales (only positive EBITDA firms were included). While these were pre-COVID numbers, they are insightful to show the opportunity for multiple expansion. Even with a size and liquidity discount, LSYN should see higher multiples with new management and more disciplined operators.We can see Libsyn's potential through an extremely simple, back-of-the-envelope valuation. To date, the company has generated around $12.6 million in revenue. Being conservative, we are assuming similar revenue figures in Q3 and Q4-even though Libsyn 5 is expected to launch in the second half of this year. Operating margins will continue to expand, as the new board and management team focus on reducing SG&A expenses and eliminating one-time costs (like litigation fees) that existed in FY 2019. In the first half of 2020, operating margins have totaled 26.5%. For the sake of argument, we are assuming operating margins will equate 25% for the FY 2020.In FY 2021, we then expect the company's revenue growth rate to expand due to the full rollout of Libsyn 5, a higher-quality user base paying reliable hosting fees, improved execution by the new management team, and sustained tailwinds in the podcasting industry as a whole. While we expect operating margins to continue increasing, even sustained 25% operating margins are significant. Using these assumptions and modest EBITDA multiple expansion, we get to a price that is substantially higher than the company's current price.Source: Company financials and SOR estimates.Another way that we can look at the company is to use a precedent transaction analysis. We can compare its price to the price Spotify paid for Anchor (approximately $150 million). While the data is hard to come by, Chartable reported that Anchor powered 15% of all podcasts on the market at the time of the acquisition. It was estimated that there were around 700,000 podcasts at that time, meaning that Spotify paid about $1,428 per show.There are now around 1,000,000 podcasts and Libsyn, according to its latest 10Q, hosts approximately 74,000 of them. Using these figures, Libsyn's price would be around $106 million (about 14% above its current market cap and 30% above its enterprise value). That said, the comparison doesn't count for Libsyn's higher-quality podcaster base, the increased value of the podcasting space since the Anchor acquisition, the fact that Libsyn generates sticky hosting revenue from its users (where Anchor doesn't), and that you would be getting Pair for free.There are several risks to the thesis.First, there is the risk that the board appoints an ineffective CEO that fails to execute. We feel that this risk is mitigated because of the activists' presence on the board. In all likelihood, they are going to find a CEO that buys into their focus on increasing growth, cutting bloated SG&A expenses, and increasing shareholder value.Next, the company may not be able to capture new podcast and web hosting growth. New podcasters and website creators have plenty of hosting options. Acquiring new customers can be difficult, especially as Libsyn is competing against free. Yet Libsyn has been competing against free offerings for some time now. Libsyn's brand name and reputation, along with a much-needed product upgrade, will continue to attract creators. As for Pair, the new CEO will need to develop a growth strategy to capture more market share in the web hosting and domain verticals. The task will be difficult, but it isn't impossible.Next, podcasters could leave the platform for other hosting companies. This is especially true if those users are cost-sensitive and/or want to leverage features (like advertising opportunities) that they currently can't find on Libsyn's platform. Nonetheless, Libsyn continues to be known as a reliable hosting service that has underrated switching costs. While all podcast hosting companies have churn, we believe that Libsyn's reliability and great customer service will minimize churn.Finally, podcasting may be a fad. There is always the risk that we are in a podcasting bubble. Ultimately, we believe that the podcasting industry is just getting started. Recent M&A deals (particularly from Spotify) show that some of the largest tech companies are voting with their feet. Going forward, it's hard to see podcasting not being an essential medium for creators to connect with their audiences.The past few years have been extremely exciting for creators, entrepreneurs, and startups in the podcasting world. Rapid listener growth, a consistent increase in the number of shows, and eye-popping acquisitions have signaled the arrival of this important medium. Yet even amongst greater enthusiasm for the podcasting industry as a whole, LSYN hasn't experienced similar enthusiasm among investors.While the company has suffered many self-inflicted wounds over the past several years, we believe that much brighter days are ahead. Much of it comes down to people. We believe that LSYN will be an excellent example of how activist involvement can turn the tides of a company with underrated potential.Even putting aside a future acquisition, LSYN has an opportunity to see significant price appreciation. More disciplined spending, product improvements, and an increasing emphasis on shareholder value foreshadow exciting times for the company. In the end, we eagerly anticipate this new chapter in the company's history."
4277457,24324,2019-07-25T09:13:59-04:00,"Libsyn provides podcast hosting and associated tech services.For a SaaS company it's notably cheap with an estimated 7.5% FCF yield and revenue is growing 25% as of Q1 2019.Podcasting is a fast-growing area of media consumption. Over half the U.S. population now listens to podcasts monthly. Double the level from 8 years ago.This is essentially a platform business and the marginal costs of hosting an incremental podcast are low, creating favorable operating leverage.There are two main risks (1) legal issues related to the 2016 business separation (2) concerns about management compensation leading to an activist campaign from Camac partners.","Libsyn (OTCQB:LSYN) provides the tech for individuals and business to host their podcasts across all major platforms. The business offers website hosting too, after the acquisition of Pair Networks.Many names and brands from Dave Ramsey to Trader Joe's trust Libsyn to host their podcasts.Source: Libsyn investor presentationThe model is relatively simple. Customers typically pay a monthly fee from $5 to $75+ depending on the features they need for Libsyn to host their podcast.Source: Libsyn websiteLibsyn is in a growth segment. Edison Research's Infinite Dial Report is a useful source here. Over half the U.S. population have listened to a podcast as of 2019, double the level of 2011. This is supported by the general growth of online audio as listeners can now easily control what they listen to in their car or on their smartphone and listen to a podcast that meets their personal interests.Note that the metric that matters to Libsyn, broadly speaking, is the number of podcasts being produced and entrepreneurs, hobbyists and big businesses continues to grow. There are now 700,000 active podcasts. Libsyn hosts about 35,000 podcasts of 5% of the total.As such Libsyn can ride this growth wave and is nicely positioned.Libsyn's economics are attractive. The business grew revenue 25% year-on-year in its most recent quarter. That's great, but even better is that total costs grew at just 7% over the same period. The result is that the operating margin expanded from 12% to 25% over the same period. The makes sense, the bulk of the costs in building and rolling out a platform to host podcasts are fixed. As such, incremental revenue converts disproportionately into profits.Normally, looking at a single quarter of growth would be risky given season patterns, but there isn't obvious seasonality in Libsyn's business and given the fast growth the most recent quarter is generally the most informative for investors.Source: Libsyn SEC filingCrunchbase had the median SaaS company growing at 30% and trading at 8.3x EV/revenue as of last November. Libsyn has an EV of $95M and LTM revenue of $23.2M for an EV/revenue of 4.1x. Well below average, though of course this is a relatively small and less liquid firm.Furthermore, looking at absolute metrics Libsyn is attractive. Annualizing the most recent quarter gets to a P/E of 21.3x. Price to FCF based on the most recent 10K is 13.1x. This is because the positive impact of deferred revenue and capex running well under deprecation means that Libsyn's free cashflow is running above reported net income.Now, these numbers are not screaming cheap to a deep value investor. Nonetheless, remember that the market is very happy to pay high multiples for SaaS growth companies today and Libsyn is in that segment with double digit growth and operating leverage.FAB Universal Spin-OutIn 2016 the business was spun-out of FAB Universal. FAB Universal oversaw a lot of value destruction for shareholders, there perhaps some risk of clawback of the value via Libsyn. Here's how the company discusses the risk in their most recent 10-K. The main positive is we're now 3 years after the event with no legal action noted.ManagementCamac Partners is a significant holder of Libsyn and unhappy with management's actions and compensation as such they are looking to call a special meeting. They argue that Libsyn management are overpaid and that share issuance to management is potentially heavily dilutive. Management salary does seem high for a small firm, and the potential share issuance is a concern. The activism could be a source of upside if successful, though also is currently a potential distraction for management. The one positive is that the potential share grants though dilutive, do create potential shareholder alignment and include incentives for an uplisting to the NASDAQ which would help liquidity. The CEO and CFO own approximately 17% of the company's stock as of the last 10-K filing.Pair AcquisitionLibsyn acquired Pair Networks to help scale the business and offer domain hosting and other services to customers. Arguably domain hosting is a less attractive business given greater competition and slower growth. This isn't so much a risk, but in my mind it does dilutes the attractiveness of the business.Libsyn's valuation is compelling both compared to peers and in absolute terms. Sustained growth could be a source of further upside given operational leverage. Furthermore, if Camac's activist campaign is successful then reducing equity issuance to management may be a source of further upside. It seems rare to find a company entrenched in such an attractive growth market at such a relatively compelling valuation. The recent run-up in the shares suggest investors are starting to take note, but it appears valuation runway remains when you look at the lofty valuations of SaaS peers."

        Possible pathâs forward are reviewed and a DCF valuation suggests 32% upside.","If you are unfamiliar with the micro-cap podcast hosting firm Liberated Syndication (OTCQB:LSYN), Iâd highly recommend you read my previous article, Activism Could Rescue Value For Shareholders Of Fast Growing Liberated Syndication. The firm has a particularly dramatic history and the article also covers the lead-up to the recent activist campaign with the hedge fund Camac Partners as well as a general overview of the firmâs growth and industry. LSYN is a micro-cap stock that is thinly traded on the pink sheets with a wide bid-ask spread and often low liquidity. Investors interested in LSYN should be familiar with risks and dynamics of investing in relatively small publicly traded companies.Podcast Industry Continues to BoomSince publication of my article on June 25th 2019 positive trends have continued for LSYNâs industry. A few key highlights are as follows:All signs point to continued growth in the podcast industry and gives me assurance that LSYNâs trajectory of revenue growth can continue near its recent pace.John Busshaus exits as CFO as part of SEC settlementOutside of industry developments, the largest internal development at LSYN has been the resignation on Oct 2nd of their CFO John Busshaus. His resignation is related to a complaint filed by the SEC on Sept 30th 2019 against LSYNâs CEO and CFO in relation to the legacy FAB issues (Iâd again recommend my previous article if unfamiliar) and the subsequent settlement of the complaint. From the form 8-k:Therefore, John Busshaus will no longer be eligible to serve as LSYNâs CFO. Busshaus is not on the board of directors.In my opinion this is a welcome development that helps shed some of the legacy FAB stigma. The fact that the most critical officer with respect to validating financial data and presided over the FAB fiasco is no longer at the firm helps their image and affords them the chance to bring in an attractive new candidate.Camac Partners SettlementOn Oct 4th, Camac and LSYN entered a settlement and Camac agreed to cancel their activist campaign. Below are some of the key concessions:While I could talk at length about the terms of the settlement, in my opinion it achieves the objective of adding oversight and independence to LSYNâs board, and consequently over management. Iâm hopeful that this should serve to reign in excessive dilutionary equity awards and help keep compensation in-line with market levels. As the owner of ~6.7% of shares outstanding, I am hopeful that Camac will act in the interest of common shareholders.Moving Forward: The Strategic Review CommitteeThe formation of this committee is a very interesting development. Their charter can be found at this link on the last page (Exhibit B). Their duties and responsibilities outlined in the document are as follows:They seem to make it very clear that they are at least contemplating the idea of looking for a buyer for the company. They may also be considering add-on acquisitions to grow the companyâs top-line, earnings, and market cap. As of June 30th 2019 LSYN carried a very large cash balance of $14.2M (over 60% of TTM revenues!) while also carrying $7.5M in debt. How LSYN uses this cash may provide a glimpse into the direction that they would like to proceed.One option I believe is likely off the table however would be a special or regular dividend. Management has significant stock incentives tied to an appreciating share price and while dividend payments would reward existing shareholders, it would slow the assent of LSYNâs absolute share price. It is clear that LSYN is a cash flow generating machine, and the accumulation of cash on the balance sheet is a testament to the low capex and ongoing spend required to maintain the company. It is also however a testament to a lack of opportunities identified by management where that cash can be redeployed for further growth.ValuationLSYNâs +18% sales growth on the podcast hosting side, near 85% gross profit margins, and recurring revenue streams make them an attractive acquisition target. There has also been a good amount of M&A in the podcasting space recently with Spotify acquiring three podcast related firms this year alone, so I believe LSYN should be able to find interested parties.With that being said, I have completed a DCF valuation that assumes a conservative projection of sales growth as follows:These in turn fed my projected 3 statement model and the following DCF:LSYN has $5.9M of NOL tax assets as of June 30th 2019 which I assume will be run-off as they generate profits going forward. My DCF assumed a terminal long-term growth rate of 3% for purposes of the terminal value. This valuation implies LSYN to be ~32% undervalued relative to their current stock price and this would not be a unrealistic premium for a purchase of the company. A transaction at this price would imply a FY20 TEV/Sales ratio of 3.8x and a TEV/EBITDA ratio of 10.8x. This also does not seem unrealistic to me when I look at the current trading levels for the web-hosting firm GoDaddy (GDDY) with a TEV/Sales of 4.4x and a TEV/EBITDA of 37.4x. While GoDaddy is obviously much larger, they have similar hosting characteristics, similar revenue growth trends (between 15%-20% annually), and comparable gross margins (GoDaddy at 66.4% TTM vs LSYN at 84.7%).LSYN's SG&A as a percentage of revenues is also relatively high at 43% on a TTM basis. I think there would be opportunities for a strategic buyer to recognize synergies or for a non-strategic buyer to cut corporate and overhead costs in general which would further improve a transaction valuation.Below is a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate and terminal growth rate.As I also touched on earlier, management has a significant amount of stock awards tied to share price milestones. The shares related to these have already been issued to management and are included in LSYN's shares outstanding, but would be forfeited if the milestones are not reached. Those milestones are specifically for the stock to trade above $5.00 for a consecutive number of days by Jun 30th 2020 and for the stock to trade above $7.00 for a consecutive number of days by Dec 31st 2020. The amount of awarded shares tied to these respective milestones are 1.3M each for a total of 2.6M. There are also 250k shares that are tied to a $5.00 milestone that expire Dec 31st 2019.If management achieves one or both of these milestones and generates a 60% to 85% return by Dec 2020, they can happily keep their shares and I'll certainly be satisfied. If those shares however are forfeited, they should be deducted from the shares outstanding in the DCF model (they do after all represent 10% of the share count). This would improve the DCF value per share to $4.25, or 48% above the current trading price of ~$2.87.Wrap-upTo conclude, I am happy with the newest developments at LSYN, specifically their continued growth, new independence on the board, exit of the CFO, and demonstrated intention to assertively pursue strategic options for the company. While the firm is small, it is a great and profitable business and I believe the current share price affords a healthy level of upside.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

Click here to find out more Â»LSYN is a leader in a fast growing industry with great financial resultsLiberated Syndication (OTCQB:LSYN) is a little heard of micro-cap stock that trades OTC. They are a leading host/distributor of podcasts, and according to their latest investor presentation, they have a 28.2% share of the top 400 podcasts as of August 2018, the largest of anyone in the industry. Edison Research has an excellent report on podcast consumers that highlights the ongoing growth in podcast listeners and the continued expansion of the industry.Percent of US population over 12 that listen to podcasts monthly:Source: Edison ResearchPercent of US population over 12 that listen to podcasts weekly:Source: Edison ResearchLSYN was an early entrant into the field and has been well positioned to take advantage of these trends. Their organic revenues have grown 25% on average since 2015 with a 5 year CAGR of 15%. Source: S&P Cap IQThe jump in revenues in 2018 is a result of the acquisition of a web hosting firm, Pair Networks, Inc. The total purchase price was $16.12mm and the operations contributed $9.37mm to 2018âs revenue. The below graphic from LSYNâs Q1 2019 investor presentation breaks out the firmâs sources of revenue after the Pair acquisition.Source: LSYN Q1 2019 Investor PresentationThe podcast and web hosting platforms operate under a similar business model. LSYN offers a range of options for companies/individuals interested in publishing a podcast/website. These options have different monthly prices based on the publisher's needs and can range from $5-$75 a month for basic podcast packages, $99-$249 a month for ""pro"" podcast packages, and $5.95-$1k a month for web hosting.Source: LSYN Q1 2019 Investor PresentationLSYN hosts many of the most downloaded podcasts, such as The Joe Rogan Experience, along with podcasts that are published by well known corporations such as Forbes, ebay, and Thomson Reuters. By nature, these revenue streams are recurring. Given LSYN is an industry leader, so long as the public consumption of podcasts continues to increase and organizations in turn continue to create their own podcasts, LSYN's growth in monthly fee revenue should continue as well, although it should inevitably slow from the historical 20% annual rates. Per Q1's investor presentation, web hosting revenues from the Pair acquisition had grown at a slower but still respectable 5.4% in FY 2018.Gross profit margins have averaged 74% since 2015 and have been growing. Combine this with the fact that a relatively light amount of SG&A is actually needed to run the operations of this business and you have a company that has been very profitable and also generates a great amount of free-cash flow.Source: S&P Cap IQAs of the end of Q1 2019, LSYN was reporting $12.5mm in cash on the balance sheet against $7.9mm of debt that is related to the Pair acquisition. They have historically carried a cash balance closer to $5mm, which is about what they would have if they completely paid off all outstanding debt. Management stated on their latest earnings call that they value the added flexibility provided by carrying a higher cash balance and could use the liquidity to pursue investments in growth and acquisitions. LSYN carries no other major liabilities and as the Capex amounts in the table above show, the amount of investment needed to sustain this business is very light. In short, LSYN has ample liquidity and cash flow generation to sustain their business, pursue growth, and even return funds to shareholders if they decided to (more on treatment of shareholders shortly). Managementâs red flags and excessive compensationBased on the financials alone, LSYN would seem to be an extremely compelling buy. But once you dig into the background on the company and management, serious red flags quickly emerge. The story is long, but the short version is that LSYN was spun-off from a now defunct public company called FAB Universal Corp. FAB was created in 2012 via a reverse merger between Hong Kong based Digital Entertainment International and Pittsburgh based Wizzard Software. Ultimately FAB was delisted after it surfaced that the company failed to disclose a $16.4mm Chinese bond issuance, âcertain deficienciesâ with regard to their accounting policy were discovered, and their China based chairman was detained by authorities in China. The podcasting portion of the business was spun-off and as a result LSYN became the public company it is today. The CEO, CFO, and all four board members (the chairman of the board being the CEO) are all the very same individuals that presided over FAB Universal (excluding the China based chairman).Since LSYNâs spin-off, it has proven to be a very successful company operating in a niche space. The problem is that this management team seems to have little accountability to shareholders and has awarded themselves an astounding amount of cash and share based compensation. These actions finally received a response from the hedge fund Camac Partners, LLC which owns 6.035% of LSYNâs outstanding shares.Activist calls for the removal and replacement of all LSYN board membersIn April of this year, Camac called for a special shareholder meeting to discuss various proposals, with the headline proposal being the replacement of all members of LSYNâs board of directors. This document provides an excellent background along with Camacâs issues concerning management and the board, and I would encourage anyone interested in LSYN to read it along with this letter to shareholders dated June 12th. Their complaints on insider compensation are particularly lucid:This dilution is extraordinary. The current management team and board went from holding less than 2% of shares outstanding to 27.87% currently. All from potentially awarded stock compensation and none from actual purchases. Camac needs 25% of shareholders to vote in favor of this special shareholder meeting in order to move forward to next steps on their proposals.ConclusionLSYN has seen stellar revenue growth and financial results. Management no doubt deserves some credit for this success. However, there is a lack of accountability to shareholders and without forced change I would expect more acquisitions that would in turn be used to justify higher compensation and bonuses for management as SG&A continues to creep higher. The extreme dilution from excessive stock awards to management has been detrimental to shareholders. Camacâs initiatives face an uphill battle given insiders account for nearly 28% of voting shares, but even if they can prove to be remotely successful in improving board accountability, LSYN has the potential to share successful returns with all shareholders.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

I describe the company below.","In What Works on Wall Street, James O'Shaughnessy describes about 300 quantitative stock investing strategies. He investigates their long-term returns and risks. Last year I discovered it is possible (but not easy) to implement many of these quantitative strategies. So these advanced strategies are not just an edge for hedge funds anymore, but anyone can implement them at home. It can be done by screening for stocks using very flexible criteria. Then export fundamentals and price data for each stock and then rank them on multiple criteria. Finally, compute the combined ranks.One of the best strategies described in What Works on Wall Street is a mix between value and momentum called Trending Value. He ranks US stocks with positive momentum on various value factors and then proceeds with the 10% with the best rankings. These best 10% he ranks on momentum. The 25-50 stocks with the best momentum enjoy high returns (21%) despite low risks (Sharpe ratio 0.9).I have done something similar, but with various improvements. One of the biggest differences is that I rank on smooth momentum instead of on raw momentum. Smooth momentum suggests many knowledgeable investors are slowly buying into the stock. Therefore smooth momentum serves as better evidence for ""wisdom of the crowds"" than bumpy momentum caused by a few events. For more details including links to scientific papers see my freely accessible article on statistical investing.For international stocks, I share the details of the best-ranked stocks with my Marketplace subscribers. For the much more expensive US-listed stocks I share results here on the free part of Seeking Alpha.Liberated Syndication (OTCQB:LSYN) has the best ranking in this month's list. This stock is relatively cheap based on the ratios retained earnings from recent years/market cap and market cap/free cash flow. The stock is also a good statistical pick because of its low liquidity. That is, the ratio 3-months average volume/Public float is relatively low.Ignoring recent momentum which is subject to mean reversion the 1-year momentum is also good and reasonably smooth:That Liberated Syndication is a good long on a statistical basis does not mean many people will be eager to buy it, as my analysis below will show.Liberated Syndication hosts podcasts. It earns most money from hosting subscriptions but also from advertising revenue sharing and from commissions on subscriptions to premium content. See page 12 of the recent quarterly report.Right now podcasts have a low market share among various other audio media. I think, however, this tiny market share is growing, although slowly. In any case: profits and revenues have gone up much at Liberated Syndication in recent years.Liberated Syndication has an ugly history and maybe even uglier recent events. The company is a spin-off of FAB Universal Corp. (OTC:FABU). FAB Universal Corp.'s main operations were kiosks in Beijing. However, the American parent company, run by Americans, also owned the podcast business. The PRC business was operated as a variable interest entity. Then, in 2014, a reputable short-seller claimed many of these kiosks simply did not exist. The allegations were followed by delisting and subsequently, the stock went to zero.FAB Universal Corp did its best to investigate the irregularities with the PRC business. However, these efforts were fruitless. I guess the legal owner of the kiosks just walked away from the VIE-contracts.The podcast hosting business was spun off as Liberated Syndication to shareholders of FAB Universal Corp in 2016. Noteworthy is that the management of Liberated Syndication is still the same group as the management of FAB Universal Corp. Though legally Liberated Syndication is a spin-off the transaction can better be described as a name change. That the same management is still in place is a risk. Did they have anything to do with the irregularities in the PRC? We will probably never know.The new name might also be a joke, like the ticker symbols SYNC and SIXD a couple of years ago. Who is liberated? Management? Or the shareholders of FAB Universal Corp?Recent events do not remove my skepticism about the management of Liberated Syndication. In December 2017 the company announced huge grants of 3.6 million stocks in total. These grants will vest on satisfying conditions related to the market cap and the share price. Another condition is that the company will list on the NASDAQ within 24 months. See here and here.I do not think such grants are good incentives for management. Management should be rewarded based on other criteria that are director related to the business. For instance, criteria based on revenue, operating profit and free and operating cash flow.Instead the grants they recently got look like a big pumper's premium. They might still succeed, however. They might have a good plan to pump the stock... err ... develop the business. I have seen it before!Part of this plan might be a fairly big acquisition. Recently the company acquired a hosting company called pair Networks. Kevin Martin is the seller, founder and CEO of pair Networks. The deal suggests confidence in the combined company.The total consideration was $16.06 million, but $4.19 million is used to pay off pair Networks' net debt. From the remaining $11.87 million Kevin Martin gets $2.5 million in shares: 1.58 million new shares. He gets the remaining $9.37 million in cash, but not from the company. Instead the company finances the deal by borrowing $10 million from a bank. According to the loan agreement the interest rate is low, again confirming confidence in the company. See also the press release.It does not seem the deal has to be approved in a shareholder meeting, despite the fact this is a really large transaction.The company did not provide many details about what it bought: no reliable numbers for revenue, profits or book value. All we got is the following sentence in the press release: The combined businesses represented approximately $23 million in annual revenue and approximately $7 million in EBITDA for 2017. Unfortunately, the numbers for the last quarter are not yet available. Therefore based on the first 3 quarters of 2017 my best guess is pair Networks had $13 million of revenue and $5 million of EBITDA. To me, these numbers suggest the purchase was not very expensive.Liberated Syndication is a stock with good momentum and various other characteristics suggesting high returns, on a statistical basis. Corporate governance does not seem to be great, however. I do not like the incentives management has to pump the stock. That said, often pumpers are successful.In particular, the recent acquisition of pair Networks could increase the value of the company. It does not seem to be an expensive acquisition. Also, the transaction shows confidence in the company. Therefore, the combined company may be worth more than the 2 parts. I would not be surprised if overhead costs can be saved and if the 2 parts can cross-sell products to each other's customers.Thank you for reading this Seeking Alpha PRO+ article.

4333981,105217,2020-03-24T17:32:39-04:00,Live Nation Entertainment is one of the companies that will be particularly affected by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.The financial foundation is not really stable. Most of Live Nation Entertainment's assets are financed through debt.The company's ability to service liabilities with its CFO has steadily decreased in recent years.There are better alternatives for investors who want to invest in this business sector.,"Live Nation Entertainment (LYV) will be one of the worst victims of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in the medium term. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, investors underestimate the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 crisis. The paralysis of the economy is being accepted as collateral damage to contain the possibly devastating effects of SARS-CoV-2. The social distancing that causes this makes it obvious that Live Nation Entertainment will be one of the last to return to normal business operations. Furthermore, the company is far from being as well-positioned financially as its competitors. In the following, I will go into this in more detail.Until the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the company performed extremely well. In the last 10 years, the share price has risen by more than 400 percent and revenue has also doubled. The company has also managed to generate rising profits in the last years. Since 2014, EBIT and EBITDA grew by 221 and 65.45 percent.Data by YChartsHowever, the problem is that the company is heavily indebted. In my last analysis, I pointed out that Live Nation Entertainment has long-term debt of over USD 2.7 billion. This leads to the highest debt/equity ratio of the company in its history. Compared to the company's assets, total liabilities amount to almost 90 percent. This means that most of Live Nation Entertainment's assets are financed through debt:Data by YChartsWhile current liabilities, in particular, are steadily increasing, the company's ability to service liabilities with its CFO has steadily decreased in recent years.Data by YChartsThis means that the company is not flexible about its financial possibilities. In particular, it will be difficult to bridge difficult phases while still providing investors with sufficient value.And this is where I see a big problem because I assume that Live Nation Entertainment will have to forego a large part of its revenues, cash flow, and profits. In my opinion, the market here completely underestimates the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 crisis. Two aspects are decisive for this. One is a misconception regarding the development of SARS-CoV-2. The second is the measures taken by governments. Concerning the development of SARS-CoV-2, I can refer to another analysis to sum things up:Until now, the effects of SARS-CoV-2 have been underestimated worldwide. I, therefore, think that the political measures could last much longer than most investors expect. Until now, the company has suspended all events it has organized through the end of March and is estimating a drop of 70 percent in revenue. But from my perspective, there is a real risk that that won't be enough. Most importantly, there will be long-term restrictions for larger crowds. Accordingly, the sector for live and other events is expected to be the last to return to normalcy. In case of doubt, this may even take as long as it takes for a vaccine to become available or for herd immunity to be established. When this will be the case, nobody can make a final prognosis. It could even take until mid-2021 or longer. The worst-case scenario would be that Live Nation Entertainment would have to cancel most of its revenues and profits by that time.The main problem here is that the missing turnover does not come back in later and is therefore only postponed. There are events like the Olympic Games or the European Football Championship, which will be repeated next year. But this does not apply to all events because live events are difficult to repeat. So many festivals will simply not take place this year, but only again next year.With all that said, you could say that this is a problem that affects the entire industry and that is exactly what is right. But some companies are much more stable to get through this phase. One company is the European champion CTS Eventim (OTCPK:CEVMF). The company is quite similar to Live Nation Entertainment:The company is practically debt-free and has higher cash and cash equivalents than debt. Therefore, it will easily be able to bridge such a phase. Furthermore, the company has been paying a dividend since 2006, which has been increased since 2008 each year. If you want to get more information about the company, just click here for more analysis I have written about this European Champion.Live Nation Entertainment has grown rapidly in recent years. Nevertheless, financially speaking it does not have a really strong foundation. The company's total assets/total liabilities ratio is almost 90 percent. I predict that the company will have problems servicing its liabilities. The only solution is to take on new debt. Even if interest rates are low, this is not a sustainable business model. This is especially true because there are better investment options. Investors should especially look at the European Champion CTS Eventim. The reliable dividend payer is practically debt-free and much better positioned than Live Nation Entertainment.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive other long-term investment proposals or updates on my latest portfolio research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article, and check ""Get email alerts""."
4356574,53552,2020-07-01T11:47:33-04:00,"Live Nation's business has been ravaged by COVID-19, and live concerts are unlikely to return for some time.The company's cash balance largely consists of deferred revenue, meaning future cash flow will lag the return of concerts by several months.Investors should avoid Live Nation's shares at least until $30.","Over the past several weeks, we have seen so-called ""vaccine"" stocks, the airlines, hotels, restaurants, cruise ships, amusement parks, etc., perform particularly poorly as rising case growth across the South and Western parts of the United States have made investors question the pace of reopening. One needn't be a scientist to foresee that there will be waves of optimism and pessimism around the potential for some of these businesses to operate as normal, and at times, sentiment will move too far in either direction.Live Nation (LYV) is perhaps the company most exposed to a return to normal as large crowd gatherings like those for concerts and sporting events are likely to be the last activity governments permit to reopen. Indeed, the recent spikes in states like Florida and Texas after they opened bars may further increase the hesitance of government officials to permit 20,000 people to be in an indoor arena. While still up nearly 30% from their April low, shares of LYV have declined nearly 25% since early June. Given this drop, some investors may be tempted to buy the dip. However, given the uncertainty the business faces and the current valuation, I believe LYV is uninvestable at these levels and would steer clear of the stock.Source: GoogleLive Nation is the premier producer of live events, namely concerts, though it also sells tickets for sporting events. Using its 2019 financials as a way to understand what its ""normal"" business is like is a useful exercise. At $9.4 billion, concerts accounts for about 80% of the company's revenue with ticketing and sponsorships the rest. Now, in reality, essentially 100% of the business is tied to large events, because there are no tickets or sponsorships to sell if these events are barred from happening. The company held 40,256 concerts in 2019, 70% of which were in North America, meaning the company is disproportionately impacted by US public health policies.Now in 2019, the company generated $499 million in adjusted free cash flow, which is to say operating cash flow less maintenance capital expense of $151 million. The company has been aggressively growing, so its actual cash usage on investing activities last year was $691 million. As investors learned in 2014-2016 in many MLPs, maintenance cap-ex is a somewhat subjective measure as ultimately some ""growth"" spending is needed to offset the natural decline of some business lines to sustain the overall business's profitability. To be clear, I am not suggesting that the $151 million number is incorrect; rather, that this free cash flow number should not be taken as entirely analogous to a company that generates positive cash flow after spending on both maintenance and growth projects.Still taking this number for what it is, LYV has a 5.5% adjusted free cash flow yield based on 2019 results, which for a company in what had been a growth industry, is a reasonable valuation. However, the industry is no longer growing. Indeed, per the last earnings call, management expects ""an operational cash burn rate of approximately $150 million per month for the rest of the year, prior to interest expense, debt payments, capital expenditures and other nonoperational items.""In other words, the company expects to burn $1.35 billion in cash between April and December of this year. 9 months of debt payments and cap-ex are likely to be at least another $300 million. Now, given the increasingly bleak outlook for concerts this year and some ancillary revenue from virtual events, let's say the company can do 20% better than this projection. That still means that the company will burn $1.3 billion this year. That's about $6 per share in cash burn. Pre-COVID-19, LYV shares were trading in the $70 to $75 range. So, if you felt that starting January 1, 2021, life would be normal, that would mean shares should be in the $64 to $69 today, which is its old trading range less the $6 per share in cash flow burn between now and year end. Now, I think most of us would say that's quite optimistic. Indeed, the company, in my view, will burn substantially more cash into 2021, and operating cash flow is unlikely to return to pre-COVID-19 trends for several years.Investors also need to be aware that LYV's cash position is a bit more complicated than it might seem at first glance. As of 3/31, the company had $3.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. However, you pay for a concert ticket before you actually attend the show. As a consequence, Live Nation sits on your cash as unearned revenue until the show occurs. Of course, the company can spend this money, and normally there is no problem because there are constantly new concerts being added to schedule as to replace those occurring, so this client cash can provide a stable source of liquidity. It's analogous in some ways to how Warren Buffett describes Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.B) ""float"" of insurance premiums he can invest. However, this presupposes a stable or even growing float, which LYV won't have for some time.The $1.3 billion in cash needs that Live Nation has for this year are well in excess of its own free cash position of $817 million. Now, it can spend event-related deferred revenue or borrow under its $963 million revolving debt capacity, which it will likely have to do this year. However, investors need to realize that in essence the company is borrowing from the future. When these concerts eventually happen, the company will be booking revenue but they won't generate the same amount of cash, since they already have that cash today and are in fact spending it to sustain themselves. As a consequence, LYV's cash flow trends are likely to lag its revenue trends, especially because they will have a long backlog of events to fill before launching new ones.One other risk is that the longer this goes on, the more consumers will push for refunds. In their Q1 report, LYV noted that ""over 90%"" of fans are holding onto tickets instead of taking refunds. The longer this goes on, and the more likely it seems that concerts won't be happening this year and perhaps not in early 2021 either, more consumers may choose refunds, another potential liquidity drain. Government officials are also likely to have a ""walk before running"" approach with fewer events to start, lengthening the time over which LYV conducts these concerts. Consumers may also, even at the margin, be hesitant to attend big gatherings, hurting ticket sales or ticket prices. Even when there is a vaccine, will people rush to take it, or will they fear side effects? These are all risks.Consequently, investors should expect Live Nation to burn cash not just in 2020 but also likely through 2021. Indeed given the deferred revenue vs. actual event discrepancy, the company is unlikely to generate positive free cash, even on an adjusted basis, until 6+ months after live events start (and this assumes that once they start, they aren't shut back down). In other words, I would expect LYV to be burning cash flow at least through Q2 2021. And from there, it is likely to be a prolonged period to return to the pre-COVID-19 run rate.The absolute best case for this recovery may be H1 2022, and between now and then, the company will have spent about $2 billion in cash to survive. Even then, investors may demand a ""pandemic discount"" on the stock for some time given the fear COVID-19 proves not to be a 1 in a 100-year event. In this ""best case,"" the company will have burnt $2 billion over a period when it would have been expected to generate at least $1 billion and may still be working through its backlog of events. And, it will be operating in a vulnerable rather than growing industry. Rebuilding its cash balance and paying down incremental debt would likely be a multiyear process from here. In other words, investors would be looking at a lost 4 or 5 years relative to the hope at the start of this year.In the worst case, more show cancellations lead to more cash refunds, further draining liquidity, and live events don't really begin in significant frequency until H2 2021 or later, at which point the company's ability to fund itself without seeking outside capital, either via debt markets or dilutive equity issuance, becomes questionable.Given the need to focus on its balance sheet once life becomes ""normal,"" a 5.5% free cash flow yield of 2019 numbers is only plausible if investors believe the best case is a certainty. In reality, though, there are clear downside risks, and every day without shows results in more cash burn. As investors grow increasingly worried about this scenario, I could see shares retest their April lows. Simply put, even down substantially from pre-COVID-19 levels, the risk in shares of LYV is tilted strongly to the downside, and I would avoid shares entirely. Indeed, at $45 per share, I believe investors can profit by betting that shares are going to fall as the market realizes how long of a rebound the company faces. I would recommend shorting shares at these levels with a target of $30. At $30, investors would be discounting an incremental $2 billion in lost value vs. today, similar to the potential cash burn through H1 2021, and as such, at that level, LYV would be more fairly reflecting the risk to its business."
4337798,56952,2020-04-15T16:12:57-04:00,"Large scale events like concerts are banned for over a month now.Live Nation's entire business depends on concerts, festivals and events.The company released an upbeat statement announces several steps to preserve cash.Information provided in this statement is reason to be cautious though.A quick V-shape recovery of Live Nationa's share price is unlikely.","On March 12, Billboard was the first to report that Live Nation Entertainment Inc. (LYV) suspended all arena tours due to the spread of the coronavirus. Not much later, other events followed. Large gatherings were forbidden in most parts of the world, which left Live Nation no other choice than to cancel all concerts and festivals until the end of April. A month later and there's still no clear path to when Live Nation can restart their business in key territories North America and Europe. President Trump hopes ""to reopen the country soon"", but a reopening on May 1st is far from likely. And even if the United States is able to reopen that soon, many other countries around the world are way more hesitant and careful. France just announced an extension of the lockdown, so did other countries.It speaks for itself that a shutdown and a large scale ban on events have a major impact on Live Nation's business and financial position. All of Live Nation's activities are directly and indirectly linked to large scale events with thousands of visitors. The company operates concerts and festivals, both as the owner of the venue or festival and as a talent's (independent) promoter. Further, Live Nation owns the world's largest ticket seller Ticketmaster and earns a lot of money with event-related sponsorships and marketing. Almost all activities are now at a standstill, even for events that are planned for the second part of 2020. Not surprising that Jefferies and Berenberg downgraded the stock over the past couple of weeks.Meanwhile, the stock price of Live Nation has been quite a rollercoaster since the start of the Coronavirus pandemic. Trading at a high of $76.60 during the first two months of the year, stocks started to tumble by the end of February and hit a low at $21.70 (a decline of almost 72% from it's high) in March. The stock recovered along with markets in general and closed at $39.41 on Monday, still down almost 50% from his highest point just a short while ago.I initially thought about writing an article about Live Nation over the weekend and had a particularly angle in mind. When would Live Nation run out of cash and what kind of measures should the company take to prevent this from happening? Looking at the company's balance sheet by the end of 2019, it was nothing but logical the company had to do something to make sure it's prepared for a period without concerts and events. That article became outdated when Live Nation announced several steps to bolster their cash position on Monday. In the company's press release, the following steps were announced:The company also provided an insight in its current cash position. As of February 29, 2020 total cash and cash equivalents balance stood at $3.3b. Only $914m of this can be considered free cash, a definition frequently used in the company's earnings reports. Live Nation cannot use all of its cash as their own. For example, money received for events past February 29, 2020 are listed as event related deferred revenue. By the end of February, these event related cash receipts totaled $2b. That's a major limitation for Live Nation to deal with.Reading through the announcement, it almost seemed to be business as usual at Live Nation. Sure, steps that were announced are a positive going forward and it's not likely the company will run out of cash within the next 12 months. Even without any event or concerts. However, the overall upbeat tone surprised me a lot. One thing stood out for me in yesterday's statement:This looks pretty good, right? Ticket sales were down just 2% and only 10% of all events were cancelled (and ticket refunded to customers) as of March 31, 2020. However, keep in mind most governments only plan a couple of weeks ahead. Events that will take place in May, June and July through September are still very uncertain and there's a good chance these events need to be cancelled or postponed to a later date as well. Furthermore, postponements are not as good as it initially sounds. I'll explain.Let's take the postponed of Ultra Music Festival in Miami as an example. This event was postponed from March 2020 to March 2021. Given Live Nation's standards, this is considered a postponed show and not a cancelled show. People who bought a ticket don't get a refund, they get a replacement ticket for the event in either 2021 or 2022. If all ticketholders opt to attend Ultra Music Festival 2021 or 2022, only 50% of available tickets will be actually sold in the next two years. Not only does the promoter miss out on income related to the 2020 event (like sponsorship and endorsement deals), it will also miss out on a full year of ticketing income. The pain may be spread over a 2-year period of time, but pain there will certainly be. The same goes for postponed concerts to a later date this year or next year. Concert venues have limited capacity (in terms of dates per year). Take Madison Square Garden in New York, with NBA and NHL games being played so often. When concerts that were supposed to take place early 2020 are being postponed to a later date, the venue isn't able to sell anew event on that new date for other artists. The schedule is already filled with postponed concerts from earlier in the year.Although Live Nation doesn't have to refund tickets right away, there will be loss of ticket income in the next two years because of the arguments I mentioned above. It can be even longer in case events are banned for the remaining of the year. That's why I don't believe in a quick V-shape recovery. Others argue that Live Nation's stock is poised to double in three years' time, because it will return to normal. In this Barron's article, the author writes:AndI do agree with the solid capital structure part, but again this seems to be a very positive assessment. It also bypasses one other important uncertainty. Live Nation's revenue from sponsorship and endorsement deals account for only 5% of its total revenue, but it accounts for 65% of its Operating Income (before corporate expenses), according to its 2019 earnings. Besides that, the effect of the coronavirus on the global economy is still uncertain. The IMF predicts: ""Coronavirus recession will likely be worst since the Great Depression."" If we're indeed at the start of a deep recession, it's an illusion Live Nation will be immune to that. Large brands will cut their advertisement budgets in order to cut spending, like Live Nation is cutting expenses itself right now. This will have a significant financial impact on sponsorship revenue in the coming years. If Live Nation is hit by (temporary) lower ticket sales, a decline in sponsorship income will be felt even harder due to the strong margins in this segment.Considering all of the above, my outlook for Live Nation is more pessimistic than the market. The quick recovering from $21.70 to a level above $40/share doesn't make sense taking into account the effect of postponements on concert and festival revenue in the next two years. Also, the effect of a global recession on Live Nation's sponsorship segment (the company's only strong profitable segment) cannot be underestimated. I do expect Live Nation to be able to continue operations, even if current measures to prevent the coronavirus from spreading will be extended to late 2020. However, I don't expect a quick V-shape recovery. This scenario is only likely when there's a quick 'return to normal' and there're no signs at this point this will be the case. Instead, it's more likely than not that we'll go through a longer than expected recession and Live Nation isn't immune for this. Therefore, I would recommend cautiousness in regards to Live Nation and its share price."
4337250,104012,2020-04-13T10:06:58-04:00,"Live Nation Entertainment has experienced phenomenal growth over the last three years with revenues and profits growing by 19% and 1,421%, respectively.However, LYV is a highly indebted company with more than 80% of its assets being financed by leverage.COVID-19 is going to have a drastic impact on the financial performance of the company. Combined with heavy debt, Live Nation does not look like a promising opportunity at present.","Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE:LYV) is one of the largest live event promoters in the world with a reported 580 million fans as of December 2019. The company has experienced phenomenal growth over the last three years, with revenues and profits growing by 19% and 1,421% respectively. However, LYV is a highly indebted company, with more than 80% of its assets being financed by leverage. There has also been a 25% decline in its operating cash flows since 2017. The company's situation has worsened with the outbreak of COVID-19 that has necessitated the cancellation of events in the first quarter of 2020. LYV derives the majority of its revenues and profits in the second and third quarters (its financial year ends on 31st December). However, there is a real and tangible risk that, even then, the company will lose a significant portion of revenues, cash flows, and profits derived from these two quarters due to COVID-19 that has led to growing regulations on social isolation and large crowds. The following sections highlight LYV's past financial performance and current developments informing a sell or do not buy decision.A company's financial performance is driven by profitability, leverage, and asset utilization. With regard to profitability, LYV's annual and latest quarterly performance since 2017 has been exceptional with net margins growing from 0.08% to 2019's 1.02%. Sales have also grown substantially (19%) since 2017. This is attributable to growth in the company's roster of artists, personal disposable income in the US, and North Americans' steady willingness to attend live events. Subsequently, LYV's profit performance has driven a 150% increase in its market value between January 2017 and December 2019 as shown in Figure 1.Figure 1: LYV stock trendsSource: Yahoo FinanceLYV has grown its revenues through the acquisition of smaller event promoters in a bid to create a nationwide network. Its most remarkable acquisition was that of Ticketmaster back in 2009 for $2.4 billion. In 2019, LYV used $235 million in similar ventures and another $315.6 million in other capital expenditures. These investments highlight the capital-intensive nature of the company's business where it owns or enters into long-term leases to use amphitheaters, stadia, and similar facilities. With more than 80% of its revenues being derived from concerts, it is apparent that LYV's financial standing is incredibly reliant on the effective use of these assets. However, the company's asset turnover ratio has been on a sustained decline since 2017 as shown in Figure 2. Even when an economic shock is disregarded, this does not portend well for LYV's current and future outlook as it infers that the firm is on an asset purchase spree without a proper strategy as their application.Figure 2: Performance driversSource: Author's own Compilation of financial dataMore importantly, it is necessary to look at how LYV finances its asset purchases. As shown in Figure 2, there has been a dramatic rise in its equity multiplier from 529% to 750% in 2017 and 2019, respectively. This means that more than 80% of the company's assets are financed through current and long-term debt. This brings into question the amount of cash available to meet the growing debt burden. LYV's operating cash flows have declined sharply from $623 million in 2017 to $469 million in 2019. This is primarily attributable to maturity of current debt. Specifically, LYV acquired an additional current debt of nearly half a million dollars in 2017 and $666 million in 2018, which means cash inflows. LYV was only able to acquire an additional $43 million of current debt in 2019. The increase at a declining rate of LYV's current debt implies that LYV's current liabilities have begun to mature. Maturity of current debt thus explains the decline in LYV's operating cash flows. Besides, the company can certainly expect pressure to pay the $4.1 billion current debt that is sitting on its balance sheet. Another $5 billion is due to be paid in the long term. This places undue pressure on operating cash flows as these demands will have to be met out of revenues. These conditions also severely limit LYV's ability to expand further as it has to prioritize debt payments or face certain bankruptcy.However, LYV is not operating under normal conditions. As mentioned earlier, the company is growing rapidly, and this is hindering its ability to generate revenues from assets. This would conventionally be mitigated by reducing or halting expansion plans, repaying debt, and expanding headroom for additional borrowing. This is not possible under current conditions. COVID-19's outbreak has forced the global economy into a near shutdown with LYV's business model coming under intensive regulatory attack. At the center of this are the newly introduced laws limiting large crowds. Where such laws are yet to be implemented, the public is increasingly apprehensive. Artists and sponsors are also not willing to be associated with large gatherings. It is reasonable to argue that these laws are short-lived and could be overturned within the next few months.Yet, it is also plausible that these regulations will be around for at least a year, within which time a vaccine is expected to be developed. Admittedly, countries are expected to lift these bans over the next few months. However, this does not dispel another wave of bans as is expected to be seen in Asian countries that are preparing for another spread following the first. Indeed, the lifting of bans on large gatherings is dependent on the development of a vaccine as it is a reassuring factor among the public. This means that LYV can no longer hold events and has already announced this decision in the short term. With further postponements expected throughout 2020, LYV can expect as much as 70% of its revenues to be wiped out. Admittedly, there could be financial aid from the federal and state governments in the form of debt moratoriums and bailouts. Nonetheless, these factors are further into the future than current cancellations. Without external financial aid, it seems certain that LYV will enter into financial distress.Based on the foregoing analyses, it becomes important to turn towards more promising stocks than LYV. An investor insisting on going for live entertainment and promotion companies should focus on those carrying minimal debt. COVID-19 certainly affects the entire sector. However, those with less debt burdens have a better advantage compared to those with a marginal borrowing headroom. Alternatively, one could invest in the wider entertainment industry where companies like AMC (NYSE:AMC), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), and others are likely to emerge as winners in the new age of social distancing."
4312249,105217,2019-12-13T09:30:00-05:00,"In my first analysis, I explained why I wasn't considering investing in Live Nation Entertainment at the time.
        Given the actual quarter numbers, it seems that the company is heading on the right directing and that everything is fine. But at a closer look, this looks different.
        The company is definitely not my first pick in the Live Event and Ticketing business.","IntroductionLive Nation Entertainment (LYV) is the world's largest producer of live entertainment. Consisting of Live Nation, Ticketmaster and Front Line Management Group, the company is the market leader in promoting concerts, ticketing and sponsorship. It has acquired many of the largest promoters in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Given that, the company promotes or stages about 30,000 events a year attracting around 60 million attendees. Furthermore, Live Nation Entertainment manages sports celebrities, promotes monster truck shows, and puts together touring theatrical productions.In my first analysis, I explained why I wasn't considering investing in Live Nation Entertainment at the time. Here's my conclusion from that article:The share price has not changed since my article several months ago. The S&P 500 was even underperformed.The latest quarterly figures have not changed my assessment either. And that's exactly what this article is about.AnalysisBefore we go into detail, I would like to briefly summarize the highlights of the third quarter:Given that numbers, it seems that the company is heading on the right directing and that everything is fine. But let's take a deeper look into these numbers. In fact, it first looks impressive when you look at the growth rates of the individual segments and by different metrics (revenue, operating income and adjusted operating income): However, the following must be noted here as a limitation. Concerts is by far the biggest segment. This is true for both, revenue and income. However, growth rates aren't that high anymore. The same applies to the revenue growth of the Ticketing segment. Only the Sponsorship & Advertising segment was convincing and offers hope due to its profitability. It is by far the smallest business, but contributes a disproportionately high share to income. The Sponsorship segment delivered 17 percent operating income and 18 percent AOI growth for the quarter and 14 percent operating income and 13 percent AOI growth year-to-date. I was also not convinced by the development of the cash flow. The company burns a great deal of its money overall. Net cash used in investing activities has almost doubled on a year to year basis. The company does not intend to pay a dividend to its shareholders for the foreseeable future. Live Nation Entertainment retains any future earnings to finance the growth, development and expansion of the business and / or to repay existing indebtedness. This is also necessary because the company is heavily indebted. It has long-term debt of over USD 2.7 billion. This leads to the highest debt / equity ratio of the company in its history:To be clear, Live nation Entertainment is a fast growing company. And a company should not be accused of making little or no profit because it is investing all available resources in further growth. Nevertheless, I think it makes sense to operate sustainably and profitably at some point and to improve the balance sheet. This is all the more true because with CTS Eventim (OTCPK:CEVMF, OTC:CEVMY) there is a European champion who gives investors much more value. CTS Eventim has an actual P/E ratio of almost 40. Even with the optimistic outlook of an EPS of 1.49, the forward P/E ratio for 2019 is with nearly 35 still very high. However, compared to Live Nation Entertainment, CTS Eventim is highly profitable and pays very generous dividends to its shareholders. So there are definitely better investments than Live Nation Entertainment. TakeawayAfter every analysis of a company, I will use a three-grade rating for this series.

4379264,104171,2020-10-15T14:07:15-04:00,"Live Nation Entertainment has grown the top line by over 11% per year.The net income available to common shareholders is nonexistent due to accretion to non-controlling interests.The balance sheet is not great, with poor leverage and liquidity during this period.With underlying demand for live entertainment weak, Live Nation Entertainment will struggle to operate successfully.","Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE:LYV) is a company that anyone who has been to a concert, festival, sports event, or seen a stand-up comedian has utilized a service from. The namesake Live Nation business owns, operates, has exclusive booking rights to 273 venues, some of which are notable like House of Blues, The Fillmore, Hollywood Palladium, and many more. The Live Nation business works with over 500 artists from all genres. The other side of the business is Ticketmaster, which is one of the world's largest live entertainment ticketing and marketing companies. Ticketmaster provides ticket sales, resales, marketing, and distribution services for live events ranging from performing arts, concerts, and sports. Live Nation Entertainment has seen nice historical top-line growth, powered by increases in events and ticket sales. But the bottom line has suffered due to non-controlling interest stakes that have reduced the net income available for the common shareholder. On top of a lack of common shareholder returns, Live Nation Entertainment is being hit hard during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, the company is overvalued, and I am staying far away. No earnings have been available to the common shareholder over the past five years, and the pandemic is decimating the operations. Things at Live Nation Entertainment do not look good.Strong Top-Line GrowthSource: SEC 10-KsLive Nation Entertainment has seen good revenue growth over the last five years, with a CAGR of 11.25%. As can be seen by the estimated total concert events, fans attending, and tickets sold, the underlying demand for live music and other events has been very strong. This is what I would expect during an economic expansion as prosperous as the past decades. Most of the company's revenue is generated from the Concerts segment, which consists of the global production of live music events. This segment has seen 6.11% per year growth over the last three years. On the other hand, the Ticketing segment, which sells tickets on behalf of clients for events, has been relatively flat. The issue with that is that Ticketing has a way better operating margin than Concerts, ranging from -0.4% to 1.2% compared to 6.8-15%. The top line has seen growth over the last few years, but as I will talk about further below, the bottom line has struggled during a strong economy, and the COVID-19 pandemic has killed the underlying demand for live entertainment.Source: SEC 10-KsAlthough operating income has increased at a clip of 20% per year, net income attributable to common shareholders has struggled to gain traction. This is due to agreements set up by Live Nation Entertainment with non-controlling interests. In 2019, around 41% of comprehensive net income was attributable to non-controlling interests. In some years, it has exceeded 100% of the total comprehensive net income, causing a net loss attributable to common shareholders. But there is more to the story, as what is attributable to the common shareholder is not available to the common shareholder. As can be seen in the second chart, net income available to the common shareholder has been consistently negative. Why is this? Well, some of the non-controlling interest is redeemable through put agreements. These put agreements are accreted to net income when the fair value is higher than the carrying value of these agreements. As can be seen above, the accretion of non-controlling interests has been a large negative factor to net income available to common shareholders, resulting in a negative return for the common stock. Overall, the non-controlling interests are controlling the common shareholder's returns.Source: SEC 10-Ks & 10-QsAs would be expected, live events have been significantly reduced due to COVID-19. In Q1 of 2020, Live Nation Entertainment posted revenues of $1.366 billion, a 21% decline. Concerts revenue declined 25%, Ticketing revenue declined 16%, and Sponsorship & Advertising increased by 20%. The quarter ended with an operating loss of -$173 million and net income available to common shareholders of -$199 million. Q2 was much worse, with revenue decreasing to just $74 million, a 97.7% decline! Concert revenue decreased by 95%, Ticketing revenue declined by 123%, and Sponsorship & Advertising revenue decreased by 88%. The operating loss in Q2 was -$588 million, and net income available to common shareholders was -$565 million.The result for the six months was revenue of $1.44 billion, which is a decline of 70.5%. Concert and Ticketing operating margins tanked, totaling to -38.8% and -143% each, making up the operating loss of -$761 million. Net income available to common shareholders ended the six months at -$765 million or -$3.62 per share. Looking at the graphic above shows that the underlying demand has disappeared. The drop-off is quite remarkable as the number of concerts and fans almost dropped to zero in Q2! Tickets sold in Q2 even went negative from refunds/buybacks from canceled events. Overall for the half year, concert events were down 61%, fan attendance was down 75.1%, and the number of tickets sold was down 60.2%. The inability to gather in large groups is a persistent threat to Live Nation Entertainment that will not go away until COVID-19 can be contained. The outlook on containment is not prosperous right now, but a bright spot may emerge with the return of fans to sporting events. Because Live Nation Entertainment makes the lion's share of the revenue from concerts and live music, it will be a hard road back to normal. We have not seen a great response to the reopening of movie theaters, and I wouldn't expect a much different outcome for concerts.Looking at the most recent quarter, Live Nation Entertainment has a current ratio of 1.27x, which will suffice for now. I do expect the company will have to issue more debt or a revolving credit line to keep alive through this pandemic. The debt to equity is very high at 16x, and the times interest earned ratio in 2019 was 2.06x. This is a real area for concern while the company struggles to operate. I would not be surprised if this unhealthy balance sheet is an issue in the near term as I do not expect much headway in live event attendance anytime soon.As of today, the company is trading at a price per share of around $55. This is an overvalued company in terms of the common shareholder. The earnings available to the common shareholder have been nonexistent. In 2019, Live Nation Entertainment had a free cash flow per share of just $0.47, and in the most recent quarter, had a book value per share of $1.62. Therefore, the company is trading at sky-high valuations of 117x free cash flow and 34x book value.Overall, there isn't much that Live Nation Entertainment offers for a good investment thesis. The company does not show returns to the common shareholder and is currently getting destroyed by the COVID-19 pandemic. To add to that, the balance sheet does not look good. The company trades at high multiples to book value and free cash flow. In the end, I would rather place my money elsewhere."
4275516,105217,2019-07-17T14:08:20-04:00,"Consisting of Live Nation, Ticketmaster and Front Line Management Group, the Live Nation Entertainment is the market leader in promoting concerts, ticketing and sponsorship.A certain premium is already justified by the fact that the company operates in a rather conservative business area with limited risks to the business.With the recent rally, however, the company has run far away from a price premium which can be consider as reasonable.","Live Nation Entertainment (LYV) is the world's largest producer of live entertainment. Consisting of Live Nation, Ticketmaster and Front Line Management Group, the company is the market leader in promoting concerts, ticketing and sponsorship. The company has acquired many of the largest promoters in the United States, Canada, and Europe. It promotes or stages about 30,000 events a year attracting around 60 million attendees. Through its subsidiaries Live Nation Entertainment also manages sports celebrities, promotes monster truck shows, and puts together touring theatrical productions.On average, every 16 minutes, there is a live nation event starting in the world:(Source: Live Nation Entertainment is the global leader)In fact, Live Nation Entertainment's stock has done pretty well. In 2019, the share price gained almost 45 percent. Since June, the share price has risen by almost 20 percent:(Source: Price gains)A certain price premium may justifiedA certain premium is already justified by the fact that the company operates in a rather conservative business area.Live events like the Olympic Games, the Football World Cup, festivals or operas are as old as modern man. One of the first music festivals was held in the Ancient Greece during the Pythian Games. As before, everyone likes a certain music artist, singer or sport athlete. Maybe styles and fashions changed but not the importance of the live interaction with the artists itself. So people will always pay to see their favorite artists live, regardless if it is a rock band, a singer in the opera or an athlete in the arena. Therefore, I would call the business model quite established and secure. Of course, it is to be expected that in times of crisis or recession, the willingness to pay high entrance fees could decline. But overall, listening to live music or visiting cultural events is still a basic need in human interaction.In contrast, there are only two real risks. But these are also very small.Amazon (AMZN) could also be considered a potential competitor. In the meantime, the speculation about a large entry of the online giant. And indeed, Amazon wanted to shake up the event ticketing market worldwide. In 2016, Amazon selected Great Britain as the test market for an entry into the online ticketing market. But after trying to gain some success for two years, Amazon decided to retreat. Last year, Amazon also postponed the planned market entry in the USA. All this indicates that at the current status, the US American and the European market have high entry barriers and even Amazon could not gain any noteworthy presence. These entry barriers are due to a bottleneck and indirect networks effects created by the dominant business positions of the promoter. As more promoters use the system of a promoter, more booking offices and customers will depend on the system and vice versa (for more explanation, feel free to study my former analysis). This could also explain and maybe justify this huge premium on the share price.Another (at least) potential risk is the terror threat. Live events like concerts or festivals could be a target of potential attacks. Therefore, it is important for promoters to invest in the safety of the guests. Hence, the promoter has to put in place all essential measures to protect the visitors, (e.g. through more trained staff, more technology for monitoring, use of drones, etc.). These costs, could hurt Live Nation Entertainment's margin. More importantly, fewer people may attend the events as a result of this threat. That would hit the company twice, as it not only organizes events but also sells tickets.But I also rate the risk as low. So far there have been very few incidents. They didn't have a major impact on people's willingness to attend live events. Of course, there is never one hundred percent security. Nevertheless, the measures taken by promoters to protect customers therefore seem to be sufficient and provide adequate protection.Apart from these reasons, which justify a price premium, the current share price is formally crying out for exaggeration. To justify this, let us first look at the current numbers. 2019 is off to a strong start, with revenue up 17 percent to USD 1.7 billion, an operating loss of USD 24 million. The company has now booked enough concerts, sold enough tickets, and secured enough sponsorship commitments to expect that the company will deliver double-digit operating income and growth for the full year. Given that revenue growth was 17 percent, the last one and a half months alone have priced the full year growth into the share price. Furthermore, as you can see, despite strong growth in sales, Live Nation Entertainment still makes no profit.(Source: Profit per share)Additionally, the company does not intend to pay a dividend to its shareholders for the foreseeable future. Live Nation Entertainment retains any future earnings to finance the growth, development and expansion of the business and / or to repay existing indebtedness. This is also necessary because the company is heavily indebted. It has long-term debt of over USD 2.7 billion. This leads to the highest debt / equity ratio of the company in its history.(Source: High debts)This leads to the highest debt ratio of the company in its history.(Source: Decreasing Gross Margin)On the other hand, there is also the highest price/book ratio for almost 10 years.(Source: Price / Book ratio)According to these fundamental figures, I do not consider an investment to be justified. The price is far too high for the value of the company, the profitability is falling and the company is heavily indebted. The investor's key takeaway is that Live Nation Entertainment is basically on a good growth path. However, the current price in no way justifies the value investors receive in return. The company does not even make a profit or pay a dividend. Investors should therefore invest the money in alternatives or wait for prices to fall.I look forward to discussing Live Nation Entertainment's price with you in more depth in the commentary section.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on my latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article and check ""Get email alerts""."

This deal is relevant to the ‘venue’ access control segment, a submarket of the total access control market.This growth forecast represents a CAGR of 5.5% between 2017 and 2023.The main driver for this expected growth is the rapid adoption of access control solutions due to growing security concerns globally.Major competitive vendors that provide venue access control services include:Ticketmaster didn’t disclose the acquisition price or terms and didn’t file an 8-K or disclose a change in financial guidance, so the deal was likely for a non-material amount.A review of parent firm Live Nation Entertainment’s most recent 10-Q filing indicates that the firm had $2.3 billion in cash and equivalents and $5.5 billion in total liabilities excluding deferred revenue.Free cash flow during the six months ended June 30, 2018, was $419.2 million.Ticketmaster acquired UPGRADED to bring its technology to improve venue access control to a larger customer base.As Ticketmaster stated in the deal announcement,In the past 12 months, LYV’s stock price has risen 15.7% vs. the S&P 500 Index’ rise of 3.3%, as the chart below indicates:(Source: Seeking Alpha)This deal for UPGRADED represents a significant positive data point for the use of blockchain technology to increase transparency and reduce fraud.Ticketmaster employs several venue access control technologies for live events, such as Ticketmaster Presence, Verified Fan, and Blink Identity.UPGRADED also has created the ability to track ticket transfers and interactive tickets, enabling event owners to sell sponsorships or other items within the ticket, such as merchandise, parking, or other items.By integrating a blockchain-based system that is flexible and provides a number of benefits to event owners, Ticketmaster appears to be staying at the forefront of event security, monetization capabilities, and consumer convenience.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

4234616,104739,2019-01-22T04:52:07-05:00,"Live Nation is the world’s largest live entertainment platform.The Group operates a vertically integrated model which combines promotions and ticketing services alongside talent management.In 2017 the company generated $10 billion in revenue from 30,000 events which attracted 86 million fans.The average consumer frequents two and a half concerts each year with disposable income prioritised towards compelling experiences.","Live Nation’s (LYV) live events business was originally founded by Robert Sillerman in 1996, sold to Clear Channel Communications in 2000, spun off as Live Nation in 2006 and merged with Ticketmaster, a specialist in ticketing software, in 2010. Since its formation the company has acquired or formed partnerships with promoters worldwide to produce live events and festivals. The partnerships enable promoters to retain independence and creative control over their events whilst plugging into Live Nation’s resources. The group owns or manages an enviable portfolio of venues and festivals, and has also developed an artist management business with over 500 artists on their books overseen by 125 managers.In contrast to the recorded music industry which was deeply impacted by piracy and illegal file sharing which lead to dwindling CD sales, the performance business has been thriving and has become the primary source of income for most active recording artists. This is in stark contrast to the past when record sales were the cash cow and artists toured to promote albums. Moreover, unlike the past when music executives and recording studios would take a significant share of the revenue pie, Live Nation distributes revenue from ticket sales directly to the artists on an up-front guaranteed basis whilst retaining the service or distribution portion of the ticket price. Alternatively, or in certain cases in tandem with the guarantee, a revenue-share agreement may be agreed with the cost of staging the event absorbed by the company and ticket and ancillary-sale income from food and beverages, parking, sponsorship, VIP seating and promotional activity split with the artist. The terms of trade between promoter and artist are generally perceived as fair and proportional, with artists making around 90% of their earnings from touring. For Live Nation, this equates to an annual spend on talent of around $3 billion.According to music publication Pollstar, from 1995-2010 the live music promotion industry expanded at double-digit rates proving recession-resistant. In 2010, the industry was hit through ticket price escalation which had reached a point of saturation among consumers. Pricing has since improved and Live Nation has diversified its presence globally such that slow-downs in some countries may be offset by stronger growth elsewhere.Live Nation is engaged in various aspects of concert production, promotion operation, ticketing and artist management. The company organizes its businesses into four segments:Live Nation operates in two large and global markets: worldwide expenditure on concert tickets totals $20bn (according to Statistica) whilst expenditure on global general ticketing, a market served by industry-leader Ticketmaster, equates to $100bn. Ticketmaster provides ticket sales, ticket resale services and marketing and distribution globally through ticketmaster.com and livenation.com as well as other websites, retail outlets and call centers, selling nearly 500 million tickets in 2017 through its systems. Ticketmaster serves more than 12,000 clients worldwide across multiple event categories, providing ticketing services for leading arenas, stadia, professional sports franchises and leagues, college sports teams, performing arts venues, museums, theaters, festival and concert promoters. The Ticketmaster app has been downloaded over 43 million times and an increasing portion of consumers are accessing tickets directly through their mobile phone. Concert ticket sales have expanded at a rate of 8% in the last 18 years, driven by a greater incentive to tour as artists derive around 90% of total income from live events allied with a secular shift in consumer expenditure towards experiences. According to the company, more than two-thirds of 13-49-year olds attend live music events around the world.Within the concerts segment, the company owns 28 venues and manages 194 venues in twelve countries. Venues owned or acquired on long leases include the House of Blues clubs, The Fillmore in San Francisco, First Midwest Bank Amphitheatre in Chicago, the Hollywood Palladium, Xfinity Center in Boston, Jiffy Lube Live in Washington D.C., Klipsch Music Center in Indianapolis, Leeds Festival Site, Little John’s Farm Reading Festival Site, and 3Arena in Ireland. The group hosted 97 festivals in 2017 and holds the rights to four of the five largest music festivals in North America (including Lollapalooza, Electric Daisy Carnival and Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival). Concerts may also be streamed live with distribution rights sold to media partners Twitter and Yahoo.Artist Nation handles non-publishing activities such as merchandising, video production and website management. As with the concert segment, growth has been spearheaded through acquisitions, which are classified as subsidiaries where the group holds a significant stake in their operations. In the United States these include Roc Nation Management, 24 Artist Management, Blueprint Artist Management, Spalding Entertainment, LMG Management and Philymack Management. At its disposal is a database with information on over 580 million customers who bought tickets last year, which provides the ability to make direct connections and introduce fans to artists they may like. Instrumental in driving the potential for data mining was the integration of Salesforce software which has helped to monetise the group’s trending data, purchase data and live entertainment data to personalise customer journeys and predict their purchasing behaviour. All of the company’s apps and website are driven from the Salesforce1 platform. As a result of these efforts Live Nation has become a top-five commerce site globally. This division is embedded within the Concerts segment. Precisely 75.3% of the company’s consolidated revenue in 2017 came from this segment; however, it only contributed 24.2% of adjusted operating income. This is because most of the concert revenue goes to the artists, resulting in a segment adjusted operating income margin of 2.1%.Comparatively, the Ticketing segment generated 20.5% of 2017 revenue, yet 39.0% of adjusted operating income. This is due to the fact that while the company distributes the ticket sale prices to the venue, it earns an ad valorem “convenience and processing” fee on each ticket which is often described to customers as service, facility or processing fee. Accordingly, this segment has a normalised adjusted operating income margin of nearly 19%. The actual margin was depressed in 2017 due to a $110 million accrual for a legal settlement entered into in January 2018.Finally, the Sponsorship and Advertising segment contributed less than 4.5% of 2017 revenue, but over 45% of adjusted EBITDA. With 1,000 sponsors across the on-site and online platforms, Live Nation is the global leader in music sponsorship providing brands with an opportunity to reach its core millennial customer base. Accordingly, this segment has an EBITDA margin of over 75%.These financial metrics illustrate the importance of the ticketing and sponsorship/advertising units to the value of Live Nation, even though these segments collectively contribute less revenue than the Concert segment. However, these high margin businesses stand to benefit from the growth of the low margin concert business over time; thus, it is important to consider the Concert segment revenue growth, as it is a key driver of future EBITDA growth at the higher margin businesses. Concert revenue has grown at a 14% CAGR over the past three years (since Liberty Media installed Greg Maffei as Chairman and laid out strategic initiatives aimed at increasing event attendance), while revenue from Ticketing has only grown at a 4% rate, and Sponsorship and Advertising revenue has grown at 11%. To the extent that the strong growth in the core business will transfer to these higher margin businesses, we believe that Live Nation can transform into a materially more profitable business over the next several years.The company’s president, Michael Rapino is an industry veteran. Rapino founded a promotions business in Canada which was sold to Robert Sillerman in 2000. Following the spin-off from Clear Channel in 2005, Rapino was tasked with running the new business. He rebuilt the management team, divested non-core businesses, such as sports agency and motor cross promotions, and focused on producing live music events. Rapino has spearheaded new initiatives, such as Ticketmaster’s Verified Fan, which limits the number of tickets sold to resellers, such as StubHub using artificial intelligence to identify genuine fans. The technology ultimately enables artists to capture a larger proportion of the revenue pool. In the third-quarter results, the company revealed that only 2% of concert tickets and 4% of music events were resold on secondary ticketing platforms. Digital tickets linked to a personalised Ticketmaster account and displayed on smartphones are gradually usurping physical tickets. Indeed, the company reported on the Q3 2018 earnings call that 97% of NFL match attendees entered through the gates using a digital ticket. The mobile app improves engagement by de-anonymizing the fan and offering a range of personalised content and relevant promotions based on their individual preferences, thereby lowering the cost of marketing a tour or event. Live Nation’s digital eco-system – supported by Ticketmaster – offers brand owners compelling marketing and sponsorship opportunities to reach targeted demographics. Advertising campaigns range from global touring rights’ for beverage companies to stage name sponsorship. Sponsorship spending for live music events represents a $4-billion opportunity. As the market leader, one might expect Live Nation to benefit from such highly incremental marketing revenues.Live Nation KPIsSource: Company ReportsLive Nation is a vertically integrated live entertainment business with control over producing live content and distribution through ownership or management of over 12,000 venues and proprietary ticketing services. For a venue or arena to switch to an alternative ticketing provider involves huge switching costs – both in technological migration to a new platform which can support a comparable load and re-training staff. It has taken seven years and significant investment to improve the Ticketmaster platform with a dedicated team of engineers supporting the infrastructure. Given the complexity and opacity of ticketing markets, especially across the secondary market, and the strength of existing relationships with incumbent venues and arenas, the ticketing services market would be challenging for a new entrant to penetrate whilst incumbent ticketing specialists – Tickets.com, Paciolan, CTS Eventim, Eventbrite, eTix, Ticketfly and SeatGeek – lack presence in other key parts of the value chain.With the exception of its direct competitor, Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG), there are few other rivals with the scale and distribution capability to promote live shows and draw large audiences. AEG owns several prominent arenas and venues, including the Staples Center in Los Angeles, the StubHub Center in Carson and O2 Center in London. AEG also has its own ticketing service (AXS) and runs an artist management business.Through its subsidiaries, Live Nation manages over 500 artists worldwide. Its ticketing business is extensive: Ticketmaster is one of the top five largest commerce sites globally, selling over 580 million tickets per annum. The group has a 400-strong sales force dedicated to working with 1,000 sponsors engaged in strategic relationships, local venue-related deals and national agreements both in North America and internationally. Smaller live promoters such as TEG Dainty Group, Another Planet Entertainment, Jam Productions, IMP and LiveStyle simply lack the resources to compete on a level playing field. By virtue of its size, reputation and digital resources, Live Nation has become the preferred partner for artists seeking to expand their income from live entertainment and tap into the company’s broad array of services and advanced technology. Moreover, the group has the rights to stage many of the most renowned live music events and festivals globally which will generate a reliable income stream over many years to come.Whilst difficult to precisely quantify, Michael Rapino (group CEO) believes the company holds global market live music production share of around 20-30% with a long runway of growth in emerging economies. Similarly, Ticketmaster has a 30% share in the global general ticketing market. Within talent management, based on number of artists represented, the group is rivalled only by Red Light Management.AEG has accused Live Nation of retaliating against venues refusing to contract with Ticketmaster by routing the tours they promote to other venues. Live Nation has steadfastly denied such allegations. Were the claims to be upheld, Live Nation would be in breach of antitrust law and the Department of Justice decree signed in 2010 as a contingency of the Ticketmaster merger which forbids the firm from forcing a client to purchase both talent and ticketing.Live Nation is pursuing a growth strategy, which involves reinvesting operating cash flow to expand its event roster and service more fans. As the business scales the higher margin segments - sponsorship, ticketing fees and amenities – will grow in line with a larger addressable market, which will drive an expansion in operating margins and free cash flow. GAAP earnings have been depressed for many years since the company has reinvested operating cash flow into new technology, geographic expansion, new promotions and venue acquisition which will drive high single-digit revenue growth and double-digit operating profit growth for years to come as the business benefits from operating leverage.In 2018, the firm is expected to generate free cash flow of $530 million. The company has a market capitalisation of $11.3bn and enterprise value of $10.4bn excluding capitalised operating leases. This implies the business trades on 20x current free cash flow. This valuation offers an attractive entry point to a unique, well-managed business with longevity and considerable barriers to entry.There are multiple secular trends underpinning the core business whilst volume growth will drive margin expansion across the ticketing and advertising and promotion segments. At a 5% free cash flow yield, a fair price is being paid for the business in a low-growth scenario, while having risk-adjusted exposure to the sizeable potential gains in future profitability.Live Nation is benefiting from a secular shift among young consumers towards experiences with live events offering considerable value in a world where moments are captured via the smartphone and shared across social media platforms. Concerts rank among the top three experiences young people are most willing to spend their disposable income on whilst artists understand touring is a necessary way to earn a living and engage with fans. Live Nation brings artists together with music fans controlling both the content and distribution. Its business model is vibrant because it pays artists full value for hosting the live show, whilst monetising ancillary areas, such as sponsorship (both physical and digital programs), food and beverage sales, parking and ticket servicing fees. Live Nation’s business starts by taking care of the artist by providing a holistic platform to showcase their skills direct to audiences worldwide. The model provides trust and transparency to the artist with the company covering venue costs, ticketing, marketing and promotion. This is in direct contrast to the recording and publishing side of the business where the system lacks transparency and the artist has not always been fully compensated by record labels for their contribution.Live music has become the center of the eco-system for artists to monetise their talent and connect with their audience. The business is global and Live Nation has a foothold in 41 countries. The core business is thriving as consumers set aside a portion of their disposable income to frequent 2-3 concerts on average per annum. Many of the festivals managed by the group, such as Bonnaroo Music Festival, V Festival, Creamfields and Lollapalooza are steeped in tradition and occupy strong share of mind. The group has over 1,000 advertisers which connect with 86 million fans that attended events last year – a larger customer base than either the NBA, NFL or NHL. Shows are oftentimes streamed live either online or on a mobile app, which has allowed the group to triple its digital advertising income. The group has the database to provide a one-to-one relationship with its audience to monetise ancillary areas such as merchandise and facilitate more targeted promotional activity. As virtual reality becomes a reality, the future, whilst ostensibly speculative, may involve consumers from all around the world unable to attend in person ‘experiencing’ concerts in real-time through VR headsets. This would open up a new revenue stream hitherto untapped. Live Nation is expected to serve 90 million fans in 2018, up from 59 million in 2013. With growth stocks presently out of fashion, shares of Live Nation are recommended for purchase."

In 2018, more than 250 million tickets were marketed using the company’s systems – through stationary box offices, online or mobile. CTS Eventim sells 80 percent of all tickets for pop and rock concerts in Germany. 60-70 percent of all tickets which are sold via ticketing systems in Germany are sold through CTS Eventim's system. Its online portals operate under brands such as Eventim.de, oeticket.com, ticketcorner.ch, ticketone.it and entradas.com.The Eventim Group also includes many concert, tour and festival promoter companies for events like ‘Rock am Ring’,‘Rock im Park’, ‘Hurricane’ and ‘Southside’, each of them with more than 70k visitors. Furthermore, CTS Eventim provides the ticket sale exclusively, e.g. in 2017, CTS Eventim was the exclusive ticket seller of the Rolling Stones tour in Germany and the Metallica concert in Hamburg. In 2018, Rammstein, a well known German rock band, worked exclusively for the (personalized) ticket sales with CTS Eventim too.In addition, the footprint extends beyond the borders of Germany. Some of Europe’s most renowned venues are operated by CTS Eventim, for example the LANXESS arena in Cologne, the Waldbühne in Berlin and the Eventim Apollo in London. As the European market leader for ticketing CTS Eventim is active in 20 countries, eg. the United Kingdom, the Benelux, Switzerland, several Eastern European countries, Israel, Russia and Italy. In 2014 CTS Eventim was the official supplier in the category 'Ticketing Services' for the Olympic Winter Games in Russia.Besides this market power, there is another fact that I like very much. The company CTS Eventim is only publicly traded to a limited extent. According to Forbes, the founder and CEO of CTS Eventim Klaus Peter Schulenberg actually owns more than 40 percent of the company.(Source: Klaus-Peter Schulenberg)For me as an investor, looking for companies with a long-term business horizon, this is a good sign because research has found that owner-managed companies do perform better than an average company which is managed by ‘extern’ managers. The reasons are:I also like the market where CTS Eventim operates. Live events like the Olympic Games, the Football World Cup, festivals or operas are as old as modern man. One of the first music festivals was held in the Ancient Greece during the Pythian Games. As before, everyone likes a certain music artist, singer or sport athlete. Maybe styles and fashions changed but not the importance of the live interaction with the artists itself. So people will always pay to see their favorite artists live, regardless if it is a rock band, a singer in the opera or an athlete in the arena. Therefore, I would call the business model quite established and secure.Of course, it is to be expected that in times of crisis or recession, the willingness to pay high entrance fees could decline. But overall, listening to live music or visiting cultural events is still a basic need in human interaction. For all this, CTS Eventim offers its service, both digital and analog. This shows that the company is also consistently using new technologies to further enhance its footprint in the value chain.The growth and market power of CTS Eventim has resulted in monstrous price gains (for a fairly traditional business).(Source: onvista.de)Additionally, shareholders were not only rewarded with the price performance. The company has been paying a dividend since 2006, which has been increased since 2008 each year. Only in the years 2006 and 2007 was there no increase. But overall, the annual payout has increased fivefold during this time. The following chart gives a good picture of the impressive dividend development (note: The chart uses USD) which represent incremental returns beyond the increased share price.CTS Eventim has rewarded its investors with continued earnings growth and high cash flow:(Source: onvista.de)The company plans to distribute each year 50 percent of its profits to shareholders. While a payout ratio in the middle range (50-60%) suggests that the company can adequately cover its dividend, it leaves enough financial space for investment in future growth, e.g. through acquisitions. Note, however, that - as is customary in German companies - the payment is made only once a year (usually in April or May) and not quarterly. For 2018 the dividend yield was 1.90 percent.As regards EPS, CTS Eventim expects mid-single-digit growth in 2019. According to FactSet Research Systems Inc. (FDS), a provider of financial information and analytic software for investment professionals, the outlook could be too conservative. FDS expects CTS Eventim to announce earnings of 1.47 EUR per share for the current fiscal year. This would mean a double-digit growth and at the same time an equally high increase in the dividend.But as the yield indicates, the growth comes with a high price. For 2018 CTS Eventim has a P/E ratio of nearly 36. Even with the optimistic outlook of an EPS of 1.49, the forward P/E ratio for 2019 is with nearly 31 still very high, even for a growing business. Nevertheless, there are some things you have to consider and which are giving the stock a lot of fantasy.In terms of the high valuation, I would like to recall a quote from Warren Buffet.To understand this high valuation, you have to consider the business and how it is operated by CTS Eventim. The company engages in all upstream and downstream areas of the ticket business with a unique business:In the early years, the company started with a ticketing software. The former business was to rent this software to ticket seller. But today, one of the main businesses is the organization of concerts and performances on own account, where CTS Eventim has brought it to the world's third largest provider. But the company has not forgotten the past and has maintained the selling business too. With buying more and more companies (ticket seller as well as other promoters), CTS Eventim has built both, the infrastructure for concerts, festivals and other events and the organization of ticketing. For the European market, this resulted in a quasi-monopoly because of the resulting natural entry barriers for potential competitors (note: I will go deeper into competition in the next paragraph).These entry barriers are due to a bottleneck and indirect networks effects created by the dominant business position of CTS Eventim: As more promoters use the CTS Eventim's system, more booking offices and customers will depend on the system (and vice-versa). CTS Eventim uses these effects: To promote an event yourself, you must distribute the tickets via the CTS Eventim ticketing system to reach consumers. If you are a ticket seller and would like to distribute tickets yourself for an event, which is highly likely promoted by CTS Eventim, CTS Eventim forces you to use their own CTS Eventimsoftware. Hence, the more CTS Eventim grows, the safer the business becomes.But that’s not all. CTS Eventim engages in other business areas too and diversifies their business further. Together with the Austrian toll system provider Kapsch Traffic Com. (A0MUZU) CTS Eventim has been awarded the contract for the collection of a car toll in Germany. The contract will last for at least 12 years from the start of the so-called infrastructure levy. The order volume for this time lies with two billion euro and is the largest single order in the history of CTS Eventim. Additionally, there is the opportunity to renew the cooperation once for three years or three times for one year each - for a maximum of 15 years. This opens up completely new and steady income streams and positions CTS Eventim for completely new markets.There a three things which worry me a little bit (besides the high valuation). Firstly, there may be some competition in the future (from Live Nation Entertainment (LYV) and Amazon (AMZN)). However, I see minimal danger here, as CTS Eventim’s business is too strong and has high entry barriers.A second risk is that festivals are possible targets for terrorist attacks.In my eyes, however, the biggest threat could be regulatory pressure.When it comes to competition, basically there is only one real competitor - Live Nation Entertainment. Live Nation Entertainment is the world’s largest producer of live entertainment. Consisting of Live Nation, Ticketmaster and Front Line Management Group, the company is the market leader in promoting concerts, ticketing and sponsorship. In fact, Live Nation Entertainment's stock has done pretty well.Nevertheless, comparing the fundamentals, CTS Eventim still seems to be the better play, even despite the high valuation of CTS Eventim. As you can see, despite strong growth in sales (Q1 revenue of $1.73B (+16.9% Y/Y), Live Nation Entertainment still makes no profit and pays no dividend.Given the fact, that both companies do basically the same business, I find it a little bit strange that Live Nation Entertainment does not manage to make a profit for its shareholders.Amazon (AMZN) could also be considered a potential competitor. In the meantime, the speculation about a large entry of the online giant even impacted the stock price of CTS Eventim. And indeed, Amazon wanted to shake up the event ticketing market worldwide. In 2016, Amazon selected Great Britain as the test market for an entry into the online ticketing market. But after trying to gain some success for two years, Amazon decided to retreat. Last year, Amazon also postponed the planned market entry in the USA. This exemplifies the described bottleneck mechanics of the ticketing business; the market has high entry barriers and even Amazon could not gain any noteworthy share. Therefore, competition does not seem like a big threat to the business of CTS Eventim. This could also explain and maybe justify this huge premium on the share price.Terror threatAs mentioned above, another potential risk is the terror threat. Obviously, live events could be a target of potential attacks. For a promoter, it is important to invest in the safety of its guests. Therefore, the promoter has to put in place all essential measures to protect the visitors, (e.g. through more trained staff, more technology for monitoring, use of drones etc). These costs, could hurt CTS Eventim's margin. More importantly, fewer people may attend the events as a result of this threat. That would hit CTS Eventim twice, as it not only organizes events but also sells tickets.Regulatory headwindsOverall, a bigger threat to the business could be seen in regulatory pressure. In fact, CTS Eventim faces some headwinds from here. Ironically, these headwinds are directly related to the company's dominance in the ticket and entertainment market.As I stated above, the market of ticketing and promoting is a conservative and old one. Furthermore, the business of selling tickets or promoting festivals or concerts or to go to these events is not dangerous. Accordingly, regulatory efforts on the part of the German competition authority is due to market power. Given that every investor is looking for exactly this market power, the current investigation of the German Federal Cartel office (NYSEMKT:FCO) could also be seen as a ‘hint’ that CTS Eventim is a real and maybe the biggest champion in the European market. But let us dig deeper into this regulatory pressure and evaluate if there could be a more serious threat to the business model of CTS Eventim.Due to the market power, since 2015, the FCO has been investigating the company for antitrust violations. It examined whether CTS Eventim abuses its dominant position with exclusive contracts in order to drive smaller companies out of the market. The clauses in question stipulate that the contracting parties may only sell tickets exclusively or to a considerable extent via CTS Eventim's ticket sales system. The FCO regards these contractual agreements as an abuse of market power under competition law. This resulted in a prohibitions of exclusive agreements with ticket sellers. But this decision does not mean, that the FCO destroyed the business of CTS Eventim, because according to the requirements set by the FCO, CTS Eventim's contract partners must only have the possibility in future to sell at least 20 percent of their annual ticket volume at their own discretion via third party ticketing systems, provided that the contracts are for longer than two years or unlimited. This means, for contracts which last only one year or a maximum two years, exclusivity is not prohibited.With CTS Eventim being such a dominant company, there is limited potential for acquisitions of smaller companies. The acquisition of the concert agency Four Artists failed due to a decision of the FCO. So, future growth through acqusitions could be limited here. But even that reflects the strength of CTS Eventim. The conservative and age-old business itself does not call for regulation, but the regulatory pressure faced by CTS Eventim could force the company to expand into other geographic markets or other services. With the surcharge for the toll, at least second succeeded perfectly.Despite regulatory risks, CTS Eventim is operating an extremely solid, growing and conservative business with very high entry barriers. Even Amazon had trouble gaining a foothold into the market. Furthermore, unlike Live Nation Entertainment, CTS Eventim does make profit. Regulation pressure could force CTS Eventim to expand into other geographic markets or other services. With the surcharge for the toll at least second succeeded perfectly. For investors who are looking for a good investment opportunity outside of the U.S. market, where Amazon does not command a presence, CTS Eventim may fit. Given the recent rise in share price, potential buyers (maybe) should wait for a decline.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4309651,104812,2019-11-28T09:25:29-05:00,"Live Nation posted a weaker-than-expected Q3 based on the timing effects of some major events.Revenue growth has slowed this year, but pricing and high-margin Sponsorship & Advertising business is supporting an increase in earnings.Company has a strong market position, but we highlight some valuation concerns.","Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE:LYV) is the largest live event and entertainment promoter in the world with ticketing platforms in 44 countries including its ""Ticket Master"" brand. The company either owns, operates, or has exclusive ticket distribution rights for over 235 venues recognized for its efficient systems and marketing reach. The stock has been a big winner, up an impressive 850% over the past decade driven by strong growth including acquisitions as the company continues to consolidate its market leadership position. Recent trends including firming margins and higher ticket pricing have added to the bullish momentum and strong outlook. With that said, the company recently reported its Q3 earnings which missed expectations highlighting some emerging valuation concerns as the stock commands a high premium. This article recaps recent event and our view on where LYV is headed next.(Source: FinViz.com)Live Nation Entertainment reported its fiscal Q3 earnings on October 31st with GAAP EPS of $0.71, which was $0.07 below expectations. Revenue of $3.77 billion missed estimates by $300 million and represented a decline of 1.8% year over year. Q4 concert revenue declined by 3% y/y in constant currency which drove the top-line miss.Considering the timing effects based on the global events calendar, the year-to-date figures over nine months help present a more consistent overview of the underlying operation. Indeed, the company focused on these metrics over the first nine months of the year in the press release. Total revenues this year are up 8% in constant currency while the adjusted operating income, ""AOI,"" has climbed by 15% y/y. The adjusted AOI margin is up to 10.2% year to date from 9.3% over the period last year.(Source: Company IR)It's important to recognize that while Concerts represent the highest proportion of revenues at 82%, Sponsorship & Advertising segment has the highest adjusted operating margin at 64%. Favorably, this is also the fastest growing area of the business up 17% this year, which is supporting the overall profitability outlook. This segment also grew at 26% y/y in Q3.During the conference call, management offered a positive outlook highlighting what was a record quarter in terms of total ticket sales, up 6% y/y through mid-October to 92 million and on track to reach 100 million for the full year. From the conference call:On the balance sheet, the company ended the quarter with total cash of $1.8 billion and total debt of $2.8 billion. This is in the context of free cash flow over the first nine months of the year at $531 million.The story has been firming margins evident by trend in ""AOI"" with Live Nation on track to generate its first full year of profitability ""available to common shareholder"" going back to its IPO. The company has been free cash flow positive and has generated positive operating income over the period, but the reconciliation here comes down to its capital structure as LYV is 33.6% owned by Formula One Group (NASDAQ:FWONA) which itself is subsidiary of Liberty Media Corp. Holdings. There is a separate dynamic of related party transactions as Live Nation generates some revenue from the controlling parties.(Source: Company IR)The relationship here, which is somewhat unique among most publicly traded stocks, creates some skewed financial metrics particularly as it relates to the company's earnings profile. Nevertheless, from an EPS loss of $0.09 in 2018, the market consensus estimate is for LYV to earn $0.202 this year, which is also forecast to more than double to $0.52 in 2020. Overall, the outlook remains bullish even with the weaker-than-expected results this past quarter.Data by YChartsLive Nation in its latest investor presentation does a good job of laying out the bullish case for the stock identifying seven key drivers which it feels presents a strong outlook. Briefly summarizing the main parts from the investor relations material, it becomes evident that Live Nation features aspects that make a good long-term investment; mainly a competitive advantage in a high barrier to entry segment and existing market pricing power.(Source: Company IR)Recognizing what is a solid company with a good business model, our concern here comes down to valuation as the stock appears pricey even with the convoluted capital structure and reconciliation of adjusted operating metrics. We are looking at the enterprise value to EBITDA over the trailing twelve months at 20.8x, which is above a five-year average closer to 17.5x. This is in the context of what is already a moderating revenue growth rate in constant currency that reached 11% in 2018 and was just reported at 8% over nine months through Q3. The growth rate of AOI of 15% is also below the CAGR at 25% between 2005 and 2018. Price to free cash flow at 38x is also on the expensive side in our opinion.Data by YChartsThe other point we consider is that the growth drivers for the company are changing from simply concerts and ticketing over the past decade to counting on more value added ""on-site revenue"" opportunities within its established venues along with pricing upside to continue its growth. Indeed, these drivers are the basis for the near-term earnings growth outlook.The bearish case for the stock comes down viewing the long-term growth opportunities as more limited than the company believes. We question how many more music festivals for example can be supported in any particular market without cannibalizing attendance or sponsorship opportunities from another. There's a sense that that the ""low-hanging fruit"" for events and entertainment in developed markets has already been captured.Live Nation has presented a long history of steady growth benefiting from an industry consolidation and consumer trends in the entertainment space. The story this year has been more moderate growth while the operating margin has expanded based on the Sponsorship and Advertising segment performance. Still, the trend is for more moderating growth worldwide.Compared to annual average revenue growth of 12% and adjusted operating income of 25% of between 2015 and 2018, the results this year show the momentum is slowing as the company enters a new phase in growth. As ticket sales slow into the single digits worldwide based on maturing markets, the company is looking for new growth opportunities.All-in-all we view risks as tilted to the downside as the company will be challenged to meet high expectations. We rate shares of LYV as a sell based on valuation concerns amid a new stage of decelerating growth where issues like margin momentum and quarterly volatility of ticket sales become more difficult to manage. Recognizing Live Nation's market leadership position and earnings trends, we think the positives in the story are more than priced in. Monitoring points include the evolution of margins, and we'd like to see the company build some momentum in concerts as a sign of ""organic"" growth."

Better yet, it just acquired a blockchain-based smart ticket platform that suggests they are already preparing for the next generation of ticketing technology.Live Nation's strength comes from the very deep roots it has established up and down the value chain. With a leading position in live experiences, Live Nation is a very stable business with generational tailwinds that are poised to continue to fuel growth over the years.Let's review in more details why LYV is a BUY after its record-breaking Q3 performance.Image SourceI came across this fantastic infographic from The New York Times that illustrates how Live Nation is using concerts and artist management to funnel business to where the profit margin is: Sponsorship, Advertising and Ticketing with Ticketmaster - which you may have used and complained about for their fees.Image Source: The New York Times April 2018The company handled shows for 4,000 musicians last year, many of them are among the biggest names in music both modern and classic.

He elaborated on the potential of the technology:A strong message is being sent by Ticketmaster management as well. The chief product officer at Ticketmaster, Justin Burleigh, pointed out in a press release that the company is ""constantly exploring emerging technologies"" and specifically praised blockchain technology.

If an arena doesn't pick Live Nation as an organizer, the company is not supposed to be able to punish the arena by diverting their artists from the venue. If Live Nation was investigated and a case was proven against the company, regulatory costs would be incurred.LYV is surprisingly fairly valued when you consider the stability of the business and the operating cash flow of the company.With a Market Capitalization of $11.6 billion, the company is still trading at about 20 times its operating free cash flow. With Revenue and AOI improving, cash flow should naturally follow with the flywheel model continuing the virtuous cycle, bringing more revenue to the most profitable segments of the business.Source: Live Nation Entertainment Form 10-KSource: PR NewswireAn important thing to keep in mind is that Liberty Media (LSXMA), headed by John Malone, has a 34% stake in Live Nation. There have been rumors of a potential merger between Live Nation and Sirius XM (SIRI), another company in which Liberty Media has a large stake. This could positively impact Live Nation's business since it would expand the vertical integration of the business with radio and music streaming services.Live Nation Entertainment is the largest player in the live events industry and is able to secure the top artists, creating a virtuous cycle bringing Venue, Ticketing, and Sponsored & Advertising revenue.Millennials - America's largest generation by population - not only highly value experiences, but they are increasingly spending time and money on them, attending concerts, festivals or live sports events.Despite its strong leadership position and the societal tailwinds helping its business grow, the company is still valued at a reasonable price.

This week the cell giant announced that it has inked a deal with Pandora (P) as well as Live Nation (LYV) which will give a free subscription to the music streaming service as well as discounts to live events. T-Mobile subscribers were treated to Netflix (NFLX) subscriptions last year.For T-Mobile the benefit of such deals is simple. It creates consumer value and attracts customers to its services. For T-Mobile partners the benefits of such deals is simple. These services garner more customers as well. Essentially it is the new age version of bundling services despite the fact that services are being supplied by different companies.Pandora Deal Pandora was among the first to venture into the music streaming business. In the early years the company struggled, like any streaming service, to find a way to monetize the delivery of music. Traditional terrestrial radio was never hampered by huge royalty fees, and this made it difficult for streaming services to gain enough traction to reach profits. While many streaming services fell by the wayside, Pandora was able to survive and appeared to be the market leader until Spotify came onto the scene. Spotify gobbled up subscribers with options like the ability to stream what you wanted when you wanted it.Over the past 18 months Pandora has been on a mission to re-invent itself, become more relevant, and take on Spotify. The company received a capital infusion from satellite radio provider SiriusXM (SIRI) which also took seats on the Board of Directors and helped in setting the stage for a better business model.With the T-Mobile deal, customers get a full year of Pandora Plus. This is the mid level package offered by Pandora. It is essentially an advertising free version of Pandora, but stops short of allowing instant music selection and downloadable content. The breakdown is below: Source - PandoraAs you can see, T-Mobile users are getting an added value of $4.99 per month. A free subscription to Pandora plus is a great start, but full customization and on demand song selection are lacking. Essentially this gives users a taste of Pandora and an ability to upgrade to Pandora Premium for just $5 more. The benefit to Pandora is simple. Pandora now has access to millions of T-Mobile subscribers and an ability to drive at least a portion of those new users to its premium service.Now, let's be realistic. This deal does not create a sudden wave of customers. The benefit of this deal will happen over time. The key here is that Pandora is making moves that have a good potential of delivering to top line as well as bottom line growth.Live Nation Live Nation is also part of the T-Mobile announcement. Benefits include: The Live Nation of the T-Mobile announcement is a gem. There is exposure all around, and people are always seeking a way to get tickets, enhance the live performance experience, and get treated like a VIP. Live Nation gets the benefit of a large pool wanting to participate, and T-Mobile gets the cross promotion of the wow factor as their trademark magenta color takes a front row presence.What Was Not AnnouncedWhat was not in the press releases is something my readers are already pretty familiar with. It is the synergy strategy being deployed by Liberty Media (LSXMA) (LSXMK) and SiriusXM.Liberty Media owns a 72% stake in SiriusXM, and a 34% stake in Live Nation. SiriusXM owns a 20% stake in Pandora. Over the past year, the speculation surrounding this handful of companies has begun to grow. They have commonality on the respective Boards of Directors, and have already begun developing some synergies in a more ""behind the scenes"" manner. With two players of this consortium now working with T-Mobile, is it possible that other deals are in the works? Consider the words of Pandora CEO Roger LynchClearly Pandora is making some disruptive moves, and in doing so has partnered with the cell carrier that is legendary in being disruptive itself. T-Mobile customers are engaged because a lot of what T-Mobile offers is actually valued by the consumer. From free pizza, to gas discounts of $0.25 per gallon at Shell, T-Mobile customers get a lot of benefits. T-Mobile is already promoting the Pandora news and Live nation news on its T-Mobile Tuesday app, where customers score free stuff and discounts simply for being T-Mobile subscribers.Pandora is currently trading at about $8 per share. the company has had some impressive numbers in quarterly reports, but investors might have been seeking a method by which these impressive numbers can continue. Simply stated, the street wants to see confirmation that Pandora can be a growth story. While I do not see this deal alone as an instant driver of equity appreciation, it does help solidify a foundation at current price levels and offer some strength to future growth.The simple message here should be clear. Pandora and Live Nation are making bolder moves. The more subtle message is perhaps that some serious bundling could be on the horizon, and that could lead to some deals that drive the related equities upward. Stay Tuned!"
4148079,104119,2018-02-19T07:50:14-05:00,"One of the highest priced stocks I've come across recently is Live Nation.With a P/E of over 2350, its earnings yield is 257 basis points below the U.S. 10 year bond rate.Yes, there are industry tailwinds, with the U.S concert market alone expected to grow to $24.55b by 2021.Yet, with its dilutive history and expensive price, I don't believe Live Nation investors are in the best position to benefit from those tailwinds.Putting its fundamentals into context, Madison Square Garden makes 1/6th of its revenue and 9/10ths of its profit (and trades at 1/33rd of its price-to-earnings).","One of the highest priced stocks I've come across recently is Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE: LYV). It first caught my attention due to its massive P/E of 2351. I can understand why investors are optimistic. Yet as I outline below, the research suggests that high P/E stocks are not correlated with future earnings growth, but instead tend to experience future price declines. And when we combine LYV's high P/E with its poor track record of earnings growth and its history of dilution - in my opinion - it makes this company not worth the risk.Investors have reason to be optimistic: there are a lot of tailwinds facing the industry. As we know, for example, the U.S. concert market alone is expected to grow to $24.55b by 2021, with sporting events expected to grow to just over $62.3b.As LYV's Michael Rapino says in a recent conference:Consumers want experiences, and LYV may very well be in a position to benefit from these tailwinds. Nevertheless, I don't believe this growth will translate into bottom line profits for investors--especially when it comes at such a high price.I know P/E has fallen out of favor with revenue-obsessed investors, but that doesn't change the fact that evidence supports it. Research links high P/Es to lower returns and lower price appreciation in the following decade (italics theirs, bold mine):Campbell et al. also show that short-term stock market performance can be predicted by comparing the inverse of the P/E ratio (the earnings yield) to market interest rates. They suggest that when the spread on the earnings yield isn't significantly higher than market rates, prices tend to fall to reflect that. Let's look at LYV's TTM earnings yield compared to the U.S. 10 year bond interest rate.US 10-Year Government Bond Interest Rate data by YChartsLYV's earnings yield is 257 basis points below than the U.S. 10 year bond rate. I don't expect this to change anytime soon, as LYV has struggled for years to increase its earnings in tandem with its revenue growth. While revenues are up nearly 130% TTM since 2010, its net income is down -0.19% over the same period.Let's put these fundamentals into some context by comparing them with an industry peer. In doing so, we can see that LYV's earnings are so low that they are on par with a company half its size (by market cap).LYV Revenue (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsThe Madison Square Garden (MSG) makes 1/6th of its revenue, and yet makes 9/10ths of LYV's earnings, as we can see in the table below.Source: Author's Compilation. Data from YCharts.MSG also offers more revenue per share and earnings per share (as well as revenue growth and EPS growth) at about 1/33rd of its price-to-earnings.Profitability is critical to a company's long-term success. When can we expect its revenue to translate into profits? Investors should not overpay for such uncertain bottom line growth.Another difference between the two companies is dilution.Source: Author's Compilation. Data from YCharts.While MSG has recently announced a stock repurchase program, we find a slightly different case with LYV. Let's get into it. As we know, when a company issues additional shares, an investor's ownership stake is reduced. Not good. When it comes to LYV, it has diluted its shares by over 165% over the last ten years.LYV Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Annual) data by YChartsLet's say you buy 1,000 shares of LYV today at ~$46.81, when LYV has~207m shares outstanding.Source: Author's work. Let's say, over the next ten years, LVY doubles its revenue. And, let's say, that because LYV investors love to reward revenue, the stock price reflects that. But because LYV has diluted its shares, there are now 548m shares outstanding.Source: Author's workHolding all else constant: instead of your shares being worth ~$93 per share, because of the dilution, they're now worth only ~$35 per share. Even though the company double its revenue, it increased its share count by 33%. That means that revenue per share has increased from $9 to only $20.50, instead of $27.27. Instead of your share of ownership being worth $129,900, even though you made the correct directional call, now, simply because of management's decision to dilute those shares, they're only worth $97,669.Simply, we're rewarded on a per share basis. And because of dilution, your return is muted.Even if there are great industry tailwinds from which the company may benefit, if it dilutes its shares, those benefits may not be not be passed on to you, the shareholder.The point is this. LYV trades a premium price relative to industry peers--trading at 33x the earnings of MSG, for example. Even granting incredibly charitable growth assumptions, investors may not be in a position to profit, as a result of LYV's dilutive history. Even assuming amazing years of excellent growth, an investor's reward may very well be muted, if it continues diluting its shareholder base. In my opinion, investors will be wise to give LYV a pass. If investors stubbornly insist of exposure to the live events industry, they would perhaps do better by considering one of its industry peers such as MSG."
4183517,20510,2018-06-23T13:20:51-04:00,Analyst sees possible Live Nation acquisition by Sirius XM.Liberty Media owns 34% of Live Nation.Acquisition would be a vertical merger and should have minimal hurdles.,"A discussion from years past is finally making its way front and center. Years ago, Liberty Media (LSXMA) (NASDAQ:LSXMK) (LSXMB) (FWONA) (NASDAQ:FWONK) took a stake in Sirius XM (SIRI). Another company that Liberty had a stake in was Live Nation (LYV). Live Nation is an event promoter, ticket seller, and does pretty much anything associated with live events. Way back when, I saw the possibilities of synergies that could exist between Sirius XM, Live Nation, and even some of the cable holdings that Liberty possessed. The conversation became more real when Liberty made a total buyout offer of Sirius XM. Ultimately, the buyout fell through because the arbitrage of the deal no longer worked.Fast forward to 2018, and we now have Citi analyst Jason Bazinet contemplating a move where Sirius XM would buy out Live Nation. His analysis was summarized by Fly On The Wall this way:This is very interesting and may even get a bit confusing for those new to the saga that is Sirius XM, Liberty Media, Pandora (P), and Live Nation. Perhaps it is best to start this way:With the table set, let's look at what this means to some of the equities involved. I will start at the top with Liberty Media.The Liberty Media stake in Live Nation is carried under the symbols FWONA and FWONK. Those symbols have ownership of Formula One Racing, a 33% stake in Associated Partners, a 15% stake in the Atlanta Braves, a 3% stake in DRL, a 25% stake in IdeasNet, a 4% stake in Inrix, a 7% stake in KSE, an 80% stake in Liberty Israel, a 34% stake in Live Nation, a 6% stake in Saavn, and a 6% ownership stake in Tastemade.Presumably, the FWON stocks would see a nice boost if Sirius XM were to acquire Live Nation. The interesting question is whether Liberty would sell its stake to Sirius XM, or if it would remain a partner in the deal with Sirius XM owning the other 66%. Confused yet? Let's go on.What if Liberty were to use its proceeds from selling its Live Nation stake to Sirius XM (if that is the taken path) to acquire more Sirius XM shares and take the ownership level above 80%. That would make an outright acquisition of Sirius XM by Liberty Media much easier in the not too distant future.Now, if Sirius XM were to acquire Live Nation, and synergies developed, then one can imagine Sirius XM's stock appreciating. That bodes well for Liberty media as well, considering that it has a 72% stake in the satellite radio provider.A big question might be what Liberty does strategically to best position itself. Does it spin off its Live Nation stake prior? Does it hold it in the same ticker? Does Liberty parlay this into something even more compelling?Now let's look at Sirius XM. Sirius XM would now have a live event juggernaut in its portfolio. It could cross promote Sirius XM with live shows, advertise shows on the satellite radio platform, obtain additional top line and bottom line revenue, and simply make a bold move for the stock that will make the recent 40% run in the last year look tame.Sirius XM's stand-still agreement with Pandora expires at the end of this year. Could Sirius XM get real bold, acquire Live Nation and then build a Pandora position in much the same way Liberty built up a Sirius XM position? Isn't this interesting? The possibilities seem almost endless and yet for the most part these seem to fly under the radar given the recent downgrade by Goldman Sachs.The Live Nation angle is compelling as well. The company has a stable investor in Liberty media, and would be acquired by a stable company in Sirius XM. The obvious synergies would play out, and Live Nation investors would get the benefit of a run up on the speculation, and then would also benefit from what would likely be a tax friendly all-stock transaction. The new powerhouse of Sirius XM/Live Nation would make both companies more efficient, deliver more free cash flow, and allow room for additional share buybacks, dividends, or even acquisitions (such as Pandora).From the Pandora perspective, there is really no bad path. The company has become much more stable under its new management and with Sirius XM's supporting role. In fact, it could be that Pandora would want to see this basket of ingredients come together in some fashion sooner rather than later.The bottom line on this is pretty simple when you boil it all down. Liberty Media is the rock solid force that helps make these companies as strong as they are. This is accomplished both directly and indirectly. I see Liberty Media as financial engineers that have become very adept at extracting value, maximizing value, and making the right moves at the right time. Even though the speculation is about Sirius XM acquiring Live Nation, savvy investors should always try to identify the Liberty connection. One might say that through Liberty you can get financial freedom. Sirius XM will want to develop its next strategy to garner more top line growth, and an acquisition may be just what the doctor ordered. I have a 2018 price target of $8 on Sirius XM. Stay tuned!"
4309821,103738,2019-11-30T05:40:25-05:00,"Live concerts and events have run into some volatile times in recent years as baby boomer retirements and young generation surge hit by recessionary fears.The industry as a whole is expected to experience lower growth rates in the years to come even as the company is expecting a sharp rebound in EPS after 2019.However, the 150x EPS multiple for 2020 is unjustified. I remain bullish on the industry, but neutral on Live Nation until net income improves dramatically.","Concerts and event promotion industries have experienced strong growth over the past few years as more baby boomers head into retirement and enjoy live concerts as well as younger generations like Millennials and Generation Z'ers prioritizing experiences over possessions and attending more and more live events.However, after growing at a 4.6% CAGR from 2014 through 2019, the industry is expected to cool as we continue thinking about recessionary trends and look to save more money by eliminating extra spending. In a new PwC report, live concerts in the United States are set to grow at a CAGR of 3.3% through 2021 and reach ~$31 billion.Live Nation (LYV) is the leader in live event and concert promotions and derives a significant portion of its sales from the aforementioned segment of the overall entertainment industry. As such, it has enjoyed an operating environment over the past few years as more concert goers and a spree of baby boomer retirements pushed ticket sales higher.The company is well positioned to weather any potential storm for a short period of time, and given the steady retirement income of retirees, there should be a solid base for its products and services to mitigate the loss of sales and profits. All in all, I remain cautiously optimistic on the company's year ahead even as it trades well above acceptable multiples.From 2014 through this year, live events and concert promotion in the United States grew at a CAGR of 4.6%. Nearly 10% of the US population, 32M people, attended a live concert in 2015, a fairly consistent average over the specified time frame. For the upcoming three years, however, the industry's growth rate is expected to stagnate as a PwC report projects the industry to experience a 3.3% CAGR through 2022 and reach around $31 billion.The benefit of the retirement spree and the very young generations making up the bulk of the live event and concert market is their relatively steady income streams (or their parents' income stream/summer jobs) thus removing a large variable that traditional industries face if or when the United States faces a more serious economic downturn. Even in 2016, when there was a slowdown in spending after the China market scare, the industry had one of its best years yet with record concert attendance.Live Nation holds around $1.8 billion in cash and is a cash-heavy company as turnaround time in the industry is rather quick between setup time and prepayment from those attending its events and concerts. It also has $2.2 billion in property and equipment after accumulated depreciation.The company does, however, hold $2.7 billion in long-term debt, forcing it to pay out nearly $140 million every year in interest expense. This is a major hindrance on the company's profitability generation given its net income and a reduction in this debt will go a long way into justifying the higher-than-average share price in the years to come, especially as we continue to see higher interest rates in the shorter term.After reporting $10.8 billion in sales for 2018, analysts expect the company to report $11.5 billion for 2019, a 6% increase. For 2020, the company is expected to report an additional 10% increase to $12.65 billion, projecting that its soft 2019 numbers are temporary due to the economic slowdown in the United States caused by the US-China trade war.On the EPS side of things, analysts expect the company to report $0.18 for 2019, a low number given higher SG&A expenses and lower margins. In 2020, the company is expected to report $0.47, a 160% recovery-bump compared to the prior year.The company's largest competitors are almost exclusively private companies, excluding StubHub which is owned by eBay (EBAY), so peer comparison is quite difficult. The company is currently trading at 393x 2019 EPS given the annual decline it is expecting but is trading at 150x 2020 earnings.Given the growth rates expected from the company over the course of the next few years and its position within that industry, I believe it's highly unlikely that the company will be able to justify continuing to trade at such a high multiple in an industry expected to grow at under 4% this year.I do believe that a recovery in margins and a potential debt reduction plan can justify the company's valuation at around 100x EPS given its revenue multiple of around 1x, but not much higher than that. This puts the company's current share price well over the target price and in overvalued territory.Live Nation has an interesting business opportunity with the surge of baby boomer retirements and the realignment of consumer spending habits among the younger generations, but its current share price is quite overextended.The company is in a solid financial position for the year to come and should be able to pay off a portion of its debt to boost net income and justify this sky-high valuation. Without that, it's hard to see the company continuing to trade at such high multiples, and any slight miss on expectations could send it plummeting, creating an adverse risk-reward profile.I remain cautious on the company's year ahead."
4044275,101421,2017-02-09T09:18:02-05:00,"Live Nation has acquired a majority stake in Israel-based Bluestone Entertainment for an undisclosed amount.Bluestone has quickly become a top promoter of international music entertainment in Israel.The deal is part of a continued albeit selective expansion by Live Nation into the Middle East, home to a large, younger demographic.Watch for more deals from Live Nation, as it scours the world for partnerships, joint ventures and other growth opportunities.","Quick TakeLive Nation Entertainment (NYSE:LYV) has acquired a majority interest in Israel-based Bluestone Entertainment for an undisclosed sum.Bluestone is a top promoter of major international music artists in Israel.Also, the two companies have ventured to launch Ticketmaster Israel as part of the formal relationship.I view the deal as a continuation of Live Nation's selective and deliberate expansion in the Middle East, to capitalize on the entertainment needs of a large and youthful population.Target CompanyTel Aviv-based Bluestone was founded in 2014 by entertainment veterans Guy Beser, Shay Mor Yosef, Guy Oseary and Gadi Veinrib to promote international artists in Israel.Guy Oseary, a noted popular music talent manager including U2 and Madonna, brought international contacts and 'mentorship' to Bluestone's management team.Bluestone is part of the Bluestone Group, which promotes live events, on-campus student events and promotional activities.Notable shows that Bluestone has promoted to-date include Rihanna, Bon Jovi, One Republic, Backstreet Boys, Juanes, Enrique Iglesias and others.In 2017, major groups on tap include Aerosmith and Guns 'n' Roses.Acquisition Terms, Rationale and CommentaryDeal terms were not disclosed by the parties.The two companies announced a joint venture to form Ticketmaster Israel, which is already ticketing Bluestone's major events.The addition of Israel has increased Ticketmaster's global reach to 28 countries.Live Nation acquired Bluestone to streamline its online tools and platform to continue developing the Israel market for major live events.In a statement, Guy Beser and Shay Mor Yosef also said, ""We see a huge potential for international artists in Israel, especially as the venue infrastructure improves over the coming years.""So, the acquisition is a bet on Bluestone's ability to pull large audiences together for international acts in Israel.Notably, the list of indoor arenas in Israel is growing:Israel also has numerous stadiums with much higher capacities.Obviously, venue security is a big issue. In 2014, a large-scale plot attributed to Hamas to attack Jerusalem's Teddy Stadium was successfully stopped.Presumably, as Israel's ability to secure large venues improves, the desire of average citizens to attend concerts and entertainment acts to make the stop on their world tours creates a virtuous cycle of increased supply and demand for such profitable events.The acquisition is a continuation of Live Nation's expansion in select parts of the Middle East.In 2013, it started Ticketmaster in the UAE and in 2015 signed a deal in Qatar to operate two large arenas in a joint venture with Elan Group.While a highly volatile region, the Middle East has a large percentage of young people, with 28% of the population aged between 15 and 29.This demographic is Live Nation's main target demographic, as they are heavy consumers of musical and live entertainment.Live Nation will likely continue to partner with and acquire stakes in Middle East entertainment concerns to selectively capitalize on the region's growth prospects.It's a risky move due to the unpredictability of the Middle East, but Live Nation is developing market share and regional operating knowledge, which will serve it well in the coming years.I write about IPOs, M&A, follow-ons and secondaries.

2045983,25432,2014-02-26T10:18:38-05:00,,"Executive summary:_______________________Shares of Live Nation have gone on an incredible run since the start of 2013, appreciating some 140% over that time frame. After the full-year 2013 earnings report and conference call after the market close on February 24, 2014, I think shares are still undervalued given the growth and margin expansion opportunities before Live Nation.The Live Nation EcosystemLive Nation is made up of three principal businesses, all of which complement each other and create the Live Nation ecosystem around live music events. The three businesses include:A good illustration of the value proposition comes from a recent slide deck from the Liberty Media Investor Day presentation. [Note: Liberty Media (LMCA) owns about 22% of Live Nation, which can be increased to a maximum of 35% based on an agreement with Live Nation.]As one can see, Live Nation controls the value chain for live music production from artist management, to ticketing, to owning and operating live music venues. On top of that, Live Nation is able to leverage its growing fan base by selling sponsorship and advertising services. This is a high-margin income stream at 70% margins, and presents an excellent growth opportunity. Sponsorship revenue was up 15% year-over-year, including 26% growth in digital advertising on various Live Nation internet properties. Given Live Nation's sites generate 34 million monthly unique visitors, there is significant room to monetize that sort of traffic. I understand Live Nation has 750 sponsors with high renewal rates given the niche target audience Live Nation serves.New Growth Driver, The Secondary MarketTo further leverage the Live Nation ecosystem, the company is expanding into an adjacent category: the secondary market for tickets. This is a big market, estimated to be $4 billion annually, and Live Nation currently has little market share. I expect that to change as Live Nation rolls out Ticket Master+ and leverages its brand name. In my view, this will also be a high-margin business, effectively acting as a ""toll collector"" on ticket sales through its Ticket Master+ platform.According to CEO Michael Rapino made a very insightful comment on a conference call last March (transcript courtesy of Seeking Alpha):I tend to agree. The market for secondary tickets is becoming more transparent as these sales move online. Rather than allowing ticket scalpers to realize margin on high-demand tickets, I think we will be moving more towards a real-time auction model for live event tickets, allowing content owners to benefit from supply/demand for its events.This, in my mind, is a big opportunity for Live Nation over the next several years, if it can capture a large percentage of secondary ticket sales working in conjunction with the content owners.Business Results, Non Cash Charges Mask Growing Free Cash FlowTo illustrate the scale and capital light nature of Live Nation's business, a good indicator is FCF growth. In 2013, Live Nation generated $300 million in FCF, up from $276 million and $203 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. That is significant FCF generation (up 50% in two years), and management is guiding for annual 40 to 45% FCF increases over the next couple of years.Given the low double digit revenue growth and the operating leverage in this model, I suspect Live Nation will generate ~$400 million in FCF in 2014, pricing the business at about 11x estimated forward FCF, and 14.3x last twelve months' FCF. Based on the growth profile, I think 15x forward FCF is an appropriate multiple. Using that indication of value, I am valuing Live Nation at $30 per share, or about 35% higher from here.Yes, Live Nation does have debt (although net debt is negligible given the cash balance). But the growth in cash flow supports the leverage, and should amplify equity returns over the next couple of years. Moreover, Live Nation refinanced its debt in August, significantly extending the maturities and reducing interest rates, saving Live Nation $12 million in cash interest costs. If we apply a 15x multiple to those interest savings, the refinance increased the value of the equity by $180 million.ConclusionLive Nation is the clear market leader in the live music category.Given the current valuation, Live Nation trades at about 15 times 2013 FCF and 11x 2014 FCF (estimated). I continue to believe that cash flow generation will increase disproportionately relative to revenue growth on account of the high-margin, incremental revenue streams Live Nation is rolling out via Ticket Master+ and sponsorship and advertising, both on site and digitally.Live Nation appears on track with its 3-year growth turnaround plan it laid out in early 2013 to significantly increase margins.Given the size of the global live concert/festival market, the moat developing around Live Nation's value proposition and the margin expansion opportunities, I think shares could be worth up to 15x forward FCF, or about 35% higher than the current $22 quote.Accordingly, I have a $30 price target on shares of Live Nation and I expect the shares to pop tomorrow after today's solid earnings report and guidance.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in LYV over the next 72 hours.

Margin of Safety is -125.8%.,"If you have heard of Warren Buffett or his mentor Benjamin Graham you are probably already familiar with value investing. Value investing has proven itself to be a profitable method of investing. Although it is not always profitable for every year, value investing has generated alpha for many investors in the long run. Value hedging is a form of value investing and market-neutral investing combination. Essentially, you go long on an undervalued security at the same time you are shorting another overvalued security. In addition to this one-two combination of undervalued vs. overvalued, you can replace one of the pairs with a fairly valued security as a hedge to isolate your alpha and beta risk.The following are types of value hedging pairs:If you are interested in how I came up with my investment theories, they are based on some of the following recommended books:I believe the answer is a qualified yes. This is what any good financial advisor would say. It has in the past, but it is no guarantee for future performance.For more examples of value hedging, please check out my other articles previously labeled “Asymmetric Allocation”, “Miracle Formula Investing” and “Intelligent Quant” to examine my investment performance or you can track my paper portfolio market-neutral/long-short at Guru Focus.I believe this is statistically relevant since the benchmark for Market-Neutral strategies is not the average S&P 500 benchmark. Because Market-Neutral funds hedge out broad market risk, a cashlike benchmark like U.S. Treasuries is more appropriate which were 2%-3%. Based on these results, I believe I am statistically correct in proposing Value Hedging as an alpha generating method when I beat the Treasuries about 37% (average 40% less 3%).In this article, I write about a potential money-making market neutral trade that consists of going long Viacom Inc B (VIAB) at the same time shorting Live Nation Entertainment Inc (LYV). There are three primary reasons why I believe this is a high probability market neutral trade. The first reason is the VIAB appears to be a better-quality company than LYV. Second, the valuations and margin of safety imply that going long VIAB and shorting LYV is a good market neutral trade for the diversified media industry. Finally, the short-term market sentiment indicators seem to support my investment thesis. Before we get into the three points, let me tell you more about the background of these two companies.Viacom Inc is a global media company. It produces television programs, motion pictures, short-form content, applications and games. The company’s brands include MTV, VH1, CMT, Logo, BET, Nickelodeon, Comedy central, TV Land, SPIKE, Tr3s, and VIVA. Live Nation Entertainment Inc is a live entertainment company. It is also a producer of live music concerts. The company is involved in live music events, venue operations, and ticketing services. VIAB has a $13.6 Billion Market Cap compared to LYV’s $9.2 Billion Market Cap. Both VIAB and LYV are considered in the diversified media industry. Technical Analysis TrendsSource: www.stockcharts.com.  VIAB has an upward trend with the 20-Exponential Moving Average above the 50-Exponential Moving Average.Source: www.stockcharts.com. LYV appears to be at a pivot point with the 20-Exponential Moving Average crisscrossing near the 50-Exponential Moving Average. The upward trend may continue, or it may reverse and trend downwards.Source: Morningstar.In the short-term, VIAB seems to have more positive momentum compared to LYV.Fundamental Analysis FactorsSince we are pitting two stocks against each other like handicapping two horses in a horse race, we can use basic key stats of value & growth to determine which stock is likely to outperform the other. The following are Key Stats for VIAB, LYV and the Industry Average:Source: Morningstar.Value HandicapsVIAB appears to be more undervalued than LYV based on these relative valuations. We will go over some major highlights of relative valuations. PE TTM ratio for VIAB is less than Industrial Average (6.6 < 23.3), while LYV’s ratio is significantly higher (875.2 > 23.3). PE ratios which are less than Industrial Average is considered relatively undervalued. PE ratios which are greater than Industrial Average is considered relatively overvalued. According to the famous investor Peter Lynch, a rule of thumb to finding undervalued stocks is look for PE ratios below 16.0.PE TTM is backwards looking. If we want to be progressive, then we need to have forward thinking. Wayne Gretzky: “Skate to where the puck is going, not where it has been.” He won major hockey games this way and you can do similar by investing where the market is analyzing Forward PE. Forward PE ratios use earnings forecasts instead of twelve trailing months ( TTM ). Comparing the Forward PE ratios for VIAB and LYV we find VIAB is significantly lower than LYV (9.1 vs. 344.8). Therefore, we can conclude that VIAB is likely to outperform LYV based on forecasted earnings projections.Growth HandicapsLYV has a better 3-Year average Sales growth rate and Net Income growth rate compared to both VIAB and the industry. However, Morningstar correctly identified VIAB as a slow growth company and LYV as a speculative growth company in my humble opinion. Why? Because of 1) Quality and 2) Relative Valuations. We already covered the some of the Relative Valuation metrics. Next, we will consider some Quality metrics to see why I believe LYV is a speculative growth company.Quality HandicapsIn the last section, we identified LYV to be the higher growth company than VIAB. However, I believe LYV is speculative growth because its Operating Margin and Net Profit Margin is significantly below Industrial Averages (Operating Margin of 2.7% compared to 20.1% for the industry; Net Profit Margin of 0.2% compared to 11% industry). In contrast, VIAB appears an undervalued slow growth company because although its Sales growth and Net Income growth is below Industrial Averages, its profitability is significantly higher than industry (Operating Margin of 18.8% compared to 20.1% for the industry; Net Profit Margin of 14.1% compared to 11% industry). VIAB’s Return on Equity of 36.4% is a lot higher than Industrial Average of 18.9%. While LYV’s ROE is drastically lower than industry (1.1%). Although VIAB has a higher operating leverage (Debt/Equity) than industry, this seems to be appropriate use of financial leverage because ROA is a lot higher than industry (8.1% vs. 6.1%). In contrast, LYV’s use of financial leverage does not appear to be an appropriate use of capital since ROA is lower than Industrial Average (0.2% vs. 6.1%).Based on Relative Valuations, Growth and Quality metrics, VIAB appears to look like an undervalued supermodel stock while LYV appears to be an overvalued ugly duckling of a stock.MorningstarSource: Morningstar.Morningstar only provided a Fair Value Estimate for VIAB of $35.00 and not for LYV. Based on this intrinsic valuation, VIAB has a 3.5% Margin of Safety.Value LineSource: Value Line.Using Value Line’s 3-5 Year Target Price Range, I converted the valuations into more meaningful statistics using time value of money with an assumption of a 10% discount rate. The following is my analysis for VIAB and LYV based on Value Line’s Target Price Range:Value Line’s Implied Annual Total Return (Average) is 25.0% for VIAB and -13.4% for LYV. Value Line Implied Current Fair Value Estimate (Average) is $56.35 for VIAB and $17.08 for LYV. Therefore, the Margin of Safety per Value Line Implied Valuation (Average) is 40.1% for VIAB and -160.2% for LYV. Adept Analyst (My Valuations)Enterprise multipleThe enterprise multiple is a ratio used to determine the value of a company. It looks at a firm as a potential acquirer would, because it takes debt into account (an item which other multiples like the P/E ratio do not include). The enterprise multiple based on EBITDA is calculated as: enterprise value / EBITDA. The enterprise multiple based on EBIT is calculated as: enterprise value / EBITEnterprise value = market value of common stock + market value of preferred equity + market value of debt + minority interest - cash and investments.Since there are no specific Enterprise Multiples for the diversified media industry, I averaged the Broadcasting, Cable TV, and Entertainment industries from the following website by the “Dean of Valuation” a.k.a. Aswath Damodaran:Source: Aswath Damodaran.Using the average Enterprise Multiples, I came up with the following valuations and Margin of Safety figures: Average Fair Value EstimatesAs a result, we come up with the Average Fair Value Estimates for VIAB of $79.18 and LYV of $19.67. Based on the last closing prices as of 1/12/18, the results imply VIAB has a Margin of Safety of 57.4% while LYV has a -125.8% Margin of Safety. According to these figures, this justifies our investment thesis that you should go long with VIAB and short LYV for this market-neutral trade. Insider ActivityThesis: buying opportunities can be found by looking at when insiders are buying. Checkout this article entitled, “When insiders buy, should investors join them?”  for why this can be a tell against other investment poker faces.Source: Morningstar.A check at Morningstar’s website, we find that insiders have been buying at VIAB, there has been more acquisitions by insiders than selling for VIAB with a 140.11% increase in shares by insiders in the last twelve trail months. This is a good sign because we want to go long VIAB. Trying to interpret LYV’s insider activity, I see more dispositions than accumulations of the stock with an overall -10.44% accumulation of shares by insiders. It appears that LYV’s insider activity signals bearish tones.Short TellsIn investment poker, there are three popular market sentiment indicators for a stock’s short-term outlook, which are 1) Put-Call Ratio, 2) Short Interest Ratio, and 3) Short Percentage of Float.Source: Morningstar, ThinkorSwim and www.finviz.com.  Put-call ratio is a technical indicator demonstrating investors' sentiment. The ratio represents a proportion between all the put options and all the call options purchased on any given day. The put-call ratio can be calculated for any individual stock, as well as for any index, or can be aggregated. The ratio may be calculated using the numbers of puts and calls or on a dollar-weighted basis. With a put-call ratio of 0.22, VIAB is bullish because there are less puts than calls. LYV’s put-call ratio of 0.291 is also bullish but less bullish than VIAB. Comparing these ratios with the market’s S&P 500 put-call ratio, we find VIAB and LYV are more bullish than SPY (a barometer for the overall U.S. market).The following table is a summary of how to interpret put-call ratios:The short interest ratio or float short for a public company is the ratio of tradable shares being shorted to shares in the market, or the float. It is an indirect metric of investor sentiment. When short interest is high it implies company’s investors hope shares will decline in value. Since the short interest ratio for VIAB is less than LYV, Viacom is likely to outperform Live Nation Entertainment Inc. on a relative basis.The following table is a summary of how to interpret short ratios:Short percentage of float is the percentage of shares shorted compared to the float. As of 1/12/18, VIAB's short percentage of float is 7.27%. LYV's short percentage of float is 10.69%. Therefore, VIAB is a better buy than LYV based on short percentage of float analysis.We analyzed both companies and found VIAB is a better-quality company and is relatively more undervalued than LYV. Although LYV has been growing topline sales and bottom-line net income at better growth rates than both VIAB and industrial averages, we had to categorize LYV as speculative growth and VIAB as slow growth. You should not buy growth for growth sake, but you need to follow value investment principles and buy growth-at-a-reasonable-price (GARP). LYV does not appear to be a good GARP investment if you go long on the stock. Then, we reviewed Morningstar and Value Line’s fair value projections for the stocks along with my Enterprise Multiple valuations and found VIAB undervalued and LYV to be overvalued. Finally, we looked at the insider activities and short investment poker tells with various market sentiment indicators and found this supported our original investment thesis. If the game is a tie in your mind or you’re on the fence about this value hedging idea after all I wrote then here’s the kicker to break the tie game. Kicker: if both stocks go nowhere or move in tandem then you can still collect a 2.4% dividend from VIAB because LYV does not pay a dividend. That is why I recommend you consider this value hedging market-neutral trade where you go long Viacom Inc B (VIAB) at the same time shorting Live Nation Entertainment Inc (LYV). An example of how to perform a market-neutral trade with VIAB and LYV using a position size of $1,000.00:To perform this value hedging strategy, you would long 30 shares of VIAB and short 23 shares of LYV.

Its 2.05% above a diversified basket of media stocks and 8.2% over the S&P for the period.Growth in mobile ticket sales were up 21% over the first six months of 2015. The company's app install base now stands at 19 million.How LYV's revenues break down as of the six months ended Q2 2015:*Note: Due to the significant revenue bumps the company gets in summer because of the production of outdoor venues, this period does not reflect what we may see in Q3 numbers coming up at the end of this month. Also because of its global scope, foreign currency fluctuations could impact results.Free cash flow was $91 million for Q2, up from $83 million in Q2 2014.Controlling the process end to endComparing LYN to other providers of mass entertainment we see several distinct advantages:Compared to cable TV: Cord cutting and the challenge of Netflix, Amazon and other streaming services to the ad revenue base will continue. This does not impact LYN at all.Compared with straight music business: So much content is essentially available free online that even the most dynamic online marketers of songs and actual CD product face a growing problem of literally competing for dollars that are shrinking due to the ready availability of free music.LYN does not have this problem. At the core of its business is the live experience, which cannot begin to compare for exciting its fan base to electronically transmitted music content.The demographic age-in/age-out dilemma of entertainment content doesn't applyExample: Casino operators as we have noted have a dual dilemma. On the one hand they need to hold on to existing older player bases against a declining total gaming win number coming out of the millennial generations. They are doing this by working with equipment makers to develop skill-based games. It is not entirely clear yet whether these new games will attract younger patrons in the kind of numbers they need to blunt the impact of lower or non-existing slot budgets. Their best bet is to hold firm, as may will, offer non-gaming attractions to offset loss of casino revenues and wait until the millennials finally age into gaming itself. And of course will program appearances by top contemporary artists (many of whom are part of the LYN family). MGM has gone a step further by investing in its new 20,000 seat arena in Vegas in partnership with AEG. Pew Research has good news in that their studies have shown that millennials tend to mature into similar leisure habit patterns as their elders.All forms of standard television content, be it network or cable, be it scripted or reality are trending downward due to the waning interest among younger consumers. The long established advertising for free content exchange model which generations of audiences willingly accepted is dying fast. DVR use is increasing and just debuting a system, which not only enables fast forward, but also eliminates commercials with a single click.Live concert entertainment involves far more than presenting an artist and selling a t-shirt afterwardIn 1988/1989 I created the Grandstand Under the Stars venue across the street from the Ballys Grand casino, where I was a C-level executive, running (among other things) the entertainment programming. The Grandstand was a 4,000-seat venue by the boardwalk, and we booked dozens of top names in contemporary and rock. We attempted to program a diverse schedule appealing to all tastes and age groups. We had Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, and many other A-list traditional names. We also booked hot rock bands, established stars from the '60s, '70s and '80s. We had appearances from Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan. Observing the differences in audiences wasn't difficult by eyeballing the age groups of the audiences. What was most striking, however -- and it showed not only in ticket sales but also in audience reactions -- was the ""tribal"" impact live shows produced. The audience for a given star was a temporary tribal gathering in that they all shared certain basic beliefs, hot buttons, understandings, and connection to one another, in addition to those focused on the performance itself.Our follow-up research held few surprises off these observations. Concertgoers who read of the scheduling of a favorite act as kind of a summons to the tribe to gather. They sped to buy tickets, to gather, to do their own tribal gestures and dancing during the shows and, above all, shared a commonality of emotion that simply is never possible in any other form of entertainment. The audience we concluded is part of the act itself, entertainment that was free to us in a sense but part of the chemistry of what we sold when we booked a given act.The formula is no different today. You can attend a Madonna or a Kayne West concert today. In her fifties,Madonna has held a good part of her international audience. In the middle of his career, West holds his. Both of them, so widely spaced by time and generations, operate from the same premise: Their audiences are part of who they are -- and who they like to think they are.We believe that is the secret sauce of LYV. Not only do its events bridge generations and tie together tribes of fans for its huge stable of artists, but it does so with no threat to aging out demos. They'll get audiences from tweens to the middle-aged. But their target is the huge center of millennials who are the most consistent consumers of music products.SummaryIn effect, LYV controls the entire chain of live entertainment product globally like no other operator in the sector. Consensus view has the stock rising into the $30 to $31 range by 2016. We see it moving higher on the upside because, according to one of our best industry sources:The earnings release on the 29th will contain results of their summer concert results. We expect recent trends to continue: A somewhat slackening off of their European tour revenues, an increase in their US concert cash flows and further increases in their sponsorship and marketing activities as major advertisers continue to break bonds with traditional media buys. Most recently, LYV signed a deal with Toyota that combines live and streaming shows.As readers of our articles know, we don't forecast earnings, leaving that to people who do that for a living. However, we do believe that LYV is a solid, well-managed sector leader that has not had the kind of Wall Street interest its fundamentals deserve, and warrants a hard look from investors with moderate risk profiles at this time.Note: Author Howard J. Klein had a 25-year-plus career as a C-level casino executive, during which property entertainment also came under his purview. In 1988-1989, he created the Grandstand Under the Stars, a 4,000-seat outdoor live entertainment venue that featured 45 top contemporary acts and bands. He's produced both shows and concerts during that time, and has been a close observer of the industry's customer base, beyond casino venues. This article provides a 360-degree view of LYV's business prospects and, by extension, the author's recommendations to investors."
1616562,20510,2013-08-07T22:57:04-04:00,,"It was about a week ago that I highlighted a bullish stance on Live Nation (NYSE:LYV) as it prepared to go into its Q2 earnings. In the article Live Nation Could Entertain Portfolio Profits, I broke down the Live Nation business model, and even offered up a little secret that made me even more bullish on the company.This week Live Nation did indeed report its Q2 earnings, and the result was the company surpassing street expectations essentially across the board.The street was expecting the company to report an EPS profit of 11 cents. The company came in at 30 cents. Revenue was ahead of analysts' expectations as well. The street was expecting revenue of $1.63 billion and Live Nation delivered $1.68 billion. The Live Nation story is just getting started, and the company is on a pace for its best year ever.If you have ever bought a concert ticket you know that you have to act fast. Well, the same mantra may well apply to Live Nation. The stock has more than doubled in the past year and is up almost 80% in 2013. The secret of Live Nation will not be a secret much longer. In fact, after the call analyst Albert Fried raised his price target to $33 from $18. The equity currently trades at $18.30, up from the $16.71 it was at when I featured it. Live Nation is building incrementally and continued improvement is in the cardsThere is still room in Live Nation to move. With such an impressive Q2, it makes me excited to think about how well Q3 will look. Current expectations are for 39 cents in earnings and revenue of just over $2 billion. I am expecting the street to revise these metrics upward based on the performance in Q2. Stay Tuned.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

We certainly do. For that reason alone, we thought Live Nation Entertainment would totally rock. Imagine our surprise when we discovered a company completely at odds with Nickelback's solid, consistent delivery of rocking--and instead delivering consistently poor performance and returns. In this brief article, we examine why we think investors are best off avoiding LYV and instead going for one of its more profitable peers.Live Nation, a live-events company that focuses on concert promotions, was formed in 2005 as a spin-off from Clear Channel Communications, and later merged with Ticketmaster in 2010 to become Live Nation Entertainment. According to LYV's 10-K:Predictably Poor PerformanceUnfortunately, the great story ends there. Live Nation's expenses are high in relation to its revenue. Below, we see that Live Nation spends nearly all of its total revenue on expenses--and has predictably spent nearly all its revenue on expenses for nearly 10 years. Remember, expenses are the operational costs a business incurs to earn revenue--and to maximize profits, a business needs to reduce expenses and raise revenues.Source: YChartsAlso, Live Nation's Operating Margin and Profit Margin are painfully low. Net margin shows how much profit Live Nation earns from each dollar of revenue. Live Nation only makes about $0.002 for every dollar of revenue.Source: YChartsFurther, Live Nation has a terrible history of generating poor returns on invested capital. ROA and ROE are predictably poor (0.22% and 0.94%, respectively). At times their returns could be called ""disastrous"" (for instance, when the company's ROE dropped below -55%).Source: YChartsAggressive AccountingGoodwillGoodwill makes up a very large part of LYV's Total Assets-approximately 20.5%, based on their 10K.Source: 10K and Author WorkGoodwill is an intangible asset that represents the price paid for an acquisition over and above the value of the acquired assets. It's for that reason that we like to remove it from the balance sheet. Goodwill represents an overpayment and therefore hardly meets the definition of ""asset"". When we strip away Goodwill from Live Nation's capital structure, we see that total, identifiable equity at the firm is quite slim. Currently goodwill is 92.3% the size of the company's total equity.Source: 10-K and Author WorkThe slim nature of Live Nation's Total Equity is made more stark when we compare Equity-goodwill with the firm's Liabilities. In sum, this is a capital structure with a great deal of debt and very little in the way of real equity.Source: 10K and Author WorkWe also note that at the moment, Goodwill is greater than shareholders' equity.Source: YChartsGenerous Accounting For AssetsIn its 10-K, Live Nation discusses what it considers to be a few of its assets (pp. 3-4)-including ""fans,"" ""artists,"" and ""employees"" (pp. 3-4). It may be possible to strictly call these assets according to U.S GAAP, but doing so leaves us unsettled.Source: Company 10-KLive Nation's intangible assets (both definite-life and indefinite-life) represent 18% of their total assets.Source: Company 10-KTo put this 18% in context, a company like Coca Cola (NYSE:KO) - which largely depends on its trademark name to differentiate it from competitors - values its definite-life and indefinite-life assets at a combined 8% of its total assets (according to its 2013 10-K, not including bottlers' franchise rights). For trade names like ""Ticketmaster,"" we find Live Nation's valuation a bit rich.ContextWhen we compare Live Nation with its ""Media - Diversified"" competitors, we find that it performs poorly. Live Nation is inferior to its competitors on almost every metric we looked at.Source: Gurufocus and Author's WorkWith the highest P/E (1,011) and EV/EBIT (43.14) and lowest returns, profit margins, and revenue growth, Live Nation investors are paying the most money and getting the least value.ConclusionGiven that Nickelback rocks the music world, we're disappointed to say that Live Nation Entertainment does not ""rock"" the investing world. Performance is poor, stock prices are high based on at least two metrics, it's more expensive than its better-performing competition, and goodwill and various intangibles make up way too much of its capital structure. We feel that investors need to put aside their love of Nickelback and switch out of LYV and into one of its more profitable peers."
1581372,20510,2013-07-29T15:48:16-04:00,,"Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE:LYV) has been on a tear over the past 12 months. The small cap company has a market cap of $3.2 billion, but could be reaching much higher over the next 12 months. Live Nation has more than doubled its 52 week low of just $8.16 and currently trades at $16.71. The Live Nation story is a compelling example in finding a way to find revenue and profit in virtually every aspect of its business. When you find that you do something well, reach out and replicate that success in other areas. The company is a clinic on squeezing out profits. Live Nation has four distinct interrelating business arms and also a small secret, that is highly positive, which I will reveal at the end of this article. Simply stated, if you have not entertained a position in Live Nation, you may well want to.The four business arms of Live Nation include Live Nation Entertainment, Live Nation Network, TicketMaster, and Artist Nation. These all generate revenue in concert with each other, and as a whole make Live Nation a profitable and compelling story. Remember, I promised another very positive aspect of Live Nation at the end of this article.Live Nation EntertainmentLive Nation Entertainment is the core business of the company. It revolves around concerts. The concerts segment principally involves the global promotion of live music events in venues owned and/or operated by Live Nation and in rented third party venues, This includes concert halls, stadium events, as well as music festivals. During 2012 the Live Nation concerts business generated approximately $3.9 billion in revenue. This revenue accounted for about 66.5%, of the company's total revenue. Live Nation Entertainment promoted 22,000 live music events in 2012. This business operates year round, but the biggest quarters are generally the second and third quarters. The company is getting ready to announce its third quarter financial report. Think about that.Live Nation NetworkIf you already excel at putting on concerts and music festivals, why not take it a step further and garner more revenue by starting a sponsorship and advertising arm of your business?Live Nation Network does exactly that. The sponsorship & advertising segment of Live Nation employs a sales force that creates and maintains relationships with sponsors, through a combination of strategic, international, national and local opportunities for businesses to reach their customers through the Live Nation concert, venue, artist relationship and ticketing assets. Want a cherry on top? Live Nation networks also promotes advertising and placement on its highly popular websites. Live Nation Network engages corporate clients to help create marketing programs that promote their brand and/or product. During 2012, the sponsorship & advertising business generated approximately $248 million in revenue. This represented 4.3%, of total revenue. While it may not seem big, how many times has a company missed their numbers by 4% or 5% and been punished for it?TicketMasterIf you can schedule the concert, promote the concert, and obtain the venue where the concert will be held, why not sell the tickets? If you are good at selling tickets, why not expand that into other events that offer tickets?TicketMaster is the ticketing arm of the Live Nation business. If you have ever listened to a radio or been to a concert you have probably heard of TicketMaster. In fact, whether you realize it or not you are very likely to have done business with Live Nation.TicketMaster, the ticketing segment of Live Nation, is primarily an agency business that sells tickets for events on behalf of TicketMaster clients. The agency retains a convenience charge and order processing fee for services rendered. TicketMaster sells tickets for its own events as well as for third-party clients. The third party business is quite substantial in its own right. Third party clients include arenas, stadiums, amphitheaters, music clubs, concert promoters, professional sports franchises and leagues, college sports teams, performing arts venues, museums and theaters. Tickets are sold through a combination of websites (78%), telephone services (6%), mobile devices (4%) and ticketing outlets (12%).Note that the biggest segment of ticket sales comes through websites. Do you see how TicketMaster and Live Nation Network have synergies? Now take that a step further noting the synergies with Live Nation Entertainment.During 2012, the ticketing business generated approximately $1.4 billion in revenue. This accounted for an impressive 23.6% of total revenue (face value of tickets excluded). TicketMaster sold over 148 million tickets in 2012 and sold an additional 108 million tickets through the box offices of venue clients.Artist NationArtist Nation in the Live Nation arm that provides management services to music artists. This arm of the business makes perfect sense. Live Nation is the clear leader in getting concerts set up, getting sponsors and advertisers, as well as ticketing. Wouldn't it make sense that the company would know something about managing the entire process?The business model here is simple. Artist Nation provides management services in exchange for a commission from the earnings of the artist. Included in this segment is the lucrative business of merchandise sales at the events, merchandise sales to retailers, and direct to consumer sales over the internet.During 2012 this arm of the Live Nation business generated $400 million in revenue that accounted for nearly 7% of the overall revenue picture. As with the concert business, there is a seasonality. The second and third quarters are the drivers in the Artist Nation business.Live Nations Q1 of 2013In Q1 of this year Live Nation saw its business improve nicely over the experience in the year prior. The company improved from a loss of 37 cents to a loss of 33 cents. The big quarters for Live Nation are Q2 and Q3. The company will be reporting its Q2 results on August 6th, 2013 at 5:00 PM.Expectations for Q2 2013Analysts are expecting big things from Live Nation in Q2 of this year. The consensus is that Live Nation will post a Q2 profit of 11 cents per share vs. a 4 cent profit in the same quarter in 2012. As you can see, the Live nation story is getting impressive.Analysts are expecting the revenue story to be just as impressive. The average expectation is $1.62 billion. Better still, in Q3 the revenue estimate is over $2 billion.While the sector as a whole is showing growth in Q2 at a clip of about 80%, Live Nation is showing earnings growth at 175%. This is more than double its peers and would make Live Nation among the leaders in the sector. This realization has been seen by the street to a certain extent, but the not everyone has caught up to the Live Nation story. The equity has gone up 100%, but the earnings growth is well above that level.Analysts have price targets on Live Nation that are up to $20. Updates have not been frequent with the most recent upgrade or downgrade coming a year ago from Stifle Nicholas, which lowered the equity from a buy rating to a hold. In the time since, the equity has doubled. Essentially, this equity has seen vast EPS improvement without getting the attention of Wall Street. That could be very compelling.The Final Secret of Live NationThe last aspect of Live Nation's business that I find compelling has nothing to do with the business itself. Rather, it has to do with who is invested into Live Nation. Liberty Media (LMCA) owns 27% of Live Nation. Liberty Media is huge. It has a controlling interest in Sirius XM (NASDAQ:SIRI) and a large stake in Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR). Liberty is even making a play for Time Warner Cable (TWC). Liberty Media is a titan that makes bold and profitable moves. While saying that everything that Liberty touches turns to gold may seem an exaggeration, it has been pretty much the path that Liberty Media has demonstrated. When Liberty Media takes an interest in a company, it tends to do very well.SummarySomehow, over the past year Live Nation has managed to double in price without getting huge attention from Wall Street. This type of equity appreciation is something that retail investors may want to note. It is sometimes thought that when a company begins to get the attention of the street that the upside is mostly already realized. Live Nation is still flying under the radar in some ways. You may want to take a good hard look at Live Nation. The next two quarters should be particularly impressive, and it is anticipated that this company will have some nice profits in 2014. Add the Liberty Media dynamic and you have a compelling story in the making. Stay Tuned.Disclosure: I am long SIRI, LMCA. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Additional disclosure: I have no position in Live Nation or Charter Communications."
1401441,39951,2013-05-03T17:52:13-04:00,,"An investment in Live Nation (NYSE:LYV) provides investors with an opportunity to buy into a unique set of assets that has an ecosystem to maximize that amount of revenue and profits available in the live entertainment industry. Unlike most of our typical investment reports -- which focus on free cash flow utilization, net asset value investing, mean reversion of margins or special situations -- this will look at the investment merits of a company that generates little free cash flow at the moment, and is somewhat of a growth investment if company management is successful in achieving its objectives.Live Nation's dominant size is a competitive advantage. The presence of a significant, value creating long-term investor, Liberty Media (LMCA), provides additional margin of safety from a liquidity standpoint. The strategy is not without risks, and we will discuss those as well. What follows is our analysis of the merits of Live Nation's three-year plan to grow its adjusted operating income (AOI) by 30%-35%.BackgroundLive Nation's current configuration was the result of a ""merger of equals"" in 2010 between Live Nation and Ticketmaster Entertainment. Ticketmaster shareholders received 50.01% of the combined company and Live Nation shareholders received 49.99%. The combined company had $6B in revenue and $500 million in operating income. The enterprise value at the time was approximately $2.5B. Today, LYV is the world's largest live entertainment company in the world. In 2012, the company connected with over 250 million fans and had over 180,000 events in 47 countries. The company is also the largest producer of live music concerts in the world, connecting 49 million fans to 22,000 events for over 2,300 artists.In addition, the company owns, operates or has booking rights in 139 venues including the House of Blues, the Fillmore and the Hollywood Palladium. Live Nation is also the leading live entertainment ticketing sales and marketing company, selling 400 million tickets a year. Finally, through the ownership of Front Line, the company is one of the world's largest artist management companies and manages over 230 of the world's best known artists, such as The Eagles, Christina Aguilera, Van Halen, Kid Rock, John Mayer and Kenny Chesney.While some investors may be attracted to the high profile artists and venues, the truth is none of those things are what attracts us to the company. If fact, because of the way the concert business works, the company makes very little money directly off of the artists or the venues, especially the small (1,000- to 3,000-person) venues that are often referenced in research or media reports (OK, we did it too.) What makes Live Nation an attractive investment in our opinion is the company's scale, which gives it the ability to monetize all aspects of the live music entertainment ecosystem in a way that is almost impossible to duplicate at a cost that is represented by the current enterprise value of the company. The company has publicly stated that it wants to increase its AOI from $460 million in 2012, to $600 to $620 million by 2015 ($140M-$160M or 30%-35% growth). Management has laid out several strategies it thinks will allow it to achieve these goals. In this article, we will analyze the various components of these strategies to gauge the likelihood of their success.Understanding the Live Music EcosystemBefore going any further, a brief discussion of the live music ecosystem is warranted. LYV's business model can be viewed as having two components: the content side composed of the artists and the concerts and the ancillary side which is ticket sales and advertising/sponsorships. We have rearranged the income statement into these two components. When LYV's business is looked at this way, it becomes clear what the strategy is.Since artists and managers typically receive 85%-95% of the concert-related revenue, the strategy is to increase the number of events the company promotes, which drives more event attendees and is then monetized with high margin ticket fees and sponsorships. The events themselves are almost ""loss leaders"" in a sense. This strategy is similar to the movie exhibition or television show business. Since almost 90% of AOI is derived on the ancillary side of the business, it will be the focus of this article.Content: Artists and ConcertsAncillary-Ticket Sales and Advertising/SponsorshipsCombined AOIAnalysis of Strategies Driving $140-$160 Million AOI IncreaseAs we mentioned, LYV has issued guidance for a 30-35% increase in AOI by 2015. This translates into an increase of approximately $140-$160 million on a starting base of $460 million. This is the main investment premise for owning stock in the company. If the company can meet or exceed this goal and investors place a higher multiple on the AOI, an investment in LYV could generate a 30%-40% increase in market value in three years. The company believes there are five components to this strategy. Below is a slide from a company presentation that summarizes the five components and the magnitude of their expected contribution. In this section, we will discuss the likelihood of successfully achieving each goal. If the company can achieve these goals, we would expect the total return over the next three years to be at least that. There is a possibility for EBITDA multiple expansion over that time as well, although with the caveat that investors only use ""free cash"" on the balance sheet when calculating the enterprise value.As the slide below shows, increasing sponsorship AOI and reducing ticket costs are the main drivers of the AOI growth. While the increase in AOI due to cost reductions is fairly straightforward to understand and calculate, the ability of the company to increase sponsorship AOI is much more complicated. We have provided a table of our estimated range of AOI for each category.Source: Company presentation.Potential Increases in AOI By CategoryInvesting 501 estimates.Increasing Fan Base by 5 Million Is a Three-Pronged StrategyLive Nation has stated that it would like to increase attendance by 5 million fans over the next 3 years. It is the monetization of these new fans through sponsorships and advertising revenue that is a major contributor to the potential 30%-35% increase in AOI by 2015. The reason the increase in fans is so important is because of the synergistic effects that result from the ecosystem that LYV has created around the music entertainment business. When LYV merged with Ticketmaster, one of the primary reasons given for doing so was to ""maximize ticket sales in the broader ecosystem around a live event.""We believe this has evolved into, ""maximize total revenue and operating income in the broader ecosystem around a live event."" We believe that major economic disruptions (36% of revenue is generated internationally) and an antiquated computer system have been major contributors to the slower than expected achievement of this goal. But it appears as though things are finally changing for the better. The company hopes to drive the 5 million fan increase through a combination of organic growth, acquisitions of venues or festivals and improved efficiency of its marketing and online strategy. The attempt to add 5 million fans comes from three areas of focus, electronic dance music shows, North American Festivals and emerging markets.Source: Company presentation.Electronic Dance MusicThe current hot concert events are the electronic dance festivals. Their popularity has grown substantially in the last few years, and LYV has recently entered the market through acquisitions. In 2012, LYV acquired Hard Events, Coppel and Cream in order to boost its presence in the festival and electronic dance music (EDM) segments in the industry. These events have over 400,000 attendees every year and the company is hoping to expand their geographical presence. Similar to traditional concerts, the events are very low margin.According to the 2012 10-K, the company generated $95 million in incremental revenue from the Coppel and Cream events and incurred $92 million in expenses. Some of those expenses could be related to the acquisitions, but it is clear that the events are low margin events from a purely operational standpoint. LYV has also been mentioned as a possible acquirer of Insomniac, whose main event, Electric Daisy Carnival, drew 230,000 attendees in Las Vegas last summer. LYV's interest in EDM events is not in the operating profit of the shows themselves, but in the monetization of the fan base.According to the company, a typical concert produces about $2.50 per fan in sponsorship revenue. However, a festival produces about $8-$10 per fan in sponsorship revenue. The reasons are fairly obvious. Since festivals are outdoors and sometimes are multi-day events, there are significantly more things to monetize than an indoor concert at an arena. For example, at a festival there can be sponsors for showers or sun screen or hospitality tents or water or camping space or almost anything, none of which are usually possible at an arena. LYV believes there is a potential of $50 million in incremental industry profits from tickets sales, artist income, venue revenues and other ancillary income available by 2015.North American FestivalsIn 2011, over 4 million fans attended festivals in North America. The most popular festivals are Lollapalooza, Coachella and Austin City Limits, whose combined attendance is over 750,000 fans. This segment is growing at approximately 25% a year, or 6x-8x the traditional concert business. Similar to the EDM segment, the opportunities for LYV are in the monetization of the fans through increased sponsorship. We believe that LYV will attempt to grow this market organically and supplement that growth with acquisitions. The company believes there is approximately $50 million of incremental industry profits available from the above mentioned areas by 2015.  Emerging MarketsLYV's market share in the emerging markets of Latin America and Asia is estimated to be only 7% (1 million out of a total of 15 million fans). The company has no presence in Latin America and only has 1 million out of the 10 million concert going fans in Asia. Rising disposable incomes of the middle class is an obvious theme here.The total incremental industry profit from these three platforms could be as high at $240 million. For each 1000 market share points, LYV would achieve $25 million in incremental AOI. Considering the company's dominant position in the industry, we think it is reasonable that the company could capture 20% of this profit potential or $50 million. We believe the wild card that could negatively impact this estimate is more related to lower than expected growth rates in the various segments and not execution.Increased Attendance Drives High-Margin Sponsorship Revenue OpportunitiesSince festivals and EDM events produce 3x-4x the amount of sponsorship revenue per fan, there is a multiplier effect in place. The direct increase in AOI from the increase in events and fan attendance, combined with the multiplier effect of the sponsorship AOI from those fans account for 50%-65% of the estimated increase in total AOI by 2015.As we showed in previous tables, sponsorship revenue is by far the highest margin revenue line on the income statement at over 70%. In spite of the number of sponsors being held relatively steady around 800, sponsorship revenue is up nearly 25% in the last two years. The company has been able to partner with larger sponsors and produce more revenue per sponsor. By our estimate, the company expects to generate nearly one-third of the total increase in AOI or $50 million from this segment. In 2012, the combination of Sponsorship and advertising AOI was about $175 million. This is an increase of about 25% since 2010 or an 11%-12% growth rate. If the company's strategy can produce a 9%-10% growth rate over the next three years, the $50 million in incremental AOI would be achieved.Strategy RisksWhile increasing attendance by 5 million fans is a huge opportunity for LYV, there are substantial risks as well. One of the risks comes from Robert F X Sillerman, the founder of FX Entertainment which was acquired by Clear Channel for $4.4 billion in 2000. FX Entertainment is the foundation on which Live Nation was built. In 2012, Sillerman pledged to spend $1 billion on acquisitions to rollup the festival and EDM segments of the market. In 2013, he acquired the North American division of ID&T Entertainment, the world's largest dance music concert promoter. He recently tried to buy the organizers of the Ultra Music Festival in Florida. The $20 billion ad agency WPP has reportedly invested $10 million with Mr. Sillerman. Mr. Sillerman has also hinted at a possible IPO in the future. He is a very strong competitor and could be a disruptive force in the LYV strategy. If he is successful in acquiring more organizers and promoters, it may be difficult for LYV to reach the critical mass it desires in this market and make it difficult for the company to achieve its 5 million fan goal.Another company that could negatively impact LYV's plans is Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG). AEG is the world's second largest live show promoter and was recently up for sale (subsequently taken off the market). If AEG was acquired by a company like Comcast, who is always looking to add content to its cable systems and already competes with LYV through the Paciolan ticket business (500 venues) the company divested as part of its merger agreement with Ticketmaster, the competition for festivals, talent and attendees would increase substantially. A bidding war in the ""hot market"" is very possible. This is especially true since this is the area that has the highest visible growth, something that investors crave and usually eventually overpay for.There is also the risk that festivals and EDM have become too ""corporate,"" especially as additional large sponsors are attracted to the market, which could lead to a decline in attendance at the major festivals and hurt revenue. Unlike the traditional concert segment where LYV has strong relationships with artists that span years or decades, we believe that because the company is relatively new in this area, its competitive advantage of having such long term relationships with performers in a segment is much weaker. There is also the danger of oversaturation of the market. The attendance at the top 10 festivals is less than 2 million and the ultimate size of the market is unclear. We believe these risks are very real and represent a significant risk to LYV achieving its goal of 5 million new fans. Falling short of this goal would also have negative consequences for the estimated $50 million in sponsorship AOI goal.Ticketmaster Upgrade Provides Significant Cost SavingsTicketmaster is a significant piece of the ecosystem. While it is only 23% of revenue, Ticketmaster produces nearly $400 million or 64% of LYV's AOI. in 2012, the company's ticketing services sold 148 million tickets and another 108 million tickets through its venue clients' (over 12,000-15,000 with a 100% renewal rate) box offices. Operating margins are over 20%. This division is one of the main ways LYV monetizes the live event attendance. The ticketing segment produces 4x the AOI of the concert and artist management division combined. For 2013, the company has guided for flat AOI growth as the technology upgrade costs are incurred for another year. Since this division is key to the company achieving its 30%-35% AOI growth through 2015, investors are a bit leery considering there is no growth in the first year and the highly valued ""visibility"" into future years is hazy. However, as the upgrade is completed, new direct expenses associated with it will cease and a potential additional savings of $30-$35 million could accrue to the company.According to management, the ticketing system is almost 30 years old. The costs associated with maintaining and operating such an old system are significant. The lack of functionality is also proving to be an impediment to generating additional revenue through improved pricing functions and user interfacing. Therefore, we believe the expenses are necessary in order to improve the long-term profitability of the company. Below is an example of the user interface currently seen by an employee. It looks like the system we used in high school. We have also provided an example of the new interface.The company is spending tens of millions of dollars to upgrade the system's infrastructure and functionality. Management believes it can save $0.35 per ticket sold in the U.S. once the upgrade is completed in 2014. The size of the cost savings is a pretty straightforward calculation. The company sells about 148 million tickets through its system. Approximately two-thirds, or 95-100 million tickets, of those are sold in North America. Multiplying $0.35 per ticket by 95-100 million tickets gets us to the $30-$35 million increase in AOI (or reduction in cost) that the company is striving for. Since the result is entirely under control of management, we believe that this component of the $140-$160 million increase in AOI is the most achievable. Increasing the functionality of the system should also help the company achieve its goal of boosting AOI from digital and social media and the secondary ticket market.Digital and Social Opportunity to Boost Ticket Sales and Advertising Exists, but Tough to QuantifyThe rise of mobile Internet activity has provided many companies with the opportunity to engage directly with fans and customers and provide a more one on one relationship with them. According to LYV, concerts are the top shared social activity. Therefore there is a natural potential synergy for LYV to boost advertising and ticket sales. The company cites research that states that 31% of fans would have gone to a concert if they had known about it, as showing an opportunity for social media to boost ticket sales. While this sounds plausible, it is also difficult to quantify the AOI opportunity. Since most of the large shows are well promoted and sold out anyway, we would expect that most fans are already aware of them and chose not to go for whatever reason. The opportunity would be for smaller, lesser known shows and artists that don't get a lot of publicity. In addition, since festivals generally are open seating type events, there should always be room to accommodate those 31% that learn of a show in town and decide to attend.While the monetary opportunity is hard to qualify, the positive impact of mobile on the business is impressive. We have penciled in a potential $10-$15 million in incremental AOI by 2015, but we do not have any particular insight into the likelihood of that amount of AOI being achieved. Due to the ""networking effect"" potential of this strategy, is not a linear process with linear outcomes. However, here are some examples LYV cites in its presentations to give an investor a sense for the possibilities.Secondary Market and Dynamic Pricing Provide Revenue OpportunitiesWith the emergence of StubHub (owned by eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY)), the secondary or ""scalper"" market for tickets has entered the mainstream. In fact, most teams and major sports leagues have now partnered with LYV or StubHub to offer fans the ability to purchase tickets on the secondary market. LYV currently has only 10% of the $4 billion secondary market and hopes to triple this business through a combination of partnerships and improved functionality of its Ticketmaster system.It should be noted that 75% of the secondary ticket market is for sporting events. Because of its ownership of Ticketmaster and its high-profile partnerships with the NBA, NFL, New York Yankees and Chicago Cubs, many investors focus on the sports opportunity for LYV. However, only 20% of the tickets sold by Ticketmaster are for sporting events. Capturing more of the concert secondary business is also a big opportunity. For example, one reason LYV is spending tens of millions of dollars to upgrade its Ticketmaster systems is its lack of ability to capture demand in the secondary market. The way the system currently works, once a concert is sold out, anyone coming to the Ticketmaster website will find that there are no tickets for sale. If the concert sells out months before the event takes place, Ticketmaster currently has no opportunity to sell that fan a ticket and that potential incremental revenue goes to StubHub or a scalper or an individual selling the tickets on sites like Craig's List. This is a key point about the LYV ecosystem.If the company can keep ticket buyers within the Ticketmaster ecosystem and sell a fan either a primary or secondary ticket, the company can capture a higher percentage of the total ticket spend and also monetize the additional time spent on their site with advertising. The fact that the secondary market exists in the first place means that there is also opportunity to improve the pricing of the primary ticket market. This is where LYV's dynamic ticket pricing solution comes into play.As an example, let's assume that a sold out event produces $1 million in ticket sales. Let's also assume that tickets to that event are sold on the secondary market for $300,000 in total. Therefore, the true demand for tickets for the event was $1.3 million and not $1 million. As it stands today, the secondary market is capturing that additional $300,000 in ticket ""sales."" So there is leakage in the system. With dynamic pricing (driven by data on 100 million fans), LYV can help artists and promoters and venues capture some of that $300,000 up front when the ticket is originally sold and therefore reduce the demand or the ""arbitrage"" opportunity currently taking place in the secondary market. The more tickets that are sold on the primary market at the real demand price, the more money everyone in the ecosystem makes and this is a direct benefit to LYV. As the promoter, venue operator, ticket seller and artist manager, LYV is making incremental revenue in all aspects of the event.Like other parts of LYV's strategy, the actual amount of incremental AOI is difficult, if not impossible to quantify, but intuitively the strategy has merits and a reasonable chance of success.Adjusting Enterprise Value for ""Free Cash"" and Calculating Free Cash Flow to Determine Future ValuationCash available to the company is overstated on the balance sheet. We constantly preach that serious investors need to do their own analytical work and read all of the SEC filings in order to improve their investment results. While most of the data is accurate, there are situations where the reported numbers need to be examined more closely. The business model of LYV creates a situation where this is necessary. Investors who just take the data from these websites at face value are missing an important aspect of LYV's available cash balance and subsequently overstating the enterprise value of the firm.If investors look at the cash balance on any of the popular websites that aggregate financial data or even just glance at the balance sheet in the press release, they will see a cash balance of $1 billion on the balance sheet. However, according to the company, the actual amount of ""free cash"" available to it is $340 million. Anyone that just takes the $1 billion at face value is overstating the company's liquidity by $660 million and also underestimating the enterprise value by the same amount. To the company's credit, it is very clear and open about disclosing the free cash balance and the difference should not be a surprise to an investor that does his own work.So why is there a difference between reported cash and ""free cash""? LYV's business model requires the company to collect the face value of the tickets it sells on behalf of its clients and then remit them to its clients when a show occurs. Since the company may be selling tickets months before a show is performed, the company is constantly collecting cash on behalf of its clients. LYV segregates this cash from its own cash.As of Dec. 31, the company reported that out of the $1 billion in cash, $442 million was ticketing client cash. In addition, there was approximately $220 million in cash on the balance sheet that the company has committed to other aspects of the concert and sponsorship businesses. Taken together, these two items reduce the company's portion of its stated cash balance by $662 million. Any investor that is using the $1 billion on the balance sheet to net against the company's debt to calculate its enterprise value is actually understating the company's enterprise value that $662 million. We believe it is more appropriate to use the ""free cash"" balance to calculate the enterprise value.Free Cash Flow Should Increase, but It's Hard to CalculateLarge swings in deferred revenue at Live Nation make it difficult to calculate true free cash flow. In fact, like many companies today, Live Nation's definition of free cash flow does not consider changes in working capital. They simply take AOI and deduction cash expenses like interest, taxes and capital expenditures. While this shortcut method can be used to get a basic estimate of free cash flow, investors need to take into consideration a company's business model and calculate a working capital adjusted free cash flow.Using the company's definition of free cash flow, LYV generated $215 million in 2012 and $155 million in 2011 or about $185 million per year. Just using CFO for each year, we can calculate that free cash flow averaged about $180 million per year, although the amounts in each year differ greatly from the company's numbers due to swings in deferred revenue. We always like to analyze multiple years of cash flow statements in order to see what might be a sustainable amount of cash flow. Swings in balance sheet items like deferred taxes, deferred revenue and inventory can distort cash flows in any given year, but over a multiple year period these items tend to swing back into balance. If we adjust CFO for the changes in deferred revenue, we see that the average free cash flow is about $150 million a year and the swings are even greater.Company Calculation of Free Cash FlowInvesting 501 Calculation of Free Cash FlowWe do not view an investment in LYV as one of our typical free cash flow accretion investment ideas, so the variance in the calculation of free cash flow is important but not a game changer. The important point is that the company does generate sufficient free cash flow to upgrade its computer systems and still acquire festivals or venues to grow its attendance, which should grow AOI in the future.LYV has said that it believes its normalized capital expenditure run rate is about $100 million a year. This amount is split about 60/40 between maintenance capital expenditures and ""revenue generating"" expenditures, which are mostly software development and other expenditures. Starting in 2014, the $20 million or so that the company is spending on its Ticketmaster systems upgrade should cease, resulting in a boost to free cash flow.Bringing It All TogetherSo after all this analysis, what have we learned? We have learned that LYV has a unique business model that has no public peers and that it has several moving parts with enough unknowns to make it difficult for Wall Street types to make nice neat earnings models and price targets. When markets and stocks decline significantly or have low multiples, we are told by the media and ""experts"" that investors do not like ""uncertainty"". However, we are also told by Warren Buffett that ""the future is never clear, and you pay a very high price in the stock market for a cheery consensus. Uncertainty is the friend of the buyer of long-term values.""We believe that an over dependence on models and price targets and multiples creates an ""illusion of control"" of an investor's outcome. However, we also believe that you have to make a few basic assumptions to help in the decision making (yes, we know the saying about never assume because it makes a you-know-what out of you and me). But we make assumptions all the time. For example, I still eat that meal at the restaurant because I assume the meat was cooked properly and the waiter washed his hands. So assumptions are not inherently wrong or bad. With that out of the way, let's make a bunch of assumptions and see what could happen to LYV stock price in the future.The first thing we are going to do is use the company's definition of ""free cash"" on the balance sheet of $340 million and not the $1 billion that is reported. This has the impact of increasing the enterprise value since cash is a contra entry to debt in the net debt calculation. That gives us a basis for calculating the future EV.Determining Free Cash FlowIn this particular instance, we are going to look at 2015 EV/EBITDA to get a sense for what the equity might be worth. Therefore, we need to calculate the amount of free cash flow that could accrue to the balance sheet to determine net debt in 2015. As we have discussed previously, LYV's business model distorts the cash on the balance sheet that is available to the company and also distortsVarious methods to calculate cash flow from operations:In order to calculate the enterprise value in 2015, we have had to make numerous assumptions. Some of our assumptions might be considered conservative and some aggressive. Generally speaking, we like to do basic back of the envelope type calculations to keep it simple. To determine the enterprise value of LYV in 2015 we have made the following assumptions to get us to our net debt calculation of approximately $1 billion:The table below brings all these assumptions together so we can calculate a 2015 enterprise value and the implied EV/AOI valuation today and a potential valuation in the future. At today's prices, the company is trading at an implied 5.5x 2015 AOI. It is important to note that our EV is than some investors might use because we have adjusted the cash balance to reflect only cash that is available to the company. Using an 8x EV/AOI multiple would value the equity at $19-$21 a share in 2015 or 60% higher than today. We believe that Liberty Media would continue to be strong buyers in the $9-$10 range so there is about a 4-to-1 upside to downside risk/reward ratio if our analysis proves correct. At the time we started our one-hour analysis the ratio was almost 9-to-1.Debt Structure Not a Liquidity RiskAs always, one of the most important parts of our analysis is a company's liquidity profile. While LYV is not trading at a ""liquidity risk"" discount nor do we expect that to be a risk to our investment thesis, we do want to understand the credit facility terms and debt structure should the worst-case scenario happen. Because of the unique business model, there are a few things investors should understand about the company's balance sheet. For example, the $1 billion worth of cash on the balance sheet is not entirely available to the company and cannot be counted on in a crisis.No Significant Debt Maturities in the Next Three YearsThere are many aspects of the concept of ""margin of safety."" One is certainly starting valuation relative to something like tangible asset value or sustainable earnings or revenue. Another part is minimizing the chance that the company suffers a liquidity crisis before the investment thesis can play out. The main source of a liquidity crisis is a company's inability to rollover debt or receive working capital financing from creditors. After examining LYV's balance sheet, neither of these situations seem to be a risk, even if the company significantly underperforms our expectations.As of Dec. 31, the company had $1.776 billion in debt outstanding at a cost of 5.2%. The most significant portion of that is the Term B loan tranche of the senior secured credit facility at $863 million. The loan matures in November 2016 and requires a nominal $10 million a year in principal payments. The maximum leverage ratio steps down from 4.25x in March of 2015 to 3.75x in March of 2017. The current ratio is around 4x. The only near term maturities are a $220 million convert in 2014 and $80 million of the Term A loan. In 2012, LYV was able to retire a $300 million bond with a 10.75% coupon by issuing a 7% senior note with a 2020 maturity date.Liberty Media Is a Significant Investor and Continues to Buy SharesOne aspect of an investment in LYV is the fact that John Malone's Liberty Media is the largest shareholder. We view Liberty's investment favorably and believe it provides LYV with a partner that can help with revenue enhancement opportunities through its 50% ownership stake in XM/Sirius. Since both companies are focused on the creation and distribution of music, there is a natural synergy between the two companies. For example, a Live Nation channel on the satellite radio network is possible as well as numerous cross promotion and sponsorship opportunities In addition, Liberty has the ability to acquire up to 35% of the company. Liberty has consistently increased its ownership in LYV and we expect that to continue.When Live Nation merged with Ticketmaster in 2010, Liberty Media exchanged its ownership stake in Ticketmaster for 24.8 million shares (14%) of the new company. Soon afterward, Liberty announced a tender offer for 35 million shares at a price of $12.00. The stock was trading around $10.50 at the time. Interestingly, the tender expired with Liberty buying only a token number of shares. Since that time, Liberty has consistently acquired shares, boosting its total holdings to approximately 50.4 million shares, including the recent purchase of retiring CEO Irving Azoff's 1.67 million shares at $8.98 per share. The fact that Liberty bought Azoff's shares gives us confidence that his loss will not have a long-term negative impact on LYV's operations or reputation. In 2012, Liberty acquired 11 million shares for $107 million, included 9.5 million at $9.68 in a forward purchase contract agreement. It also acquired 7 million shares at an average cost of $10.50 in 2011.It is clear that Liberty Media still desires to increase its stake in LYV and we have every reason to believe that it intends to eventually acquire the 35% stake it is allowed to have. With a well financed, motivated buyer of up to 16 million shares in the $9-$10.50 per share range, we believe investors should accumulate shares in this range whenever the opportunity arises.SummaryThe merger of Live Nation and Ticketmaster in 2010 created a company that has attempted to build an ecosystem to capture the maximum amount of revenue and profit from the live entertainment industry. A severe recession in Europe, combined with an antiquated IT system has prevented the company from fulfilling that goal. Additionally, there is no real comparable public company and little Wall Street coverage, investors have been drawn to less complex investment ideas.Finally, while the company has made it clear it wants to increase AOI 30%-35% by 2015, outside of the cost savings potential on the Ticketmaster system upgrade, there are not many parts to that guidance that can be counted on with much certainty or are easy to comprehend. We believe that it is all these factors that have provided patient, long-term investors the opportunity to invest in a unique business model and a more than reasonable price. Of course, if the stock would get back to $10 for any reason, we would be buying more right along with John Malone.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in LYV over the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: Investing 501 is a pair of investment professionals with over 60 years of experience.

1336641,25432,2013-04-11T20:40:53-04:00,,"I'm writing this column from the Ace Hotel in Palm Springs, California. Like the other Ace Hotels around the country (Seattle, Portland, New York City), it is well curated with choice furniture and art.And, with a piping hot cup of Stumptown Coffee, the scene is buzzing. Word on the street is that Jack White is performing a secret show in the lounge this week.Outdoor music festival and concert season is upon us in North America.On Friday, April 12, the Coachella Valley Arts and Music Festival kicks off in Indio, California, about 25 miles up the road from Palm Springs. The event will bring concertgoers from around the world, with over 80,000 people expected on each day of the event. With the emerging festival scene, the value of music, arts and entertainment is evident. People pay for good music.As we enter into festival season in North America, Live Nation (NYSE:LYV) is ripe for an analysis, since it derives a substantial portion of its revenue in Q2 and Q3, due to seasonality.Currently priced at $12.85/share, Live Nation sports a market capitalization of $2.42 billion. But, it has seen significant price appreciation since late 2012, so investors should be cautious when investing in or trading shares of Live Nation. The shares, which lagged the market for much of the past two years, are now outperforming the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY).The Business:Live Nation is developing a moat around the promotion and distribution of live music. It operates as a vertically integrated, live entertainment company, comprised of five segments: (1) live music events; (2) venue operations; (3) ticketing services; (4) sponsorship; and (5) advertising sales and artist management and services. It's a market leader in all segments.In Q4 2012, Live Nation grew sales 21% year-over-year, driven by growth in all its segments. According to its earnings release, Live Nation had already sold 9 million concert tickets for 2013 events by the end of 2012, representing a 58% growth rate year-over-year. With increased popularity in music festivals across the United States, I expect the trend to continue. Live Nation also generated $275 million in free cash flow in 2012, on the back of cost control and expense reductions at the music venues it owns and operates.Catalysts:In addition to growing demand and appetite to pay for live events, Live Nation is also undergoing a number of operational improvements to strengthen its brand and value.First, management indicated in recent investor conferences that its integration with Ticket Master is almost complete, and the company is now benefiting from synergies between the two businesses. Management has reworked the Ticket Master booking platform to allow its 12,000 customers to manage the platform with important concert updates. This reduces the back end work required by Live Nation, and puts the power of its platform into the hands of its network of customers by allowing customers to control inventory and pricing strategies. This affords its customers the chance to manage their venues more effectively.The Ticket Master website has effectively become an open, web-based platform which will reduce Live Set's expenses, as they no longer have to control the information, instead giving their customers access.Second, adjusted operating income is projected to increase 30 to 35% over the next couple of years as Live Nation realizes the benefits of its (1) investment in the improved Ticket Master platform; (2) price increases for its concerts as demand rebounds; (3) launch of new products, including a secondary-ticket offering, which the company believes is a $4 billion industry; and (4) cost reduction activities. If Live Nation can capture a meaningful portion of the $4 billion secondary ticket market (up from its current 5% share), that could serve as a significant boon to its top line growth and, combined with cost control, meaningful operating leverage could be unleashed in this model.Management has indicated, and this analyst agrees, that event operators, artists, sports teams, etc., won't allow $4 billion to exist outside the ticket ecosystem. Surely, those entities would like a piece of the action, and a more transparent secondary market will lead to additional price discovery with respect to the value of each ticket. And, by leveraging Live Nation's strong brand name, the company can help alleviate any uncertainty as to the validity of second-hand tickets, and help reduce counterfeit tickets sold on the secondary market.Third, international expansion represents additional growth opportunities. Live Nation now operates in 41 countries and is looking to expand its reach into other markets. Prior to the Internet allowing for broad dissemination of music content, artists used to generally only tour North America and Europe, places where the record label expended resources to raise consumer awareness. Now artists can go to Latin America, Asia and other places and sell out venues since listenership has broadened as a result of a number of internet-based, music distribution channels.Fourth, Live Nation is using smartphone technology to push notifications in the mobile environment to its customers. Live Nation is now able to locate users based on their location and musical interests, and suggest nearby concerts. This service helps manage excess capacity and fill additional seats for minimal cost.Other Matters:For those investors who like to follow what institutional investors are doing with a particular security, they should note that Madison Square Garden (MSG) sold its 3.2% stake in March 2013. The company didn't provide a comment, but it appears MSG's relatively small stake, and therefore, lack of control of Live Nation, and the run up in the share price since December 2012 were the impetus to sell. The Live Nation shares MSG owned were from stock consideration received in exchange for the sale of Frontline to Live Nation in 2011.In addition, Liberty Media (LMCA) owns a significant 27% stake in the share capital. Liberty Media is a sophisticated media investor. Live Nation appears to be an avenue for expanding its reach in the global live music and entertainment business.Conclusion:After a significant run up in Live Nation's share price since December 2012, the price to value gap has narrowed considerably. However, Live Nation appears to be positioning itself for robust future revenue and earnings growth by leveraging its vertically integrated live music production and distribution model. For $2.42 billion, investors are getting a global business with considerable clout and a promising future.Because most artists generally make their living from touring rather than record sales these days, I expect the trend for bands to tour extensively to continue and Live Nation should be a benefactor of that trend.Like with anything, though, investors should be wary of chasing a stock at higher levels, especially considering the US indices are at all time highs.For now, forget about investing in Live Nation. Music lovers have something better to do: go pick up your Coachella ticket and enjoy the show.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

625511,29301,2012-05-30T09:11:16-04:00,,"The chronically weak stock market performance of Live Nation (NYSE:LYV) is one of the more puzzling stories in the media/entertainment investment universe. Seven years after spinning out of Clear Channel as a concert promotion and venue management leader and 2-plus years after the merger with Ticketmaster created a live entertainment powerhouse, LYV shares continue to underperform.Even despite a recent uptick, partially attributable to news that LYV's largest shareholder Liberty Media (LMCA) has increased its stake to 26%, LYV shares are down 15% over the past year, well behind the S&P 500's flattish return that includes dividends. LYV's five-year performance is downright dreadful at minus 53%. Might LYV shares at last represent an interesting investment opportunity?While my analysis suggests that the downside is limited for LYV and a case can be made for a compelling long-term value at $9.39 per share, barring an unlikely Liberty-sponsored privatization of the company, catalysts for near-term share appreciation are difficult to identify.It is a rare Liberty portfolio company that lacks credibility in the investment community, but that appears to be the case with LYV: skeptical investors are in ""show me"" mode. And awkwardly, LYV occupies a segment of the market in which it is not a value stock returning cash to shareholders (like Liberty's DirecTV) nor an investor favorite awarded a rich market multiple (like Liberty's Sirius XM) nor certainly not some optimal combination of the two (a bit like Liberty's HSN).Why has LYV been such a head-scratching underachiever? It's easy to arrive at the conclusion that value has historically leaked away from shareholders and toward LYV's artist clients, management and lost to inefficiencies. After all, how does one explain that a dominant, vertically integrated live entertainment behemoth with $5.4 billion in 2011 revenue generates EBITDA margins only in the mid-single digits?How does one explain that operating efficiencies and incremental opportunities reasonably expected to be harvested from the merger with Ticketmaster in early 2010 are hard to find in LYV's financial results two years on? Or that the diluted share count continues to expand, up nearly 6% in the past year to 186 million? Or that LYV remains a non-investment grade credit with debt/EBITDA above 3.5x and that debt covenants begin tightening later this year?Yet operational metrics are improving in nearly every business segment and, importantly, there are signs that LYV's bloated cost structure is being addressed. With revenue up a little over 2% in Q1 in its seasonally slowest quarter, direct and selling expenses fell by about 2%, indicating the achievement of some modest operating leverage. Yet corporate overhead rose by 10% to $23 million in the quarter or 2.7% of revenue, some 20 basis points higher than last year. EBITDA margins in Q1 rose to 4.2% from under 1% in 2011, an improvement, but still lackluster, given where this company should be in its post-merger operational cycle.Still, the company enters its strongest part of the calendar with some momentum. This may never be a double-digit revenue growth business, but if the recent margin improvement continues, LYV should generate north of $100 million of free cash flow in 2012, the most in its history. For 2013, this looks like a $6 billion revenue business with more than $450 million of EBITDA and free cash flow in the $160 million range.Margin expansion is absolutely critical to the investment thesis: with a $6 billion top line, even a 150-200 basis point margin improvement has massive flow-through implications. If management can deliver on this forecast, the company could see its net leverage fall into the 2x EBITDA range by early 2014. An investment grade credit rating should pave the way for a long-awaited return of capital to shareholders, though probably not for another 24 months.Liberty, the savviest media investor on the planet, obviously sees value here as evidenced by its recent additional purchases of LYV securities. Just as fierce speculation surrounds Liberty's intentions regarding its investment in Sirius XM, similar chatter could develop here. In Sirius XM's case, the tireless Liberty speculation has been a counterproductive distraction, which is a future consideration here as well.The likelihood of a $2 billion tender any time soon for the 74% of LYV that it doesn't own, while easily within Liberty's capabilities, is low. LYV doesn't have much current debt capacity, the fact that there isn't a natural strategic buyer for a privately-held LYV and Liberty's preference for the majority of its assets to be in public equities suggests that LYV will remain public.To date, perhaps the most surprising development at LYV is that Liberty hasn't demanded faster operational improvements at the company, at least publicly. In future, the best guess is that Liberty remains a large, long-term shareholder in a company that, when finally in a position to return capital to shareholders in 2014, may be more inclined to dividends than share buybacks that facilitate creeping control for Liberty.The path to improved operational results and a higher LYV stock price is now visible, driven by overdue cost controls, expanding margins, improved cash flows, balance sheet deleveraging and an eventual return of capital to shareholders, all of which could meaningfully occur between now and 2014. If management can execute, there is no reason that a company on a $500-million EBITDA run-rate in 2014 that generates close to $250 million of free cash flow can't be worth $17 per share, even without any multiple expansion from current levels. But that's probably too far into a murky future to be an aggressive buyer of the stock now.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Additional disclosure: The author manages client accounts with an investment focus on technology, media and telecom stocks with under $3 billion of market capitalization."
1850301,21820,2013-11-19T16:57:03-05:00,,"News came out last week that Live Nation (NYSE:LYV) was in talks to buy Principle Management, the management of U2, and Maverick, the manager of Madonna. This deal makes perfect sense for Live Nation, as the company has large investments in both artists and it would further the amount of profits received from the success of both.Under the buyouts of both firms, Madonna's agent Guy Oseary would take over management of U2, while Principle owner and U2 manager Paul McGuinness would become Principle's chairman. McGuinness has been with U2 since their early beginning. The acquisition price for both is rumored around $30 million.The acquisition of U2 and Madonna will greatly improve Live Nation's Artist Nation business segment. Artist Nation boasts 200 acts and is one of the top artist representation names in the business. In 2007, Live Nation signed a 10-year deal worth $120 million for a portion of profits from studio albums, concerts and merchandise. In 2008, the company completed similar deals with U2 and Jay-Z. In 2011, U2 broke the record for a worldwide yearly tour with $700 million in tickets sold. Last year, Madonna brought in over $300 million from her 88 stop tour.Here is a look at some recent deals signed by Live Nation:· June 19: Took majority stake in BDG Music Group, the largest concert promotion company in the Baltic region. Will rename Live Nation Baltics.· June 21: Launched a new ticketing platform in Austria.· July 18: Named Robb Spitzer Managing Director of Live Nation China Concerts. This new role will help expand the brand that was created through a 2005 joint venture with Beijing Gehua Cultural Development Group.· August 19: Created joint venture with mixitup Enterprises in Australia. The combined company will be Australia's largest brand entertainment agency.· September 26: Launched G-Major Management with Virginia Davis. Will represent artists like Jewel, Thomas Rhett and Danielle Bradberry (recent winner of Season 4 ""The Voice"").· October 24: Acquired Voodoo Music & Arts Experience.Live Nation also enjoys a strong partnership with Jay-Z through his Roc Nation brand founded in 2008. Roc Nation represents singers like Jay-Z, Shakira, Rihanna, J. Cole and MIA. The firm also represents athletes like Kevin Durant, Geno Smith and Robinson Cano through Jay-Z's new sports venture.In the most recent third quarter, total revenue increased 15% to $2.3 billion. The company saw a large increase in global concert attendance (+27%), an area which continues to rise through acquisitions and joint ventures. Here is a breakdown of revenue by business segment:· Concerts: $1.73 billion, +21%· Ticketing: $356.8 million, +3%· Artist Nation: $111.1 million, -13%· Sponsorships And Advertising: $110.2 million, +15%As you can see the quarter was extremely strong, with the company's Artist Nation segment the weak link. With the addition of Madonna and U2 and a new September partnership to form G-Major Management, Live Nation's pool of artists grows in size and should help boost the growth of this segment. The company is able to post larger attendance and higher revenue despite fewer events. This is part of the company's vertical consolidation to acquire assets that give it a larger portion of the revenue proceeds. This shift in management is what makes me bullish on the company going forward.Analysts on Yahoo Finance see Live Nation posting a loss of $0.16 per share for the current fiscal year. This would be an improvement on the loss of $0.87 per year posted last fiscal year. Going forward, earnings per share are expected to hit $0.03 in fiscal 2014. Revenue is expected to rise around 7% in both the current and next fiscal year.I last wrote about Live Nation in December of 2011. At that time I praised the company as a possible winner from Super Bowl XLVI. Madonna, who shared a deal with Live Nation, was the half time performer. With a Super Bowl appearance comes strong tour sales and album sales typically for artists. I said the $8 stock could hit $12 by mid-2012.Shares have risen all the way to $19.79 since the time of that article, through the success of Live Nation and Ticketmaster, which are now owned under the same brand. Shares currently trade toward the high end of their 52-week range with a price around $17.50. Year to date, shares are up 82%, but I don't believe they're done. This is a $20 stock waiting to happen. Live Nation is simply the best of breed in ticketing, band management and international concert promotion. The company continues to strengthen its assets and its renewed focus on long-term deals with high in-demand acts should power shares ahead. Buy stock in Live Nation and own a small piece of Madonna, U2 and other big name acts.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

104882,21562,2008-11-09T02:40:30-05:00,,"The pullback in consumer spending hasn't yet hurt the concert business. Live Nation (NYSE:LYV) put on 17 percent more concerts in the past quarter and concert attendance rose 5.7 percent. Live Nation, the nation's largest concert promoter, reported strong earnings after the bell on Friday—its third quarter profit more than tripled to $139.9 million, on strong performance, the gain from selling its motor sports division and a tax benefit.Looking just at continuing operations, earnings were $1.41 per share, up from 55 cents per share in the year-ago period. Revenue was up nine percent from the year ago period to $1.59 billion, but a bit less than analysts expected.Still, Live Nation stock traded down in Friday's trading—finishing the day down more than 10 percent. Investors are clearly concerned that the downturn in consumer spending means the concert business will fall off a cliff. I had an exclusive interview with Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino who is more optimistic.By Live Nation's estimates, the average concert-goer goes to about one and a half concerts a year. They are determined to see their favorite performers and they make it a special occasion, and a priority. Rapino cited Thursday night's Madonna concert in Los Angeles, which was packed, and Coldplay and AC/DC tickets selling out quickly.The big test for Live Nation will come next year when it breaks off from Ticketmaster (TKTM), currently its partner, and becomes Ticketmaster's competitor, selling tickets itself and attempting to change the concert ticket landscape. Live Nation is slowly accumulating exclusive deals with different concert venues, including last month, the Roseland ballroom in New York. The real question is whether a vertical model for the music business makes sense—Live Nation has deals with big stars including Madonna, U-2 and Jay-Z to handle all their business from concert tours to recording. We'll see if this approach to the music industry can flourish despite the fact that traditional music sales have been tanking."
1741732,55762,2013-10-11T17:16:14-04:00,,"Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE:LYV) has been on a tear for the last year and I don't expect it to stop anytime soon thanks to operating and strategic initiatives, which are yet to be realized. As seen by recent changes in executive management, I believe Live Nation is currently undergoing a paradigm shift where the new ticketing platform (currently in beta) will perfectly merge the sale of primary tickets and resale tickets.I believe Live Nation Entertainment will surpass their three-year plan to grow adjusted operating income by 30%-35% by putting greater emphasis on the secondary ticket market and by executing their strategic initiatives. Adjusted Operating Income was $460 million in 2012, and analysts expect this to grow to $600 to $620 million by 2015. Analysts assume that $10 million to $20 million (of the $140 million to $160 million increase in AOI) will be generated by increased secondary ticket sales. But, as outlined below, the secondary market opportunity is far greater and likely will produce an incremental $40 million in AOI.Source: Company Presentation.Secondary Ticket Sales Have Become A Legitimate BusinessTraditionally, customers mostly bought their event tickets directly from venues or through sale arrangers such as TicketMaster. TicketMaster controlled the primary sale of tickets but the resale of tickets (the secondary market) were either illegal (think scalping) and/or took place through private arrangements with respectable, but largely anonymous ticket brokers, often referred through word of mouth. However, like many businesses, the internet has transformed the secondary market and legal objections generally have fallen. As a result, the secondary ticket market today is a $5 billion business compared to primary ticket sales of $25 billion.Stubhub, founded in 2000, and today an eBay subsidiary (NASDAQ:EBAY) led this transformation and currently has 40% to 50% market share of the secondary market. A pivotal event was the 2007 revenue sharing partnership between Stubhub and Major League Baseball that further legitimized the secondary market. In fact, now 20% of fans go directly to Stubhub to buy tickets and completely skip TicketMaster, even if the event is not sold out. In addition to Stubhub, TicketNetwork and TicketsNow (a Live Nation company) have 20% and 10% of the market, respectively. The other 25% to 35% of the market is highly fragmented with many players such as VividSeats (<5%) and my company, TickPick which accounts for less than 1% of the market.The Resale Economic Opportunity Is SignificantGenerally, secondary market players earn fees of 20-25% of the ticket prices, creating a $1 billion market opportunity. In 2011, Stubhub sold approximately $1.4bn in tickets, generating $325 million in revenue and $80 million in operating income. It's estimated that Stubhub will sell $2.0bn worth of tickets, generating $470 million in revenue and $115 million in operating income in the 2013FY.The economics of the secondary market are captured in the following table.Source: Data compiled from Team Marketing and TickPick.TicketMaster's Secondary Market Business Will Fuel LYV's GrowthLYV currently has $460 million of AOI and the company has issued guidance for a 30-35% increase by 2015, or roughly an additional $150 million. Some analysts believe that reaching this goal could lead to a 30-40% increase in market value. See for example an excellent review by another Seeking Alpha Contributor Live Nation opportunity.Currently Live Nation is capturing about 10% of the secondary market through its ownership of TicketsNow, and this business is contributing roughly $20 million of AOI. Analysts with conservative estimates believe Live Nation will attain 20% market share through the TicketMaster system by 2015 (thus increasing AOI by $10 million to $20 million). I, on the other hand believe 30% market share is a more accurate and conservative forecast, resulting in $300 million of revenue and an increase of AOI by $60 million to $65 million, putting LYV well on its way to exceeding its AOI target.Live Nation is uniquely positioned to integrate the primary and secondary marketplace and the high barriers to entry on the primary side will allow them to fend off competitors and achieve 30% market share. Live Nation's beta product, TM+ allows customers to see both primary tickets and resale tickets listed within one ticket system. TM+ is in advanced stages and will be rolled out in 2014.Besides incremental AOI generated by the resale of tickets through the Live Nation ecosystem, LVY will also benefit tremendously through increased advertising revenue. Furthermore, integrating the primary and secondary market will yield additional benefits to Live Nation's business. These benefits include:1. Branding2. Deepening Relationships3. DataValuationThe table below provides numerous assumptions so that we can calculate a 2015 enterprise value and the implied EV/AOI valuation today and a potential valuation in the future. At today's prices, the company is trading at an implied 7.2x 2015 AOI. Note that the EV is different from what some investors use because the cash balance is adjusted to reflect only cash that is available to the company (versus other cash being held in escrow for payment for future artist performances). Using an 8x EV/AOI multiple would value the equity at $20-$22 a share in 2015 or 20% higher than today.*Source: Investing 501SummaryLive Nation Entertainment has seen a significant run up in its share price since December 2012 and although I believe they will accomplish and exceed their goals set for 2015, I no longer believe LYV is a screaming buy. With that said, management has already signaled to the market that resale tickets are a high priority. The right steps internally & externally are getting executed, which will help fuel future growth and AOI: none of which I believe is accounted for in today's current share price.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: I wrote this article and am not receiving compensation for this article.

71158,21562,2008-04-04T04:20:22-04:00,,"With the music industry in an upheaval, Live Nation (NYSE:LYV)--the world's largest concert promoter--is revamping its business and taking on the music establishment at the same time.How? Live Nation is expected this week to close its biggest deal yet: a reported $150 million package for Jay-Z that includes his recordings, tours for the next decade, and financing for his own entertainment ventures. After selling his Rocawear clothing line last year for $204 million dollars, Jay-Z started a chain of nightclubs, so this deal gets Live Nation into a whole new range of businesses. Businesses that Live Nation would want to integrate with Jay-Z include his recordings, tours, and endorsements. And of course, it shows Live Nation directly competing with the music labels for both the music rights business and all the related marketing. Does it make sense for Live Nation, which lost almost $12 million dollars last year? This does seem part of a trend for them. In October, Live Nation negotiated a deal with Madonna worth some $120 million dollars, including slightly fewer rights. And, just this week, the company negotiated a deal with U2, for slightly fewer rights again--that one worth probably around $70 million.The question is whether this kind of investment is worth it for Live Nation with the ongoing decline of album sales. It seems it'll take Jay-Z doing more tours, as well as more endorsements and sponsorships, for it to be really be worth it for Live Nation.It's no wonder Jay-Z (real name Shawn Carter) finds this deal appealing. He'll reportedly get an upfront payment of $25 million, an advance of $25 million (includes fees for his tour), and an advance of $10 million on an album for at least three albums during the deal.Plus, he'll get $5 million a year for five years to cover overhead, millions more in publishing and licensing rights, and another $25 million for ""Roc Nation,"" a company to finance Jay-Z's ventures, from which Live Nation would get half the revenues. Whew, that's a lot of money! There's also the question of how influential this Jay-Z deal will be in getting younger artists to sign up with Live Nation. It does set a precedent of sorts for up-and-comers to go this route instead of the traditional music label one. If Live Nation wants to get a critical mass of artists, then this could be a good play for attention. But whether the Jay-Z deal itself is worth it is yet to be seen."

The band sold 1.6 million shares for about $6 million, putting Live Nation on the hook to pay the remaining $19 million in cash.U2 may have needed the funds for holiday shopping, but it wasn't exactly ideal timing for Live Nation, which surely would have much preferred the band wait until their stock was worth more.A ""360"" agreement gives Live Nation control over the whole range of U2's revenues in exchange for some significant payments, including $25 million in stock. When this deal was first struck, U2's agreement to accept stock instead of cash was seen as a sign of confidence in Live Nation's business, though the company tells me, it always promised the full $25 million.Still, this looks pretty bad, especially considering the fact that LYV hasn't yet started to recoup its investment in U2 and won't until the band goes on tour next year. Live Nation had the cash on hand to pay, no problem. But critics are drawing attention that other artists like Madonna will similarly be able to sell the cash components of their deals.Live Nation defends its ""360"" model, regardless of where its stock is trading now. The company sent me the following statement: ""This payment is the down payment on our 12 year agreement with one of the world’s most successful global artists that we will begin to monetize next year. We believe U2’s 2009 tour will be one of their biggest yet and the driver for monetizing the expanded rights under our deal resulting in a higher margin for Live Nation."""

The company is ""negotiating the exit"" of Michael Cohl, the company's chairman, according to the Wall Street Journal. Cohl's been pushing the company's ""360 deals"" with superstar musicians, paying Madonna, U-2 and Jay Z well over $100 million to get a share of every aspect of their businesses. And apparently he's been battling over them with the company's CEO, Michael Rapino, who wants to slow down on these deals, which many have called expensive and risky. This makes the whole situation particularly controversial because Live Nation has basically staked its future on these deals.Needless to say, the music industry is in a shambles. Even the biggest music superstars aren't sure things. Madonna's latest album release was a huge disappointment in terms of sales, confirming some concerns that Live Nation has spent too much on these deals, too optimistic about what superstars are really worth. LYV stock is down about 45 percent over the past 12 months, and it traded down nearly 10% on Friday.But Cohl's departure raises a number of questions. Will his nine-year non-compete clause remain in effect and be part of his existing settlement? Will he take some of those big name clients with him and start a competitor business? Or is he so crucial to LYV's relationship with these artists that they'll push to keep him?And then there's the big picture question--other than concerts is there any way to really make money on the music business? This morning Miller Tabak downgraded the stock from Buy to Neutral, lowering its price target from $18 to $14. Meanwhile Standard & Poors downgraded the stock from Sell to Strong Sell. There's a huge conflict here between the need to reinvent the business model behind the music business and LYV's need to perform for investors. Based on the movement of the stock, it seems like Wall Street isn't so optimistic on LYV's strategy."

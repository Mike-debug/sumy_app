Reiterate our ""Bearish"" rating.","We remain positive on Mastercard (NYSE: MA) as a long-term play but continue to see shares overpriced given the current macroeconomic backdrop, beset by the pandemic. In the short-term Mastercard’s earnings will continue to continue to decelerate as its high yielding cross-border travel weighs on its growth profile. The threat of second wave and ensuing lockdown in Europe is now a reality, as UK follows France to announce harsher lockdown measures. We like Mastercard’s leadership position with fast growing fintechs and strong exposure to the digital economy. However, multiple risks to disintermediation remain in the medium to long-term as we monitor PayPal’s foray into off-line retail payments with the launch of its QR code payments (read our detailed analysis here: Link) and Fed’s real-time payment network expected to launch in 2024. We see 32x 12m-forward PE multiple as fair based on a post cross-border EPS nadir from Q2 2021 to Q1 2022 of $8.2. This imputes a 10% lower share price for Mastercard from its current level of $289. We reiterate our ""Bearish"" rating. Revenue: Q3 revenue came in 2% below our expectations and 3% below consensus. This was primarily driven by lower than expected cross-border revenue which declined 48% (vs. our expectations of 38%) as international travel showed no sign of any meaningful recovery (See section below). On a positive note, domestic assessments segment saw revenue grow by 2% vs our estimates of -5% (and up from -12% in Q2 2020).EBIT: EBIT also came in 3% below our expectations, falling 21% YoY as growth in digital payments and economic recovery excl. travel and entertainment did little to offset high-yielding cross-border revenue.EPS: EPS declined 27% YoY vs our expectations of 21%, driven by a 14% decline in revenue and high operating leverage. Q3 EPS of $1.6 was 4% below consensus.Cross-border growth remained constraint despite the reopening of the economy. There was some improvement in lodging and restaurants but international travel continued to lag in Q3. Mastercard believes that it will take a vaccine or an effective therapeutic for this to recover. However, cross-border will weigh on earning growth only until Q1 2021, after which the lower base will allow it to reset growth rates, given the onset of the pandemic from March 2020.Cross-border volume trends showing little sign of strong recoverySource: Mastercard Q3 earnings presentationSomewhat to our surprise, other revenue which constitutes Mastercard’s Cybersecurity, Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, and other services decelerated from 12.4% growth in Q2 to 5.2% in Q3 2020. Some of the examples of MA’s services is Citibank’s use of its AI platform to mitigate credit losses. Itau and Santander in Mexico are using MA's AI platform to increase security for consumers and increase approval rate of transactions.According to survey conducted by Mastercard, seven in 10 people suggest that the move to shopping online will be a permanent phenomenon. As economies reopen, consumers will return to brick and mortar business, however, e-commerce will come out with a much bigger share of total retail sales as the shift in consumer habits and by its extension, payment habits have also changed.According to the survey, 60% of consumers plan to use less cash after the pandemic. In Q3 contactless payments had a diffusion rate of 41% up from 37% in Q2 2020 and 30% in Q3 2019.Mastercard’s tokenization volume increased 100% YoY, now representing 8% of all its switched transactions. The network continues to be a leader in the fintech and neobanks space, having extended its deal with Brazil based Nubank, the largest challenger bank, along with signing new clients such as Nickel in France and Bnext in Spain.Mastercard also continues to help merchants on setting up or expanding their omnichannel capabilities. In India, it launched a POS capability in partnership with Worldline and Axis Bank, allowing smart phones to become POS devices, enabling them to accept not only card payments but also QR code and remote payments.We downgrade our forecasts reflecting lower Q3 earningsPost Q3 Financial ModelSource: AlphaTech EquitiesValuations remain priceyWe continue to see a 12-m forward PE ratio of 32x as fair (even though at the higher end of 2016 to March 2020 PE range) to value Mastercard. However, we think we should base our valuation on a 12m forward EPS starting Q2 2020 given the lapping of the pandemic which neutralizes the lower cross-border revenues. Our model suggests a 12m EPS from Q2 2021 to Q1 2022 of $8.61, imputing a valuation of $261 or c.10% below current share price. We reiterate our ""Bearish"" rating on the stock.Source: AlphaTech Equities"

Think of Netflix, whose stock is up about 15,000% over the past 20 years as it moved from mail-order DVDs to offering bits of data in the cloud. This revolution has another 10-20 years left in it, and those companies leading and benefitting will offer vast rewards to their shareholders.","This week's Alpha Trader podcast features hosts Aaron Task and Stephen Alpher talking (mostly) tech with Jon Markman, founder and president of Markman Capital Insight.Before getting into individual stock picks, Markman first looks at the big picture: Going back about 80 years, whenever the Fed steps in to put the brakes on a bear market, one should expect the averages to go up five times over the following ten years. The Fed helped end the bear market, says Markman, on March 23 this year. Applying that 5x multiple to what the Dow (DJI) and the Nasdaq (COMP) were that day leads to 91,000 on the Dow and almost 34,000 on the Nasdaq in roughly 10 years.Before considering that extreme, consider that the S&P 500 (SP500) bottomed in 2009 at 666. Markman's target then for that index was 3,330, which was hit late in 2019.This, of course, doesn't mean that there will be any number of scares and sizable corrections along the way. These should be thought of as buying opportunities, particularly for those companies leading and benefitting from the ""digital transformation,"" which Markman defines as the use of data and software to build new business models.A great example of this is Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which, over two decades, went from being a mail-order DVD business to offering bits of data in the cloud. Tap an image on your electronic device of choice and the show begins. The company has 193M customers, a $234B market cap, and a stock that's up something like 15,000% over 20 years - all from harnessing the digital revolution.As you might imagine given the major wave he's talking about, Markman doesn't have a ton of interest in Netflix's earnings this week. Over the next 10-20 years, Netflix and others leading the digital revolution - think Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON), and Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM), to name just three - are all going to be multi-baggers (though Peloton and Zoom might be due for a short-term correction).Now, the above are very well-known (and hot) names. Maybe not as well-known, but with an equally great opportunity, is a player like Schrodinger (NASDAQ:SDGR), a company delivering healthcare using digital tools.For those wishing to invest in the digital revolution but undecided about which horse to ride, Markman suggests Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) as - more than any other companies - perfectly levered to e-commerce and the transformation of money to software.Other digital transformation long ideas discussed in the podcast include The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD), a platform for the buying and selling of digital ad inventory, and enterprise workflow platform operator ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW). Both have eye-popping charts, but massive opportunity over the next decade still awaits.We couldn't let Markman go without comment on two tech megacaps - Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). He's a fan of Microsoft, giving its post-Ballmer management kudos for moving the focus of the company away from selling devices, and instead, selling into the high-margin areas of the digital space. He's not bullish on Apple though, worried about waning iPhone sales, and questioning the ability of the company to replace that revenue with other devices and services.Listen to or subscribe to Alpha Trader on these podcast platforms:"
4379646,33291,2020-10-18T23:36:03-04:00,"COVID has created a situation which has impacted Mastercard's business in the near term, likely for the next few quarters.Q3 earnings will be reported in a few weeks and there are several key metrics to watch.Based on what we are seeing to date, we see 2020 revenues coming in at $15.0-16.0 billion and earnings per share coming in at $6.00-7.00.Expect ongoing normalization as the economy reopens.","Prepared by Tara, Senior Analyst at BAD BEAT InvestingMastercard (MA) will report its third-quarter earnings in a few weeks and we want to be very clear that we think shares are a great long-term buy on any significant pullback. Make no mistake, COVID has created a situation which has impacted Mastercard's business in the near term, likely for the next few quarters. Still, despite the obvious declines, it continues to deliver solid performance in 'the new normal' as it were. As the crisis continues there will be reduced volumes, less consumer spending, and a slowdown in growth, likely for the next quarter or so. However, we think that despite the rebound in shares, there is opportunity here. Overall, we saw a progressive improvement in volume trends over the course of the second quarter, driven by the opening up of domestic economies. That continued into Q3. And today, we believe that most markets are in the normalization phase domestically and spending has begun to gradually recover with some sectors recovering faster than others.Valuation-wise, the stock has long been overvalued, but that valuation has come in lower, particularly if we 'exclude' the earnings impacts over the next few quarters and look to 2021. On the next pullback, we think this stock still makes an excellent addition to any portfolio focused on growth. With the huge economic impacts of COVID-19 it is still overvalued in the traditional sense. For years, the argument of the name being overvalued has been made, but shares continued to rise. With Q3 earnings coming in a few weeks, we wanted to check back in and discuss the trends we will be looking at by examining what we saw in Q2.Despite the economy reeling the overall data remains relatively strong, particularly against expectations. The reported second-quarter saw top-line contraction though as there were clear pressures. Growth has slowed given COVID-19-related shutdowns and reduced spending power of a chunk of consumers.The past growth in revenues had been impressive. Here in Q2 2020, economic activity slowed heavily. Internationally, activity began slowing even earlier. We expect Q3 and Q4 will see pain as well, but think Q4 2020 and 2021 are set to see a ramp-up in activity. Things have gotten substantially better since Q1. It is not the virus itself that killed growth of course, but the actions of the government to try and stop the spread. People are being cautious and not going out as much. At the same time e-commerce has really exploded. Mastercard benefits from the latter of course. We think as things reopen it gets better. Net revenue for the quarter came in at $3.3 billion, a 19.5% decrease from Q2 2019. This was primarily due to a steep drop in gross dollar volume and in processed transactions. Expect a decline in Q3 as well.Mastercard saw a 10% drop in gross dollar volume, at the higher end of our wide range for COVID-19 impacted Q2 expectations for 8-14% declines, and saw a 10% decrease in transactions processed, also better than the declines of 7-13% we thought we might see. The transaction declines drove the declines we saw in revenues. As we mentioned earlier, internationally, things slowed down before they did in the U.S. As such, cross-border volumes took a huge hit once again. They contracted 45%. Expect more declines in Q3, but not so steep. We expect to see double-digit declines in cross-border volumes in Q3, as well as mid-single-digit declines in processed transactions.With revenues falling in Q2 we expected expenses to decline. We think that happens in Q3 as well. Expenses fell year over year vs. last year by 9% on an adjusted basis. On a currency-neutral basis, expenses were down 5%. Total adjusted operating expenses were $1.6 billion for several reasons, including primarily spending related to strategic initiatives, as well as lower promotional spending and of course acquisition-related integration expenses. When we factor in the decrease in revenues, we see that it led to operating income decreasing as reported at $1.7 billion. We expect declines in operating income in Q3, though less so than what we saw in Q2. With the top-line contraction and margin contraction, we saw a big drop in adjusted EPS. We expect a decline in Q3 EPS as well.With the decline in revenues, earnings fell, and we expected a decline down to as low as $1.20. We saw fewer transactions being processed, we had lower revenues, and narrowing margins. Again, expect Q3 to also be painful, but the market has essentially given these COVID-19 quarters a pass. Much like the revenue trend, the EPS trend stalled in Q2. Net income was down to $1.4 billion versus the $1.9 billion a year ago, and hit $1.36 per share versus $1.89 per share. As we move forward, we expect EPS growth to remain stalled in the next quarter, and possibly into Q4. For Q3, we are expecting $1.70 in earnings, considering a decline in revenues to $4.0 billion. This would be down from last year.The shape and speed of the recovery will be determined by the effectiveness of policy initiatives. It is tough to forecast though, and handicapping performance is really tough right now. Sectors like home improvement, clothing, and out-to-eat dining have been normalizing. We are hopeful that domestic and intra-regional travel will normalize as the year progresses, while entertainment and international travel will probably take longer to recover.Based on what we are seeing to date, we see 2020 revenues coming in at $15.0-16.0 billion and earnings per share coming in at $6.00-7.00. This is based on annual volumes increasing in the low single-digits, contraction in cross-border volumes in the single-digits, and operational expenses higher in the low single-digits overall.If the stock falls back, we think you should buy it. Under $300 was what we would have loved to have seen, but that is going to take a big selloff. Perhaps if shares retrace 5%, you can start buying again. If the general market takes a hit, we may get an opportunity. If Q3 misses our estimates, the stock may fall. That said, it is a great long-term buy.If you like the material and want to see more, scroll to the top of the article and hit ""Follow."""
4382030,105815,2020-10-28T10:12:06-04:00,"New all-time high virus cases recorded in the US and Europe means that the second wave is upon us, pushing recovery forecasts well into 2021.Cross-border and high yielding credit payment volumes continue to lag and will weigh on shares in the short-term.Latest 8-K volume information shows the pace of recovery has decelerated, putting at risk Q3 street estimates.Open Banking and the rise of digital wallets can prove to be a meaningful headwind for Mastercard.The recent bounce back in shares without an accompanying increase in volumes has stretched valuations.","Investment thesis: Mastercard (NYSE:MA) faces the ""Perfect Storm""While we see Mastercard as one of the best-in-class payment companies, it faces multiple headwinds from the pandemic, as its cross-border and higher yielding credit revenues remains disproportionately hampered. We acknowledge that the virus will see it benefit from the move to e-commerce, increasing digitization of payments and continued growth in other services. However, we do not see these tailwinds to compensate for the outsized decline in revenue and earnings from its credit card and cross-border verticals.On a medium to long-term view, we see the company facing multiple risks of disintermediation driven by the global pivot to open banking and the rise of digital wallets.We see street estimates for revenue and EPS growth as bullish and fear that the risk of reporting lower than expected results in the short-term remain elevated - one which will continue to weigh on valuations. For its upcoming Q3 earnings, we inform our forecasts from Mastercard’s latest 8-K and see revenue and EPS growth continue to struggle given the disruption to the global economy.Valuations also appear to be overdone. Share prices have recently recovered 62% from its low in March without any accompanying upgrade in financials. As a result, we see valuations overdone, especially given the blunted growth profile of the business led by declines in its cross-border and its higher yielding credit payment volumes. To summarize, we see Mastercard facing the perfect storm as valuations seem to have gotten ahead of itself at a time when street estimates are at a risk of being downgraded. With both Europe and US recording highest ever daily cases of the virus, we may find ourselves at the cusp of the second wave which could push back recovery well into 2021. We initiate coverage on Mastercard with a ""Bearish"" rating and a price target of $267, imputing a downside of 19%.Global growth in 2020 is expected to fall by 4.9% according to IMF’s latest forecast in June. This was revised down from a decline of 1.9% in April. More importantly for Visa and Mastercard, there are two key takeaways from the revised forecasts.1. Consumption growth was downgraded for economies across the globe, an important driver of payment volume growth for card networks. The weaker forecasts for consumption growth is fueled by lockdowns and STH (Stay at Home) measures coupled with a greater propensity of consumers to save.2. Visa and Mastercard have negligible presence in China, the only bright spot in the developed market economies.Source: IMFRecently, US and larger European countries have recorded its highest ever one day tally of coronavirus cases. See chart below. Whilst both regions have much higher testing capacities now than it did at the onset of the first wave, we see the resurgence of the virus as poignant and one which will delay recovery of the global economy further into 2021. This is particularly relevant for   Mastercard   as street estimates expect a recovery in cross-border revenues and card volumes beginning Q4 2020, which we now see as highly unlikely.US has recorded its highest every tally in daily coronavirus cases of 85,085France, UK and Germany have all recorded its highest one day tally for new cases.Source: Wikipedia Cross border constituted 22% of gross revenue and 33% of net revenue for Mastercard in 2019, underscoring the importance of the vertical as a significant revenue engine. Furthermore, Cross-border fees are significantly higher yielding then its equivalent domestic transactions revenues, inhibiting profit margins for the second largest card network globally.Cross-border fees constituted 22% of Mastercard’s 2019 gross revenue. Source: Mastercard 2019 10-KCross border fees revenue declined by 54% in Q2 2020Source: Mastercard Q2 2020 Lower-yielding intra-Europe leading recovery in cross-border payment volumes On a more bearish note, it is important to note that a significant component of the recovery in cross-border payment volumes for Mastercard is shouldered by much lower yielding intra-Europe travel. This is evidenced by the negative delta in revenue growth and payment volumes growth from its Q2 results (See figure below). We see international travel continue to be hampered by the second wave of COVID-19 and see any recovery being pushed into 2021.Cross border revenue growth declined 54% vs cross-border payment volume -45%Source: Mastercard 8-K filing Sep 2020We study the rise of mobile payments in China to understand the implications for card networks. In the past six years, mobile payments have become the dominant form of payments in China, constituting 57% of total non-cash payment volumes in 2019 according to the People’s Bank of China. Alipay had c.30% and Tenpay had c.27% of total payment volume market share at the end of 2019. The growth of mobile payment providers has come at the expense of UnionPay’s credit and debit cards which have seen market share decline to 44% in 2019 after accounting for the entire market back in 2013.The rise and rise of digital wallets in China at the expense of card network UnionPayIn six years, AliPay and WeChat Pay (Tenpay) have grown to account for 57% of total payment volumes in China Source: Economist Intelligence Unit and People’s Bank of ChinaUS sits in the middle of the pack in mobile payments adoptionMore than 80% of Americans use a smart phone. Despite this ubiquity, card payments continue to dominate the landscape. Analysts estimate that there needs to be a significant reason for consumers to change their behavior and reach out into their pockets to use a mobile phone to make payments. Card payments also allows US consumers to keep racking in the rewards points which is difficult to transfer to mobile. This versus India where government had pushed the pivot to mobile payments as it looked to increase tax collection given the high penetration of cash-based payments. China on the other hand saw private players in Alipay and WeChat Pay increase the penetration of mobile payments, both of which dominate the payments landscape accounting for more than half the payment volumes in China.The war for payment dominance by country Source: Bain research, Graphics from CNBCHowever, we see the onset of the pandemic as a tipping point as more consumers and merchants demand touchless forms of payments. We see PayPal as the best positioned company to drive the change to mobile payments. Its acquisition of Honey in 2020, the reward/discount based digital platform is extremely synergistic and should help more consumers sensitive to reward points, adopt mobile payments.Figure: US mobile payments penetration is significantly lower than ChinaSource: Bain research, Graphics from CNBCThe pandemic has triggered a seminal point to unlock the QR-code opportunityInvesting in QR code payment opportunity is vital for PayPal, given that it allows to broaden its payments offerings to offline brick and mortar businesses which constitutes >80% of all retail sales. Given the increased free cash windfall from the pandemic, management announced an additional $300m of investment in H2 2020, majority of which will be dedicated to building its QR-code payments network in the US.In terms of PayPal’s QR-code unit economics, sighting the pandemic, PayPal is not charging merchant for any payments until the end of 2020. However, beginning 2021, merchants will pay 1.5% of transaction value + €0.10 per transaction in the UK.PayPal sees itself benefiting from a ""HALO"" effect as consumers using it online also more likely to use it for offline purchases given the positive brand identity it enjoys. We see PayPal’s QR code offering as a significant driver of growth in the medium to long term given…1. PayPal is best positioned off all payment companies to drive QR-code based payments in the USUnlike any other payment company, PayPal’s is the best positioned to drive QR-code based payments given that its scale. Venmo and PayPal combined have between 150 to 175m users in the US at the end of H1 2020, an extremely attractive proposition for merchants of any size. Versus competitors, Square comes closest with a digital wallet which had 45m users at the end of H1 2020. Visa and Mastercard do not have a digital wallet serving customer directly. Zelle, another P2P payments platform back by banks and credit unions in the US is another big player in the digital wallets space which had forecasted to overtake the number of Venmo users (40m in 2018 versus 60m in Q2 2020) back in 2018.2. The onset of the pandemic is driving merchants to demand touchless payment solutionsFurthermore, with the onset of pandemic, users are more likely to use touchless payments such as QR-codes, driving merchants to reach out to PayPal and ask for touchless payment solutions. Currently, PayPal is working with more than 100 large retailers across US and Europe including the likes of pharmacy giant CVS to provide QR-code based payments.3. Strong value proposition for using digital wallets will fuel user adoptionThe ability to add reward points for customers every time they pull out a PayPal or a Venmo digital wallet will be a key driver of adoption. Acquisition of Honey will provide further impetus for users to use the Venmo and PayPal apps to make offline purchases as it allows merchants to integrate some of Honey’s discount offerings. Merchants could also use proximity messaging feature to provide customers with offers to increase sales.With the aim to optimize and promote cross-border payments, the European Union sought to standardize payments infrastructure within its member states via the introduction of the Payment Services Directive (PSD) in November 2007. The directive, despite its success was deliberately crafted to be not all encompassing. The introduction of PSD2 in early 2018 sought to address a much broader set of services, aiming to make payments safer while embracing new and innovative payment solutions through an open banking infrastructure.The new directive holds influence over a several new services and providers, in addition to a greater scope of existing services. It allowed incumbent financial institutions and third-party providers (TPPs) across the EU, upon customer request, access their financial information via application programming interfaces (APIs). The usage of payment initiations (PI) provides a greater benefit over the currently prevalent bank-to-bank transfers as it allows for 1. Faster processing times (an average of 15 minutes vs hours or even days), 2. Lower fees (0.1% vs 1% to 4% for debit and credit cards), and most importantly, 3. Increased security (96% less fraud).COVID-19 has accelerated the growth in Open Banking paymentsAccording to TrueLayer, a leading open banking UK payments company, PI (Payment initiation) volumes had increased 43% Month-on-Month (MoM) prior to the pandemic. Even before the pandemic, there were only c.100k PI transactions while online card transaction volumes reached 217m. With the onset of the virus in March, which saw most of Europe entering a lockdown, PI volumes jumped 460% MoM. The onset of the pandemic and the ensuing lockdown significantly increased the adoption of PI as transactions jumped 832% between March and July. All in all, we estimate that 2020 will see between 2 to 4m PI transactions in the UK, or c.1 to 2% of total online volume, meaning that Open Banking payments even though registering an impressive growth profile remains some way away from becoming mainstream.Total Open Banking API calls in UK have increased significantlySource: Openbanking.org.ukIn a letter addressed to the US Federal Reserve in December 2019, Google highlighted the importance of learning from the implementation of the UPI (Unified Payment Interface) in India as it attempts to build its own interbank real-time gross settlement services (RTGS), FedNow.The bank-to-bank real-time payment system, UPI, is an open-ended system with 140 participating banks. The system enables companies to construct applications which allows for direct customer to merchant payments, with the additional flexibility of its interoperability between different platforms. In the four years since its launch, the system has seen monthly volumes increase from 100k to an astounding 1.15bn. In 2019, the third year after UPI’s launch, with 800m monthly transactions valued at $19bn, the run rate for its transactions have accounted for 10% of India’s GDP. Between June 2019 and June 2020, UPI volumes have seen a year-on-year (YoY) increase of 77%. According to research by Assocham-PWC, UPI in India is projected to grow at a CAGR of 20.2% until the year 2023.In 2019, UPI payments accounted for 10% of India's GDPSource: National Payments Corporation of IndiaIn the post Open Banking world, it can be technologically challenging for fintechs to connect to different financial institutions given each banks has its distinct IT infrastructure. Some of these systems are antiquated, rendering it difficult for different systems to communicate with each other to make the experience of PI’s seamless. Mastercard is trying to homogenize this, by playing the role of a trusted third party which sits in between fintechs and financial institutions and allowing them to share customer’s data securely. As of Q2 2020,   Mastercard   had signed up 2,000 banks across 11 European countries for this service.With the aim to prevent disintermediation, Visa announced the acquisition of Plaid, one of the largest Open Banking API Fintech provider, for $5.3bn in January of 2020. Mastercard followed suit with the acquisition of Finicity in June 2020 for $825m. During the same month, PayPal participated in a follow-on round of funding for Tink, a Swedish company and leading European API provider.Despite the lack of any positive news or updates from the company, share prices have recently recovered 62% from its low of ~$203 recorded in late March. As a result, we believe Mastercard’s valuations are off kilter. The risk of ongoing sluggish recovery in its cross-border fees and credit payment volumes continues to weigh on growth. We see the onset of the second wave and the delay in the recovery of global GDP pushing out its EPS recovery into back end of 2021.Multiples are in uncharted territory despite the downgrade to forecast Source: KoyfinMastercard is currently trading on 12m forward PE of 44x versus historical average of 22x to 38x. Given its downgraded revenue and EPS growth profile over the next 12 to 18 months, we believe the current lofty valuations to be unsustainable. We see a 12m-forward PE multiple of 32x as fair, imputing a valuation of $267 or 19% below its current share price.

We hope you enjoy.Aaron Task: Welcome to Alpha Trader. We are two weeks away from the election and in the thick of earnings season and maybe there's going to be a fiscal stimulus package and maybe not. In the meantime, we are joined today by a very special guest. Jon Markman is President and Founder of Markman Capital Insight, which is an independent investment research publisher.

Jon, welcome to Alpha Trader.Jon Markman: Hey, it's great to be here. Thanks for inviting me.AT: It is great to have you here. As we really get into the thick of earnings season this week, because you are a stock picker, I want to talk about individual stocks with you, but want to get your big picture. As I mentioned, there's so many macro things that the market seems to be hanging on right now; the election, obviously, COVID and the case numbers creeping up, the fiscal stimulus talk, it seems like on a given day that's what's moving the market. What do you think about from a big picture perspective about the market right here?JM: Sure. Well, in terms of the big picture, what we have to remember is that earlier this year, the COVID crisis thrust the market into a bear market for a short period of time and into a recession. And the bear market ended essentially at March 23 when the Federal Reserve announced that it [would backstop] the bond market and basically, reduced interest rates to zero for an extended period of time. The market turned around there, and a new bull market started, and a new economic cycle started. Generally speaking, for the last, you know, 80 years, when the Fed has intervened to stop a bear market, the market has proceeded to go up by five times in the next 10 years.AT: 5x.Stephen Alpher: Okay.JM: 5x. So that happened in 2009, and it happened in the 1982. It's a very common occurrence. So, I think the big picture is that no matter what happens in the days and weeks ahead, I think we can be have some measure of certainty that the Dow will be up 5x over the next five years. So, talking like 91,000 in 2025.AT: Right, so it's going to be – so you are talking about Dow 90,000 plus. That's an extremely bullish…SA: Yeah, I have to write that down. Hold on.AT: Yeah.JM: And, you know, for the NASDAQ, for those of you who follow NASDAQ, NASDAQ was [6,771], I think at the low. So, we're looking at NASDAQ 33,855. Now, this sounds kind of extreme, but I did this exact thing after the 2009 debacle. And I announced a target for the [S&P 500 or 3,330]. And you know, we got there late last year.AT: Right. So that was 5x from the low of 666.JM: Right. And the – in the he Dow – and then NASDAQ was up a multiple of that. I think it was about 7x instead of 5x.AT: Right. So that's very interesting for a lot of reasons. Because, you know, Stephen and I have – one of the themes of this podcast has been, you know, there has been a lot of analogies or comparisons to the late 1990s. So, it sounds like, you know, if that analogy is holding, then we're in like, 1995 or 1996. Like, we haven't really gotten started yet.JM: I would say more like 2009, like late 2009.AT: Okay.JM: Following the financial – great financial crisis, because I was in a crisis in which the Fed intervene to the extent that – and to an extent, similar to what it did this time, although this time was even more so. I mean, the Feds never committed to the interest rate at a basically zero bound for the next two years ever, in its history never has done it. And so when you combine that with the fiscal stimulus we already had, plus this fiscal stimulus is coming, and I think that investors should stop worrying about the small picture and just – the big picture, and just focus on the individual stocks in sectors that they want to be involved in as this bull market rolls on.AT: So, we will get to those and I just want to be clear, and we try to be apolitical on the show, but it sounds like you're saying it doesn't matter the outcome of the election at this point.JM: I would say it doesn't matter from an investor's perspective. I mean, the market is obviously all in on a Biden victory, and the democrats flipping the senate. Markets been very low – has had a very low volatility, where the VIX is really subdued, there's no expectation of a gigantic calamity happening, you know, in November. So, I think people need to put their fears away and just get on with the work of identifying good companies run by good managers and good niches.SA: And just to clarify, while you're saying that the Dow, the NASDAQ, the S&P are going to be several multiples higher several years from now, it doesn't mean we can't get some pretty sizable or brutal kind of bear moves in between.JM: Yeah, I mean, even in a bull market, you're going to have, we have 15% to 19% declines from, you know, from time-to-time, over some crisis that we're not even aware of, you know, when you look back, and you look at the things, the ways that the market got sidelined, between 2009 and today, you can't even remember the details of most of them, but they seem so important at the time. You know, like, you know, the European financial crisis.AT: Exactly. That's the first thing that came to mind for me, like it was such a big deal, at least, you know, in the financial news, but for the markets, you know, pretty much on the screen.JM: Remember the Greek debt crisis?AT: Absolutely.JM: I mean, every single day on our screens, we were talking about the Greek debt crisis, and suddenly it just went away, as the President says, like, things go away.AT: The pigs, I mean, it was all about the pigs. Right?SA: Right. Sure.JM: Yeah. And, you know, from time-to-time there's going to be these missteps with the market, but generally speaking, when the Fed has flooded the zone with as much money as it has, it has to go somewhere. And generally, it goes into the most speculative areas first, before it seeps down into industry. And when I say the most, you know, Walter Wriston, the former head of CEO Citibank said, money goes where it is most wanted and stays where it is best treated. And as generally the stock market at the beginning of these upturns.SA: I know a lot of the stocks you're picking are about technological disruption and such, but given kind of the flood of money out there, do you have any interest in kind of what have previously been underperforming sectors, like energy, financials?JM: I'm kind of interested in the energy sector. The energy is down 50% since from last year, which is unbelievable, in a lot of ways. And I'm interested in the industrials and the, sorry the financials. But they've been afforded at every turn, every time we think that the value stocks and energy and banking are going to turn around and start to move higher they get slammed by the sellers. So, I would say less interested in energy and banking until I can pull out of their bear market – their sideways move and be much more interested in technology.You know, I think that people, a lot of investors are – they're worried about valuations, they're worried about the election, but they're missing the bigger picture. The digital transformation that I've been talking about in my letters, in my columns, is the biggest most investable trend in our generation. Digital transformation is just getting started. It's going to happen, regardless of valuations, it's going to happen regardless of elections. And any market weakness that you see is an opportunity to buy these companies that you know, lower prices, because they're not going to stay lower for long.AT: So, let's talk a bit more about that digital transformation. And it's, you know, in Fast Forward Investing, your most recent book, I know that was the theme of the book, but what's different or new about it today than back in, again the late 1990s, when we were talking about how the internet was going to change everything, you know, is this – is it the same thing all the Fast Forward 20 years or is it something different from that?JM: No, it is very much the same thing. Digital transformation is the use of data and software to build new business models. That's all it is. The use of data and software to build new business models, and it's possible because cloud computing made data processing relatively portable and inexpensive. And it also made large scale permanent data storage viable. So, here's a great example. Look at the evolution of Netflix. It used to be a mail order DVD business, you know, you just filled out a form, mailed it to Netflix, and they send a physical DVD to you by mail. Remember those?AT: I do.JM: But the digital transformation turned the DVDs into an icon on your Smartphone, and now it's just a – instead of a hard disk, it's just bits of data stored away in the cloud. You tap the image on your phone and magically a movie emerges. There's no DVD, there's no player, there's no paper forms to fill out and mail away. Every step of the process has been transformed by a digital alternative. And that's really – just have to start with Netflix. Netflix is real businesses using predictive analytics to determine you know, produce and digitally to deliver content to you that's based on your interaction with its software.So, think about this, Netflix now has 192 million paying monthly customers. They've created a business worth $234 billion out of thin air, and that thin arrow was actually – that's kind of a cliché, but what's really happened is that they've harnessed the digital revolution to create a business is $234 billion. And the – or in the market its shares are up like 15,000% since they shifted online.AT: They should have been rewarded. And I will note Netflix, you know, one of the highlights of this week's earnings, you do have a position in Netflix on your Markman buy list. So, I'm curious if you have any specific thoughts about the earnings report and maybe more importantly, like, how do you approach earnings as a trader, especially in the name like Netflix, where you know, we're on, you've got some big paper games right now?JM: Yeah, I mean, I think this is a 10 years to 20 years theme, and I think that over the next 10 years, Amazon, for instance, will go from being a trillion dollar company to a $10 trillion company. So kind of like where you end up, where you end up buying a stock like that is kind of immaterial vis-à-vis just going ahead and understanding that this trend is happening and taking advantage of it. You have to realize that there are a lot of more – a lot more companies on this [Chucks] in Netflix there. You've got Peloton Interactive, reimagining the gym, and delivering and you've got companies like Schrodinger is delivering health care using digital tools. You know, I think that getting involved in these companies is more important than figuring out exactly what's the price is, what the right price is.AT: Just from like a portfolio management perspective, and I know you trade options as well, do you buy puts out of the money just in case something bad happens on earnings call? Are you just like these are core holdings and you're not going to play around with them?JM: My attitude is that these are core holdings, and I'm not going to play around with them. So, I do publish options, tune options, newsletters, and also features. So, I'm very attuned to the short-term picture. But in terms of this larger theme that we're talking about digital transformation, this is going to be going on for 20 years. You know, it's sort of like, Aaron, you know, when you and I used to working back in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and we said, there's going to be a mobile computing revolution, right? Remember that?AT: Yeah.JM: This was before YouTube was really popular and before, you know, you're prepared to get everything that you needed online. And how long has it taken for that vision to be fulfilled? It's been about 20 years. So, you know the companies that were the [hot] at the beginning of the digital content revolution are still hot today. And if you can't decide on which one to buy, I think, generally speaking, Visa and MasterCard are the way to go, because they're leveraged to both – to the economy, as well as to the digital revolution.AT: Wait, so why not PayPal, as opposed to use your MasterCard?SA: Or Square?JM: Yeah, I mean, Square and PayPal are both great companies and we have on them in the past, but in terms of like, if you just have to have one name that covers E-tail and the transformation of hard money into credit into software. And the two companies at the forefront of that revolution are MasterCard and Visa. MasterCard and Visa are a duopoly. Basically, there are no other companies that provide ATM and credit card transaction data to the scale that they do. So, those are two companies that are like just because I'm sure they're going to be around in 20 years.AT: A quick follow up there, Jon. What about Bitcoin? You know, do you have a thought on cryptocurrency more broadly, as [kind of] threat to the Visa’s and MasterCard’s of the world?JM: I try to get involved with cryptocurrency at the very beginning and I just couldn't get my head around it. And I still don't completely understand why it's valuable. So, I'll leave that to other people. You know, you can't be an expert in everything Aaron.SA: We try.AT: We try.JM: I'm much more interested in, you know, Peloton Interactive. I think they're a fascinating company. Peloton is known for its best-in-class stationary bikes and treadmills, but the company is really disrupting the physical gym experience with interactive virtual exercise instruction. And, you know, the public has really taken to – you have Peloton sales are up 99 – sales were up 99% in fiscal 2022 to almost $2 billion. And the shares are up about 360% since the beginning of the year. And that's a really interesting company as taking advantage of this sort of virtualization of our experiences.AT: Alright. We're going to come back and talk more about Peloton with Jon Markman. You're listening to Alpha Trader, we'll be right back.Take a deep dive into features to arm yourself with knowledge to expand your strategy with confidence. See what adding features can do for you at cmegroup.com/alpha.We're back with Jon Markman, author of the Strategic Advantage newsletter among many others. You can find it on Forbes and Fast Forward Investing. He also has Markman’s Strategic Options and Power Elite equity research services at Weiss. So Jon, just before the break, you mentioned Peloton and one of your recent commentary pieces you wrote some of our favorite names like Peloton are extremely overbought and likely to stall and as you just alluded to, it's had a phenomenal six plus months here certainly since the lows in March. So, what kind of stall or what are your concerns short-term about Peloton? Is it just a valuation call?JM: It's more of an overbought call. I'm not worried about the valuations, the valuations will take care of themselves. You know, with inflation low in a piece can be pretty high, and so I think that I'm not that worried about valuation per se in a high growth company like Peloton. I'm more worried about you know, some competitors coming in like Nordic Track and others, but Peloton has really built up, it's more than just a bike. Have you ever tried it Aaron, ever tried the vehicle?AT: I have not. I have not had the pleasure yet.JM: It's really quite remarkable. I got one a year ago and the bike itself is exceptional, very high quality, but what's really cool is the video, the he spin instructors are fantastic, very motivational, and they really keep you wanting to come back and do your work on the machine. You can get a you can get a – but I want to think of as – like an hour's gym workout in about half an hour on this bike. And the instructions are very motivational. I think they've just done a fantastic job of creating sort of, for one of a better word, the Netflix of gyms where it's a company that's completely dependent, and built on the digital experience, and disrupts the gym as an experience. But there's other companies I think that are less obvious.You ever checked out the company called The Trade Desk, TTD. It's a platform for real time buying and selling of digital Ad, Ad inventory. So, big clients bid for digital ads across connected TV platforms like Amazon Prime and most websites that are not owned by Facebook and Alphabet. What I mean by that is that most ads on the internet are served by Facebook and Alphabet, but all the ones that aren't those two are served through The Trade Desk. Sales were up 38% last year to [616 million]. And they're pulling back now, but they're still up 130% for the year.AT: Right. And I'm looking at the, your Markman Buy List and Trade Desk, you got into it in late April at around $225. You know, most recently it’s trading over 600, Europe 170% on that name. But if you want to go back to Peloton for the same reason, because you're on paper, at least you know your gains here are well over 500%. So, you know, again, are you doing anything to protect or lock in those gains given you just said, you think it's overbought on a short-term basis?JM: You know, I do think it's overbought. So, I think that people who were in it from the beginning from the IPO, etcetera can pair back their holdings, but I'm not really – I'm not – that's like my thing. I don't really get into people sculpting their portfolios. I just want to help them understand what the best companies are to invest in to take advantage of these themes. Does that makes sense? I'm not their financial manager or consultant. I just want to bring ideas to them that they may not have been aware of. Another company that I like a lot in the space, ServiceNow, symbol NOW. It operates in enterprise workflow platform, have you ever heard it?AT: Yeah.JM: They allow companies to easily monitor different parts of their business in real time and it also permits the integration with a lot of other software that – and legacy software that companies have. It's actually become the operating system in many large companies and some companies – those clients are so enamored with what they're doing, their subscription revenues, renewals average 97%. So, ServiceNow has done a tremendous job of digitizing the work desk in large companies, and I think it's a company that people ought to really be involved with.AT: Because, you know, you've got so many different potential ways people can find your stuff like for someone who's you know, just getting familiar with Jon Markman like what's the best way for them to find your work and follow some of these picks that you're talking about?JM: Sure. People can go visit my website markmancapital.net and sign up for a free two week trial of my Strategic Advantage newsletter, which comes out daily. People can also check out my column at TheStreet called, Markman On Tech.SA: I wanted to talk about another stock you wrote recently about one you own when there’s been a multi-bagger for you, that we've all heard of which is Zoom video, your most recent column say that that's looking a little overbought, they might face some challenges, you remain quite bullish on the name in the future. I'm kind of – I'm struck by the speed at which things move now. We were talking about Netflix earlier, and kind of how that's become a dominant name, you know across the globe really. 20 years as a public company up whatever, 13,000% or 15,000%. It's still just a $250 billion company. It has been a Public Company for a little while. It's already $170 billion company. Is the market so much bigger for Zoom than Netflix that we shouldn't be really paying attention to market caps?JM: Well, I think the Netflix piece of the story that I find fascinating is that every step along the way people would say, Disney is going to crush them.SA: That's right. Yeah.JM: Comcast is going to crush them.SA: Apple is going to crush them.JM: Apple is going to crush them. But you know, when you've got a really good idea, and you're able to prosecute that idea with a lot of focus, like the people at Netflix did, you can be successful. A little bit earlier in the year or last year, I was a little bit skeptical of Zoom, because, you know, there's a lot of competing products out there. Cisco has a great product. Microsoft has a great product called Skype.SA: Google has Google themes.JM: Google has Google Meet. And I'm like, you know, you got all these big sharks out there in the water, how is the Zoom Communications going to survive? But it turns out that they created and they operate this simplest video conferencing business in the enterprise world. You know, it's got a web interface that can have anybody zooming in seconds, including grandma, grandpa, and the kids. And you know, it's become an essential tool in the post-COVID world. It's partly because they were in the right place at the right time, it's probably because of luck. But they've done a great job of capitalizing on their luck. I'm just a little bit worried about Zoom going forward because they're moving into an area as they get bigger, where they're going to be competing with the Cisco's and Microsoft's of the world more directly, and I think that could slow and distract them. But for now, I'm a big Zoom fan.SA: And do you look at management's, obviously Zoom’s in the right place at the right time, right now, Peloton is in the right place at the right time right now. You know, how do we know that they've got, you know, they are [Reed Hastings] that's going to, you know, survive 20 years of challenges?JM: I mean, you don't know right? So, because we don't know, it's risky. And but risk is how you make money. If things were, we were certain about things, there would be no money to be made? Because everyone would have the same opinion, but…AT: Yes. And I remember when people were calling for Reed Hastings head when he did the Qwikster move. I guess that was about 15 years ago, maybe and Netflix was looking dead at that point. It looked like self inflicted wounds at that point. So that's a great point. We don’t know which of these, you know, newer younger manager or management teams are going to turn out to be the next Steve Jobs, Tim Cook at all.JM: Right. You have to keep in mind there has to be risk involved, otherwise it wouldn't pay.AT: Right.SA: Right.JM: You know, another company I think is really interesting in this space is Teladoc Health, you remember them. TDOC?AT: Yes.JM: This is an idea which was always on the calm, right. Everyone was thinking, telephone-based medicine that's the future people. People have been saying that since like the 1990s, the early 2000s, late 2000s. You know, it's like it was just never quite happened and it suddenly boomed. However this crisis in Teladoc Health becomes the largest telehealth platform in the United States. They operated video platform that connects healthcare professionals and doctors, psychologists, etcetera to their patients. And in my opinion, the strength of the Teladoc program is its contractual relationship with health insurers in large companies. Sales were up 32% to 535 million last year, or earlier this year and stocks are up 164% in 2020, but I think this is another one that you can buy on pullbacks, it doesn't really have a natural competitor.AT: Right. So yeah, so it sounds like – a lot of these things, Teladoc Health, Peloton, Zoom certainly you know, have benefited from the COVID panic or pandemic excuse me and panic. Is it your view though that if, you know if tomorrow they announced the vaccine, and we can all get back to “normal life”, how disruptive or not will that be to these companies?JM: Well, there's actually three things happening and talking about vaccines. I call them the – this is a terrible acronym, because I can't do any better than this Aaron. It is FVS. It will be better if I had a vowel, you know, yeah, I need a vowel. But anyway, let’s just say FVS. The S is the said. So, I'm talking about support for the market. The Federal Reserve decision to basically say that they're going to keep a zero interest rate policy for the – through 2023 is a huge boost for the market. Number two, V. The V is vaccines. You know, obviously, the market thinks that there will be a vaccine in the next year. I don't think it's going to happen in the next three months. But you could certainly have a vaccine for the most severely impacted people by the middle of next year. And that's a rate of hope that that investors are leaning on. And the S is stimulus.Stimulus, if it were to happen, if they were to pass a stimulus bill now, it might only be $500 billion, because that's the amount that the Senate wants to pass. Speaker Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin have proposed a $1.8 trillion program, but you know, if the stimulus program does not occur in the next – if they don't make a deal in the next two days, it's going to go to after the election. And I think the investors out to hope that it happens after the election because if the Biden camp – if the democrats win, you're probably looking at stimulus of more like $3.2 trillion. And that's like double what they could get right now.AT: That's real money. That's real money.JM: That’s real money. A trillion here, a trillion there, pretty soon.AT: Pretty soon. Pretty soon it's real money. Yeah, yeah. No, it's incredible like how we all become so numb to these big numbers. But yeah, I mean…JM: A $3 trillion infusion – $3 trillion infusion into the economy would just supercharge this. It would turbo-charge the economy and also the stock market, because excess money always goes to speculative uses. So, I think what the market right now is doing is it believes that these three horsemen, the Fed, Vaccine, and Stimulus are going to support investors, at least the next year or two.SA: And a vaccine doesn't change your bullish view on names like Zoom video?JM: No, I mean, I'm not an expert by any means on medicine, but from what I've read, it seems like the rollout of the vaccines will be very slow.AT: Yes, that is true. So – and you reference this with Teladoc, specifically. So, you know, maybe you'd look to buying a pullback. So, what is your advice for people and there's a lot of them, and you know, myself included, you know, who've been sitting on cash or too much cash relative to where they “should be” based on their age and risk profile, you know, waiting, you know, because they think something bad is going to happen and the market is going to, you know, fall back here, like, what would you recommend someone do with cash at this point?JM: Again, I'm not a financial advisor; I just kind of try to find stocks that I think will help people – will benefit people if the thing that I'm talking about will come true, but I think that, you know, this is not a good time, this is probably not a good time for cash. The Fed is telling us that, you know, by forcing interest rates down to near zero, it's creating the view as the correct view that it's called TINA, you know, you’re familiar with TINA, right?AT: Yes. There is no alternative. Yes.JM: There is no alternative. So, I read a long time ago, an interview with Warren Buffett where he said, and it really stuck with me. He says that, ‘stocks and bonds are always in competition with each other’. If you can get a 6% return from a bond, why bother with stocks? But you know, you can't get 6% anymore, right? It's hard for [indiscernible] to get 1% over passbook savings account. So, cash is trash. Yeah, I'm not just saying that because it's [indiscernible]. I'm saying it's because the Fed is telling us that they want – they're forcing people into stocks. And the Fed’s the most powerful engine of growth in the world that has been, you know, for the last hundred years. People always want to think that the Fed’s not all powerful, but it really is.AT: Yeah, don't fight the Fed is the oldest, you know saying on Wall Street. Well, not theOldest…JM: The oldest saying on Wall Street is don't fight the Fed. And my addendum to that is the Fed is undefeated.AT: Can't be the oldest because the Fed’s only been around for 100 plus years, but sorry, that's splitting hairs. That's [indiscernible].JM: The oldest piece of advice of that nature is there's nothing new under the sun that comes directly from – it comes from the Bible, but it comes to us via reminiscences of a stock operator. It’s on the first page.AT: That’s right.JM: There's nothing new under the sun because everything that we talk about is as much about human emotion as it is about dollars and cents. In my view, PE is an opinion, PE is – [high PE] is to tell you that investors have a high level of confidence in the company, the [low PE] says people have low level of confidence. So, I would – I think right now, people have relatively low level of confidence in the market overall. It should be more exposed.SA: Are there any stocks that you're a fan of that have, to your [chagrin], kind of disappointed you, yet you still remain a fan?JM: Well, actually, let me talk about one just – just for Aaron, because he's kind of worried. He's he says people have cash and are looking to raise the plat. And, you know, for those people who are a little bit on the fence, I would say stick with some of the best run companies that have been through so many cycles and come out on the other side. One of the companies I really like a lot on that regard is Danaher, DHR, are you familiar with them? They're a conglomerate that operates in professional services like diagnostics, environmental, and Applied Sciences, and they've got [30 different] businesses under their banner, but that all share a cohesive management structure and a digital infrastructure. And this provides, you know, economies of scale, and the Danaher business has grown year-after-year, after year-after-year and, you know, 2020 has been especially lucrative, but this is a really well managed company. You know, Aaron, you're a baseball fan, you know how people say sometimes, he's a professional hitter. You know that phrase?AT: Yes, yes.JM: And it sounds like ridiculous. Like, of course, they're all professional hitters, but no, there are some hitters that are just – they just seem to be able to hit the ball when it's necessary, hit the, you know, hit a home run when required.AT: Like go the opposite way when they need to, just to move a [indiscernible] yeah.JM: Advance the runners, etcetera, etcetera. Well, Danaher is that kind of company, to me. It’s extremely well managed, and one of the stocks, I have the easiest time recommending to people.AT: Essentially, it sounds like Danaher a number of years ago people would talk about and they are sort of like, you know a smaller GE when that was a complement.JM: Good point.AT: But it sounds like, you know, you're talking about Danaher the way people used to talk about GE.JM: That’s correct.AT: You know, steady, well run business, well managed, you know, diversified and they know what they're doing.JM: Exactly. And so that's not really a tech company, per se, but I included in my list because it does, it has taken, they've done a tremendous job of taking advantage of the digital revolution. Another stock I like a lot that people doesn't get enough credit is Cadence Design, you ever heard of them, CDNS. They make – it's a company that makes systems that companies use to design semiconductors. And you know, chips are the center of the digital revolution, because they're finding their way into ever smaller, lower powered devices.So, we're making lots more semiconductors than we used to. And Cadence is in the business of making that process more efficient and cheaper for the manufacturers like Nvidia, etcetera. And you know, it's not the fastest growing business in the world, I think it's growing at a highest single digit growth – it has high single digit growth last year and this year, but it's a company that's really not that well understood and not that – not overpriced, and I think people ought to take a look at it, Cadence Design, CDNS. And then one more company I'd like to call the people's attention that may not – people may not be aware of is MongoDB.AT: That one I’m not familiar with, what does MongoDB do?JM: It has – symbol is MDB. It makes a scalable cloud-based database program that competes directly with Oracle. So, Oracle is kind of messed up, has been for years, because it's got this tremendous terrible legacy business, it is trying to grow out of MongoDB, and it's being assaulted by these smaller cloud-based database platforms like MongoDB. So, MongoDB revenues shot up to 420 million in fiscal 2020. Just repeated design wins and new business from companies like Adobe and Google. So, in terms of, you know, the best online or cloud-based database program, company, I think MongoDB is the one MDB.AT: You know, I do want to ask you about a couple other [demes] and obviously, you know, it sounds like we could talk about – you could talk about interval stocks for a long time here. When you were talking before about Peloton it struck me though the way you describe them is the way a lot of people talk about Tesla, which is the other, you know, headline earnings report this week, and I'll put air quotes on earnings because who knows if it's going to be positive or not? Do you have a position in Tesla or a view on that particular stock?JM: I’m a big fan of Tesla. I've never – I haven't owned it for a while because it got just – the price got, in my opinion got [outrageous] and I've always been worried about Tesla because they've had a series of Financial – Chief Financial Officers leave the company which is sort of a bad sign.AT: Right.JM: So, Tesla has exceeded my expectations. I'm not an expert in Tesla, but I do respect what they've done.AT: Fair enough. Okay. And then the other name I wanted to ask you about is one that I would think most of our listeners are familiar with, which is Microsoft, give an interesting perspective on Microsoft, which is that, you know, people are under estimating the importance of office in a work from home world, can you explain that thesis?JM: Yeah, I mean, Microsoft is one of the few – is the only company of its generation, they managed to survive. You know, Cisco has not really survived, Oracle has not really survived. And a lot of its competitors have gone away, but Microsoft has just been blessed with great management after Steve Ballmer left. And they made a really important shift to the cloud. They stopped worrying about whether they were going to sell Windows devices, they started to sell – they want to sell more into the digital space. And it's, you know, management has done a great job year-after-year of directing them into the high margin areas of this industry, and I think the world of Microsoft – I think that it can be up, you know, 5x by the beginning of the next decade.SA: And a name that I haven't seen you talk about in at least any your recent writings, which I've just read is Apple, obviously an important name to a lot of people.JM: Yeah, Apple is a name that I have a lot of problems with. The market hasn't had as much problems as I have. But to me, it's, you know, iPhone is no secret, iPhone sales peaked about three years ago, and have not gone back up. And making a big business out of like, Apple Watch, and the iPad services just seems to me like it's a difficult proposition. And I really, you know, you look at Amazon, what they really have is either a five SQ company, can you imagine another, could there be any other [trillion dollar] company that basically has five things to sell.They can sell, you know, what I mean? And if one of those products, you know, becomes in effective [indiscernible] it's not a good seller, the whole company can be brought down, and I'm just a little worried about them, Apple. I mean, they haven't really improved the – I mean, it's the – they're trying to make, keep the impression that a smartphone has to be expensive. And then a lot of other vendors who showed us that you can make a device, it's like 99% as good as an Apple and sell it for about 60% loss.AT: Yeah, it's interesting that when the 5g phones came out last week, you wrote, you know, the phones are finally here, but investors should skip Apple and focus on Skyworks Solutions and Qorvo, the component supplier that make the new devices speedier, and to me that, you know, you obviously, you're not shy about investing in mega cap stocks, but it's – to me that sort of seemed like the classic Jon Markman. Like, I'm going to look for the first derivative type of play. What, you know, do you have positions in Skyworks and is a Qorvo symbol, QRVO?JM: Yeah, I don't have one at the time, but I'm waiting for them to pull back, give me an opportunity to buy them. But I do think that, you know, these are the sensors, these are the, to make the internet of things work. And we need low cost sensors and we need ways to access them. And that's what these two companies helped Apple devices do. So, you know, I don't think it's really that necessary to do first derivative stocks, but you can go directly to the source.So, if you really want to take advantage of this industry, you can buy the stocks and I recon I did. But if you want to go to first or second derivative, then yeah, buy the chipmakers and make this possible. And Qorvo, Cadence is my number one pick in chip design. I think Nvidia is my number one pick in the development of new businesses for chips. And if I had to pick one, I think I’d wait to buy Nvidia on the next pullback.AT: All right, well, if you're right, we may not get any pullbacks for the next decade, but we really appreciate all your time here today. Our guest has been Jon Markman. You can find his research and more at markmancapital.net. Jon, thanks very much for being with us today.JM: Aaron, thanks for having me.SA: Thank you, Jon."
4378541,105812,2020-10-11T21:30:43-04:00,"Mastercard is a critical part of the payments infrastructure across the globe.It has an enormous and expanding market opportunity, driven by the shift towards digital payments.The company has grown revenue at 12% annually since 2010. But profits have grown even faster, at 19% per year.Mastercard's Vocalink provides technology that enables real-time payments. This is helping to shape the future of the payments industry.Mastercard is a Buy.","Mastercard’s (MA) network is a critical part of the payments infrastructure across the globe, providing support for various types of digital and mobile payments, both of which are expected to grow rapidly in the coming years. But Mastercard is also helping to shape the future of real-time payments - another space that is expect to grow quickly. Mastercard’s essential role in these markets, combined with its exceptionally profitable business model, makes this stock a compelling long-term investment.Mastercard is one of the largest payment networks in the world, behind Visa (V) and China-based UnionPay. It has over 2.2 billion payment cards in circulation, which are accepted in over 210 countries (and territories) by over 37 million merchants.Mastercard, like Visa, is an open network - it processes payments, but does not issue cards. Instead, it works with other financial institutions that issue cards branded with its logo. This differs from American Express (AXP) and Discover (DFS), both of which process payments and issue cards, and therefore, assume the role of the acquirer.The company’s role in a payment transaction is depicted in the graphic below:(Source: Created by the author using graphics from Mastercard)Mastercard's network connects thousands of financial institutions and millions of merchants across the globe. But its partnerships extend beyond traditional banks and credit unions. The company also partners with several popular tech and fintech firms to provide debit cards and other products. For example, the Square Card (SQ) allows merchants to instantly access their Square balance without waiting for a bank transfer. Likewise, MercadoPago - MercadoLibre's (MELI) payment platform - offers Latin American consumers a prepaid card linked to their mobile wallet balance. Even the Apple (AAPL) Card is backed by Mastercard.The graphic below shows a few different Mastercards, each representing a partnership with a fintech firm:(Source: Created by the author using graphics from Mastercard)Mastercard generates revenue in a few different ways. First, it collects assessment fees on both domestic and cross-border transactions. These fees are taken as a percentage of gross spend, and are shown in the chart below:(Source: Created by the author using information from Wells Fargo)The company also earns revenue through transaction processing fees, which include connectivity fees and transaction switching fees. Connectivity fees are charged to issuing and acquiring banks for access to the Mastercard network. Transaction switching fees are charged each time an issuer receives an approval for authorization, each time transaction information clears between the customer’s (issuing) and merchant’s (acquiring) banks, and every time funds settle. These fees are charged on a per transaction basis (not a percentage of spend), and range from $0.01 to $0.05 per transaction.Mastercard has an enormous and expanding total addressable market. In the coming years, this opportunity will be driven by two catalysts: (1) increasing consumer spend and (2) increasing digital payments, both online and in stores.1. Consumer SpendingOver the last 20 years, consumer spending has grown by 2.8% per year, according to data from The World Bank. This consistent growth in consumer spending is one of the driving forces behind economic growth in general.(Source: Created by the author using data from MacroTrends)Of course, consumer spending has decreased substantially this year, but that happens from time to time - notice the dips in 2008 and 2014. In general, though, consumer spending tends to rise over time. And that tends to act as a baseline for Mastercard's growth. In other words, even in the absence of all other catalysts, Mastercard should still be able to grow ~2.8% per year.2. Digital PaymentsOn a global scale, digital payments are expect to grow from $4.9 trillion (2020) to $8.2 trillion (2024), representing 13.4% annualized growth.The 2020 Global Payments Report by WorldPay provides a growth forecast through 2023 for both e-commerce and POS (in-store) payments. This is shown in the graphic below. Percentages indicate a percentage of total spend in each category.(Source: WorldPay Global Payments Report (2020))As indicated above, digital/mobile wallet payments are expected to increase both online and in stores. Additionally, credit/debit card payments are also expected to increase in stores. These trends will directly benefit Mastercard.You may also notice that credit/debit cards are expected to decrease as a percentage of spend online. But this is misleading, as it indicates outright usage (i.e., not through a digital wallet)But digital wallets work with payment cards. Yes, they can be funded by bank transfer, too (i.e., Automated Clearing House). But these platforms were also built on top of card networks rather than in place of them. So, Mastercard still benefits. In fact, the effect is two-fold, as they benefit both from continued outright usage of payment cards and from increasing use of digital/mobile wallets - like Apple Pay (AAPL), Google Pay (GOOG), PayPal (PYPL), Square - when these wallets are used in conjunction with a credit/debit card.But what's driving the shift toward digital payments?Mobile wallets offer increased convenience and security. Smartphones make it easy to organize and use a variety of payment cards, not to mention providing extra security in the form of password protection. So, the shift towards digital payments will be partially driven by increased adoption of mobile wallets. But the other half of the equation is increasing e-commerce penetration.Accordingly, eMarketer’s 2019 report forecasts that global e-commerce sales are expected to grow from $4.2 trillion (2020) to $6.5 trillion (2023), representing ~16% growth per year.(Source: eMarketer)Over this time period, e-commerce sales will increase from 16% of total retail sales to 22%. This shift towards e-commerce will correlate with an increase in digital payments, and given Mastercard's competitive position, they should capture value from this shift.But even after 2023, there is still significant room for growth in e-commerce. Likewise, mobile wallets will continue to become more ubiquitous, and consumer spending in general should continue to rise (as it has in the past). For these reasons, I would expect Mastercard’s market opportunity to continue expanding well into the future.Mastercard’s business model is exceptional for many reasons. First, the company’s global network has created an effective duopoly (with Visa) in many regions of the world, making it all but impossible for competitors to upset the status quo. This advantage is further reinforced by strong network effects - each new cardholder adds value for every existing merchant, and each new merchant adds value for every existing cardholder. Additionally, Mastercard’s business model is operationally efficient, as revenue growth has significantly outpaced growth in operating costs over the past decade. As a result, operating margins have trended upwards over time, from the high-40%'s to the mid-50%'s range. And this has translated into expanding profit margins. Finally, due to the asset-light nature of the business, capital expenditures have also been low, which has allowed the company to grow free cash flow exceptionally quickly over a long period of time.As I mentioned earlier, Mastercard card generates revenue through (1) assessment fees on both domestic and cross-border transactions, and (2) transaction processing fees. Before diving deeper into the financials, let’s examine both of these metrics over the last decade.The chart below shows gross dollar volume (GDV), which represents the total amount of currency moving through Mastercard’s network. This is important, as assessment fees are taken as a percentage of gross spend.(Source: Created by the author using data from Mastercard Investor Relations)As indicated above, GDV has increased at 9% annually since 2010.The chart below shows switched transactions over the last decade. This figure directly impacts the amount of revenue generated from transaction processing fees.(Source: Created by the author using data from Mastercard Investor Relations)As indicated above, the number of switched transactions has grown even more quickly than GDV, at 15% annually since 2010.Given the metrics above, it’s not surprising that Mastercard has been able to grow revenue consistently and quickly over the last decade. This is shown in the chart below.(Source: Created by the author using data from Mastercard Investor Relations.)Mastercard has grown revenue at 12% per year since 2010. While 12% growth in any given year is nothing extraordinary, to consistently grow at that pace for a decade is quite impressive. Even more impressive, that number includes the impact of the most recent quarter, in which revenue dropped 19%. However, investors shouldn't be worried about this. Q2'20 coincided with the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the associated business closures and social distancing precautions significantly reduced consumer spending during this time. As the situation improves, revenue growth will resume and potentially accelerate.I would also like to note that operating margins have trended upward over the last decade, reaching 57.5% in FY'19. While margins have dropped a bit in 2020, they still remain above 50%. As a result of this increasing efficiency, Mastercard has grown earnings at 19% annually since 2010. Once again, that number is exceptional.Finally, Mastercard has kept capital expenditures relatively low over the past decade. Accordingly, free cash flow has grown at 19% per year since 2010. This is shown in the chart below.(Source: Created by the author using data from Mastercard Investor Relations)Again, this type of growth over the course of a decade is very impressive. Few businesses will ever achieve that level of financial success.Mastercard currently trades at 47.7x earnings and 21.5x sales, both of which represent a slight premium compared to Visa. These metrics are shown in the chart below:Data by YChartsWhile Mastercard stock isn't cheap, I believe the company warrants this valuation. It has executed consistently for over a decade, growing revenue, profits, and free cash flow at a double-digit pace.Additionally, as the chart below indicates, Mastercard's revenue and earnings growth have slightly outpaced Visa's since 2010.Data by YChartsWhereas Mastercard has grown revenue 193%, Visa has grown slightly more slowly, at 174%. Likewise, Mastercard's profits have grown 415% compared to Visa's 399%. This justifies the slight premium in Mastercard's valuation.China’s payments infrastructure is perhaps the largest risk to Mastercard and Visa, as it would represent a complete overhaul of the current payments system in the US and Europe.In order to discuss this risk, I will provide an overview of the payments infrastructure in the United States.Payments Infrastructure In The United StatesThere are essentially three payment rails in the US: (1) Automated Clearing House (ACH), (2) Card Networks, and (3) The Clearing House Real-Time Payments (RTP) Network. And all of these involve banks to some degree.Payments Infrastructure In ChinaRather than being primarily bank-based, like the US and Europe, a huge portion of payments in China flow through two big tech companies: Alibaba (BABA) and Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY).How did this happen?For years, Mastercard and Visa were kept out of China. In fact, Mastercard only recently received approval to enter the Chinese market. Likewise, China’s card-based network, UnionPay, was met with some resistance from merchants - due primarily to merchants taking issue with the fees. This left a gap in the Chinese payments infrastructure.So, in 2004, Alibaba introduced AliPay, providing consumers with a means to shop on its e-commerce marketplace. Then, Tencent’s competing product, WeChat Pay, was released in 2005. In the intervening years, these digital wallets have taken root and are unlikely to be displaced. Just to provide some context, AliPay reportedly had 1.3 billion users as of March 2020. At the same time, WeChat reported 1.2 billion users. In other words, AliPay and WeChat Pay's combined user base is almost twice the population of China.According to a Bloomberg report, use of these digital wallets effectively cuts banks (and payment cards) out of the equation. Most Chinese consumers transfer their paychecks from their banks to their AliPay or WeChat Pay wallets, then use these wallets to fund most purchases. This means banks don’t earn interest on account balances, nor do they earn interchange revenue from card-based spending. It also means card networks don’t take a cut either.For this reason, if China’s payments system expanded into the US and Europe, it could certainly threaten Mastercard’s competitive position. This would be analogous to US consumers transferring paychecks into their Apple Pay or Google Pay (or PayPal) wallets, then using those wallets to fund most or all of their daily purchases.However, this doesn’t seem like an imminent problem. Companies like Apple and Google are already being investigated for alleged monopolistic practices. Further consolidation of power in their hands is unlikely. Imagine how the Justice Department would respond if Apple and Google replaced banks and payment cards as a lynchpin of the US payments infrastructure.Furthermore, given the tension between the US and China, and the dominance of Mastercard and Visa outside of the Asia-Pacific region (i.e., Mastercard and Visa handle a combined 90% of payments outside of China), I doubt AliPay or WeChat Pay will meaningfully enter the US or European markets anytime soon.As I mentioned earlier, The Clearing House’s RTP Network represents a new type of payment rail. Real-time payments will play an important role in the future, not only because they help meet the demands of an increasingly digitized world, but because they allow for better security and data transfer alongside payments. This may sound trivial, but quality data helps reduce fraud, money-laundering, and other financial crimes.How does this relate to Mastercard?The Clearing House RTP Network is powered by Vocalink technology, and Vocalink is owned by Mastercard. But the impact extends beyond The Clearing House in the United States. Vocalink’s technology has also been used to develop real-time systems in the UK, Singapore, and Thailand. And while adoption is still in the early stages, it is important to recognize that Mastercard is literally helping to shape the future of payments around the globe.Mastercard has also created a real-time payments system using the card payment rails. This system is called Mastercard Send. And it leverages Vocalink’s technology to enable three types of real-time payments:Mastercard Send can reach more than 3 billion accounts in 80+ countries. For example, PayPal and Venmo users can instantly transfer funds to a bank account using Mastercard Send if the account is linked to a Mastercard debit card. And numerous other platforms use Mastercard Send to provide the same functionality: Stripe, Square, Uber (UBER), Google Pay, and Allstate (ALL).But Visa is also innovating around real-time payments. Its system is called Visa Direct. Like Mastercard Send, it uses the card payment rails to instantly transfer funds. The only difference is that the bank accounts must be linked to a Visa debit card.Also noteworthy, Mastercard recently announced that it would be working with ACI Worldwide (a provider of real-time payment software) to offer real-time payment services on a global scale.Mastercard is a critical part of the global payments infrastructure. It owns ~25% of the payments card market, with over 2.2 billion credit/debit cards in circulation, which connect thousands of financial institutions and millions merchants.The company benefits from a textbook network effect, as each new cardholder benefits all existing merchants, and each new merchant benefits all existing cardholders. This further solidifies its dominant position, making it all but impossible for a competitor to upset Mastercard and Visa’s ""duoply"" in most regions of the world.Additionally, Mastercard’s total addressable market is enormous and expanding. In the coming years, two major catalysts will drive growth: (1) increasing consumer spend and (2) the shift towards digital payments.Beyond this, Mastercard’s business is the picture of financial health. Revenue has grown at 12% annually since 2010. Over this time, operating efficiencies have allowed earnings to grow even faster, at 19% annually. And Mastercard’s asset-light business has kept capital expenditures low, meaning free cash flow has also grown quickly, at 19% per year over the last decade.Finally, rather than fading from relevance in the increasingly crowded payments space, Mastercard continues to innovate and adapt to the changing world. It has partnered with several fintech firms, including PayPal, Square, and MercadoLibre, to offer branded debit cards and other services. The company is also helping to shape the future of real-time payments, which has the potential to dramatically change the industry going forward. In other words, Mastercard is just as relevant today as it was a decade ago, if not more so.For all these reasons, Mastercard is a solid long-term investment."
4365576,53552,2020-08-06T23:34:06-04:00,"Mastercard shares trade at a premium multiple, but strong growth trends justify it.Q2 results were down due to the economic shutdown, but activity trends have improved in July.Mastercard's data and security businesses are even more in demand now, while the shift away from cash will continue, which will ensure continued growth over the medium term.","Shares of Mastercard (MA) have recouped much of their March losses and are up 13% over the past year. While the company’s valuation may seem high given the declines reported in its Q2 results, its long-term growth trajectory remains on track, and it is an attractive long-term investment.(Source: Seeking Alpha)In the company’s second quarter, it earned $1.36, $0.18 above consensus. Revenue was down 19% to $3.34 billion, essentially in line with expectations, as lockdowns led to fewer transactions. EPS was down over 25% from $1.89 last year as cost cuts could not keep up with the fall in revenue.Given the economic downturn, there was a significant drop in activity as consumers stopped frequenting restaurants, hotels, malls, etc. While increased online transactions helped to offset this, cross-dollar volume was down 10% to $1.38 trillion. The US was down 5%, while the rest of the world down 12%. Debit cards outperformed credit cards, interestingly.The biggest headwind the business faced was on cross-border transactions, as the vast majority of the world shut down their borders to visitors to control the spread of COVID-19. Cross-border transactions were down 45%. In fact, the $707 million drop in cross-border volume fees accounted for nearly all of the revenue drop that Mastercard faced.On the positive side, the company’s “other” revenue was up 10% excluding acquisitions to $1.08 billion. This business unit includes all of MA’s data and cybersecurity offerings. While consumers think of Mastercard as a card company, it also offers security protection to crack down on fraud, which will be more valuable as e-commerce grows. Additionally, with over $1 trillion in quarterly spending, it has tremendous data on where people are spending. These trends, which can be seen nearly real-time, are incredibly valuable for advertisers, investors, and policymakers. Seeing this unit grow during such a challenged economic period is very encouraging.Operating expenses were down 5% to $1.63 billion, 9% excluding acquisitions as the company spends less on advertising and travel. Advertising was down about 60% to $93 million, in large part due to the delay of many sporting events. Additionally, rebates and incentives cost the company $198 million less to $1.76 billion, given lower activity levels.As Mastercard’s cost structure does not move as variably as its revenue base, margins contracted to 51.2% from 58.3%. More encouragingly, card count was up 5%, which should help support greater cash flow and earnings in future quarters.Mastercard also maintains a pristine balance sheet. The company issued $4 billion in debt, bringing its gross debt total up to $12.5 billion, just 4% of the company’s $310 billion market cap. It also has a $11.1 billion in cash, leaving its balance sheet nearly unlevered on a net basis, giving the company significant flexibility.Even though business was down, it generated $3.1 billion of free cash flow year to date vs. $2.6 billion a year ago, a testament to the juggernaut the company is. While earnings were down this quarter, activity is likely to improve in coming quarters.As economies unlock and consumers engage in more activity, Mastercard will be a natural beneficiary. While gross dollar volume was down 10% in Q1, in the month of July, card volume in the US and Europe has turned positive year over year, which will boost the top and bottom line.Now, travel restrictions inside of a country have generally eased more quickly than those between countries, which will likely be the case for some time. As such, Mastercard’s cross-border business will likely rebound more slowly. But it should start to recoup some of that lost $700 million revenue in Q3. Particularly in Europe, where intra-Europe travel restrictions have eased significantly, the company is seeing improvement. July is running down 26% vs. 40% in Q1.(Source: Mastercard Q2 2020 Earnings Release)Much of the revenue hit Mastercard felt in Q2 should really be seen as a one-time impact rather than a recurring shift in the company’s earnings capacity, which is perhaps why the stock has already discounted most of its March losses. While some units may take a few quarters to recover, I see Mastercard as better-positioned in a post-COVID-19 world than a pre-COVID-19 world.First, e-commerce has gained significant market share, and as the world grows more digital, cash will be used less. Indeed, a Mastercard Impact survey shows 60% of consumers expect to use less cash even after the pandemic. This means more penetration and transactions for payment providers. Now, this benefits all the payment companies and not just MA - but also Visa (V) and PayPal (PYPL). However, MA won’t just win on the card side but also on the business side.90% of Mastercard’s business customers are small businesses. The company is using its financial strength to invest $250 million to help streamline its entrance into e-Commerce. More than just being a nice marketing ploy to engender positive headlines, this small business assistance will deepen Mastercard’s relationship with them. A greater online presence means more need for cybersecurity assistance, and Mastercard is more likely to win cybersecurity work when it is helping small businesses build their e-commerce platform. Programs like this are costly today but can pay for themselves in future revenue and brand equity.Additionally, as noted above, Mastercard’s data business grew in the quarter. As the world becomes more reliant on Big Data, few companies have Mastercard’s breadth of data. Indeed, given the magnitude of the economic shock, investors have looked to new real-time indicators, from OpenTable’s daily restaurant data to credit card spending and TSA screenings, to gauge the speed of the downturn and recovery. This crisis has shown the value of real-time data, opening up Mastercard’s analytics business to a whole new suite of buyers. The company’s ability to package and sell data is a differentiator that can supercharge its growth beyond just increased transaction volumes.So, Mastercard should see improvements in the near term, thanks to the economic normalization, and longer term due to favorable transaction trends, deepening ties with business adding e-commerce and sales of data analytics. MA has been a tremendous grower for years, and these factors should permit continued growth. In 2019, the company generated $7.7 billion in free cash flow, up from $1.6 billion in 2010. That’s a 19% compounded annual growth rate.Thanks to its strong balance sheet, Mastercard has restarted the share repurchase program and has bought back $1 billion since the start of Q3. There is $5.9 billion available on the program. Shares only yield 0.52%, and while the dividend should continue to grow double digits, share repurchases are the primary use of its excess free cash flow.Assuming a return to trend by Q4 of this year, the company can earn $9 per share and generate $9 billion of free cash flow in 2021. That leaves shares trading 34x 2021 earnings, which is not cheap. When I look at Mastercard, I am reminded of Warren Buffett’s piece of advice, “It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.”With over a decade of double-digit growth behind it, Mastercard has proven to be a wonderful company. Moreover, secular trends in transaction growth are continuing, and in data, they can accelerate, meaning several more years of similar overall growth are in the cards. By 2025, this company can generate over $16 billion in free cash flow, which would support a share price over $525 at a 3% free cash flow yield, a 13% annualized return from today. MA is a stock to own, enjoying the compounded free cash flow it generates. In time, you will be rewarded."
4369161,105308,2020-08-17T10:04:47-04:00,"Mastercard shares have made a full recovery post their massive 42% decline.The company has returned to growth levels quite quickly.Despite using lower growth estimates to analysts, Mastercard has a great return potential with a decent margin of safety.","Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) have been two all-time favorite stocks in the investing community, tapping into the full potential of modern-day payments by operating the toll booth of everyday transitions. Our love for the two companies is no secret as well. We have published a few articles on their total return potential, including why investors should ""add on every dip forever.""Today, we will focus specifically on Mastercard, whose shares took a 42% nosedive during the March's sell-off, only to quickly rebound to nearly their all-time high levels over the past few months.As we had recommended doing, those who added during the dip would have benefited greatly, admittedly with most of the other stocks in the tech sector. In this article, we want to explore Mastercard's future return potential and assess if shares are still worth picking up post their recent rally.Source: Google FinanceIn this article, we will:Mastercard's latest earnings came in weak, as expected, due to reduced transaction volume as a result of COVID-19. Revenues fell by 19.5% to reach $3.3B, while EPS also decreased by 30%, to $1.41, as gross dollar volume declined by 10%, on a worldwide basis.This marks the first time the company's revenues faced any meaningful dip, as its sales had kept on increased during times such as the Great Financial Crisis. Despite the steep decline in sales during the quarter, we view the situation as temporary and want to emphasize on Mastercard's resiliency as a business.As this handy table provided by Mastercard illustrates, recovery is taking place swiftly. In April, switched volume (processed transactions) took a nosedive amid the slump in consumer spending. However, the next couple of months saw considerable improvement, with July not only having resumed to pre-COVID-19 volumes but also recording slight growth.Source: Investor presentationIn our view, this is incredibly remarkable, considering that cross-border transactions remain severely impacted, as travel restrictions still apply.In fact, on a year-to-date perspective, gross dollar volume was down by only 1%, despite three fully adversely affected months and a still beaten down cross-border volume by 24%.Source: Earnings releaseBased on these numbers, Mastercard would have enjoyed another incredible financial year if it wasn't for COVID-19. However, these numbers also highlight the company's operational resiliency. With switched transactions up 1% YTD, while undergoing a global pandemic and arguably the least business-friendly 3-month period in recent history, Mastercard is an unstoppable juggernaut.Further, with the company's net income margins being on the path of long-term expansion, Mastercard's profitability is set on advancing as its growth levels resume. We have used the same analogy in previous articles, treating Mastercard's profitability as royalty-like, since its gross margins are literally 100%. As its revenues keep growing on the back of a cashless society, the company has to incur little to no additional operating expenses, continuously increasing its net income potential.Now, let's attempt to use the available information to estimate the stock's medium-term return potential.Consensus estimates point towards a quick recovery throughout next year, as shown previously in Mastercard's growth slides. EPS growth is then expected to grow by around 20% annually, indicating similar EPS growth levels, pre-COVID-19.Source: Seeking AlphaHowever, we are going to estimate more prudent levels, at 12%, to ensure a higher margin of safety in the potential scenario that COVID-19 reignites post-summer.For DPS, we estimate an annualized growth of 20%. We are confident with this figure because the company's 5-year average is 24.5%, while the company's very own last dividend increase was 21.2% as well. We believe that the company has considerable wiggle room to keep on increasing the dividend at a rapid growth rate. The payout ratio remains below 25%, while its consistent share repurchases further should save the company of the extra future dividends it would otherwise have to pay.Mastercard has retired around 23% of its shares outstanding over the past decade. The company had its buyback program paused during Q2. However, it resumed it entering Q3 with its quick recovery. From June 1st to earnings release on July 27th, Mastercard repurchased a substantial $1B, in less than two months.Applying our estimated growth rates, we should be getting the following figures:Source: AuthorBelow, we have calculated the potential investor returns, based on the company's current price of $326, our estimated growth rates, and its current valuation, if one were to buy today. As you can see, if shares were to retain their current (forward) P/E ratio of 37.5, investors would still achieve double-digit returns, despite applying lower growth rates than those of analysts.Even amid a valuation compression, investor returns would still be acceptable.We believe that the most likely scenario would be a light P/E compression to the low 30s, still tapping into a double-digit return potential.Source: AuthorConsidering that Mastercard has never been ""cheap,"" we believe that its future expected growth could justify its current, rather pricey, valuation multiple.The most significant risk that we think could adversely affect Mastercard's future performance is a second COVID-19 wave in Europe that could impose strict travel restrictions, potentially hurting the economy and reducing consumer spending. As mentioned earlier, recovery has been extremely swift, as consumers still swipe their cards to purchase their everyday necessities.However, global monetary authority assistance has also aided in keeping transactions flowing, as multiple governmental entities around the world have handed businesses and consumers money (0%-rate loans, grants, etc.) along with the various stimuli.An adverse progression of COVID-19 will have significant results and would likely diminish our expected returns.Further, as the company repurchases its shares at quite a high valuation, we fear that investors receiving dividends, or Mastercard acquiring other companies could maybe generate higher returns. We are not to question a world-class management team on its capital allocation, but stock repurchases at the company's current valuation levels could arguably reduce shareholder returns in the long term.Mastercard is one of our favorite stocks that we are actively looking to add during market downturns. The stock's slump during March and April was another opportunity for investors to reinforce their positions.Despite the recent rally, Mastercard appears to have a decent return medium-term potential, even under reduced analyst expectations. Further, shares hold a fair margin of safety under a potential valuation compression.While the significant risk of the likelihood of COVID-19 advancing post-summer, Mastercard remains a great company that saw a quick resumption to growth levels during the virus's first phase. We are not planning to add shares at their current price. However, another considerable correction may trigger some buying activity."
4363879,33291,2020-08-03T14:09:04-04:00,"Volume declines hit revenue in Q2.Cross-border volumes were sliced nearly in half.We see 2020 revenues coming in at $15.0-16.0 billion and earnings per share coming in at $6.00-$7.00.Under $300 is a fine level to start doing some buying, and you can add in blocks lower if the market rolls over again.","Prepared by Tara, Senior Analyst at BAD BEAT InvestingMastercard (NYSE:MA) continues to deliver solid performance, and in our opinion, this stock remains a buy, but under $300 would be ideal. Sure, it is still down some from all-time highs after its sizable pullback in the COVID-19 crisis. As the crisis continues there will be reduced volumes, less consumer spending, and a slowdown in growth, likely for the next quarter or so. However, we think that despite the rebound in shares, there is opportunity here.Yes, right now, it is painful relative to the growth path the stock and company were on. Yes, valuation-wise, the stock has long been overvalued, but that valuation has come in lower, particularly if we 'exclude' the earnings impacts over the next few quarters and look to 2021. On the next big pullback, we think this stock still makes an excellent addition to any portfolio focused on growth. With the huge economic impacts of COVID-19 it is still overvalued in the traditional sense. However, the market is looking ahead. Perhaps it is anyway.For years, the argument of the name being overvalued has been made, but shares continued to rise. Action has been a little sideways of late, but on the next pullback consider shares because Mastercard as a company has continued to invest in itself. It is only a matter of time before growth returns, and if this market does as we expect it to do, growth will return from increasing volumes as people get back to work, businesses open, and the company manages its expenses. We think, in 2021, a double-digit growth in earnings is likely. In this column, we will examine trends in sales and earnings and discuss our expectations for the rest of 2020.Despite the economy being beat up, the data remains relatively strong, particularly against expectations. The recently reported quarter saw top line contraction. Perhaps unsurprisingly the growth has slowed given COVID-19-related shutdowns and reduced spending power of consumers. The past growth in revenues had been impressive. Here in Q2 2020, economic activity slowed heavily. Internationally, activity began slowing even earlier. We expect Q3 and Q4 will see pain as well, but think Q4 2020 and 2021 are set to see a ramp-up in activity.It is not the virus itself that killed growth, but the actions of the government to try and quell the spread to prevent a run on hospitals, and widespread death which led to tough decisions being made, decisions which have crushed commerce. Net revenue for the quarter came in at $3.3 billion, a 19.5% decrease from Q2 2019. This was primarily due to a steep drop in gross dollar volume and in processed transactions.Mastercard saw a 10% drop in gross dollar volume, at the higher (better) end of our wide range for COVID-19 impacted Q2 expectations for 8%-14% declines, and saw a 10% decrease in transactions processed, also better than the declines of 7%-13% we thought we might see. Our expectations were much wider than usual given the pain of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it created. The transaction declines drove the declines we saw in revenues. As we mentioned earlier, internationally, things slowed down before they did in the U.S. As such, cross-border volumes took a huge hit once again. They contracted 45%. Expect more declines in Q3, but not so steep. Given the declines in revenues and transactions we were looking for commensurate declines in expensesOperational expenses have continued to rise rather sharply in recent years, following revenue increases. With revenues falling we were looking for expense declines. Expenses fell year-over-year vs. last year by 9% on an adjusted basis. On a currency-neutral basis, expenses were down 5%. It should be noted that continued investment in strategic initiatives as well as normal operational expenses resulted in the overall single-digit declines. Total adjusted operating expenses were $1.6 billion for several reasons, including primarily spending related to strategic initiatives, as well as lower promotional spending and of course acquisition-related integration expenses. When we factor in the decrease in revenues,we see that it led to operating income decreasing as reported at $1.7 billion. Perhaps not surprising, adjusted operating margin contracted to 51.8% from 58.3%. With the top line contraction and margin contraction, we saw a big drop in adjusted EPS.Putting it all together, we see earnings fell, and we expected a decline down to as low as $1.20. We saw fewer transactions being processed, we had lower revenues, and narrowing margins. Again, expect Q3 to also be painful, but the market has essentially given these COVID-19 quarters a pass. Much like the revenue trend, the EPS trend stalled in Q2.Net income was down to $1.4 billion versus the $1.9 billion a year ago, and hit $1.36 per share versus $1.89 per share. As we move forward, we expect EPS growth to remain stalled in the next quarter, and possibly into Q4.To be clear, handicapping performance in these unprecedented times is difficult, but we see a reason to be hopeful for the prospects of the stock going forward. Factoring in the trajectory of Mastercard's performance in 2019, as well as the investments the company has made strategically, we still see some growth in 2020. Ultimately, the shape and speed of the recovery will be determined by the effectiveness of policy initiatives. It is tough to forecast though. We would expect some sectors, particularly where there is demand now, like home improvement, clothing, and out to eat dining to normalize sooner than later. Then later, domestic and intra-regional travel to normalize after that. Other areas like mass entertainment and long-haul travel will probably take longer to recover. There will also be geographic variability.Based on what we are seeing to-date, we see 2020 revenues coming in at $15.0-16.0 billion and earnings per share coming in at $6.00-$7.00. This is based on annual volumes increasing in the low-single digits, contraction in cross-border volumes in the single digits, and operational expenses higher in the low-single digits overall.What we are seeing in 2020 is true contraction thanks to policy decisions that simply limit business. Let the market knock this thing back a bit. Under $300 is a fine level to start doing some buying, and you can add in blocks lower if the market rolls over again.If you like the material and want to see more, scroll to the top of the article and hit ""follow."""
4366297,104254,2020-08-08T08:05:33-04:00,Mastercard's financial metrics are exceptionally good.Mastercard and its main competitor Visa enjoy extremely strong positions in the global card payments network that are unlikely to be challenged in the medium term.Transaction volumes through the card payments network are very sensitive to global economic health. The current pandemic has already presented a brief opportunity to buy Mastercard cheaply.The shape of the global recovery may provide further opportunities to buy this wonderful company.,"Mastercard, Inc. (NYSE:MA) is a technology company in the global payments sector. Mastercard partners with financial institutions to issue Mastercard branded cards (generally co-branded with the issuing financial institution) that are processed through the Mastercard payments network.In this operating model, Mastercard has no exposure to a breakdown in the credit process of the consumer or the corporate using the card. This risk is borne by the issuing financial institution.Mastercard predominantly makes its revenues by charging a fee for every transaction flowing through its network, but it also has a growing services business where it is using a SaaS approach to providing services such as cyber fraud detection and prevention, loyalty programs, etc.The company currently only has one reportable operating segment, but it does break down gross revenues into four sources (the proportion of total 2019 FY revenues is shown in brackets):Source: Author's compilation using Mastercard's 10-KMastercard has primarily grown organically. Its focus has always been to replace cash and checks in the consumer payments sector. It has gained share by signing up more financial institutions to issue cards and more merchants who are prepared to accept the card.Over the last 10 years, Mastercard has spent more on acquisitions than capex and capitalized software ($4,572 M versus $3,558 M). Most of these acquisitions have been relatively modest in size, but nevertheless important strategically, particularly in regard to its growing Services business.Mastercard and its main competitor Visa (NYSE:V) have entrenched positions in the global card payments sector.The payments system is a four-party network as shown in the following diagram:Source: Mastercard 2019 10-K filingA typical transaction comprises a financial institution's account holder (credit or debit card) purchasing goods and services from an accredited merchant using a Mastercard payment product (a card or a device).The transaction is authorized by the card issuer (the cardholder's financial institution) and the issuer pays the acquirer (the merchant's financial institution) an amount equal to the transaction less the interchange fee. This transaction is then posted to the account holder's account.The acquiring institution pays the value of the transaction net of a discount (called the merchant's discount) to the merchant's account.It is noted that Mastercard does not issue cards nor is it exposed to any credit default issues related to the transactions.Mastercard estimates that in 2018 the total value of the transactions within the global Payments Network was $235 Trillion. There are three segments within the Payments Network which are depicted in the following chart:Source: Mastercard Investment Community Presentation, Sept. 2019Mastercard's primary target market segment is the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) market. This segment is understood to have transactions totaling $50 Trillion per year. The PCE market is believed to be growing (pre-COVID-19) at between 4% and 5%, whilst at the same time, there is a secular shift within the segment away from cash and checks to cards (both debit and credit).There are many functional card payment networks throughout the world. The following table shows the reported Gross Dollar Value of transactions of the major networks:Source: Author's compilation using data sourced from company 10-K filingsClearly Visa and Mastercard dominate the card processing network (combined market share of 58%). I suspect that the difference between the $19,520 B total in the above table and the estimated market size of $30,000 B is filled by the Chinese market participants such as Ant Financial.It should be noted that the size of the Payments market (particularly the PCE segment) is directly influenced by the health of the global economy.There are reports that COVID-19-related economic lockdowns have had massive impacts on the gross domestic product (GDP) of various countries. The World Bank believes that the global economy may shrink by more than 5%. This has an immediate impact on the value of transactions flowing through the Payments Network. Mastercard recently reported that its second-quarter gross dollar value (GDV) was 10% lower than the prior year.Mastercard's strategy is reasonably straight-forward:Mastercard summarizes its strategy in the following way:Source: Mastercard Investment Community presentation Sept 2019The most significant recent change in the Payments Network has been the rise of the digital/mobile wallet. A digital wallet (such as Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google Pay (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), etc.) allows users to store their credit and debit card information on an app or platform - then use it to pay for transactions with merchants without requiring the physical presence of the card.Worldpay (NYSE:WP), an international company which provides transaction support for merchants, annually publishes projections for the future of global payments. Its latest update is below:Source: Worldpay Global Payments Report 2020The digital wallet providers (Apple, Google, etc.) become one more ""ticker clipper"" on the network. They get paid by the card issuers and acquirers.The digital wallet has no impact on the revenues of Mastercard and Visa.I have summarized some of the key metrics for Mastercard and Visa in the following table. To eliminate the impact of any single year, I have averaged the metrics over the last five years:Source: Author's compilation using Mastercard & Visa 10-K filingsThe following conclusions can be drawn from the table:To better understand the differences in operating margins, I have broken down the 2019 Income Statement for both companies and expressed the reported expense line items as a percentage of net revenues:Source: Author's compilation using company 10-F filingsI acknowledge that Visa has a much larger revenue base, which would tend to reduce its fixed cost ratios in relation to Mastercard, but it is obvious that there is a significant difference in reported personnel productivity.Many technology companies expense a major proportion of their product development costs which strictly speaking should be capitalized because of the multi-year benefits that they bring. This means that many of the reported operating margins for these companies are potentially understated.I suspect that Mastercard is expensing a higher proportion of its development costs relative to Visa and that this is the reason that Mastercard's operating margin is much lower than Visa's margin.This conclusion is supported by the fact that Mastercard's capital productivity is much higher than Visa. Mastercard generates $1.82 of revenues from each dollar of invested capital whilst Visa generates 52 cents of revenues.This results in Mastercard having a much higher return on invested capital. It is for this reason that I think that Mastercard is a better investment (although to be fair either would be fine at the right price).The following chart shows Mastercard's historical revenues and operating margins:Source: Author's compilation using Mastercard's 10-K filingsRevenues have grown steadily since the global financial crisis (GFC). As previously stated, the five-year CAGR is just over 12%.Operating margins have been relatively steady (or slightly rising) for many years. The declines in margins in 2011 and 2018 were caused by large provisions for legal expenses. I have not adjusted the operating expenses for these events because I have formed the view that in the future regulatory litigation may become the norm for Mastercard (and Visa) because of its dominant market position.My moat assessment for Mastercard is shown on the following table:Source: Author's compilationMastercard has a strong moat based on its brand, licenses, the network effect enjoyed by its merchants and card issuers and finally the transaction volume going through its network generates a low cost per transaction.My moat assessment would be the same for Visa.The strength of Mastercard's moat is demonstrated by its return on invested capital:Source: Author's compilation using data from Mastercard's 10-K filingsMastercard's return on invested capital (ROIC) is excellent; however, some care should be taken in interpreting this ratio.Since 2007, Mastercard has reinvested just over 19% of its operating cash flows back into its business. This is shown in the following table:Source: Author's compilation using data from Mastercard's 10-K filings.Mastercard has used its excess cash flows to purchase marketable securities ($528 M), complete share buybacks ($32,196 M) and pay dividends ($6,815 M).In total the company has returned just over 82% of its operating cash flows back to shareholders.This can be seen when I show the entire Cash Flow summary:Source: Author's compilationMastercard has used its free cash flow to capital to shrink the capital component of its balance sheet. As a result, in the ROIC ratio, the numerator has expanded whilst the denominator has shrunk. This has caused the ratio to grow to levels only associated with the best of companies.My approach to valuation is based on projecting a company's future cash flows and discounting them back to the present using a discount rate which is reflective of the risks or uncertainties associated with those cash flows.The process is summarized by this diagram courtesy of Professor Aswath Damodaran:Source: Dr Aswath Damodaran (NYU Stern).Now keep in mind that this is my scenario for Mastercard. It is based on my best estimates of the future. I acknowledge that there will be many individuals who are better placed than I to forecast Mastercard's future:Key Inputs Into Mastercard's ValuationThe assumptions are then summarized into the following inputs into the valuation model:The DCF is relatively straight-forward. A free cash flow to the firm approach is used with a three-stage model (high growth, declining growth and maturity). The model only seeks to value the cash flows of the operating assets. The valuation has been performed in USD.The output from my DCF model is:Source: Author's modelI also developed a Monte Carlo simulation for the valuation based on the ranges of the valuation inputs. The output of the simulation was developed after 100,000 iterations.The Monte Carlo simulation can be used to help us to understand the major value drivers in the valuation. It turns out that the key value driver for Mastercard (based on my scenario) is the revenue growth estimate. This variable has the highest effect on the valuation and is the greatest source of risk in the valuation.Source: Author's modelThe simulation indicates that Mastercard's intrinsic value is between $231 and $340 per share with a midpoint of $281.The revenue growth is Mastercard's value driver and accounts for 83% of the variation in its valuation.Consequently, Mastercard's valuation is extremely sensitive to the impact that COVID-19 might have on the global economy in terms of the depth of the decline in GDP and the rate of recovery.The following table highlights the impact of both aspects on Mastercard's valuation:Source: Author's modelThe forecast that I have used in my valuation is shaded in yellow.Mastercard's valuation is sensitive to the depth of the pandemic induced economic decline but it is even more sensitive to the rate of recovery. A ""V"" shaped recovery would not impact Mastercard as much as an ""L"" shaped recovery.Source: Yahoo FinanceMastercard has been a wonderful investment for shareholders for many years. Interestingly there have been two significant occasions over the last two years when the stock could have been purchased at a discount to its intrinsic value.During the COVID-19 market meltdown, Mastercard became very cheap.Source: MorningstarThe Morningstar table demonstrates how well Mastercard shareholders have done relative to the market and its sector. It has been an outstanding investment.I think that Mastercard has a number of issues relating to its future growth which will require management's vigilance if the current growth trajectory is to be maintained:For each company I value I also assess what role this company could potentially play in my portfolio. The cornerstone of my portfolio is what I term ""Tier 1"" companies. These are the companies that I hold for the long term and where I invest most of my cash.My high-level criteria for a company to qualify as a Tier 1 long-term investment are:Mastercard ticks all these boxes. It is an excellent company and at the right price deserves a place in any good portfolio.What should current holders of Mastercard be doing?Let me acknowledge that I am a shareholder of Mastercard and I have held my shares for several years.I think that the company's intrinsic value is between $231 and $340 per share. The company is priced at the upper end of my valuation. Therefore, I think that the company is currently a HOLD.I would neither be adding or selling to my current holdings. However, I stand locked and loaded ready to BUY if the market gives me the same opportunity that was presented early this year.Final Recommendation: HOLD"
4354014,104941,2020-06-16T02:51:21-04:00,"Visa and Mastercard operate as a de facto duopoly. While this is good, Boeing taught all of us that being a duopoly is not enough.That is, management cannot rest on its laurels, lest they get disrupted.Both of the companies are developing a basket of services to improve their payment processing infrastructures, i.e., Mastercard's planned acquisition of Nets and Visa's acquisition of Plaid.Cash is on the way out, and these two payment infrastructure technology companies are positioned to be the primary beneficiaries.I rate both Visa and Mastercard as buys.","(Source: WalletHub)The consumer payments infrastructure market is a de facto duopoly between Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA), though American Express (AXP) and Discover (DFS) combined do possess a noteworthy share. While all of them have historically served as card-based transaction infrastructure plays, a new wave of fintech is currently washing ashore, and the strength of any of the companies will reside in their ability to adapt to these new realities.My vision for these companies isn't necessarily contingent solely on the ""death of cash"" so to speak. If Visa and Mastercard want to remain relevant throughout the 21st century (and therefore good investments), these companies must be able to diversify their revenues in the same way Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), and Alphabet (GOOG) successfully have over the last decade.In a recent article, I referred to Microsoft's Azure and Amazon's AWS offerings as the ""modern-day railroads of data"" in the 21st century.Well, whether we realize it or not, purchasing Visa or Mastercard is directly akin to purchasing railroads in the early and mid-20th century. These are truly the rails of money in the 21st century.And if you don't take my word for it, stay tuned for the rest of the article, as I share a quote from Mastercard's management regarding the company's position as the money railroads in our modern era.To this end, today, I am going to compare both of the companies’ core businesses, after which I will explore their acquisition strategies to determine which company will deliver superior results in the coming decades. I am going to analyze the companies highlighting that both will generate market-beating returns, and at the end of the article, I will answer the question of which one you should buy today.Let’s find out!(Source: Market Share by Credit Card Network)Visa is the more established business, as it has a stronger market share and more revenue than its competition. I simply think of Visa as Coca-Cola (KO) and Mastercard as Pepsi (PEP), and as we've seen over the last decade, just because one has a better-tasting drink doesn't mean that its stock will outperform (that is, PEP has outperformed KO, as can be seen below).(Source: YCharts)So just because one has been more dominant doesn't mean it will continue to be so in the future, hence we are conducting this analysis.Both companies have benefited from the decline in cash and the rise in digital and card payments. This trend has led to tremendous revenue growth for the two companies in the past 10 years. As people have turned away from using cash, they have started using credit and debit cards as well as various payment platforms, which are nearly ubiquitously enabled by Visa and Mastercard's payment networks.(Source: YCharts)As can be seen above, both companies are steadily increasing revenues, though they both project a modest dip in 2020 due to the virus.Mastercard increased revenue by 13% in 2019 and 20% in 2018, while Visa increased its revenue by 11% and 12% in those years. Mastercard is growing slightly faster, while Visa already has a greater presence because it processes more transactions, which can be seen below.(Source: GlobeNewswire)The graph above captures Visa’s superior presence. The chart below further highlights this dominance.Annual and Monthly Purchase/Spending Volume in 2018(Source: Market Share by Credit Card Network)So far, this is information to which you've already likely been exposed. Next, I will highlight where I believe ""the rubber will meet the road"".That is, V and MA cannot continue to generate market-beating returns without becoming de facto venture capital funds, in which they bolt-on rapidly growing fintech startups with revenues in the hundreds of millions (as Visa successfully did with Plaid recently). This is referred to in the industry as a ""multi-rail"" strategy, as I will highlight in the coming paragraphs.E-commerce and digital wallets are becoming more popular as technology evolves. In light of this, Visa and Mastercard are positioning themselves such that they will continue to dominate the payments infrastructure arena. As can be seen below, the amount of non-cash transactions is supposed to steadily increase across the globe.(Source: Stripe reaches $35 billion valuations after $250 million funding round)Visa and Mastercard will in all likelihood continue to capture this growing trend. Furthermore, global e-commerce sales are still growing rapidly.(Source: eMarketer)Now, let's take a look at this ""multi-rail"" strategy, which I've mentioned a couple of times heretofore.(Source: Medium.com)Visa’s portfolio consists of a variety of solutions that include contactless technology, digital products, and risk management protection. As can be seen above, the company has built a fortress of solutions by which I see it insulating itself from disruption, while also planting the seeds for future accelerated revenue growth.For example, the Plaid acquisition provides just another rail on which money will travel in the 21st century, and Visa will be there to collect its tolls.(Source: Quartz)Plaid allows people to access their bank accounts from a variety of apps and websites. This is just one highly successful example of Visa making a strategic acquisition to further strengthen its moat as the premier global payments infrastructure company.Earthport was another acquisition in 2019 that enables Visa to strengthen its international presence. Visa also strengthened its fraud management system with its acquisition of Verifi.While the company's core business of providing the rails on which money transfers between individuals and their banks slows, its strategic acquisitions will continue to ensure it remains a fantastic investment with plenty of ""cargo"" still traveling on its tracks.Now, let's check out some examples of Mastercard's rail building.Building Mastercard's Tracks(Source: Mastercard held deal talks with Sweden's Tink | Sifted)As illustrated above, Mastercard is steadily acquiring and investing to strengthen its position as a dominant payments infrastructure company. In addition to the above ""tracks"", it also offers a variety of solutions, including fraud protection and digital payments.In the fall of 2019, Mastercard entered into an agreement to purchase Nets, a real-time payments infrastructure play hailing out of Denmark. Since entering into the agreement, the antitrust authorities of the EU have decried as anticompetitive behavior.So, we will continue to monitor developments related to Nets. However, it truly highlights my point about these companies needing to become diversified. In the words of Mastercard's management, they want to become ""multi-railed"".Another example of Mastercard diversifying its revenues was its acquisition of Ethoca, a technology solutions company that identifies and resolves digital fraudulent activity. Moreover, Mastercard now offers enhanced cross-border account transfers internationally through Transfast.Mastercard's acquisitions are further diversifying its revenues and thereby creating a multi-rail company.Now, let’s find out which is the better investment based on our proprietary valuation model.To determine a fair value for Visa and Mastercard, we will employ our proprietary valuation model. Here's what it entails:Now, let's check out the results!AssumptionsUsing the L.A. Stevens Valuation Model, I found that Visa and Mastercard are technically overvalued from a discounted cash flow perspective, as Visa trades at ~$190 and Mastercard at ~$297.However, this is why the L.A. Stevens Valuation Model is highly useful. DCF models can oftentimes prevent us from making great investments, as they reject the reality that in 2030 the respective companies will likely trade at elevated multiples due to their stable and, albeit modestly, growing cash flows.So, in order to determine expected returns, I simply grew the above free cash flow per share at the above assumed growth rates. Then, in year 2030 (or thereabouts), I assigned a conservative price to free cash flow multiple of 25x. For companies with gross margins of above 75%, operating at the heart of secular growth trends, 25x should be easily attainable, as companies like Procter & Gamble (PG) and Apple (AAPL) trade at 25x+ price-to-free cash flow with less than 5% top line growth and even worse margin profiles than those of Visa and Mastercard.(Source: L.A. Stevens Valuation Model)Now, the L.A. Stevens Valuation Model includes a 4th component that factors in dividends without reinvestment and with reinvestment on a quarterly, semi-annual, and annual basis.It's really useful, if I do say so myself, and above you can see the approximate results based on an annual DRIP setting.There are numerous methods by which one can implement a margin of safety. In most cases, I simply use conservative estimates to arrive at a valuation for a company. Here's an example:For the model, I used conservative estimates to account for growth and buybacks over the next 10 years. Visa bought back ~30% of shares outstanding in the past 10 years, while Mastercard bought back ~28% over that same period. Therefore, I assumed that both companies will buy back only 25% of their shares over the next 10 years.Visa and Mastercard operate in a highly lucrative industry... with disruptive vultures circling it every day.From my perspective, retailers would pounce at the opportunity to reduce the transaction fees precipitated by the present payments infrastructure regime. Therefore, I highly approve of the ""multi-rail"" strategy that both companies have assumed. And ultimately, I rate both companies buys at their present prices.With that being said, I would not bet the farm on either company and would prudently diversify into the handful of fintech players my Beating The Market subscribers and I have purchased.In sum, I label Visa a buy at $200 and below and Mastercard a buy at $300 and below.As always, thanks for reading; remember to follow for more, and happy investing!"
4353891,102548,2020-06-15T12:59:57-04:00,Mastercard's earnings and stock price have appreciated strongly in the last decade.The Mastercard-Visa duopoly is still standing strong.An in-depth look at the bear case against Mastercard.The steep entry barriers in the electronic payment industry and the global banking network of Mastercard-Visa will secure the profitable duopoly position in the future.,"Mastercard (MA) probably doesn't require an elaborate introduction, as a sizeable share of Americans are using a Mastercard on a regular basis. Together with Visa (V), both companies dominate the credit card market, both in the USA and on a worldwide basis.As more and more payments are being executed digitally, both Mastercard and Visa have seen their revenues and earnings grow materially in the past decade. The growth in earnings has been accompanied by solid profitability margins and free cash flow growth, which has attracted investors to solidly increase the market value of Mastercard.In this article, we will have a short look at the stock price performance of MA and the underlying long-term fundamentals behind this growth story. We will then have a look at the bear case on Mastercard, by providing a summary of the bearish articles/cases on Mastercard.Mastercard went public on 25 May 2006, as the company issued around half its 135 million shares to the public. A total amount of $2.4 billion was collected at the offering day, bringing the total market capitalization to $5.3 billion.Fast-forward to today (12 June 2020), the market capitalization value has grown to $280 billion. The value of the company has 53-folded its starting value of 2006. Since the inception date, shareholders of MA would even have done better than that, as they would have received numerous dividend payments and Mastercard has regularly bought back its own shares.Source: stockcharts.com The stock price has significantly outperformed the general stock market (SPY) over this period. The uptrend has materialized year after year, only halted by temporary stock price corrections. Source: stockcharts.comOne share of Mastercard currently costs $296, bringing the total market value to $280 billion. This makes Mastercard the sixteenth-largest company by market cap, whereas Visa is currently the tenth-largest company.At the right end of the chart, you can see a more severe decline in stock price. This is the impact of the recent Coronavirus correction, which pulled the stocks from all sectors and industries down as global consumption declined as a consequence of the lockdown measures. The stock price declined strongly but soon recovered in a V-style pattern, retracing its previously high levels.In the past decade, Mastercard has seen its revenues and earnings grow materially. The business model of Mastercard does not require high maintenance costs or large operational expenditures, which result in strong profitability ratios.A major part of the revenues per share have historically been converted into free cash flow.Source: table created by the author with data from stockrow.comFrom this table, we can see the stock price growth of MA has been backed by the fundamentals of the company. The P/E ratio is currently around 38 level, which may seem high, but for a company realizing these strong profitability ratios and growth in earnings, we deem this value justified.Investors are attracted by the earnings power of Mastercard and the strong duopoly position, and as the payment market is becoming more digital, the bullish case has been rather solid in the past years. In the section here below we will take a more contrarian approach and look at what the bears have to say on Mastercard.As explained in the sections here above, Mastercard has realized strong fundamental growth in the past years and the stock has been appreciating strongly. The stock price has recently suffered from the Coronavirus's impact on the stock market but on a long-term basis, the fundamental growth story is still standing strong.Most of the articles which have been published on SeekingAlpha in the past months (and years) have been bullish to very bullish on MA. While we are tempted to go along with the majority and be bullish on MA, we are going to take a more contrarian approach here.Source: book cover of David Dreman's book on Contrarian Investingin this section, we will have a look at the articles which take a bearish view on MA and provide a summary of their main bearish arguments. We have selected all the articles as of 2016 in order not to comment on potentially outdated articles. Most of the articles which have been published on MA on SeekingAlpha have also been published after 2016.We can group the Bear Case arguments for Mastercards in the following categories:This is the most common argument we run into when we read the bearish articles on MA. The valuation multiples used to come to this conclusion vary from internal valuation comparisons (the current price of MA compared with its historical valuation ratios) and the valuation versus the average stock valuation ratio.The most commonly used valuation ratio here is the P/E ratio of Mastercard. Bearish authors point out the current P/E ratio (in 2016-2017-2018) is relatively high compared with its historical P/E ratio. This view is understandable, the P/E ratio has been rising on average and has mostly been above the 25 level.Source: chart made by the author with data from stockrow.comOur comment on this argument: We agree the historical P/E ratio of MA has not been on the low side. There are major companies out there that can be purchased for single-digit P/E ratios, but these companies don't even come close to the historical earnings growth of Mastercard. Taking into consideration the high profitability ratios and the elevated free cash flow generation, we deem an above-average P/E ratio justified.2. The duopoly position is not sustainable in the long runA number of bearish articles discuss the sustainability of the duopoly position of MA and V, which is the main driver behind their strong earnings. The leadership position of MA could be challenged by one of the following factors:Our comment on this argument:In this article, we have taken a look at the strong historical stock performance of Mastercard and the fundamental drivers behind this growth story. In order to maintain a balanced view of the future market position of Mastercard, we have looked at the Bear Case against Mastercard, based on the articles posted here on SeekingAlpha in the past four years.The bearish arguments mostly focus on the relatively high valuation ratios of MA, which we would deem justified taking into consideration the strong historical earnings growth combined with the high profitability ratios.The second group of bearish arguments mainly focusses on the sustainability of the duopoly position of Mastercard and Visa. In our review of this bearish argument, we highlight the strong entry barriers to the payments market and the global networks any intruder would have to compete with. The major issue any new competitor would have be facing here are the steep entry barriers to enter the electronic payments market.Taking the bearish arguments into consideration together with the fundamental drivers of Mastercard, we conclude the stock has still room to appreciate further in the near future."
4345056,105096,2020-05-08T17:01:46-04:00,"Visa and Mastercard both saw double-digit volume declines in April; the near-term earnings impact would only be partially offset by cost cuts.However, excluding verticals like Travel, Card Not Present volumes are growing at 20%+ as the move to digital payments accelerates.We expect earnings after 2021 to be at least on par with 2019, and growth to resume their previous mid-to-high-teens trend.At $182.72 and $278.47 respectively, Visa and Mastercard shares are still 10-15% lower than before COVID-19, and will likely re-rate upwards.With strong growth likely to resume after 2021, we expect both shares to deliver a mid-to-high-teens annualised return. We re-iterate both Buys.","We initiated our Buy rating on Mastercard (MA) last March, followed by a similar Buy rating on Visa (V) in June, preferring them over American Express (AXP) in the card networks space. Since then Mastercard and Visa have returned 19.0% and 12.8% respectively (including dividends).In this article we re-evaluate the two companies' investment cases by reviewing their recent volume performance, CY20Q1 results, near-term outlook, post-COVID earnings and valuation.Both Mastercard and Visa showed double-digit year-on-year volume declines in late April, but these were largely attributable to verticals that were particularly impacted by COVID-19 (such as Travel and Entertainment). Excluding these, Card Not Present volumes have in fact been boosted by COVID-19 and are growing at 20%+, similar to PayPal's (PYPL) volume growth.Visa's U.S. volumes were running at -10% year-on-year as of the fourth week of April, with debit card volumes actually being slightly higher than 2019 (as shown below). Given 25% of Visa's volume is from Travel, Fuel, Restaurants and Entertainment, and these were down by more than 50% in April (including Travel down 80%), this is a respectable performance. In fact, excluding Travel, Visa's U.S. Card Not Present volumes were up 30% year-on-year in late April, benefiting from the acceleration of digital payments growth under COVID-19:Mastercard's global volumes were running at -20% year-on-year as of the third week of April, with U.S. volumes slightly better at -15% (as shown below). Management believes the late April period represents the early part of a “stabilization” phase, including some benefit from government stimulus payments:For Mastercard, even in cross-border payment volumes, once we exclude Travel & Entertainment (""T&E""), Card Not Present volume was actually up approx. 20% in April, including up nearly 40% by the last week of the month:While Visa's and Mastercard's overall year-on-year volume growth rates in April were not as impressive as PayPal's 22%, this could be explained by the different mixes of their businesses. PayPal is historically less exposed to Card Present volumes, and it also gained disproportionately from previously-underserved SMEs and consumers moving away from cash due to COVID-19. It is also worth noting PayPal’s volume remains relatively small, at $191bn in CY20Q1, compared to Mastercard’s $1,565bn and Visa’s $2,786bn.COVID-19 had only a small impact on Visa and Mastercard during CY20Q1; operational trends, including in value-add services, remained strong.For Visa, Payments Volume grew 4.6% year-on-year (ex. currency) in the quarter (Visa's FY20Q2), decelerating from the 8.1% growth in the prior quarter (FY20Q1) as the impact of COVID-19 started to materialise in March. Excluding the loss of low-margin China volumes, Visa's Payments Volume grew 7% in FY20Q2, compared to 10% in FY20Q1 (ex. currency):Visa's P&L, excluding currency, showed Net Revenues grew 7% for the quarter, Operating Expenses grew 3% (with management starting to cut costs as COVID-19's impact became apparent), and EPS grew 9% (helped by the share count having been reduced 2.2% by buybacks):Note that Visa's Service Revenues are based on the prior quarter’s volume, so they are still 8.5% higher year-on-year this quarter. The growth in value-add services helped both Data Processing Revenues and Other Revenues; acquisitions also helped processing revenues.For Mastercard, Gross Dollar Volume was up 8.1% year-on-year (ex. currency) in 20Q1, decelerating from the 12.3% growth seen in 19Q4:Mastercard's P&L, excluding currency, showed Net Revenues grew 5% year-on-year, Operating Expenses grew 8%, Net Income grew 3%, and EPS grew 6% (helped by buybacks) (as shown below). The 8% growth in Operating Expenses included a net +3% impact from one-off items (including +5% from acquisitions and -3% from hedging gains/losses):Mastercard's Domestic Assessments revenues grew 8% year-on-year, in line with its volume growth for the quarter. The 28% growth in Other Revenues included a +6% contribution from acquisitions, but was still comfortably double-digit organically, showing the strength of value-add services.Both Mastercard and Visa guided to a low-single-digit organic reduction in Operating Expenses, while also committing to not making any COVID-19-related lay-offs this calendar year.For Mastercard, this means a low-single-digit growth in Operating Expenses once acquisitions (notably the $3.18bn acquisition of Nets, still expected to close in 20Q3) and currency are included:For Visa, this means Operating Expenses will be ""flat or down in the second half"" of their financial year (ending 30-Sep):Revenue headwinds from lower volumes will be somewhat offset by the continuing growth in value-add services. For example, Mastercard predicted that their service revenues will still grow year-on-year in 20Q2, albeit at a lower rate than in Q1:We believe near-term earnings are essentially impossible to predict. COVID-19 means that there are huge uncertainties around volumes, and revenues do not follow a linear relationship with volumes - different revenue lines carry different revenue margins (for example, intra-regional Travel has lower margins than inter-regional Travel), much of services revenues are not volume-based, and rebates & incentives to card issuers do not have terms disclosed and contain some fixed components.We also believe that investors will largely regard COVID-19 as an one-off and anchor their valuation on 2019 earnings until the recovery phase.While we expect significant volume and earnings declines in 2020, with a recession likely extending into 2021, we believe that after 2021 both volumes and earnings should be at least on par with 2019 levels.COVID-19 has clearly accelerated the move to digital payments. This means there will be a larger base of users and applications for digital payments in 2021, in an economy that will likely be of the same size or larger than 2019.While each crisis is different, we believe the 2008-9 financial crisis provides some encouraging datapoints. While the Great Financial Crisis did not have the travel and “social distancing” restrictions that we face with COVID-19, the headwinds that these represent are somewhat offset by the tailwinds created by the accelerated move to digital payments.During the 2008-9 crisis, Visa's volume growth fell from 20% in FY08 (ending Sep) to a negative -2% in FY09, but recovered to a positive 17% in FY10 (all growth rates based on dollar volumes). Similarly, Mastercard's volume growth fell from 18% in 2007 to -3% in 2009, but recovered to 19% by 2011:We expect at least the non-T&E part of Visa and Mastercard's volumes to recover relatively quickly after the lockdown and subsequent recession, offsetting any potential weakness in T&E spend, and with overall volumes after 2021 at least back to 2019 levels.We value Mastercard and Visa on their CY19 earnings, given our assumption that earnings after 2021 will be at least on par with their 2019 levels.For Visa, at $182.72, share are trading on 32.2x P/E and a 3.0% Free Cash Flow (""FCF"") Yield; the Dividend Yield is 0.7% ($1.20 per share). Visa has confirmed that its dividend policy remains unchanged, and it will continue to execute the $9bn buyback program it has for FY20:For Mastercard, at $278.47, shares are trading on 35.4x P/E and a 2.6% FCF Yield; the Dividend Yield is 0.6% ($1.60 per share). Mastercard has continued to pay dividends and, while it has suspended buybacks, will “re-evaluate” if visibility on the economy improves and will “opportunistically execute” them:Both Visa and Mastercard shares have de-rated by 10-15% in the last few months. For example, Mastercard's FCF Yield was 2.2% in our last article on the company in January; while Visa's was 2.7% in our last article in February:We believe a plausible scenario for returns over the next 5 years is as follows:Including a Dividend Yield of 0.6% (growing with earnings in reality), investor returns in the next 5 years will be 70-90% in total, or 11-14% annualised:While both Visa and Mastercard had double-digit volume declines in April, their Card Not Present volumes outside specific verticals like Travel are growing at 20%+, a respectable performance even when compared to PayPal.COVID-19 is accelerating the move to digital payments and, while near-term volumes and earnings will suffer, after 2021 there will be a larger base of users and applications on an economy that is same or larger in size. We expect earnings after 2021 to be at least on par with 2019 levels, and that both Visa and Mastercard will resume their historic (mid-teens and high-teens respectively) EPS growth.We believe the shares can generate a 11-14% annualised return over the next 5 years, based on some re-rating prior to 2021 year-end and strong earnings growth thereafter.We re-iterate our Buy ratings on both Visa and Mastercard.Note: A track record of my past recommendations can be found here."
4382406,33291,2020-10-29T00:28:14-04:00,"Mastercard stock is down almost 20% from the recent highs in the summer of 2020.Payment volumes and transactions were up, but international volumes were much lower.Expenses down, but not enough to offset revenue declines and preserve earnings.We still see over $6.00 in 2020 EPS, and while the valuation has always been stretched, we are buyers under $300.","Prepared by Tara, Senior Analyst at BAD BEAT InvestingMastercard (MA) stock is down almost 20% from the highs in the summer of 2020. We wanted this stock under $300. We feel it is a buy-and-hold here. Overall, the company continues to deliver solid performance, but the pain being felt in commerce from the COVID-19 crisis is causing an impact. Payment volumes are getting hit hard. However, we want to stress that this is temporary. Shares could fall further with the recent market chaos ahead of the elections and warnings of fresh lockdowns, and astute traders should take advantage.As the crisis continues, there will be reduced volumes, less consumer spending, and a slowdown in growth, likely for the next quarter or so. Yes, right now it is painful relative to the growth path the stock and company were on the past decade. Yes, valuation-wise, the stock has long been overvalued, but that valuation has come in lower, particularly if we ""exclude"" the earnings impacts over the next few quarters and look to 2021. Mastercard as a company has continued to invest in itself. It is only a matter of time before growth returns, and if this market does as we expect it to do, growth will return from increasing volumes as people get back to work, businesses open, and the company manages its expenses. We think, in 2021, a double-digit growth in earnings is likely, but the next few months will still be painful. In this column, we will examine trends in sales and earnings and discuss our expectations for the rest of the year.Despite the economy being beat up, the data remains relatively strong, particularly against expectations. The recently reported quarter saw top line contraction. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the growth has slowed given COVID-19-related shutdowns and reduced spending power of consumers. The past growth in revenues had been impressive. Here in Q3 2020, economic activity had picked up somewhat from earlier in the year, but is still slow. Internationally, activity has been weak. We expect Q4 will see pain as well, but think 2021 will see a ramp-up in activity.Net revenue for the quarter came in at $3.84 billion, a 13.7% decrease from Q3 2019, though this was up $0.5 billion from Q2. The year-over-year drop was primarily due to a steep drop in cross-border activity. Still, there were reasons to be positive.Mastercard saw a 1% increase in gross dollar volume, at the higher (better) end of our wide range for COVID-19-impacted Q3 expectations for -4%-+3% declines, and saw a 2% increase in payment volumes. On top of this, transactions processed were up 5%, also better than the declines of -1%-8% we thought we might see at the midpoint. Our expectations were much wider than usual given the pain of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it created. The transaction declines drove the declines we saw in revenues. As we mentioned earlier, internationally, things slowed down before they did in the U.S. As such, cross-border volumes took a huge hit once again and contracted 36%. Expect more declines in Q4. Given the declines in revenues and transactions, we were looking for commensurate declines in expenses.Operational expenses have continued to rise rather sharply in recent years, following revenue increases. With revenues falling, we were looking for expense declines. Expenses fell year over year versus last year by 4% on an adjusted basis. On a currency-neutral basis, expenses were down 5%. It should be noted that continued investment in strategic initiatives as well as normal operational expenses resulted in the overall single-digit declines. Total adjusted operating expenses were $1.7 billion for several reasons, including primarily spending related to strategic initiatives, as well as lower promotional spending and, of course, acquisition-related integration expenses. When we factor in the decrease in revenues, we see that it led to operating income decreasing as reported to $2.1 billion, from $2.7 billion a year ago. Perhaps not surprising, adjusted operating margin contracted to 54.9% from 59.4%. With the top line contraction and margin contraction, we saw a big drop in adjusted EPS.Putting it all together, we see earnings fell, and we expected a decline to as low as $1.65. We saw fewer cross-border transactions being processed, and there were lower revenues and narrowing margins. Again, expect Q4 to also be painful, but the market has essentially given these COVID-19 quarters a pass. Much like the revenue trend, the EPS trend stalled in Q3.Net income was down to $1.5 billion versus the $2.1 billion a year ago, and hit $1.51 per share versus $2.07 per share. On an adjusted basis, EPS hit $1.60, missing expectations, and falling 26% from last year. This is a big reason shares are falling. With falling EPS, we have concerns as well, but we believe what we are seeing is temporary for the next few months. As we move forward, we expect EPS growth to remain stalled in the next quarter, and possibly into early 2021.Ultimately, the shape and speed of the recovery will be determined by the effectiveness of policy initiatives. It is tough to forecast though, with stimulus uncertainty, election uncertainty, and questions over whether COVID-19 vaccines will be effective. We would expect some sectors, particularly where there is demand now - like home improvement, clothing, and ecommerce - to see good volumes. As we move forward, we expect to see domestic and intra-regional travel starting to normalize when there is more clarity on COVID-19. Other areas like mass entertainment and long-haul travel will probably take longer to recover. There will also be geographic variability.Based on what we are seeing to date, we see 2020 revenues coming in at $15.0-15.7 billion and earnings per share coming in at $6.20-6.70. This is based on annual volumes increasing in the low single digits, contraction in cross-border volumes in the double digits, and operational expenses higher in the low single digits overall.If you like the material and want to see more, scroll to the top of the article and hit ""Follow."""

We reiterate our Buy rating.","We review our investment case on Mastercard (NYSE:MA) after shares corrected by nearly 10% from their $367.25 peak on August 28.Since our initial Buy rating in March 2019, MA shares have returned 41.8% (including dividends), more than double that of the S&P 500:The move to digital payments is a strong secular trend, and we also have Buy ratings on Visa (V) and PayPal (PYPL), which have also done well; we have been Neutral on American Express (AXP), which underperformed as expected.We last reiterated our Buy rating on MA in May. In this article, we utilise the company's Q2 2020 results and post-Q2 volume data, as well as comments by senior executives at investor conferences.MA management believes that most markets are now in the ""normalization"" phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, but not yet resuming ""growth"":As of August, MA's global switched volumes were 2-3% higher year-on-year, including U.S. volumes at 4-5% higher and non-U.S. volumes roughly flat:According to MA, ""all regions outside of the U.S. have seen improvements from July to August"", while the U.S. saw a slight deceleration (from +5% to +4%). The ""continued modest improvement"" in August was due to re-openings in some markets, offset by the withdrawals of government support programs.Travel & Entertainment (""T&E"") volumes remained weak in August due to COVID-19 restrictions. Excluding T&E, year-on-year growth in switched volumes has returned to the same level as Q4 2019 as of August.Cross-border volumes remain depressed. As shown above, excluding intra-E.U. volumes, cross-border volumes were approx. 50% lower year on year in August, while intra-E.U. cross-border volumes showed a small improvement.The weakness in cross-border volumes was mainly due to weak Card Present and Travel volumes; Card Not Present (Non-Travel) volumes have been 20% higher year on year through July and August:The volume trends above translated into Q2 2020 volume declines of 8.9% in Purchase Volume and 10.0% in Gross Dollar Volume (excluding currency):Within Q2 Purchase Volume, credit card volume was down 18.8% year on year, while debit card volume was up 8.0% (but with no adverse impact on revenues). Q2 revenues were down 17% year on year (excluding currency), primarily due to Cross-Border Volume Fees declining 52% (or by $737m):In other revenue lines, Domestic Assessments was down 8% in Q2, mostly in line with volume decline; Transaction Processing was down 6%, less than the 10% decline in the number of transactions, due to a favourable mix. Other Revenues were up 14% year on year, with 4 ppt from acquisitions and the rest from value-add services (especially Cyber Intelligence and Data & Services).Operating expenses were down 6.4% year on year in Q2, including Advertising & Marketing being down 58.7%, providing some offset to the revenue decline. However, EBIT was still down 27.9% year on year for the quarter.Adjusted EPS fell 28.1% year on year for Q2 2020 and, including Q1's decline of 2.4%, fell 13.0% year on year for H1 2020.Management did not provide any forward guidance on revenues, due to ongoing uncertainties on COVID-19 and the economy. However, currency is expected to be a 1% headwind to revenues in both Q3 and Q4 2020.Expenses are expected to be down low-single-digits, excluding acquisitions, in Q3; including acquisitions, they are expected to be up mid-single-digits. (Currency is not expected to have a material impact.)If current volume trends were to continue, we believe Q3 EBIT would be down approximately 20% year on year, due to Net Revenues being down 10%, mostly driven by Cross-Border Volume Fees being down 50%, and expenses being up 5%. (We expect Domestic Assessment revenues and Rebates & Incentives costs to be flat; Transaction Processing revenues to be up 5% and Other Revenues to be up 20%.)Other developments since Q2 2020 results included:At $331.78, on 2019 financials, MA shares are trading at a 42.1x P/E and a 2.2% Free Cash Flow (""FCF"") Yield; the Dividend Yield is 0.5% ($1.60):Despite the lower Net Income, FCF was significantly higher year on year in H1 2020, due to favourable working capital cashflows.Buybacks were restarted at end of Q2 2020, and $1.0 billion was spent to repurchase shares by July 27, with an average price of about $300.Shares have re-rated upwards significantly since we initiated our Buy rating in March 2019, when they were trading at 36.3x P/E. However, we believe the higher multiple is justified, given the ""lower for longer"" interest rates outlook and MA's unique earnings resiliency and growth.COVID-19 has resulted in an economic shock and will likely push the economy into a recession, but it has also accelerated the move to digital payments, which will benefit MA earnings. We believe MA will eventually return to the ""high teens"" EPS CAGR target it had set for 2019-21 before COVID-19:MA has a track record of achieving a high-teens EPS CAGR. During 2011-19, EPS CAGR was 19%, on a Net Income CAGR of 16%, with most earnings returned to shareholders in dividends and buybacks:In our illustrative return forecasts, we assume:At $331.78, with an exit price of $467.43 and dividends, we believe shares can deliver an annualised 11.6% return and a 43% total return over 3.5 years:MA card volumes are now in a ""normalization"" phase in most markets, being 4-5% higher year on year in the U.S. and flat internationally in August.However, high-margin cross-border volumes remain approx. 40% lower year on year, which means we expect Q3 EBIT to be 20% lower year on year.Before COVID-19, MA has a target for a high-teens EPS CAGR and has a track record of achieving this. COVID-19 has accelerated the move to digital payments and will likely accelerate MA's long-term earnings growth.We expect EPS to more than recover by 2021 and to grow at a mid-teens CAGR thereafter.At $331.78, the shares can deliver an annualised return of 11.6% and a total return of 43% over 3.5 years.

4350338,41961,2020-05-27T13:58:34-04:00,"Mastercard's recent operating update suggested a likely trough in business activity, with sharp improvements seen in the last few weeks.Cross border transactions is still a problem area, and may take quite some time to recover.There are many long term positives for Mastercard that are starting to emerge, which set the business up well for long term growth.","Mastercard (MA) recently reported Q1 results which were noticeably subdued compared to results in quarters gone by. The business reported revenue growth of just 5% on a currency neutral basis, well down from typical levels of mid double digit growth. While the global pandemic has taken a chunk out of Mastercard's near term growth, the business shared an important operating update recently which suggests ""green shoots"" of recovery are likely imminent.Mastercard Q2 Operating UpdateMasterCard recently shared operating metrics which hinted at a trough being seen in the declines in processing volumes, with peak declines during the week of April 14 of almost 30%. Since that time, the recovery in both the number of transactions as well as the volume of transactions processed has been quite noticeable. While processed volumes are still down in aggregate year over year, there’s been a nice recovery in overall switched volumes, with Mastercard reporting a recovery in switched volumes with declines of only 12% year-over-year most recently. In the United States, the recovery in processing volume has been even more notable, with declines in switch volume of just 6% year-over-year as of the end of the week of May 7, suggestive of a fairly remarkable consumer lead recovery.Cross-border volumes are still a major weak spot for MasterCard. While switched volumes in aggregate are recovering, cross-border volume which are significantly influenced by consumer and business international travel, are still at anemic levels. At the low point, cross-border volumes were down near 55% year-over-year. While declines appear to have stabilized and a trough reached during the week of 14 April, the recovery has been quite muted with cross-border volume still down 43% year-over-year during the week of May 7.This is particularly problematic for MasterCard given how profitable this segment is for the business. MasterCard, like Visa (V) derives high margin assessment fees on transactions that its customers undertake during international travel. These transactions have a disproportionate affect on MasterCard revenue and margin because of the fact that assessment charges can be as high as 1% of the transaction amount, or almost 4-5x the levels that MasterCard typically sees.MasterCard has approximately 30% of overall revenue coming from cross-border transactions. With many international routes having been temporarily suspended and consumers fearful of travel resumption‘s due to both health and economic reasons, this could be a segment of the business that remains depressed for an extended period of time. While I expect a recovery here to start first on the enterprise side, the large cancellation of conferences and events will also see an elongated and tepid recovery in the segment for quite some period of time.Cross border volume recovery will commence with sustained regional travel across borders in places such as Europe, Latin America and Asia. MasterCard alluded to as much in its results, noting that it was starting to see the beginnings of an increase in intra-Europe travel.While Mastercard's business is clearly still feeling the impacts of the coronavirus crisis with depressed transaction volume impacting operating results, there are a number of green shoots that can be observed in some of the operating trends that the business highlighted.The growth in 'card not present' non-travel transactions, which is largely a proxy for e-commerce and other remote transactions, saw a steep step function increase in growth, with growth almost doubling from pre crisis levels of 20% year over year to just under 40% in the last few weeks.Source: Mastercard Q2 Operating UpdateThe growth in remote transactions are significant, because Mastercard's biggest opportunity set is not necessarily taking share from other competitors such as Visa or American Express (AXP), but rather going after the still 70%+ of global consumer expenditure volume which still remains cash-based. It’s increasingly apparent that serious damage has been done to the role of cash in society as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. This can be seen on a number of fronts.Digitization of previously physical transactionsWhat’s been interesting to observe during the crisis is that many transactions which were previously in person have affectively been converted to online, a trend which will likely remain in place for some indeterminate period of time. With social distancing restrictions likely to remain default behavior for the medium term in restaurants, fearful and reluctant diners have been reverting to curbside pick up models, rather than going through the hassle of dining in. No doubt, this mode of consumption is likely to be in place for some considerable period of time until more relaxed restrictions eventually emerge. The longer-term question will become whether this creates a new permanent change in behavior for consumers.Consumers also appear to be embracing new categories of digital consumption, most notably the ordering of groceries online with delivery to the home. Similar holds true for other categories of consumption including entertainment, clothing and merchandise as evidenced from the results of businesses like Netflix (NFLX) and other online retailers.Acceleration of e-commerce penetrationThere have been reports that many consumers have stepped up or shifted the volume and spend towards e-commerce activity. In emerging markets it’s even more significant, with a significant number of consumers making their first ever e-commerce transactions. Visa recently observed that roughly 2 in 10 active Visa card holders in Latin America made their first ever e-commerce purchases. As the pandemic rages in Latin America, this is a phenomenon that will increase. Providing that experience was satisfactory, this is a shift that’s likely to remain permanent. With MasterCard having even more of its revenues coming from emerging markets than Visa, it’s likely that the pandemic will prove a major tailwind for the business and result in new 'carded' expenditure that is permanently lost to cash.Preservation of digital payment status quoOne of the other incidental benefits to MasterCard and Visa as a result of the pandemic is a likely stalling of the potentially disruptive innovation that had sprung up in the fintech ecosystem over the last few years. While MasterCard and Visa are arguably some of the hardest business is to disrupt, given the need to simultaneously convince both consumers and merchants of the need to adopt alternative payment instruments and do so at scale with an alternative solution that’s as equally secure, there were pockets of emerging activity in new fintech spaces as 'Buy Now and Pay Later' that were starting to see quite significant traction. It will be interesting to see what depressed economic conditions do to default rates and the popularity of such alternatives.Venture capital backed businesses are typically the first to experience the negative impacts of major economic distress disruption of the like that we are currently in. MasterCard was seeing increasing disruption in cross-border transactions processing with smaller competitors starting to take regional share. With the collapse of cross-border transactions generally and the consequent impact on venture funded businesses this disruption may take a hit once normal cross border transaction volume returns, after a likely extended recovery.While it clearly will take some time for Mastercard's business to fully recover from the effects of the pandemic, initial signs are encouraging and green shoots are starting to emerge. A trough in MasterCard processed volumes has been seen with steady recovery starting to occur. While a full recovery in cross-border transactions will likely take more time, there are positive signs as far as long-term consumer behavior. A digitization of previously physical transactions as well as a multi year acceleration of e-commerce trends that were present will set up MasterCard business well and ultimately enable it to play a more meaningful hand in the war on cash moving into the future."

In this regard, the outlook for Q2 could still be to the downside, in spite of encouraging Q1 results.Additionally, we see that even though gross dollar volumes grew through the first quarter, net income saw a slight drop from that of the same quarter last year:Source: MasterCard 03.31.2020 - EX-99.1 - Earnings ReleaseHowever, I continue to take the view that MasterCard remains a strong business and from that standpoint I intend on remaining long the stock.From a valuation standpoint, both MasterCard and competitor Visa (V) have shown solid long-term growth in earnings per share, with both companies trading at a similar P/E ratio.Source: ycharts.comSource: ycharts.comWith that being said, one potential concern regarding MasterCard when compared to Visa is that the former appears to have low ratio of cash and equivalents / accounts receivable when compared to Visa. This would appear to indicate that Visa has traditionally been more efficient at converting accounts receivable (money owed by debtors) into cash as compared with MasterCard.Source: ycharts.comGranted, MasterCard does not particularly have a cash flow problem and the ratios for both companies are quite respectable. That said, one would ideally like to see growth in this ratio going forward - any company would prefer to collect cash immediately as opposed to having to wait for payment - which is essentially what accounts receivable is measuring.On balance, MasterCard is a strong business in an industry that is increasingly becoming digital. Granted, macroeconomic risks going forward and competition from Visa may place downward pressure on the stock in the near-term. However, I still see the long-term outlook for the stock as being favorable and from that standpoint intend to remain long the stock going forward."
4340792,65113,2020-04-28T23:01:45-04:00,"Mastercard could see short-term downside as consumer spending dips in a recessionary environment.However, online sales remain strong and Mastercard has a strong foothold in this market.Notwithstanding some short-term downside, I take a long-term bullish view on this company.","Back in August, I had made the argument that the dip in Mastercard (MA) provided a buying opportunity. At the time, the decline in the stock appeared to be as a result of profit-taking, while gross dollar volume and earnings growth had continued to rise.Of course, this had been before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the economy was in a significantly stronger position than it is now. Mastercard did initially see a big plunge down to $200 before reverting to $245 at the time of writing.Source: investing.comIn the short to medium term, there is the possibility that the stock may stand to decline further as a result of market contagion and fears over future economic growth.With that being said, there are a number of reasons why I believe Mastercard is a business that will withstand economic pressures going forward, and for these reasons I do not intend on selling my shares any time soon.With Mastercard being a leading provider in the digital payments space, this is an industry that is only set to grow going forward – even if retail spending takes a hit in the short term. For instance, cash usage in the UK has halved during the coronavirus crisis, with many shops now refusing to accept cash and insisting on contactless payments. Mastercard is also strongly integrated with mobile payment technologies such as Apple Pay and Google Pay and stores are reportedly also seeing an increase in mobile payments.In this regard, while cash technically still remains legal tender, the immediate future could very well be one driven primarily by electronic payments as more and more stores eschew cash. This has already happened in Sweden, which is recognised as having the most cashless society in the world. Cash is still legal and in circulation but many store outlets now refuse to accept cash, making electronic payments the de facto method for purchasing goods and services. While cashless societies were always going to emerge from the rise we have been seeing in digital payments, COVID-19 will simply accelerate that process.Additionally, while this pandemic has resulted in a sharp drop in brick-and-mortar sales, online sales - which necessitate digital payments in the first instance – have been thriving.For instance, Statista reported a sharp jump in online sales to 101% for Italy during the month of March, while the UK, Italy and Germany also saw jumps to above 50%:Source: statista.comMoreover, online retail sales more generally have seen a rise by 74% in average transaction volumes – with DIY and home products seeing the largest increases. These trends are likely to outlast COVID-19, as consumers adapt to a “new normal” of electronic payments – and I anticipate that Mastercard’s gross dollar volume will ultimately see a long-term rise as a result of this trend.Looking at Mastercard’s performance more fundamentally, Mastercard’s performance was quite strong in 4Q 2019, with adjusted net revenue growing by 16% and diluted EPS growing by 26%.Source: Mastercard Incorporated Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2019 Financial ResultsGross Dollar Volume saw worldwide growth of 12%, and Switched Transactions saw growth of 19% from the same period last year.Source: Mastercard Incorporated Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2019 Financial ResultsThe growth in Switched Transactions is particularly significant, as this does not only cover growth in credit or debit card transactions, but also prepaid payments, mobile, value added services, merchant services, clearing fees, among others.In this regard, Mastercard is seeing significant growth in what can be thought of as the “automated payments” side of the market, whereby the end consumer does not directly trigger the payment in question. This is very good for Mastercard from a recurring revenue standpoint, and I anticipate that this trend will continue.Let’s take a look at EV/EBITDA for both Mastercard and competitor Visa (V).Source: ycharts.comWe can see that while the EV/EBITDA ratio for both companies has dropped significantly, it is still higher than the five-year low. While the next earnings season is likely to show a significant slowdown in revenue growth, I anticipate that Mastercard and other providers in the industry will come out as some of the lesser affected companies during this pandemic.Companies with a strong digital footprint are best equipped to survive this pandemic, and Mastercard certainly fits that bill. I mentioned previously that Mastercard is one of those companies where valuation is not as critical in judging the worthiness of the stock - this has traditionally been a strong company that has seen growth even at an expensive price. Upon evidence of a significant rebound in consumer spending, I anticipate that growth for this stock will also quickly rebound.Of course, every stock comes with risks and Mastercard is no exception. Mastercard and others in its industry traditionally face settlement risk. Unlike banks, Mastercard does not make money by lending, rather through a range of service and transaction fees from facilitating transactions between customers. However, that also means the company faces the risk of being liable for fulfilling the cost of a transaction if one party is unable to do so. While Mastercard has typically proven effective at mitigating this risk during normal economic times, a significant downturn in economic activity could mean that Mastercard is exposed to higher settlement risk as more parties start to default on transaction obligations.When looking at the company's most recent balance sheet for Q4 2019 earnings, we see that settlement due from customers for the year ended 2019 accounted for just over 17% of total current assets, so the risk is quite substantial:Source: Mastercard Incorporated Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2019 ResultsAdditionally, the company is subject to ongoing litigation regarding allegedly illegal card fees, with a £14 billion case having been launched in the UK in mid-2019. Granted, Mastercard and Visa are the two main players in this industry and wield significant market power. However, there is the possibility that costs due to litigation proceedings would add extra strain on Mastercard's finances at a time when overall consumer spending is set to decline.In my view, there will more than likely be further decline in Mastercard’s stock price owing to the current market contagion. There are risks associated with Mastercard's business model, but I ultimately see the company as having the ability to withstand these pressures longer term, even if we see declines in the short to medium term. However, this company remains fundamentally strong, and for that reason I’m staying long."
4342697,102404,2020-05-04T10:55:15-04:00,Mastercard's business will be affected by COVID-19 as well as the upcoming recession as spending will decrease.But Mastercard can profit from a potential shift in payment behavior over the long run.With an intrinsic value of $211 Mastercard remains overvalued at this point.,"This week, I will continue my series with the financial services company Mastercard (MA). You should not be surprised, that this article is very similar to the article about Visa (V), which was published last week, as the business model of both companies is very similar. It is therefore quite logical, that Mastercard is affected in a very similar way as Visa. Last week, when I published the analysis about Visa, I had to rely on preliminary data and 8-Ks, while for the Mastercard article the analysis can rest on the earnings release from last week.(Source: Pixabay)All these articles will follow the same structure and focus on four different aspects that seem to be very important right now:(Source: Author's own work)Similar to Visa, Mastercard is also generating most of its revenue by processing payments and from authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions. And as credit cards are often used when traveling abroad, Mastercard was affected already in January when Hubei went on lockdown and countries as well as companies started to suspend traveling. As a result, cross-border volume fees declined pretty early. In late February, Mastercard still expected net revenue growth of 9-10%, but with the full effects of the pandemic and the resulting lockdowns and shelter-in-place, Mastercard released an 8-K on March 24, 2020 and not only withdrew its guidance for the year, but also gave the following estimates for the first quarter:Last week, Mastercard reported a revenue of $4,009 million for the first quarter of 2020, which is still reflecting revenue growth of 3% and adjusted diluted earnings per share also increased about 3% from $1.78 a year ago to $1.83 this quarter. GAAP earnings per share decreased from $1.80 in the same quarter last year to $1.68, reflecting a decrease of 7%. The gross dollar volume was up 8% in local currency basis while the cross-border volume was down 1% in local currency basis. The number of cards still grew 5% compared to the same quarter last year and switched transactions increased 13% to 22.1 billion transactions. When looking at the different segments, only cross-border volume feeds decreased 4% compared to the same quarter last year.(Source: Mastercard Investor Presentation)When looking at the cross-border volume trends, we see that until the beginning of March, the effects of COVID-19 did not really kick in and Mastercard could still report growth. But during March the decline really set in and cross-border volume with card present declined more than 80% at the end of March and is stagnating at that level during April.The following chart is illustrating why the first quarter is not really representative - not for Mastercard, not for Visa and also not for most other companies. While in the first two weeks, the switched volume was still growing 8%, we see declines between 20% and 30% in the weeks of April.(Source: Mastercard Investor Presentation)And although it seems as if the last week of April is showing first signs of improvement again, we have to see how quickly the business will recover. The second quarter will definitely be much worse than the first quarter and in countries where economies are trying to open up again, the buying behavior is not the same as before (we can look at Austria for example). It is difficult to say if and when customers will spend money in the same way as before and at least international travel will probably take several quarters to recover and revenue from cross-border volume fees will probably also stay at a depressed level for several quarters. In the earnings call, management promised, that they will provide periodic updates on the operating metrics throughout the quarter and we will have to watch the next few weeks and months very closely.And similar to Visa's business, Mastercard will also be affected by the upcoming recession and with more than 30 million people having claimed for unemployment insurance in the last six weeks, the spending behavior of people might change. And although many millions of workers might only be furloughed and might have their jobs again in a few weeks or months from now, it seems extremely unlikely that we will see similar unemployment numbers in the next few years as before the pandemic and the resulting crisis. Millions of people without a job (not only in the United States, but in many other countries all over the world) will decrease spending and therefore have a negative effect on Mastercard's revenue in the coming quarters.We can also look at Mastercard's performance during past recessions to get a feeling of how the company might perform in the coming quarters. In case of Mastercard we can only look at one recession - the Financial Crisis - as Mastercard went public in 2006 and we don't have numbers from the years before. When looking at the years during the last recession, we can see that Mastercard was able to increase its revenue every single year. In 2009, revenue grew only 2.1% YoY, but in all the other years we saw growth in the high single digits or even double digits. Net income actually declined in 2008 (it was even negative), but in all the other years, net income could increase and in 2009 net income was higher once again than in 2007. The reason for the negative numbers in 2008 was a $2.5 billion litigation settlement and when not including these expenses, Mastercard would also have increased its net income in 2008 as in all the other years.Like with all the other companies before, we also have to look at the company's financial health as in times of declining revenue and liquidity drying up, the company's balance sheet becomes especially important. On March 31, 2020, Mastercard had $10,207 million in cash and cash equivalents and $477 million in short-term investments. Even if revenue and operating income should decline, we should not worry about the liquidity of Mastercard.Aside from liquidity, we also have to look at the long-term and short-term debt of Mastercard as solvency is another important aspect. On March 31, 2020, Mastercard had $12,466 million in long-term debt. When comparing the amount to Mastercard's equity of $5,423 million, we get a D/E ratio of 2.30, which is quite high. Nevertheless, we should not worry about the financial health of Mastercard as the company has enough cash on it balance sheet to repay a huge part of its debt. And when considering the annual operating income ($9.7 billion in 2019), it would take less than one and a half years to repay the outstanding debt and therefore we must not worry about the debt levels.(Source: Mastercard 10-K)When we are looking at the debt levels that are due in the next few years, we should also not worry as Mastercard has to repay only $650 million in 2021 and $785 million in 2022 (no debt has to be repaid in 2020 and 2023). And finally, Mastercard has also announced, that it has temporarily suspended its 2020 share repurchase activity with $6.9 billion remaining under current repurchase program authorization.Finally, we are calculating an intrinsic value for Mastercard and our assumptions for future cash flows will be quite similar as for Visa. It sometimes seems as if Mastercard gets ascribed a higher multiple than Visa and growth expectations for Mastercard seem to be a little higher. But when looking at the past, both companies perform quite similar and it makes sense to use similar assumptions for Mastercard as for Visa. In my opinion, both companies don't have to battle each other for market share as the underlying market is still growing with a high pace and offers enough growth opportunities for both companies.When looking at the long-term performance of Mastercard since 2002 (the oldest data I could find), Mastercard could increase its revenue 13.97% on average and net income could be increased 27.78% on average during that timeframe. Free cash flow could be increased 23.03% annually on average since 2004 (I couldn't find numbers from 2002). When looking at management's own long-term revenue growth potential (before COVID-19), they see the number at least in the low double-digits.Due to the above-mentioned negative impacts from COVID-19 and the upcoming recession, I will assume a 10% decline in 2020 and free cash flow to stay at that lower level in 2021. From 2022 going forward, I will assume 11% growth till the end of the first decade and following that, 6% growth till perpetuity (the same assumptions I used in my Visa article). Using these numbers (and - as always - a 10% discount rate) leads to an intrinsic value of $211.20 for Mastercard. And - like in all other articles in this series - I will include a 20% margin of safety to reflect the high levels of uncertainty. This leads to an entry point of $168.96.Similar to Visa, Mastercard has a very stable business model and while it will be affected by COVID-19 and the shelter-in-place orders as well as the upcoming recession, we don't have to worry about Mastercard in the long run. In the meantime, Mastercard might be affected in the next two years by the decreased spending of people due to closed stores and high unemployment. When looking just at the D/E ratio, Mastercard's debt seems to be extremely high, but we also have to consider the cash and cash equivalents and the high amounts of operating income, when assessing the company's financial health and we shouldn't worry neither about liquidity nor solvency. Nevertheless, Mastercard is still overvalued right now and far away from the preferred entry point.In my article about Visa, I mentioned long-lasting shifts in the payment behavior of people, which might benefit Visa and these long-lasting shifts in payment behavior might also benefit Mastercard. This crisis could lead to more and more customers switching from hard cash to some other form of contactless payment leading to even higher growth rates in the years to come.(Source: Author's own work)Stay safe, stay healthy, don't panic!"
4343118,33291,2020-05-05T12:37:10-04:00,"With the huge economic impacts of COVID-19, the price of the stock now reflects far less than perfection.While Q1 2020 would have shown continued reliable growth, March was weak thanks to COVID-19, and Q2 will likely be the bottom in terms of volumes.Let the market come down, and take MA under $250, then do some buying.","Prepared by Tara, Senior Analyst at BAD BEAT InvestingMake no mistake, Mastercard (NYSE:MA) continues to deliver solid performance, and in our opinion, this stock remains a buy, especially after its sizable pullback in the COVID-19 crisis. Sure, there will be reduced volumes, less consumer spending, and a slowdown in growth in the next two quarters. The market priced that in with a 100-point drop from the top. Recently, shares started rebounding with the broader market. We think the market is set to continue pulling back in the coming weeks and if you can get into shares under $250, it makes for a solid long-term investment.Yes, right now, it is painful relative to the growth path the stock and company were on. Yes, valuation-wise, the stock has long been overvalued, but that valuation has come in lower, particularly if we 'exclude' the earnings impacts over the next few quarters and look to 2021. On the next big pullback, we think this stock still makes an excellent addition to any portfolio focused on growth. Of course, it must be stated that the name has been priced for continued near-perfect performance of the underlying company.As we will see in a moment, with the huge economic impacts of COVID-19, the price of the stock now reflects far less than perfection. Some will say, it is still overvalued. Perhaps. But let us face facts. For years, the argument of the name being overvalued has been made, but shares continue to rise. Despite the pain, we will feel economically in the next few months, maybe even a year, Mastercard as a company has continued to invest in itself.Will growth return? We believe that it is only a matter of time, and if this market does as we expect it to do, growth will return from increasing volumes as people get back to work, businesses open, and the company manages it expenses. We think, in 2021, a double-digit growth in earnings returns. Yes, pain is real right now, but we must look ahead. Mastercard is a growth machine, to continue to run higher, performance must continue. In this column, we will examine trends in sales and earnings and discuss our expectations looking ahead.Regardless of the broader market action, the data remains strong. The recently reported quarter saw top line growth, albeit lower growth than we have been accustomed to relative to past reporting periods. As you can see (and perhaps unsurprisingly), the growth has slowed versus past Q1 revenues:Source: SEC filings, graphics by BAD BEAT InvestingAs you can see from the graphic, the growth in revenues had been impressive. Here in Q1 2020, growth continued, but as we all know economic activity slowed heavily in March. Internationally, activity began slowing even earlier. We expect Q2 and Q3 will see pain as well, but think Q4 2020 and 2021 are set to see a ramp-up in activity. The results strongly suggest that the company would have easily continued its stable and reliable growth had it not been for COVID-19. And it is not the virus itself that killed growth, but the actions of the government to try and quell the spread to prevent a run on hospitals, and widespread death. A so-called 'flattening of the curve.' Net revenue for the quarter came in at $4.0 billion, a 5% increase over Q1 2019. This was primarily due to an increase in gross dollar volume and an increase in processed transactions.Mastercard saw an 8% jump in gross dollar volume, at the higher end of our wide range for COVID-19 impacted Q1 expectations for 5%-9% growth, and saw a 13% increase in transactions processed, also above our (albeit wide) expectations for 11-14% growth. The transaction growth drove the gains we saw in revenues. Now, it was not all positive. First, we had to ratchet down our expectations as COVID-19 ramped up. As we mentioned earlier, internationally, things slowed down before they did in the U.S. As such, cross-border volumes took a lump. They contracted 1%. Expect more declines in Q2. Of course, with so many more transactions processed, we need to be on the lookout for rising expenses. This is because a rise in expenses could offset revenue and pressure margins.One consideration to keep in mind is that operational expenses do continue to rise rather sharply, and in this case, offset the rising revenues. Expenses grew year-over-year vs. last year by 7% on an adjusted basis. On a currency-neutral basis, expenses were up 8%. In this quarter, the pace of revenue growth lagged the operational expense growth. It should be noted that continued investment in strategic initiatives as well as normal operational growth expenses resulted in the expense trend moving higher.Obviously, we hate to see rising expenses. Total adjusted operating expenses were $1.8 billion for several reasons, including primarily spending related to strategic initiatives, as well as higher promotional spending and of course acquisition-related integration expenses. Of the total increase, 6 points were due to acquisition-related expenses. Now, when we factor in the increase in revenues, as well as the increase in expenses, we still see that it led to operating income increasing and was flat as reported at $2.2 billion. Perhaps not surprising, adjusted operating margin contracted to 55.3% from 56.9%. With the slight revenue growth and slight margin contraction, we saw meager growth in adjusted EPS.Putting it all together, we see earnings growth. We have more transactions being processed, we have growing revenues, but narrowing margins. Again, expect Q2 to get even worse, and that is why the market has revalued the stock significantly lower. Much like the revenue trend, the EPS trend stalled in Q1:Source: SEC filings, graphics by BAD BEAT InvestingNet income was about flat at $1.8 billion versus the $1.8 billion a year ago, and hit $1.83 per share versus $1.78 per share. This result comes from higher-than-expected revenues, a slightly higher rise in expenses than expected, and the company also repurchased $1.4 billion worth of stock in the quarter (4.7 million shares). As we move forward, we expect EPS growth to remain stalled in the next quarter, and likely into Q3.Make no mistake, handicapping performance in these unprecedented times is difficult, but we see reason to be hopeful for the prospects of the stock. Factoring in the trajectory of Mastercard's performance in 2019, as well as the investments the company has made strategically, we still see some growth in 2020. Ultimately, the shape and speed of the recovery will be determined by the effectiveness of policy initiatives. It is tough to forecast though.Of course, we have to consider the trends in new cards being issued, transaction volume growth, and gross dollar volume growth. We think Q2 will be the bottom, and in the call slides we saw about a 25% reduction in volume in the first few weeks of April. This is because internationally things are starting to open up. In the United States, there are plans for opening based in phases. Those phases will impact where Mastercard sees volumes. We would expect some sectors, particularly where there is demand now, like home improvement, clothing, and out to eat dining to normalize sooner than later. Then later, domestic and intra-regional travel to normalize after that. Other areas like mass entertainment and long-haul travel will probably take longer to recover. There will also be geographic variability.Based on what we are seeing to-date, we are going to make a call here on 2020 revenues coming in at $15.0-16.0 billion and earnings per share coming in at $6.00-$7.00. This is based on annual volumes increasing in the low-single digits, contraction in cross-border volumes in the single digits, and operational expenses higher in the single digits.What we are seeing in 2020 is true contraction thanks to policy decisions that simply limit commerce. Let the market come down, and take MA under $250, then do some buying.If you like the material and want to see more, scroll to the top of the article and hit ""follow."""
4340093,104579,2020-04-26T22:46:55-04:00,The recent market pullback offers investors a chance to acquire Mastercard shares.The shares trade at a higher valuation than the overall.The shares trade at a higher valuation than the overall market due to expectations for higher growth.Temporary economic weakness will be overcome and spending will once again resume to a normal pace.,"SourceThe payments processing space is a segment that benefits from strong consumer spending. Of course, during current times, there is going to be a drop in spend as consumers stay home and many stores, parks, and venues remain closed. While this temporary economic shutdown will negatively affect credit card processing firms, it is important to remember that it is temporary. While Mastercard's (MA) stock trades at more lofty valuations than I usually prefer as a value and income oriented investor, I believe sometimes you must pay up for growth. In the long run, the continued adoption of credit cards over cash will allow this processing giant to benefit. We take a look at the recent performance, possible expectations, the current valuation and more.Mastercard last reported earnings that were a beat on both the top and bottom lines.Source: Seeking AlphaRevenue grew 17% when accounting for currency fluctuations, a very strong number and better than Visa.Source: Earnings ReleaseIt was pointed out that 1% of this growth was due to new revenue from acquisitions. Operating expenses grew 11% year over year. The company attributed some of this to acquisitions and most of the rest to strategic initiatives. Earnings per share grew a lovely 141% when adjusted for currency fluctuations, helped in part by the tax regulation, higher revenue, and better operating margins.For the full year, the company served investors with some impressive results.Source: 10KThis is the reason the company receives a premium valuation. It continues to perform year after year and it can be expected to continue to do so. The company repurchased $6.5 billion in shares and returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. Safe to say investors can expect increasing dividends and share repurchases in the years to come as the company matures and is limited to the investments it can make due to its already dominant position.Looking ahead, Mastercard projects its compounded annual growth in earnings to be in the high teens and revenue to grow high-single digits. This should keep the stock moving forward; however, any miss on these expectations could lead to the highly valued stock to decline.It should be noted that Mastercard recently warned investors that the economic turmoil will impact full-year results.Source: Seeking AlphaDespite all the staying at home being done, the company still expects growth to be in the low single digits which is quite impressive. I would argue that some of the shift from retail store spending to online spending by nature forces consumers to use credit cards as cash can't be used. This will naturally increase business for Mastercard.Looking at the balance sheet, we see Mastercard is in a healthy financial position.Source: 10KWith $6.98 billion in cash on hand and only $8.5 billion in long-term debt, the company is in a pretty financially sound position. Because of this and its growing cash from operations, which was a lovely $8.2 billion for 2019, the company can continue to return cash to shareholders.Lastly, the company has been growing its dividend for the last 9 years at an impressive rate. While the total yield is low at less than 1%, the company has been growing the dividend at a CAGR of 25%. Despite this fast pace, it still has a payout ratio of less than 20%, meaning the dividend is safe.The industry stands to benefit as the continued adoption and rewards of credit cards increase.So below we take a look at some interesting statistics of credit cards and the difference between the U.S. and the rest of the world.Source: InfographicsInterestingly enough, a large majority of Americans already use credit cards for most of their everyday purchases. While there was still 14% of Americans using cash for everyday purchases, this is rather small compared to the rest of the world. It does offer opportunity and market share to be obtained still by the likes of Mastercard. What is more interesting is that 100% of 18-24-year old report using their debit card to make everyday purchases. This will be a trend that continues with the next generation I would presume, and should continue to help benefit processors.Now, when it comes to making larger purchases, the consumer seems to be more likely to use credit cards and/or cash. This is because they feel confident the purchase is protected with their credit card where there may be no recourse for them with cash.Source: InfographicsAs we saw earlier, it seems like a majority of Americans are purchasing items using their credit or debit card. However, when it comes to making some larger purchases, perhaps they are still using cash.According to Fortunly, there was still 12.7% of the United States GDP spent in cash. This was a total of $2.36 trillion in transactions that we know of that is still able to be obtained by payments processors. Why do so many people still use cash? If the consumer has the savings to pay for an item in cash, why not pay using a credit card which will give you essentially an interest free loan if paid in full when the bill is due? Why not try to use a credit card that offers rewards for spending? Perhaps for a discount, or some other type of saving they may receive for using cash. Or perhaps it is because when the consumer uses the credit card they tend to spend more.Source: Value PenguinIt seems like knowing one has the time to pay the bill may give them the confidence to spend more than they otherwise would. The physical recognition of handing over cash does seem to feel quite a bit more depressing than swiping a credit card, at least to me.Where does the opportunity further become enhanced? Globally of course. Two of the world's largest countries by population, India and China, have a statistically smaller percentage of people who own or use credit cards. How small? Only 20.9% of China's 1.39 billion people have credit cards and better yet only 3% of India's 1.35 billion people have credit cards according to the global economy website. Now, it is important to note that part of this is due to a large population of people in poverty. But these countries have been experiencing a surge in growth in their middle class, which of course stands to use credit cards as they become more widely accepted.This is why Mastercard continues to see its ""Rest of World"" segment grow at a faster clip than the United States. What is more intriguing is that it saw stronger international growth than domestic. This is at a time when arguably the United States is one of the few actually growing.Source: Earnings SlidesAs the company shows us above, it saw a rather healthy growth of 14% overall in spend by the international segment outpacing the U.S. segment by 5%. This could only be due to continued adoption and usage of plastic for payments. It is noteworthy that despite only having 5% of the world's population, the United States accounted for about 40% of total gross dollar transactions processed. Also, important to remember is that Mastercard has no risk in rising balances. So while consumers may start to use credit cards to finance purchases as a recession hits, the company stands to benefit from continued usage. However, a severe recession like we saw in 2008-2009 could lead to a decline in payments and thus begin to hurt Mastercard. Arguably, the recent economic shut-down was not one of natural elements and thus I expect a faster-than-normal recovery.Looking at valuation, we can see that Mastercard is trading at a higher multiple than its peers.Data by YChartsWe see from the chart above that Mastercard trades with the highest forward P/E compared to peers and the lowest yield. This would suggest the stock doesn't offer value over peers. It would also suggest perhaps looking into competitors for investment.Next, looking at the 5-year average valuation for Mastercard, we can see the stock appears moderately valued.Source: MorningstarThe shares currently trade at a higher than average P/S, but, lower than its average P/E and P/CF. They also offer a higher earnings yield than they have recently. Looking at this ratio, one would perhaps like to start a position here. There are risks due to us being uncertain how big of an economic impact the current situation will have. I would rather enter at a 15% discount to historical averages; however, investors should overlook this and realize sometimes you just have to pay up for a quality enterprise.Mastercard benefits from the adoption of plastic over cash. The recent pullback in shares may be warranted due to there being a high likelihood of a severe recession. However, I believe the recession will be brief and there will be an abundance of pent-up demand once the economy re-opens. While we have not faced such a situation in modern times, we will come out of this stronger than ever. For long-term investors, the world will continue to grow and spending will continue to increase. Credit cards continue to offer distinct advantages to cash in most cases with ever-increasing rewards. Additionally, with more and more employees being paid direct deposit, the use of debit card should continue to rise as well. Mastercard currently offers investors an opportunity to start a position at a rare discount to some historical valuation metrics."
4335468,105409,2020-04-01T11:42:09-04:00,"Mastercard, a global card provider, is currently trading 25% below its peak while the company guided that it could still grow revenues by low-single digits during the Covid-19 crisis.History has shown that after a crash, the stock tends to recover quickly.The company created a lot of shareholder value in the past with free cash flows growing by 22.3% annually over the past 12 years. I expect them to keep delivering.My DCF analysis shows that there is 44% upside at these levels. Moreover, downside risk is very limited to 6% in the mid-term.Director Uggla bought shares at $265 recently. MA is an interesting low-risk buy at these levels.","Last week, Mastercard (MA) appeared in my list with interesting insider buying activity as Director Uggla Lance Darrell Gordon purchased $265K worth of stocks. Mastercard has been on my buying list for a long time as I believe it is a wonderful company with a strong cash flow compounding story. Investors always need to keep in mind the possibility of a long-term bear market, such as the period 2007-2013. In such periods, cash flow compounders such as Mastercard will outperform strongly, which is one of the reasons why I like this stock. During market crashes such as the last month, buying these cash flow compounders is very favourable in terms of risk/return reward. In this article, I will discuss why Mastercard could be a sound investment during this crash based on its past performance, future prospects and valuation.Mastercard, a credit and debit card provider, has created significant amounts of shareholder wealth over the past years. In fact, free cash flow rose by a CAGR of 22.3% over the past 12 years, caused by strong revenue and margin growth. Its current operating margin of 57.24% is one of the highest margins of all publicly-listed companies. Interestingly, Mastercard performed very well during the financial crisis as free cash flows kept rising significantly.(Source: Robbe Delaet based on company data; 2008 margin and FCF was significantly impacted by one-time litigation costs)I believe that buying Mastercard during the 2020 crisis could be an exceptional opportunity which investors won't see for another five years because of three factors: the stock always recovers quickly from crashes, the industry is expected to grow by double digits and the stock is currently valued at below-average multiples.Quick recovery from crashesMastercard is well-known to be a steady growth stock. However, during market crashes, the stock tends to drop significantly and recover quickly. During the financial crisis, the stock dropped by 51% (still significantly better than the market) and recovered in two and a half years, while the S&P 500 needed more than six years to reach new highs. During the 2018 correction, the stock dropped significantly as well but reached new all-time highs quickly. In 2020, at its lowest point, Mastercard dropped by 41%. While I am not sure at all that there is not much worse to come, I believe that this could've been the bottom and we already commenced a new bull market with the stock. Right now, still being 26% below its recent high, I believe Mastercard is still an interesting stock to pick up for the longer term.(Source: Robbe Delaet with Tradingview.com)Future growth opportunitiesMastercard is operating in a growing market particularly supported by growth in e-commerce and electronic payments. In fact, Mordorintelligence expects the global card payment market to grow by a CAGR of 13.7% over the coming five years. Mastercard, together with Visa (V) and PayPal (PYPL), will be one of the companies on the front line to benefit from this market growth.(Source: Robbe Delaet based on Mordorintelligence; numbers in $trillion)Also, there are significant opportunities for Mastercard in the emerging markets. In fact, GDV grew by 5% more in the Rest of World compared to the US.(Source: Mastercard Q4 presentation)Meanwhile, Mastercard's operating expenses are growing at a much slower rate compared to their revenues. Consequently, margins should be able to keep rising which will put a leverage on free cash flows growth.Average valuationsCurrently, Mastercard's valuation is wandering around its 5-year average. As a consequence, one could expect the stock price to follow earnings/FCF growth over the coming years. While 2020 will see a slowdown due to the coronavirus, the company will probably continue its double-digit growth trajectory afterwards. Consequently, one can expect the stock price to grow by 10-20% annually over the coming years assuming that the valuation will stay constant.Obviously, Mastercard's earnings will be affected by the COVID-19 virus as it is expected that we will fall into a worldwide recession this year. For example, McKinsey expects US GDP growth to fall by 2.4% annually. In the shorter term, consumers are spending much less. However, it is fair to assume that the e-commerce market will hold up pretty well. In contrast to many businesses, Mastercard will not be impacted by supply chain problems, which is a positive as well. Recently, Mastercard updated their Q1 2020 target, as indicated in my table. They dropped their 2020 guidance due to Coronavirus concerns. Overall, it is quite impressive if a company can keep growing revenues during this crisis, which shows the reliability of Mastercard's business model.(Source: Robbe Delaet based on company guidance; EPS growth is own estimation)Let's try to approach the fair value of Mastercard by performing a discounted cash flow (""DCF"") method, which in my opinion is the most reliable method to value Mastercard. The DCF method consists of two parts: the WACC calculation and free cash flow assumptions. Moreover, I will include a sensitivity analysis to take into account weaker than expected growth numbers as I believe that investors always need to be conservative.WACC calculationThe Weighted Average Cost of Capital or WACC is the factor to discount the expected cash flows to today. The WACC is based on the cost of capital and cost of debt (which has a very low weight for MA). My calculations show a discount factor of 7.73%, which is fair considering Mastercard's low risks.(Source: Robbe Delaet)Free cash flow assumptionsI assume that 2020 revenue growth will slow down to 4%, and will recover by 4% in 2021 and 2022 assuming that COVID-19 will put pressure on economic activity for 2 years but will slowly recover. Moreover, I expect growth to slow down again by 1% starting in 2023 (from 12% to 11% to 10%, etc.) due to the size of Mastercard, which makes it hard to keep growing at the same rate. The included long-term growth rate (to eternity) is 2.50%. Moreover, I included margin improvement of 50 bps each year starting in 2021 due to economies of scale and operational efficiencies. Mastercard has proven that it can increase margins substantially over time.(Source: Robbe Delaet)Interestingly, my conservative model shows that there is 43% upside for investors buying Mastercard at today's levels. The fair value of $362.58 is a bit higher than its all-time high achieved earlier this year.Sensitivity analysisTo analyse the investment risks, I included a sensitivity analysis. The bearish model includes slower revenue recovery from the COVID-19 crisis of only 1% annually (4% growth to 5% to 6%) compared to 4% in the base case. Moreover, the bearish model assumes that in the mid term, revenue growth would slow down by 1.50% annually. Interestingly, this bearish model gives only 6.47% downside risk, which is very low.(Source: Robbe Delaet)To conclude, Mastercard is a low-risk capital compounder which generated a lot of shareholder value in the past (strong growth, 22% of shares outstanding repurchased, dividend increase...). The future looks bright with many opportunities in the emerging markets and a global card payments growth of 13.7% annually. History shows us that Mastercard can be volatile during a market crash, but recovers fairly quickly. Consequently, it could be interesting to pick up shares at these levels. Moreover, my DCF method shows that there is 43% upside for investors who buy this stock at the current levels. I prefer Mastercard above Visa and PayPal as this stock compares favourably based on growth and valuation combined. Moreover, Mastercard recently had some insider buying activity, which increases the potential upside based on literature."
4335518,21798,2020-04-01T16:13:17-04:00,Mastercard is likely to take a hit during the global coronavirus shutdowns.The long term still looks positive for the company as trends shift away from cash to more cashless payments.The bear market is creating an improved valuation and a better entry point for long-term positions.,"Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is likely to take a negative hit to revenue and earnings as a result of the global coronavirus (COVID-19) shutdowns. With most non-essential businesses closing temporarily, consumers will probably be spending much less than normal, especially when some consumers are not able to earn money. However, the United States is a nation of spenders. The U.S. is the largest consumer market on the planet.I don't know exactly when business activity will get back to normal. When it does, the pent-up demand for spending on vacations, dining, concerts, sporting events, appliances, electronic devices, and other consumer goods/services have a good chance of leading to economic growth again. Since digital payment transactions are expected to grow at an annual rate of 12% through 2023, Mastercard is poised to grow as we head into an economic recovery.Consumers might be using their credit/debit cards during the COVID-19 quarantine to purchase groceries, home improvement products, online purchases, and takeout orders during this time. They are also probably still paying for their subscriptions such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Disney Plus (NYSE:DIS), cable/internet services, newspapers/other publications, smartphone service, etc. that are billed by credit card.However, uncertainty remains since we don't know how many people will lose their jobs as a result of most non-essential workers ordered to stay home. Not everyone has the luxury of working from home, so there is likely to be a negative impact from the lack of economic activity and from many consumers with less ability to spend. So, Mastercard is likely to experience lower revenue than was originally expected before the Coronavirus crisis occurred.Despite the economic uncertainty for Mastercard in the short term, it is better to have a long-term perspective looking at least five years ahead. We are likely to adapt and eventually develop a vaccine and treatment for COVID-19. It may take a while before that happens, but everyone can't stay home forever. We will have to find a way to get back to our normal business routines with some extra precautionary measures in place.If anything, COVID-19 will probably accelerate the use of cashless payments over the long term.Consumers might be more inclined to use debit/credit cards in the face of virus threats. You can wipe down your phones and cards with disinfecting wipes, but you never know who handled cash and what germs on are stuck to it. Therefore, Mastercard may benefit from a long-term boost in card transactions on top of the already expected increases in cashless payments.When employment situations get back to normal, the pent-up demand from consumers has a chance of flooding the market with economic activity. Sure, there will be many who will have to get back on their feet as a result of business/job losses. However, there are also likely to be many consumers who will be ready to vacation again and make other large purchases which can be easier and more convenient to pay for with credit cards as opposed to handing over a wad of cash.Overall, Mastercard should do well over the long term even if it has to face the current uncertainty and economic slowdown from the coronavirus.The recent market plunge improved Mastercard's valuation. The forward PE dropped from the 40s down to the lower 30s. Keep in mind that this is based on analyst estimates that haven't been downgraded yet as a result of the COVID-19 business shutdowns. So, the valuation metrics could tick higher if earnings estimates are lowered.Source: YCharts.comMastercard is the type of company that tends to maintain an above-average valuation level. The S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) now has a forward PE ratio of about 16.8. So, the stock is still trading above the market's average. Investors tend to award Mastercard a higher valuation as a result of the company's double-digit earnings growth.Mastercard's expected earnings growth of 4% for 2020 has been recently lowered from 14% as a result of the shutdowns. However, when economic activity returns to normal, Mastercard is likely to thrive again to return to strong double-digit earnings growth rates. The reason for that is because the company earns fees on the transaction volume when its branded cards are used. Pent-up consumer demand is likely to lead to increased spending. So, the decline in the stock price has a good chance of creating a good buying opportunity for the long term.What makes Mastercard such a strong long-term investment are the company's high margins, returns, and strong cash flow. The company achieved an EBIDTA margin of 60% and a net income margin of 48% over the past twelve months. Mastercard had an ROIC of 44.6% and ROE of 144% over the same time period.These high margins and returns lead to strong profitability and cash flow. Mastercard had $8 billion in operating cash flow in 2019. This was a 31% increase over 2018's operating cash flow. The strong cash flow gives the company the flexibility to pay dividends, repurchase shares, pay down debt, expand existing businesses and to acquire new businesses. Combine that with above-average growth and that is what a shareholder-friendly company looks like.Mastercard has a good long-term credit rating of A+ from the S&P. The balance sheet has 1.26x more total assets than total liabilities and 1.42x more current assets than current liabilities. Although total debt is high at $9.3 billion, the company has total cash of $7.7 billion. Overall, Mastercard looks able to withstand the shock of a recession. The stock could still decline, but the company should easily remain solvent.Source: stockcharts.comMastercard's stock recently bounced higher off of an oversold condition with the RSI from the low to upper 30s on the weekly chart. This may not be the bottom for the stock or the market, but the current condition looks like a relief rally. Any positive news regarding the COVID-19 situation could prolong the rally.There still might be more downside for Mastercard's stock in the face of the COVID-19 uncertainty. However, when the crisis is over, consumers are likely to return to normal spending patterns as pent-up demand is unleashed.The shift away from cash payments to more digital payments should help Mastercard to grow over the long term. The company made a large $3.2 billion acquisition in 2019 for Nets, an account-to-account payments company. The deal is expected to close in 2020. This large acquisition demonstrates Mastercard's commitment to stay on top of new technology and trends.Nets provides Mastercard with a presence in Europe. Mastercard has plans to expand Nets into additional regions. This could help the company grow while diversifying Mastercard's sources of revenue.Once we get past the current economic slowdown, Mastercard is poised to thrive for the foreseeable future. The company has a good chance of achieving above-average growth for multiple years."
4334043,95006,2020-03-25T04:45:54-04:00,"In October 2019, I warned investors about Mastercard's high valuation and suggested a rotational strategy so that they could avoid a big drawdown.Part of that strategy suggested rotating back into Mastercard stock when it was trading near fair value for investors bullish on the company long term.In this article, I review the strategy and check to see if Mastercard stock is trading near fair value, and I'll also share my potential buy price for the stock.","For the past two years, I have been warning investors about the dangers of overvalued, high-quality stocks and sharing a long-only rotational strategy to help mitigate the dangers of these highly priced stocks. The basic idea is that when the expected 10-year forward returns of the target stocks (in this case, Mastercard (MA)) get low enough, one rotates out of the stock and into a pair of ETFs with the goal that the ETFs will be more defensive during a downturn. Then, when the price of the target stock falls more than those of the defensive ETFs, the investor who likes the target company can rotate back in and own more shares than they would have had if they just held the stock the entire time.In my October 9th, 2019, article, ""Mastercard: A 10-Year, Full-Cycle Analysis"", I made the case that Mastercard was a Sell.I tracked the results of my strategy (along with what would eventually become 42 other stocks I suggested selling due to high valuation this past year). The goal was to rotate half the funds back into Mastercard once one could achieve a 20-25% ""free share gain"" and to rotate the other half of the funds back in once the stock was trading at fair value again. (For me, fair value, in this case, was an expected 10-year CAGR of 8%.)In this article, I'm going to examine whether it is time for investors bullish on Mastercard's long-term prospects who rotated out of the stock back in October to now rotate back in.(Source)Normally, this is a fairly simple process of checking the results of the default ETFs versus the target stock, but we had a rare event take place at the end of February where it became clear we were headed for a recession. When that happens, we move all of our ""default ETF money"" into cash. I meticulously documented that in my last update article, ""Going To Cash: Rotational Strategy Update (February 2020)"". The way I'm tracking the results now that the default money has been moved to cash is to calculate the returns on a theoretical $10,000 up to the point it was moved to cash, and then to compare that cash amount (which does not grow when it is held in cash) to the theoretical growth of $10,000 kept in the target stock.In this case, when the money from SPLV and RSP was moved to cash, it would have been worth $9,741, so it would have suffered about a -3% loss over the holding period. But the primary goal of this strategy was to increase our shares in Mastercard for free, so let's see what the stock would have returned.Data by YChartsData by YChartsMastercard stock has fallen about -25% since my warning article, and a $10,000 investment would now be worth $7,485. The money that was first put in SPLV and RSP, then into cash, would now be worth $9,741. An investor who followed this strategy could now take that $9,741 and buy +30.14% more Mastercard stock than they owned back in October. In other words, an investor who owned 100 shares of Mastercard stock on October 9th, 2019, could now buy 130 shares of the stock without spending any more money. This is a little above our 20-25% ""free share gain"" goal for the first part of the strategy, and so, this part of the rotation is now complete.Mastercard now joins twelve previous ""free share gain"" winners in the series so far.The first part of the approach was to rotate back in after a 20-25% ""free share gain"" was possible. The second half of the money is to be rotated back in when the forward 10-year full-cycle CAGR estimate is near fair value at about 8%. So, next, I'm going to run what I call a ""Full-Cycle Analysis"", which is the same analysis I performed back in October that identified Mastercard's stock as being overvalued enough to sell. As part of the analysis, I calculate what I consider to be the two main drivers of future total returns: Market Sentiment returns and Business returns.In order to estimate what sort of returns we might expect over the next 10 years, let's begin by examining what return we could expect 10 years from now if the P/E multiple were to revert to its mean from the previous economic cycle. I start the previous cycle around 2008 for Mastercard because it had a couple of huge earnings growth years after the company's 2006 IPO that aren't likely to be repeated.As I write this, Mastercard's forward PE is 22.59, while its normal P/E this past cycle has been 25.87. If, over the course of the next 10 years, Mastercard's P/E were to revert to its normal 25.87 level and everything else was held equal, it would produce a 10-year CAGR of about +1.37%. (At the time of my original analysis, this return was expected to be -3.88%.)We previously examined what would happen if market sentiment reverted to the mean. This is entirely determined by the mood of the market and is quite often disconnected, or only loosely connected, to the performance of the actual business. In this section, we will examine the actual earnings of the business. The goal here is simple: We want to know how much money we would earn (expressed in the form of a CAGR %) over the course of 10 years if we bought the business at today's prices and kept all of the earnings for ourselves.There are two main components of this: the first is the earnings yield, and the second is the rate at which the earnings can be expected to grow. Let's start with the earnings yield.Data by YChartsMastercard's forward earnings yield is currently +4.33%. The way I like to think about this is, if I bought the company's whole business for $100, I would earn $4.33 per year on my investment if earnings remained the same for the next 10 years.The next step is to estimate its earnings growth during this time period. I do that by figuring out at what rate earnings grew during the last cycle and applying that rate to the next 10 years. This involves calculating the EPS growth rate since 2007, taking into account each year's EPS growth or decline, and then backing out any share buybacks that occurred over that time period (because reducing shares will increase the EPS due to fewer shares).Let's start by looking at how much shares were reduced since 2008.Data by YChartsMastercard has reduced its shares outstanding by about -23% over the course of this cycle. I'll back these out for earnings growth estimates. When I go back to 2008 through today, I get a cyclically adjusted earnings growth rate of +17.83%, which is an extremely fast growth rate.Next, I'll apply that growth rate to current earnings looking forward 10 years in order to get a final 10-year CAGR estimate. The way I think about this is, if I bought Mastercard's whole business for $100, it would pay me back $4.33 the first year, and that amount would grow at +17.83% per year for 10 years. I want to know how much money I would have in total at the end of 10 years on my $100 investment, which I calculate to be about $221.67. When I plug that growth into a CAGR calculator, that translates to a +8.29% 10-year CAGR estimate for the expected earnings returns.Potential future returns can come from two main places: market sentiment returns or earnings returns. If we assume that market sentiment reverts to the mean from the last cycle over the next 10 years, it will produce a +1.37% CAGR. If the earnings yield and growth are similar to the last cycle, the company should produce somewhere around an +8.29% 10-year CAGR. If we put the two together, we get an expected 10-year, full-cycle CAGR of +9.66%. Since this expected forward 10-year return is above 8%, Mastercard is now trading near what I consider ""fair value"", and for the purposes of this demonstration of the rotational strategy, an investor could now rotate the second half of the money back into the stock. Next, let's see how the ""fair value"" portion of the rotational strategy performed.Sometimes, the ""free share gain"" portion of the rotation and the ""fair value"" portion of the rotation meet their goals at different times, and so, the returns are different. In this case, the stock price has moved so fast, they met their goals at the same time, thus producing identical gains for both parts of the rotation at +30.14%.Mastercard will now join eleven previous rotational ""fair value"" winners.This completes the demonstration of the rotational strategy with Mastercard. The first half of the rotation gained about 30% more free shares, and the second half also gained about 30% more free shares. I have 31 additional high-quality stocks I'm still tracking, though, so we should have a fairly large sample from which to judge and analyze the strategy in the future.My basic threshold for buying a stock with a margin of safety and good forward returns is for the 10-year full-cycle CAGR to be greater than 12%. But since we are going into a recession, I have a slightly stricter standard that I apply. First, I want the business's 3-year revenues to have at least appreciated by 10%. So, let's check that first.Data by YChartsRevenue looks fine. The next thing I want is for the business earnings portion of the CAGR to be at least 9%, and I also want the P/E to be at least within 20% of the P/E during the trough of the last recession. These let me know that I'm not relying too much on future market sentiment changes for all of my potential returns, and it tries to get us at least somewhat close to the bottom in terms of P/E. (The earnings of these companies will certainly drop over the course of the next year, so using the P/E is really just a way to avoid buying way too early if the market has a history of sending the stock really low during recessions. It's not particularly good at picking exact bottoms.)The price at which Mastercard will meet all these criteria based on current forward earnings is about $162.00, but I think that price is a little too low, because the stock sold off quite deeply during the last recession (unjustifiably so, in my opinion, because I think the market was treating it like a credit company instead of a processing company). If I remove the trough P/E standard, then Mastercard would be a ""Buy"" at $176.00, and that's the price at which I would, as a value investor, be a buyer of the stock. This isn't a ""target price"" as much as it is a price that I think has a greater-than-50% chance of occurring during this downcycle.So far during this downcycle, I have purchased 31 stocks using this method, so plenty of the prices are hitting right now, but there is never any guarantee that all the stocks I'm watching will hit. I'm always trying to strike a balance between the likelihood of getting a lower price and the likelihood of the price never dropping that far, so the price above is my best attempt to find a good balance."

In line with this global trend, more and more Mastercards are being issued each year and being used more commonly for payment transactions.

More specifically, Mastercard will set up a joint venture with NetsUnion Clearing Corp., enabling the company to operate in the Chinese payment market. We expect this will enlarge Mastercard's profit potential strongly in the coming years.Mastercard is currently valued at $334 billion. The P/E ratio is at 42, while the P/S ratio is currently at 20. The market value is no lower than x69 the book value. We can dig deeper into these ratios, but the key takeaway is that the stock is priced rather expensively using the classic pricing ratios.This is what we would have expected as well, given the earnings have risen this strongly year after year and continue to do so. Combining this with a bull market in stocks in general in the past decennium, the price of Mastercard has appreciated accordingly.This price appreciation however should not suggest the stock price will stop its uptrend, as long as the strong fundamental earnings drivers will stay in place. We see no reason why Mastercard would lose its dominant position in the payments market, nor do we expect the digitalization of payments to come to an end.Combining the fundamental drivers with the current valuation of the stock, we conclude it makes sense to enter a long position in Mastercard. In the section below, we describe how to structure this deal.Opportunity: Mastercard is a fundamentally strong company and can likely continue its growth story in the coming years. This would mean the stock will continue its current price momentum and offer attractive returns to stock investors.Risk: The stock has risen already strongly and the current price ratios are rather high (e.g. a P/E ratio well above the 40 level). If markets would come down, we could expect a strong momentum stock like Mastercard to be impacted directly. For this reason, it makes sense to limit our risk on an investment in Mastercard.Proposal: Invest in a call options on Mastercard. These call options will allow the trader to benefit from a rise in the stock price of Mastercard, while the overall investment will be limited compared with an investment in common stocks.We recommend to purchase the $370 call options expiring on 21 August 2020 for $10.2. This call option will give the right to the owner to purchase 100 common stocks of Mastercard for $10.2 each with an exercise price of $370. As soon as the stock exceeds the price level of $380, the holder will make a profit (given this happens before 21 August 2020). If an investor would purchase 100 common stocks of Mastercard, this would cost $34,000 while this call option will only cost $1,020. In the table below, we compare the profit potential of this investment:Source: Created by the author with data from yahoo financeMA has seen its earnings grow strongly in the past years, together with its stock price. As the business fundamentals are all still strong and in place, we expect this fundamental growth to continue in the coming years. In order to benefit from this momentum, we would recommend initiating a long position in Mastercard call options."
4335712,105308,2020-04-02T15:11:22-04:00,"Visa and Mastercard should face minimal impact from the Covid-19 outbreak. Pricing power is impenetrable.Their business model is inflation-friendly, should it be caused by the 2.2T stimulus.Valuations are attractive, and both companies remain excellent long-term holds.","You will often see investors praising quality stocks, but argue that they are too expensive. It makes sense, after all. Exceptional companies with outstanding records of shareholder value creation are often tied to a considerable premium. From time to time, whether a recession occurs, or unforeseen circumstances take place, great opportunities arise to buy quality merchandise when it is marked down, as Warren Buffett's famous quote goes.One such example is Visa(V) and Mastercard (MA). Shares saw their price drop as much as 37% and 42%, respectively, from their earlier highs. The declines, especially for Mastercard, were more violent than the overall market, part of which could be attributed to their premium valuation at the time. In my view, while shares have rebounded from their lows, I consider both stocks to be top-quality companies, whose current discount opportunity should not be missed. With major economies around the world being shut down, consumer spending is expected to slow down over the next quarter or two significantly. Everyday transactions, like your daily coffee, should pretty much plummet. Therefore, on that part, payment processors like Visa and Mastercard should lose significant revenue amid less payment volume. On the other hand, a substantial part of that consumption shifts online, where processors still get their fees. While there is no doubt that processors' previous guidance expectations are negatively affected, there are a few positive points to consider too.1) Pricing powerOnline transactions are more profitable. Keyed-in transactions (Using your card details to purchase something online) have a higher average processing fee to account for the higher risk. Since consumers favor online shopping amid safety and government restrictions, I expect that processors will average a higher fee per transaction completed.2) InflationLast Friday afternoon, President Donald Trump signed into law a historic $2 trillion stimulus package to aid the American public and the US economy to fight the overwhelming spread of Covid-19. However, many investors and policymakers have expressed their worries. The question arises as to whether such a stimulus is ""affordable,"" and whether it will cause government debt crises and a subsequent rise in inflation. While a debt crisis would cause everyone trouble, on the inflation part, Visa and Mastercard have their investors' back covered. In fact, the duo will never be impacted negatively by inflation. On the contrary, it will expand its profitability even further, since processing fees work on a percentage basis.Finally, a less impactful but potential effect of Covid-19 is the acceleration towards a cashless society. Physical cash loses ground to digital by the day, but it still remains a considerable share of total payments volume, at around 31%. Considering increased awareness towards hygiene and being a potential virus-carrying source, consumers should further deviate from wanting to touch physical cash. That could be an additional positive long-term driver for both Visa and Mastercard.As I mentioned earlier, quality companies tend to trade at a premium, as demand for their shares remains strong. Visa and Mastercard have been no different. However, at their current valuations, they present an excellent long-term growth opportunity. Their current P/E ratios (Last Twelve Months) are 29.8 and 31.7 and respectively. Let's consider Mastercard's updated guidance, for example. The company sees Q1 revenue growth in low single digits and a currency headwind impact at ~2%. Considering a low single-digit growth rate for this quarter, overall revenue growth for the year could still account for the north of 5%. Moreover, profitability should remain intact, as the company doesn't need to take action (e.g., advertising) to fuel growth later on. The same should apply for Visa as well. Personally, I don't see how a year of slightly less revenue growth justifies such a violent price drop. Therefore I see both companies trading at a significant discount at FPE of ~30, considering their well-known long-term growth prospects and impenetrable moat.Finally, the price decline may even turn out to be beneficial for long-term shareholders. Both Visa and Mastercard have a unique love towards share buybacks. The companies have been aggressively canceling the shares out of the market, increasing their programs annually. As you can see in the graph below, both companies have reduced their shares outstanding by more than 30% over the past ten years. If anything, this period in time should allow management teams to scoop up additional shares on the cheap, further boosting EPS, and reducing forward PEs.Innovation is at the forefront of both Visa and Mastercard. The world has changed for the better through their fast networks that have made payments fast and secure for every business around the world. However, this doesn't mean that they are not always focused on staying ahead of the competition in the fintech world. After all, since they are both used amongst the majority of electronic transactions, the synergies are flawless.Earlier this year Visa acquired Plaid for slightly more than $5.3 billion. This is the company's biggest acquisition excluding the €13B ($14B) acquisition for Visa Europe in 2015. Other recent purchases include Earthport, a cross-border payment company, Verifi, a company that helps other organizations reduce chargebacks and finally, Payworks, a company that provides gateway software for Point of Sale. The sequence of Visa's purchases reveals a similar philosophy when it comes to potential synergies. They are back-end solutions, that while most people don't know about, they are being used in our daily transactions. Plaid, for example, links the data of most of the banks and credit unions and sells to many fintech companies. Plaid's technology is used to power many well-known fintech companies in the market. Examples include Venmo (PYPL), Acorns, Trim, and Lending Club (LC), Betterment, Wealthfront. The reason I like Visa's acquisitions is that these kinds of solutions are used in the background, where Visa can build a powerful ecosystem of products to promote through its powerful brand and market leverage. Investors have been constantly discussing the idea of, say Visa purchasing Square (SQ), since it owned a small equity piece in the first place. However, Point Of Sale companies like Square, face fierce competition, since they operate on a very crowded space. Therefore Visa's choice to pursue the digital ecosystem path is, in my view, the better road towards future growth.Mastercard has followed a similar path, enriching its portfolio through a series of acquisitions. Last year alone, the company has purchased four companies, namely:Similarly to Visa, Mastercard has taken the digital path towards adding solutions for merchants and financial institutions that can unlock synergies with their processing networks. Considering their incredibly strong cash flows, I expect both companies to continue seeking more growth avenues through purchasing other firms. Staying pure digital seems like a wise choice as well.All points considered, I believe that Visa and Mastercard are superb long-term holds that should suffer minimal impact amid Covid-19. Consumer spending is shifting towards digital in these times of self-isolation, but the two companies remain the leading processors to undertake these transactions, which can even attract higher fees. With robust pricing power and even an inflation-friendly business model, whatever shock the current outbreak may have on their income statements, should only be a temporary growth deceleration, on a much larger long-term growth story. At their current attractive valuations, I see both companies as attractive buys for investors who are willing to undertake potential short-term volatility."
4339562,105417,2020-04-23T15:38:23-04:00,"As we examine payments volume for MasterCard, we are cautious in 2020, but are more optimistic about the direction of MA shares for 2021.Our key point of caution centers around MasterCard's greater exposure to the non-US markets, particularly in the developing countries.Our thesis is Neutral for now; however, we are open to reexamining it as more information about payments volumes becomes available in the near term.","We just published an earnings preview on Visa (V) on April 22 (See Article). It's only fair that we conduct a separate analysis of MasterCard (MA), particularly, as we have stated before, the two names are associated together like conjoined twins and some investors (in our opinion, incorrectly) even depict Visa and MasterCard as a duopoly. They are, of course, in the same payments network business, competing for customers with the same investment profile. However, the two are quite different once we begin to dissect the specifics. It is these specifics that make our thesis different in the post-coronavirus world: namely, for 2020, we recommend staying on the sidelines. At the same time, we believe that MA will become much more interesting in 2021.Our thesis on MA is Neutral for now; however, if you are a long term investor, you may consider holding on to your investment over the next 12-18 months, as long as you could tolerate some unpleasant speed bumps in the months and possibly quarters to come.Below, we explain in some detail:Too Much International Exposure: Recall that nearly three quarters of MasterCard's revenue comes from abroad, with Europe having the lion's share. For years, the international component added an extra diversification edge to MasterCard, particularly when compared to Visa, where the US/International revenue spread was more around 50/50. However, in light of the coronavirus outbreak, we believe that non-US corridors are quickly becoming pockets of reduced spending. This doesn't refer to Europe as much, where some non-discretionary spending should remain solid even with the onset of a recession (as an example, Italy has gone through four recessions in the past decades, with the core non-discretionary spending patterns remaining relatively unscathed). Rather, we view developing countries in Latin America and Asia Pacific as the ones being in danger, particularly the impoverished nations, with the spending greatly reduced among customers who rely on remittances from the developed world. Our initial channel checks on Western Union (WU) and MoneyGram (MGI) indicate a drastic reduction in money transfer volumes.MasterCard's Brand Value Inferior to Visa's: Furthermore, there is an inevitable fact of brand value. MasterCard is not as well known around the world as Visa and in many instances is less popular. If you look at the map below, MasterCard's popularity is largely confined to Canada, Brazil, Australia, and isolated pockets of Europe and Africa. Visa, meanwhile, dominates throughout Europe, Asia, and Africa. Therefore, should recessionary pressures continue to mount, we see that Visa would be better positioned against MasterCard: it just has a wider outreach, plain and simple. Interestingly enough, MasterCard outreach is closer to that of American Express than to Visa's, which is a bit counterintuitive, since 1) AmEx is widely known as a card for more affluent cohorts (in recent years, AmEx has changed its marketing to include all income strata, but the old reputation is still in place) and 2) AmEx is not known for its debit products. Pricing Advantage May Turn Into Disadvantage: As MasterCard sought to lure more developing and particularly developed (there was a significant marketing in Europe) markets, its pricing became lower, on average, than Visa's. The difference, according to our estimates was in the range of 1-1.5 bps. Such small delta should not be dismissed, since it makes a huge difference when applied to trillions of annual payments volume. At present, however, we are seeing this lowered pricing as a revenue harbinger in the near term, when every incremental $50 billion in volume makes a difference.Greater Focus on Debit Puts MasterCard at a Disadvantage: MasterCard is know for greater debit card usage than Visa. However, during the coronavirus crisis, customers are more likely to rely on credit card products, since they are more prone to carry over balances (with debit product, funds are subtracted in a pay-as-you-go fashion from the linked bank account, similar to PayPal). As a result, we expect debit volumes to fall in 2020, which should hurt MasterCard more than Visa. Furthermore, most of these volumes will not be recuperated in 2021, since consumers would substitute one payment method (credit) for another (debit). Here we are once again stuck with the previous ""international"" problem, since debit usage is highly prevalent in most European corridors, Latin America, and even Asia Pacific.2021 Should Look Different for MA Shares: We do believe that much of the coronavirus-related medicine shall be taken by MasterCard in 2020, positioning it to return to previous volumes in 2021. It is important to note that we are not necessarily saying that the economic outlook will be as rosy in 2021, as it has been in 2019. However, markets are forward-looking, and if there is greater clarity around the one-two year future of payments volumes by 2021, this could be enough for MA shares to stage a comeback.As for 2020, things are likely to look bleak for the reasons we just outlined.Valuation: When we apply the P/E multiple of ~29x to our 2020 EPS estimate of $9.12, we get the target price of $264. Our thesis for MasterCard is Neutral at this point, but if things start to shift into a more positive direction over time - we may upgrade MA shares from Neutral to Buy."
4332507,92986,2020-03-17T12:39:27-04:00,"Despite Mastercard's dividend rate being well below 1.0%, I consider this a great (future) addition to my dividend portfolio.The company is rapidly raising its dividend payments in addition to maintaining a very generous buyback policy.Operating income, financial stability, and payout rates are strong and sustainable, and I expect the stock to outperform the S&P 500 on a long-term basis.","I have been looking forward to writing this article. As I have increasingly added to my dividend holdings over the past couple of weeks, it's time to discuss the lowest yielding dividend stock I have ever discussed. Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is too good to ignore. The company offers dividend investors significant upside potential to gain strong capital gains and alpha while rapidly raising its dividends. The company has solid fundamentals and will be able to improve shareholder value for years to come. In addition to that, the company is spending a fortune on buybacks in addition to its dividend payments without damaging its cash flow. This company offers everything I have been searching for, and I look forward to buying the stock at a discount.Let's start this article by mentioning that Mastercard is not a typical stock I am looking for on a long-term basis. I am, and have been, looking for stocks yielding between 2.5% and 5.0%. I have put a lot of cash to work recently after liquidating my managed portfolio at the Dutch investment provider Robeco. I wanted to get back into the market and bought stocks that have a high dividend payout rate, a stable balance sheet, a healthy (sustainable) and growing payout ratio as well as long-term sales growth potential. The overview below shows the stocks that I currently hold. Note that I added most of them last week (week 11, 2020). I will start showing my portfolio performance once I have a longer history. So far, the stocks have been in my portfolio for less than a month. Note that the stocks are also listed in my Seeking Alpha bio.The reason I try to avoid dividend stocks with a payout rate of more than 5% is because these companies are often low-growth stocks. A lot of high dividend stocks have a large market cap, low costs, and are great tools to benefit from population growth or a stable business environment. The reason I go for a lower payout rate is that I want capital gains as well. My goal is not to beat the S&P 500, but I do not want to lag the market by too much.That's why I decided to put Mastercard on my watchlist. While the stock is yielding just 0.60% right now, there are a lot of reasons why this stock is still a great long-term investment for dividend-seeking investors.The first point on my checklist is growth. Mastercard has a phenomenal track record of growing sales and levering margins to boost operating results and earnings. As you can see below, sales and operating income have been in a long, and very strong uptrend. Since 2006, sales have grown on average by more than 12% (CAGR). Operating income has improved by 21% per year. That's not a calculation error. It really is this high.Source: TIKR.comThe main reason the company was able to boost its operating performance is the beautiful trend in margins. The operating income margin has risen to 57.3% in 2019. This is up almost 100 basis points compared to 2018 and yet another improvement in a rapidly rising uptrend. As you can see, the biggest improvements were made in the years prior to 2011. This skews the annual operating income growth rate a bit. However, even if we only go back to 2011, operating income has improved by 12%.Source: TIKR.comThe company is beautifully maintaining strong earnings. For example, in the fourth quarter, net revenue improved by 16%. 13% of this was due to higher volume in domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees, transaction processing, and others. 1% of growth was provided by acquisitions. This was offset by a 1% headwind due to unfavorable currency translations. Total expenses were up by 11% and significantly underperformed top-line growth. Operational expenses were up 7%. This was mainly caused by depreciation and amortization expenses, while 4% higher costs were the result of acquisitions.As I already briefly mentioned, the stock is not known for its generous dividend payments. And that's OK. While I am writing this, the stock is yielding 0.60%. That's 150 basis points below the S&P 500 yield and 30 basis points below the 10-year government bond yield. However, the dividend growth rate has been nothing short of impressive. Since 2012, dividends per share have rallied by roughly 35% per year. Even better, until 2016, the dividend yield increased while the stock almost tripled.Source: TIKR.comNow comes the part where I tell you how much of its operating cash flow the company spends on dividends to see if it is sustainable. As you can see below, dividend payments were slightly less than 17% over the past few years. That's not impressive if you want dividends only. However, buybacks completely dwarf dividends. The company started to spend close to 80% of its operating cash flow on buybacks since 2018.Source: Author's Spreadsheets (Raw Data: SEC)In 2019, Mastercard spent $1.35 billion on dividends. That's 28% more compared to the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, buybacks accelerated by 31.7% to $6.50 billion. As you can see, these growth rates and high payout ratios are only possible as cash flow is rapidly improving. In 2019, Mastercard generated operating cash flow worth $8.2 billion. That's almost $2.0 billion higher compared to 2018. Since the end of the recession in 2009, operating cash flow has accelerated by 17.5% per year. Meanwhile, the company was able to generate positive free cash flow in all but three years in recent history.Source: TIKR.comSo far, there is overwhelming evidence that Mastercard is a go-to stock to benefit from the company's success. Higher sales equal higher operating income and higher cash flow. I'm also happy that investors do not have to tolerate elevated debt levels in exchange for buybacks and higher dividends.What good is a rising payout ratio when a company is heavily leveraging its balance sheet? Besides that I already highlighted the company's ability to sustain shareholder payout, the company is operating based on a solid balance sheet.Let's start by mentioning that liquidity has never been a concern. The company's total current assets currently cover 142% of current liabilities. Especially, the company's cash position of almost $7.0 billion is enough to cover accounts payable and accrued expenses. Unfortunately, as you can see in the graph below, the ratio of total liabilities to total assets has increased significantly. In 2010, the company's liabilities were less than 41% of total assets. This has almost doubled to 79.5%.Source: TIKR.comThe graph below shows the development of both total assets and liabilities quite well. While both assets and liabilities rallied along with the stock price, there has been a significant outperformance of total liabilities. The good news is that this level is still sustainable. Especially because the company is operating with a healthy liquidity position and is showing strong organic growth. Also, the outperformance of liabilities has slowed down significantly in 2019. It remains to be seen if assets can outperform in 2020, but I have no worries that Mastercard will be able to withstand a slowing economy.Data by YChartsThis brings me to the last part of this article.The market is currently absolutely crazy. Last week, I ended the week with a short summary including that futures were halted every single day of the week - and this was the third week after the madness started in February of this year.Source: TwitterI am convinced the market will come back in the second half of this year if Europe and the US can contain the virus. China and South Korea both have peaked and are seeing significantly lower new cases. The next few weeks will be tough for businesses of all sizes as citizens are asked to stay inside. This has already been largely priced in as the German DAX is down 33% from its all-time high. The S&P 500 was down 26% before the rally on Friday. Keep this in mind when bad economic starts to roll in.Either way, I started buying because I wanted to benefit from lower prices. A lot of shares that I bought were off more than 20% from their highs and had a good dividend yield. You will see my entries when I start publishing the performance of my holdings. Mastercard is currently down 21% from its all-time high. The P/E ratio has declined to 34. Nonetheless, the ratio between Mastercard and the S&P 500 as seen in the graph below is currently at a new all-time high.Data by YChartsMastercard is in great shape. The company has solid growth, a healthy balance sheet, rapidly rising shareholder value and is doing business in a booming industry. I will try to buy the stock below $270 as soon as possible. However, keep in mind to keep your positions small if you decide to buy shares. Volatility is very high, and economic risks are elevated. Even if all my positions go to zero, I will have enough money to cover all expenses without running into trouble. Only use the money you don't need for the next number of years as this guarantees you will be able to maintain a long-term position. In my situation, it is important to get long-term capital gains and to outperform the S&P 500. If Mastercard were to turn in an underperformer, my decision to buy a stock with a low dividend yield would have been a mistake.Either way, and regardless of your investment strategy, I want to wish everyone all the best in these difficult times.

Grupo Aeroportuario del Centro Norte (OMAB) has produced a more than 500% total return over the past eight years, for example, yet it gets minimal discussion in the growth-at-a-reasonable-price community. And, unlike the credit card companies, its EBITDA growth has actually kept up with its share price. But that's a topic for another day. The point is, I'm betting the airports (blue and yellow lines) will overtake the credit cards (green and red lines) sooner or later:Data by YChartsWhy did I pick Visa and Mastercard as my ""controversial"" example to pit the airport stocks against? The reason isn't that I think they're bad companies - far from it. But due to a decade of blistering performance, expectations are now far too high.I expect Visa and Mastercard to return orders of magnitude less over the next decade than they did over the previous one. Investors that own the credit card stocks for rapid compounding gains (think 15%/year annualized or more) should really reconsider their holdings, as a company like Mastercard is unlikely to be able to produce this again next decade.You may not realize it from hanging out here on Seeking Alpha, where stocks with higher yields often get more attention, but Mastercard and its chief rival Visa have become huge sensations in the aggressive investing category. Big dog funds from around the world have piled in to these names.On Twitter, user Bluegrass Capital compiles a list of top growth funds' holdings every quarter, using a sample of 20 of the most respected compounder-focused growth funds. Within their data set, Visa is the single most popular celebrity holding with fully 75% (15 out of 20) selected funds owning it. Mastercard is the fourth most popular holding out of all listed U.S. shares, trailing only Visa, Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) and Moody's (MCO).SourceThe number listed there is the number of these esteemed funds that hold a position out of 20 funds sampled. I'm not opposed to these sorts of hedge fund hotel stocks; they tend to have high P/E ratios, but offer correspondingly fast growth to make up for it. In fact, I have decent positions in Diageo (DEO), Brown-Forman (BF.A) (BF.B) and Roper (ROP), among others, from this list, despite many folks calling those stocks extremely overvalued.Regardless, I'm skeptical that Visa and Mastercard deserve to be so far up the list, rivaled only by Google, Amazon (AMZN) and Moody's.There's a thought-provoking quote from Scott McNealy, the former CEO of late 1990s darling Sun Microsystems. After the tech stocks crashed, McNealy famously asked investors what they were thinking to pay 10x sales for his company's stock at the peak. McNealy said:Within two years of trading at that $64 level, Sun's stock crashed back to below $10. While there is room for debate on how high is too high a price/sales ratio to pay for a high-flying company, I've always used 10x as my mental benchmark where I had better double-check my assumptions before hitting the buy button.I bring this up for two reasons. First, Visa and Mastercard sell for way more than 10x sales nowadays. And two, it ties into hedge fund manager John Hempton's discussion of Visa stock on Bloomberg's Odd Lots podcast.And since that discussion, things have gotten even crazier. Mastercard recently hit 20x sales and Visa is right behind it at 19x:Data by YChartsThis is a simply incredible chart. Since 2011, these companies' Price/Sales ratios have tripled! Remember, we're not talking share price here. This is the amount that investors will pay for each dollar of revenues from these firms, and it's tripled. That's simply insane.Normally, over time, price/sales ratios for fast-growing companies actually go down, rather than going on an exponential moonshot. For one, as your company gets much larger, there are fewer and fewer untapped markets left to enter. For another, as you get bigger, you tend to draw more competition. Fellow Seeking Alpha author Harrison Schwartz recently demonstrated some potential cracks forming in the Visa/Mastercard payments moat.I'm not sure if Schwartz' decidedly bearish take on these stocks will play out in the near-term. I do know, however, when you're paying 20x sales for something that used to sell at 6x sales, you need just about everything to go right to keep getting acceptable returns going forward.It's not just the price/sales ratio shooting up either, the companies' PE ratios have exploded as well. Yes, credit card bulls will say, the companies' profit margins have gone up. And that's true. But it's not been nearly enough to justify the share price run ups. Both stocks traded at 20x earnings as recently as 2012 and could be had at 30x during the December 2018 correction. Now Mastercard is up into the 40s and Visa isn't far behind:Data by YChartsAs my tweet from November showed, I've become increasingly skeptical on the valuation for Mastercard stock. However, it's dangerous to be bearish on something simply due to valuation. In the short-run, momentum chasing often pushes overpriced stocks to even higher levels. You need something more concrete than just a high PE or Price/Sales ratio to knock a stock down.With the corona virus, we now have that. On Monday afternoon, Mastercard shocked investors with a massive revenue warning. Mastercard started off its press release by saying that the core business is still showing strong growth as expected. But then they lowered the boom with this on the virus:Take a second to think about that. In less than one month, Mastercard is now saying that changing business conditions - primarily due to the virus - have caused a 2-3% revenue shortfall for the upcoming quarter. This should be alarming for a number of reasons, as credit card activity is a good barometer for global consumer spending, among other things.However, specifically to Mastercard, it shows how fragile the long-term bull case is at 20x sales and 40x earnings. If you assumed 15% annual revenue growth - in line with recent results - and at least flat if not rising profit margins, you'd get doubling revenues and earnings every five years.40x earnings for something growing at 15%/year is still a full and generous valuation, but you can defend it if you have a high level of conviction in the earnings growth. But now Mastercard is down to a 9-10% revenue growth rate due to the (at least so far) relatively modest corona virus. Remember that the U.S. credit card issuers do not have much of a foothold in China and have struggled to get licenses there. Thus, the actual impact of corona virus on Mastercard's business so far shouldn't be particularly pronounced, and yet here we are.A seemingly modest event (at least so far) has Mastercard's revenue growth rate down to 10% or even the high single digits. If corona virus can do that, certainly other events such as a U.S. recession, a geopolitical flare-up, a regulator hitting fees in a key market or who knows what could cause a similar dip in Mastercard's revenue growth rate.At a 9% annual growth rate, Mastercard needs eight years to double revenues and earnings (admittedly perhaps slightly less time for earnings due to the buyback). Let's fast forward to 2028. At that point, Mastercard would be selling at ~20x earnings and 10x sales (Scott McNealy's ""ridiculous"" valuation level).Are investors going to be happy if they tie up their money in Mastercard stock for eight years and get something valued at 20x earnings and 10x sales along with 0% stock price appreciation in the interim as the net result?No, of course not. And that goes back to the hedge fund hotel problem. Mastercard (and Visa) are owned by some of the most aggressive and successful mutual and hedge funds in the world. They aren't going to hold a stock for many years while its growth rate slows and the valuation ratio gradually comes back to earth. No, they're going to dump that dog the moment it starts underperforming, and you'll get a sudden rerating of the stock to the downside.I'm skeptical that corona virus will be the straw that breaks the camel's backs as far as the credit card companies go. But it's worth reflecting on your assumptions going forward if you own Mastercard stock today. Just how fast do you believe it can truly grow? If a modest virus can knock revenue growth back to the single digits, is the stock really worth 40x earnings?Sooner or later, Mastercard and Visa will drop back to 10x sales or less (they were at 6x not all that long ago, after all). It could be a bumpy ride to those more level-headed valuations. Let's hope the corona virus blows over quickly and Mastercard resumes its world-beating growth. But use this revenues warning as a red flag to reconsider your position while Mastercard is still flying high. One of the worst things in investing is to get stuck owning a growth stock as it turns into a value stock."

Adjusted EPS landed at 26% YoY Growth.With 7 acquisitions in 2019, the company broaden its offering and strengthen its position in the payment market.MasterCard launches new digital and mobile payment platforms.Geographical diversification, new products and exposure to emerging markets will provide continued high revenue growth.","Written by Edward Mwangi and Jacques GeorgetMasterCard posts a successful story of a multinational organization providing financial payment solutions with a comprehensive global spread, covering over 210 countries and territories transacting over 150 currencies.MasterCard maintains a healthy operational efficiency while providing good returns on the invested capital. The recent surge in e-commerce, an increase in financial service penetration, and the move towards cashless economies are key components in the current high price gains of the company, and according to our valuation, the stock still has some upside. However, 2019 was a great year for MasterCard, with the stock climbing 58.3% compared to a return of 29% for the S&P 500 index.The company is also outperforming its guidance estimates over the period. FY2019 earnings reports just went public. For FY2019 MasterCard outperformed both consensus and guidance estimates with net revenue growth landing at 16% on a YoY basis.Furthermore, the company's efficiency is unbridled, maintaining a minimum annual operating margin of 50% over the past eight years. Finally, in 2018 the company outperformed its 2016-2018 EPS CAGR estimates (the mid-'20s), posting CAGR of 28% for the period. For FY 2019 adjusted EPS growth remained high at 26% YoY.In 2020 we do expect revenue growth to slow down slightly. Based on the company's performance objectives for the period, Net Revenue CAGR should grow in the low-teens while maintaining a minimum annual operating margin of 50%, while we expect EPS to grow by 15%.MasterCard continues to significantly increase the number of transactions processed, cross-border volume, and cards outstanding. The company saw 20% more transactions YoY in 2018 with an accompanying increase in revenue and adjusted earnings of 16%, 23%, respectively.Cashless Payment SystemsThe war on cash is real. The move towards a cashless society in a bid for safety and convenience creates an almost unlimited opportunity for the card and digital payments business. Our view is that the move towards cashless systems provides a great market for MasterCard to capitalize on its robust networks.Currently, MasterCard maintains a competitive advantage in the payment market either through acquisitions, strategic partnerships, or its ability to leverage its capabilities in the creation of the multi-line rail network. MasterCard has built its infrastructure to create a system to integrate merchants, acquirers, and issuers along with other support for real-time account-to-account payment, bill payment technology, and business-business payments, which creates a multi-line rail network.The move towards cashless systems provides for a long runway of growth for the company, creating value for shareholders. According to a report by G4S, the British multinational security Services Company, approximately only 32% of payments in the U.S were made with cash in 2018. However, there are also opportunities in lagging regions. For instance, the report estimates that, in Europe, cash still makes up 79% of all transactions by volume. This indicates a significant area of growth for the company in Europe given its large international presence.Hence, there is readily available demand for payment networks which MasterCard offers across various forms of payment. We believe demand for MasterCard's primary offerings will continue to proliferate.E-commerceThe continued high growth in e-commerce and the improved security in handling credit/prepaid/debit cards online at websites such as Amazon provides a good source of growth for Mastercard. We expect the volume of transactions from e-commerce to increase significantly, which in turn, will increase the need for MasterCard's comprehensive payment solutions. This is simply because increases in e-commerce raise the demand for debit and credit card payments as well as mobile and digital payments. Sustained growth in e-commerce means long-term growth in payment transactions.Finally, we also expect the company to venture into new real-time payment products to capitalize on e-commerce growth.Emerging markets are another important growth catalyst for MasterCard. In emerging markets, increased mobile penetration and digital payment platforms will drive more traffic to established payment rails. For MasterCard, the effect is a growing demand for its services.Domestic and International Fee BusinessBased on the current outstanding anti-trust issues in Pan-European countries, the recent commitment to reduce transaction costs could increase the volume and amount of transactions, which should help counter any perceived decreases in revenue. Further diversification across new markets with MasterCard International will help the expansion of services.We expect the current forward-looking acquisitions and new products, such as new business to business payment services provided by the company, to increase the company positioning in the payments market. MasterCard actually made seven acquisitions in FY 2019 - the most in its history as a public company, according to Barclays analyst Ramsey El-Assal.Share buybacksThe company approved a new share repurchase program to buy back shares of its Class-A shares of $6.5 billion shortly after the exhaustion of the prior $ 4- billion program. Besides, the approach of MasterCard to increasing its dividend payments and perform share buybacks are shareholder-friendly actions, which we believe will enhance shareholder wealth. We also argue that it indicates the management confidence in the sound financial health of the company.ValuationOur expectations are based on the vital catalysts, and the historical performance of MasterCard's stock outperforms the market in the long run. MasterCard provides a simple business model that is fee-based for the transaction, which generates revenue by charging financial institutions based on the gross dollar volume of activity.MasterCard has a solid track record of dividend payouts, and thus, we find a DDM valuation suitable here. First, the dividends have been growing by an astonishing 24.22% annually in the last 5 years, from $0.47 in early 2015 to $1.39 per share in early 2020. This is worth mentioning as it, if it were to continue, would strengthen the long-term valuation of the stock.Based on the current high growth in revenues (and earnings) combined with the company's growth opportunities in emerging markets and e-commerce, we believe dividend growth will continue to come out strong. Besides, MasterCard has a relatively low payout-ratio, currently at around 15%, which means the company can boost dividends in two ways, namely by organic growth but also by increasing its payout ratio. Furthermore, current share buybacks will push the stock closer to our estimated intrinsic value.Using a dividend growth rate of 24% for the next five years, decreasing to 15% for the subsequent five years, we yield a fair value of $397.60 for the stock. We believe a long-run growth rate of 5% is possible, based on the company's possibilities in emerging countries and the related high potential GDP growth for decades ahead in these countries.It's also noteworthy that cash on hand continues to increase for the company, meaning the company's net cash flow remains strong albeit the increasing payout ratio. We, therefore, expect management to continue to increase the payout ratio in the coming years, supporting our dividend growth target of 24% 2020-2025.RiskIntensifying competition from established competitors such as VISA and a fast-paced and tech-insense payment market will continue to challenge the company. MasterCard needs to stay at the forefront of payment solutions and adapt to the ever-changing market. This is an important reason for the company to widen its real-time payment capabilities and continue its acquisition strategy.The main rival has a very similar competitive advantage, VISA, and is making strides in improving their rail networks. VISA also make acquisitions for new Fintech payment channels, which may pose a threat to MasterCard's market share.Furthermore, MasterCard operates in an industry with easy to replicate strategies that could slow growth in the longer term. Furthermore, technological advances in electronic payment systems may lead to new, competing entrants in mobile and digital payments.Finally, the company operates in a highly regulated industry where lawsuits and regulations pose significant loss contingencies for the company. For example, In the US, VISA and MasterCard just agreed to a $6.2 Billion settlement in regards to an antitrust lawsuit.Massive litigation expenses can adversely affect company performance and valuation. Litigation and regulatory costs pose a considerable risk for the company since the charges are made up of complex interactions involving significant uncertainties with unascertainable damages.There are also anti-trust concerns in the EU concerning MasterCard. To abate the EEA concerns, MasterCard has committed to reducing the inter-regional interchange fees by at least 40%.We argue that the strong revenue growth and high profit margins of MasterCard are indicative of an economic moat that the company will be able to ride on in the coming years. Based on our evaluation, we believe the company is currently undervalued and provides an excellent investment opportunity.With this said, in light of the unpredictability of antitrust issues and the intense competition, we do see a risk of slower growth in the long term. We think there is a need for MasterCard to increasingly leverage its brand in new payment platforms to enhance its value proposition and create sustainable growth for its investors."
4328045,41961,2020-02-28T04:57:05-05:00,"Mastercard recently disclosed that the coronavirus will slice 2-3% of Q1 revenue growth.Cross border transaction volume will be particularly impacted.Long-term investors shouldn’t be concerned; it's still as hard to displace Mastercard as it was last month.The long-term growth drivers for Mastercard are positive, and this latest incident may spur Mastercard to make progress in B2B payments to better diversify its business.","Mastercard (MA) arguably surprised many people (myself included) when the business disclosed that it is not immune to the impacts of broader market trends on its business, with the emerging issue of the coronavirus resulting in a reduction in guidance.The company highlighted cross-border transactions as being particularly impacted, with the impacts on cross-border flows likely to take Q1 revenue growth for Mastercard down 2-3% to 9-10% growth year on year for Q1 rather than the low teens growth which it previously forecast. Mastercard still expects annual growth to be in the low teens range providing the coronavirus impact on its business is limited to Q1 alone.On first glance, the impact on Mastercard appears particularly problematic. Cross-border transaction volume is particularly high margin for Mastercard and the business has now started to see a bounce back in volumes after a period of more muted growth. In the most recent quarter, MasterCard’s cross-border volumes were up almost 16% after a period of low teens growth. Given the high margin nature of this business, there will likely be some margin erosion that Mastercard experiences, particularly if this drags on for any length of time.If cross border volumes stay permanently down because people now suddenly have a long-term fear of travel, then this will be a more permanent impact on revenues. We also may not have seen the worst of it yet. If the virus drags on for any length of time, additional concerns for the business will be the increasing spread of the virus to other countries which is likely to impact in-store consumer spending, particularly discretionary spending.Increasing spread of the virus spreading more broadly across Asia Pacific, where Mastercard has almost 30% of revenues, may lead to a broader economic impact for the business. With South Korea and Indonesia recently reporting large clusters of cases, spending in retailers and high-end malls is likely to be significantly down. Mastercard has a particularly strong exposure to Asia in its business, more so than rival Visa (V).However, if history serves as any guide, much of this will likely rebound back once the epidemic has been contained. A large amount of the cross border volume is consumer discretionary expenditure, or more simply consumer spending on overseas travel and vacations. This volume will simply be deferred and will rebound once the epidemic has been contained, leading to a sharp rebound in activity at the conclusion of the epidemic as consumers once again take those overseas vacations. This was a phenomenon that was also seen after the SARS outbreak. Some of this volume maybe business expenditure which is permanently lost as the need to meet in person is satisfied by virtual meetings.The unexpected uplift to Mastercard may well be a more meaningful dent on the ‘war on cash’ as a result of this epidemic. What I’m talking about here is less the images associated with the Chinese authorities incinerating large wads of cash due to fears of contamination, but rather an acceleration of the trends towards digital payments that Mastercard and Visa (V) leverage. The impact of self-imposed quarantines on large sections of populations across developed and less developed economies is likely to accelerate trends towards e-commerce that have already been in motion for the last decade. If this experience is a satisfactory one, this is likely to lead to a more permanent change in habits for consumers as far as spending patterns go. This is particularly likely in emerging economies where e-commerce is still in its infancy.While behavioral changes may have broader favorable impact in the rest of the world, the impact in mainland China is likely to be more muted for Mastercard. Mastercard and Visa are technically accepted on Alibaba (BABA) via AliPay, however Mastercard is only now readying its entry into China via a joint venture with local partners, thus lacks the issuance partners and credit card volume in the country for an uptake in e-commerce volumes to make any real dent in the Chinese market at present.Contrary to what may appear to be the case, the decline in revenue that Mastercard has signaled does not mean that Mastercard’s moat is now suddenly broken. Businesses of all shapes and sizes are indicating reductions in guidance due to the coronavirus. At the end of the day, Mastercard is a toll-taker on consumer expenditure, and will suffer reduced growth when there is a major or noticeable pullback in spending. However it remains just as hard to replace or substitute Mastercard today as it was last month. A new rival still has to build a two-sided network, at scale, across merchants and consumers simultaneously convincing both that they are solving for something consumers and merchants don’t believe is solved for, while assuring security and trust. I view this as one of the hardest execution tasks in modern commerce.What the impact of the coronavirus outbreak may do is spur Mastercard to redouble its B2B efforts to create additional revenue diversity. Mastercard has been making initial steps to further penetrate the B2B market. Part of Mastercard’s push here has been the development of a more efficient, real-time payments infrastructure for B2B payments. This initiative received a real boost from the company’s acquisition of Vocalink in 2017, which itself was a set of existing ACH rails. By being able to innovate on top of these rails for enhanced payment delivery, Mastercard likely has a better chance of success to commercialize a B2B product, and have banks use and deploy this. Mastercard aims to standardize the real-time payments process via faster authentication and reconciliation of payments. B2B payments is close to 3X Mastercard's addressable market opportunity today.Mastercard's valuation remains at the top end of the range where it has traded historically, at 35x earnings. While that is not cheap, I still don't view this as a crazy, bubble-like valuation, relative to other opportunities in the market. Low-growth businesses like Procter & Gamble (PG) and Colgate (CL), which have grown revenue at 1% annualized over 3 years both trade at 25x earnings. For a high-quality business that still has long-term growth drivers and a meaningful moat, in an environment where growth will be harder to come by, Mastercard provides security of consistent revenue growth which is increasingly rare."
4321167,105308,2020-02-04T08:37:57-05:00,"Visa and Mastercard reported promising earnings.Both firms have deep moats, outstanding margins, and a great future ahead.With no competition on sight and growth in cashless transactions, they continue to be a fantastic investment.Investors should not miss further returns and add to their positions on every dip, instead.","Both Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) reported earnings this past week, proving once again why the duopoly playmates deserve a significant position in every investor's portfolio.Source: PexelsOne of my favorite quotes from Warren Buffett is the following:Visa and Mastercard have possibly one of the most straightforward business models to operate in the market. This is not to take the slightest credit away from both management teams, who have done a phenomenal job. However, in comparison with other businesses, in which management teams face day-to-day critical decision making (e.g., Boeing (BA) or Microsoft (MSFT)), Visa and Mastercard's operations are relatively frictionless. That's where Buffett's quote comes into play, which, in my view, translates to owning businesses with relatively simple, straight-forward business models. Visa and Mastercard have one of the smoothest revenue streams and virtually operate a duopoly, with a deep moat.As a result of the deep moat the two firms have built around their sector, they have been able to consistently generate superior returns, over the past decade.Visa reported net revenues of $6.1B, an increase of 10%, while Mastercard reported $4.4 billion, an increase of 16%. The latter has been lately posting higher growth, mainly due to its exposure to untapped markets, primarily in Asia. However, both firms have shown an almost identical turnover CAGR of 10 years at 12.5% and 12.8%, respectively.Growth on contactless payments will only continue its upward trajectory over time. Consumers are unlikely to go back to using cash anytime soon. As long as the world's population is on the rise and as more places go cashless, Visa and Mastercard are positioned to benefit with little to no extra effort. What makes the service that these two firms provide so attractive, from an investor's point of view, is that it practically requires no improvement, additional investment, R&D expenses, etc. The only actual responsibility that both management teams face is to sell the service to as many institutions as possible. Once, say, a bank chooses Mastercard, the firm is set to enjoy a perpetual revenue stream that comes with every transaction fee. This is reflected in their gross margins, in which both firms report a jaw-dropping nearly 100%.  This is why I like to think of the duo as royalty companies. Their net margins have been continuously moving higher. It makes sense that, with more institutions using their network, there will be a point at which little to no growth will be available in terms of acquiring new customers. Then, whatever revenue is reported will essentially translate to earnings, in terms of their network products; hence, a ""royalty"" model.Visa and Mastercard have dramatically outperformed the market over the past five years, returning ~228% and ~305%, respectively. The outcome for such a monster performance is the ability to generate outstanding free cash flow. The solid margins mentioned is the foundation for excellent profitability, which both management teams have excellently rendered into exceptional shareholder value growth.The frequent deployment of excess cash goes towards share repurchases, which is probably the favorite way of investors for a company to return capital, for its tax efficiency and consistent open-market buying support. Over the past five years, both companies have repurchased ~14% of their shares outstanding.Moreover, while still modest in terms of yield, both firms are consistently growing their dividends, and they should inevitably be two future dividend aristocrats, considering their great cover ratio (3-4x) and earnings growth.When it comes to retirees and income-oriented investors, Visa and Mastercard may not be the most appropriate investment today, since both their yields are below 1%. However, considering their swift dividend increases, which, as you can see below, average annually between 20% and 30%, both stocks are promising future dividend growth stocks, which should generate a high yield on cost.On its earnings report, Visa guided for low double-digit revenue, which is in line with its current one. Moreover, their recent acquisition of Plaid, for more than $5.3B, should boost its growth, before it eventually falls to the high-single digits. Plaid has an account CAGR of 115% over the past four years, which should unlock synergies with Visa's network and boost turnover growth in the foreseeable future.For more information on the acquisition and its potential synergies, I suggest that you read Crispus Nyaga's very informative article.Additionally, Visa announced a new $9.5B share repurchase program, which at its current valuation, implies retiring another ~2% of its total share count. At the same time, Mastercard's running repurchase program still has ~$7.9B remaining to be completed. Share repurchases will not only boost future EPS figures but, as I have mentioned before, their open market transactions produce a slightly positive upward momentum which slowly but consistently increases the share price.For 2020, Mastercard also expects net revenue growth in the low teens and operating expense growth at the high end of high single digits, much on the same page as Visa.The title of the article ""Buy On Every Dip, Forever"" is truly how I do believe investors should be buying both stocks. While ""forever"" is indeed a bit undefined, as long there is no competition to challenge Visa and Mastercard, it only makes sense that they are ""forever"" a good buy.Payments processing is not just a service but rather a daily human interaction. When it comes to risks, for the past decade, there hasn't been a single new technology that has caused investors concerns over whether the duo will continue to dominate. Therefore, I see no risks in terms of sustainability, unless a new way of payments is introduced, which is also able to be massively adopted. Moreover, even if such a new way of payment processing is presented in the market, Visa's and Mastercard's pockets are deep enough to get into the new industry and adapt quickly. Therefore, when it comes to risks, the only concerns that investors should have, in my view, is buying at the right valuation.The reason I urge investors to initiate or add to their positions on every dip is that both firms have historically never been cheap. Many have lost their fantastic growth and stock price appreciation due to ""waiting for them to get cheaper."" It makes sense that a duopoly with a vast moat will, of course, trade at a premium. Therefore, instead of risking further potential returns, I believe that investors should not time the market and instead buy these quality companies, which allow for sleeping well at night.As you can see in the graph below, both firms have historically been trading at relatively above-average multiples, which should continue to be the case, with no competition on sight.Visa and Mastercard are trading at a forward P/E of 31 and 35, respectively. Again, while these two equities are not the cheapest in the market, they deserve their premium. Investors should pay a little more, knowing that these two best-in-breed businesses will keep compounding their portfolio with fruitful returns for years to come.Visa and Mastercard are regarded as two of the favorite stocks for many investors in general, and also here, on S.A., and that's for a good reason. The two companies have created an impenetrable fortress that doesn't allow for any competition to get in their way. In my view, both stocks should be a primary option for investors who are always ""buying the dip"" on equities. With no competition in sight, I see both stocks as a ""constant buy,"" which investors should see as an opportunity whenever they take a hit in their stock price. The valuation has always been a bit pricey, but anything of high quality usually is, and both firms are no different. Finally, going into the trouble of trying to figure out which of the two is a better holding is pointless, in my view. Not only both firms have shown outstanding historical returns, but their business model itself is strongly correlated. I firmly believe that one should hold both stocks and keep adding on every dip ""forever."""
4322974,104609,2020-02-10T22:24:05-05:00,"Mastercard and Visa have been great investments, but economic rent from oligopoly power never lasts forever.Many of Visa and Mastercard's clients (i.e., e-commerce giants and banks) are slowly building infrastructure that can eventually break their networks' dominance.The ongoing rise in anti-interchange fee regulation in Europe and elsewhere is already shaking up the industry, as recently seen in Visa's fee revamp.Between the two, Mastercard is the more overvalued, and its investors may be assuming the company will see more transaction growth than feasible.Due to technical momentum, it is probably not a great time to short Visa or Mastercard, but a long Visa-short Mastercard pairs trade has a great setup today.","(Pexels)There are few long-term price charts that are as beautiful as that of Visa (V) and Mastercard's (MA). The two payment giants have been the benefactors of low post-crisis competition in the payments space, a significant increase in non-physical cash payments, data processing innovations, the ""death of cash"", and the growth of e-commerce. In fact, if you invested $10K in Mastercard at the bottom of the financial crisis, you'd now have $220K, while you'd ""only"" have 56K if you bought SPY:Data by YChartsDespite significant returns and high valuations, the vast majority of analysts are bullish on both companies. Indeed, they both have a track record of high revenue growth and have raised profit margins to very high levels. I agree with the consensus view that e-commerce will continue to be a significant driver of revenue growth for the companies, but the bigger the pie, the more competition will come.Put simply, the long-term prospects of these companies are not as rosy as they used to be. While Newton's third law of motion does not apply to stocks, high stable margins and seemingly endless growth are likely to increase competition and could finally crack the payment industry's significant moats. In my opinion, there are three major risks that jeopardize revenue growth for Visa and Mastercard: emerging competition, increasing regulatory threats, and a likely economic slowdown.Payment companies rely on the value of their network, and Visa and Mastercard have, by far, the most integrated and extensive global payment networks, making it very difficult for competitors like Apple Pay (AAPL), PayPal (PYPL), and Alipay to gain enough network market share to be profitable if they tried to compete directly.The barriers to entry in the payments industry are immense, but technological innovation is antiquating much of the payment industry's fee structure. For example, Discover Financial Services (DFS) has no foreign transaction fees, which should attract customers (cross-border fees make up about a quarter of Mastercard's revenue), but the company has an objectively worse network (as many Discover cardholders know all too well).Because of these immense network advantages, global governments are beginning to scrutinize the industry. In the U.S., Europe, and many other places, there is rising popular pressure on breaking monopolies and oligopolies. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission recently probed Visa and Mastercard to see if some retailers are being blocked from routing digital payments over alternative debit networks like Pulse, NYCE, and Star. In Europe, the European Commission cracked down on interchange fees last year.Even more, just a few days ago, the Royal Bank of Australia called for a possible end to the automatic use of Visa and Mastercard and instead regulate that the country's own far-cheaper system ""EFTPOS"" be used.Interchange fees are charged to merchants accepting cards and are paid to banks issuing Mastercards/Visa cards. If those fees are reduced, banks will see lower profits from credit cards and likely request lower gross dollar volume fees. If governments continue to jab at the network power of these two companies, the tide may shift and finally crack the doors open to disruptors.U.S. Interchange fees are currently a $110 billion industry, and banks currently earn $52 billion in income on them, higher than the interest they charge on the underlying loans. If interchange fees drop due to competition/regulation, it will almost certainly cause banks to look to issuing their own cards similarly to Discover and Amex (AXP).Visa is fully aware of this threat and announced a complete revamp of its interchange fee structure earlier this week, noting that, “The U.S. credit interchange structure has been largely unchanged for the past 10 years.” The company plans to make interchange fees vary vendor to vendor depending on their business. This includes increased fees on e-commerce (thereby increasing the chance that Amazon (AMZN) will disrupt) and decreased fees on in-store merchants (possibly to appease small business-friendly regulators). The company plans for these changes to go into effect in April and October of 2020.Of course, there is also the digital currency disruption angle. I have my doubts that cryptocurrencies will ever be a stable store of value, but distributed networks like Ripple aim to drastically undercut traditional transaction fees. In my personal opinion, disruption won't probably won't be from any of the major cryptocurrencies today, it is only clear that the gates to do so are finally opening.One possible example is JPMorgan's (JPM) ""JPM Coin"", which is a digital coin that allows for free instantaneous payments. It is currently only a prototype, but with strong institutional backing, it could hypothetically take some of the payment industry's business.As I discussed in a recent article ""Silvergate Capital: Banking On Crypto"", the dominant bank for cryptocurrency businesses, Silvergate Capital (SI), has also developed its own free/instant institutional payment network called ""Silvergate exchange network"".For now, these networks are only in the hands of major institutions, but it goes to show that many pipes are being laid by Visa/Mastercard's own customers seemingly exploring the possibility of direct competition.I do not believe that either of the earnings of either company will take a significant hit from this threat soon - it is largely existential. That said, we must consider how much growth is priced into these stocks. If they fail to hit growth targets, significant declines could arrive.To demonstrate, take a look at the revenue growth, ""P/E"", and profit margins of each company:Data by YChartsAs you can see, both have been growing revenue at a high pace, with an average of about 11% per year. They also both maintain incredibly high profit margins of around 50% and rarely experience losses.Over the past 120 years, stocks in the S&P 500 have held a median ""P/E"" ratio of 15X, which I use as a benchmark valuation for stocks that are expected to grow revenue at GDP pace. Further, in today's frothy valuation market, companies in the S&P 500 have a median ""P/E"" of 25X. Thus, we can assume that there is about 70-200% total future discounted revenue growth baked into the valuations of these two companies.Where will this much growth come from? I believe it is fair to assume that the trend will be toward lower transaction fees due to competition between the two, and potential external disruption/regulation will slow growth. Total non-cash transactions will likely continue to climb, but that does not necessarily mean that Visa/Mastercard will maintain their moats.There are additional negative growth catalysts to keep in mind. While both market themselves as ""technology companies"", their business model is cyclical, and a decline in global retail sales brought on by a recession or the growing Coronavirus threat would hamper growth. Obviously, with margins as high as they are today, their bottom lines are unlikely to fall significantly, but their growth is likely to. Further, the impact of the Coronavirus on China's production may also eventually limit the supply of goods globally and lower/slow transactions.Between Mastercard and Visa, I believe that Mastercard is a better short opportunity due to its higher valuation, which makes its stock price more sensitive to changes in growth expectations. Mastercard's current valuation premium to Visa implies a level of revenue growth that is highly unlikely to be sustainable, and I'd bet that the valuation gap between them will close before either enters a bear market.One could even do a pairs trade on the two by short-selling Mastercard and hedging with Visa. Obviously, I'm long-term bearish on both, but both companies have very high momentum today, and there is some probability that they move parabolically higher similarly to Tesla (TSLA).As you can see in their total return ratio below, MA is at a long-term resistance level compared to V:Data by YChartsIn my opinion, the pairs trade is likely to offer much more alpha than directly short-selling Mastercard, as it largely removes the risk of a parabolic short-squeeze on either company.I'm sure many are enchanted with the tremendous growth rates of Mastercard and Visa. Indeed, that growth may not fade quite yet, but competitive and regulatory pressures seem to be growing at a much faster pace than the market expects.It is true that previous calls for ""disruption of the payments industry"" have not yet impacted their bottom line, but that does not mean they won't. Visa and Mastercard rely on extensive networks that act as a (very) significant barrier to entry. However, once the network is broken enough (be it from regulation or competition), there is a decent chance that it breaks completely. This has happened before in social media (Myspace, AOL, etc.) and in many other network-centric industries.For now, the payments oligopoly seems intact. It will require significant work on behalf of merchants and banks to create competing payment networks, but with 50%+ profit margins in the industry, the competition will come. Outside of the U.S., there is already significant pushback against fees, and I'd bet that ex. U.S. revenue will see lower-than-expected growth over the coming year.That said, contrary to the opinions of some, nothing can go up forever without significant drawdowns. For now, both are capitalizing on what is essentially economic rent generated by oligopoly power, but challengers' infrastructure is being laid, and I imagine it will crack their networks in the coming years, lowering growth expectations today.Overall, I believe that both Visa and Mastercard are ""sells"", but that it may not be a great time to short either without a hedge considering their high momentum. If I look to make the trade, it will be a long Visa-short Mastercard pairs trade, as I expect their valuation gap to close from here. Eventually, both will be great short opportunities."
4320794,33291,2020-02-02T07:07:10-05:00,"Mastercard continues to deliver solid performance.For years, the argument of the name being overvalued has been made, but shares continue to rise.You are paying for performance.A strong Q4.Our 2020 projections justify continue ownership of this great growth stock.","Make no mistake, Mastercard (NYSE:MA) continues to deliver solid performance, and in our opinion, this stock is a buy on any sizable pullback and still makes an excellent addition to any portfolio focused on growth. Of course, it must be stated that the name has been priced for continued near-perfect performance of the underlying company. Let us face facts. For years, the argument of the name being overvalued has been made, but shares continue to rise. While the overall economy and market have been strong, Mastercard as a company has continued to invest in itself. Let us be clear, you are certainly paying for performance. We reiterate this key fact because the Street has essentially priced shares for continued beats against consensus estimates. We get there through growing volumes, well-managed expenses and double-digit growth in earnings. On the bearish side of things, any real earnings missteps would send the name falling, and risks to consumer strength if they grow, could be a detriment. But as of now, Mastercard keeps delivering, and the market continues to assign a premium valuation to the name. This is evidenced by its multiple being nearly 40 times trailing earnings and 35X forward EPS.Despite the recent stalling of the stock in relation to the recent market weakness, Mastercard is a growth machine, and the stock has still more than tripled from where we recommended it at $90 a share. With the solid growth Mastercard is showing, the valuation has been justified. To continue to run higher, performance must continue. In this column, we will examine trends in sales and earnings and discuss our expectations looking ahead.Regardless of the broader market action, the data remains strong. The recently reported quarter saw another impressive top line, with solid increases in Q4 revenues over the past three years:Source: SEC filings, graphics by BAD BEAT InvestingAs you can see from the graphic, the growth in revenues is impressive. The results strongly suggest that the company will continue its stable and reliable growth. Net revenue for the quarter came in at $4.41 billion, a 16.1% increase over Q4 2018. This was primarily due to better-than-expected performance in gross dollar volume and a large increase in processed transactions.Mastercard saw a 12% jump in gross dollar volume, surpassing our expectations for 11% growth, and saw a 19% increase in transactions processed. The transaction growth drives the huge gains we saw in revenues.Not only is this growth above what we thought we might see for volumes (18-19%), but it is simply impressive for a long-standing company like Mastercard and shows the company is still executing to near perfection. In other words, the company is executing to a point where the market remains confident. Of course, with so many more transactions processed, we need to be on the lookout for rising expenses. This is because a rise in expenses could offset revenue and pressure margins.One consideration to keep in mind is that operational expenses do continue to rise rather sharply, right in line with rising revenues. Expenses grew year-over-year vs. last year by 11% on an adjusted basis. On a currency neutral basis, expenses were up just 12%. This is very well done considering the rise in revenues. What we mean is that the pace of revenue growth outpaced the operational expense growth. It should be noted that continued investment in strategic initiatives as well as normal operational growth expenses resulted in the expense trend moving higher.Obviously, we hate to see rising expenses. Total adjusted operating expenses were $2.0 billion for several reasons, including primarily spending related to strategic initiatives, as well as higher promotional spending and of course acquisition-related integration expenses. Of the total increase, 6 points were due to investments in strategic initiatives. Now, when we factor in the increase in revenues, as well as the increase in expenses, we still see that it led to operating income increasing 94% as reported. This is strong growth. Adjusted operating margin expanded to 54.4% from 52.3%. With this margin expansion, earnings per share continue to impress.Putting it all together, we see earnings growth. We have more transactions being processed, we have growing revenues, and widening margins. Tremendous. The expense growth is justified by the pace of revenue growth. This has us bullish on this pullback in the broader market, especially when we factor in the billions of shares repurchased over the years. With the continuing solid performance, we have seen a nice bump in earnings per share:Source: SEC filings, graphics by BAD BEAT InvestingThis earnings growth is clear. Every year the company has been expanding its bottom line, and meaningfully so. For this, the Street has rewarded this stock. In turn, shareholders are winning. This most recent quarter was no exception as the company saw net income widen to $2.1 billion from $0.9 billion, hitting $2.07 per share, up 138% from last year. When we adjust for this and other items, we see that the more comparable adjusted net income came in at $2.0 billion, up 23% from last year's $1.6 billion. What is more, earnings per share on an adjusted basis were up 26% to $1.96, and this surpassed our expectations for $1.90 per share in adjusted earnings. This result comes from higher-than-expected revenues, a lower-than-expected rise in expenses, and the company also repurchased $1.0 billion worth of stock in the quarter (3.6 million shares). With this established growth, we see 2020 delivering impressive continued gains over 2019.Factoring in the trajectory of Mastercard's performance in 2019, as well as the investments the company has made strategically, we see growth in 2020. Of course, we have to consider the trends in new cards being issued, transaction volume growth, and gross dollar volume growth. It is safe to say we remain bullish. Based on what we are seeing, we project 2020 revenues coming in at $19.2-19.6 billion and earnings per share coming in at $8.90-$9.10.With earnings per share growing in the high teens, the bearish pressure ways with the stock trading at 35X forward earnings. The stock like in the last few years is priced for outperformance. Therefore, for the stock to see continued rises, expect performance to register above our outlook and that of analysts. Underperformance would lead to strong selling in our opinion. With that said, we see strong performance in 2020. We think as always the company grows into its valuation. Mastercard is a buy under $300.If you like the material and want to see more, scroll to the top of the article and hit ""follow""."
4313591,102107,2019-12-23T07:00:00-05:00,"We look at the technology sector for our second year-end Marketplace Roundtable.The sector has been a leader even as the regulatory and valuation bullseye on it has grown, and our authors mostly expect that leadership to continue.They share a few favorite names and ideas, including big ones you expect and a few smaller ones you might not.","2019 finishes with an extra kick for investors. Part of that is the continued strong run of the market, erasing memories of last year's near bear market and extending the decade-long bull. There also are plenty of market headlines and events that have sprung over the end of the year, from Phase 1 trade deals to M&A to political whirlwinds and more.More trivially, the 2010s are ending and the 2020s begin. It's been quite a decade for equity investors, with the S&P 500 returning over 250% in that time. Even underperformance could leave a portfolio in good shape, and any alpha that was found would really leave investors well off.Where does that leave investors and the markets for 2020, at the start of a new decade? That's what we try to answer in our annual Marketplace Roundtable series. We are publishing roundtable discussions featuring more than 80 authors from across the spectrum of investing styles and focuses you find on Seeking Alpha: Macro to value investing, small cap to energy, gold to quant and alternative strategies, and more.Today's discussion focuses on the Tech sector, which was again a market leader. We're featuring the following panel:From Growth to Value: I think too much time and energy is wasted in trying to predict the market. You never know when investor sentiment will turn sour. The fact that this is ""the most hated bull market"" is rather a good thing. I see the constant bear market threat as insurance against irrational valuations.Some stocks that have outstanding results, raise guidance and fall nonetheless because the beats and the raise were already priced in. This is very healthy for the general market. It's only when there is exuberance and overreaction you might see a big fall in stocks. Some stock categories are richly valued but that is always the case in a bull market. As long as not all stocks are severely overvalued, the bull market may continue.Damon Verial: This bull market has been seen as one of momentum. Whenever that momentum is perceived to stop, such as last Q4 or back in August, you start to hear about the bull market ending. Recently, momentum is back up, and the fear mongering has ceased. However, the market doesn’t work as most people believe. Momentum typically is bullish but weakening right before a bear market – not negative. Hence investors should be fearful when they see positive but declining momentum in stocks – not after momentum turns negative.Integrator: I tend to focus more on high quality, secularly growing businesses so I'm less concerned about how the overall market performs but I will say that I expect to see a much stronger divergence in distribution of returns going forward with higher quality growth names continuing to provide stronger returns and lower quality names with limited growth prospects for revenue and earnings struggling to deliver satisfactory returns. As we likely enter into a cycle of more tepid economic growth, you will see a greater disparity between the ""haves"" and ""have nots."" Companies that can grow earnings will be rewarded and those that can't won't. I expect much lower overall returns for markets in 2020.Andres Cardenal: Many analysts tend to lose sight of the fact that the market is not driven by the fundamentals alone, but the fundamentals in comparison to expectations. When expectations are low and there is a healthy degree of fear in the market, it is relatively easy for the fundamentals to outperform those expectations and for stock prices to do well going forward. Bull markets are born on pessimism and die on euphoria, and we have not reached euphoria levels at this stage. This is indicating that the path of least resistance for the market is higher.Bull & Bear Trading: The recent momentum higher will usher us into 2020 with a fully valued market. Near term, the optimism of USMCA and China trade deals may fade as expectations are tempered by reality. A strong U.S. consumer may combine with better global growth for 3% GDP in the U.S next year. A historically strong labor market may be accompanied by further wage growth that could help move inflation toward the Fed's target of 2%. This economic strength means that a key bull market driver of decreasing interest rates may be absent in 2020.The changing interest rate environment may create less favorable conditions for the market. We anticipate 2020 to be a trading range market with a slight upside bias. Near term we are wary of a market correction.Elazar Advisors, LLC: The Fed is pumping money into the market like crazy. Buckle up. The key word being up.Julian Lin: The time to sell the market is when you can't find any stocks to buy. I am still finding many deeply undervalued stocks, and as a result I do not fear any market crash.Robert Castellano: Corporate earnings are rolling the game, but some sectors are overbought.Rick Pendergraft: The momentum is obviously still to the upside, but we all know the rally has to come to an end at some point. I am cautiously optimistic for 2020 with an eye on lowering equity allocations if certain technical events happen.Cestrian Capital Research: We believe the market will continue to rise, albeit punctuated by more spasms and sell-offs than has been the case over the last decade.Mark Hibben: I viewed the collapse of tech stocks, the focus of my service, in December 2018, as panic selling and I made clear that I thought it was a good time to buy. I added to my portfolio as stocks were going down. As I expected, the portfolio recovered, about doubling in value from the December lows and exceeding the high point of the portfolio total return in late August 2018. But that was then.Lately I've had the feeling that we're approaching the end of the bull market, either do to continuing trade tensions or recession, so I took profit and pared back the portfolio to key long term growth companies. In a market downturn, I'll be a buyer once again. In short, I regard an end to the bull market as a buying opportunity.Joe Albano: Most would agree you can't time the market. So why try predicting a massive correction, recession, or depression? Stick to your risk tolerance and goals. Keep cash at all times, and watch the charts. If things look like they're about to fall then situate yourself to hedge. I wrote an article this past month saying the Nasdaq could be in trouble before the year is out. And it could have been based. But the key was I didn't hedge or sell my portfolio. I just created a heads up for myself in case it happened. I circled the key levels and would begin hedging if it got there. If it didn't, then I hadn't changed course and I'm still fully invested (per my goals and cash allocation).EnerTuition: I generally focus on long-term wealth generation through individual stock picking and not the market. Having said that the market is very frothy which is understandable in the context of low interest rates. As a result of ZIRP/NIRP climate, there may be a correction but not a steep one as the money has to go somewhere.From Growth to Value: One of the great things about the stock market is that you never stop learning. There are many things I have learned about investing in 2019. One of the things I like the most is looking the competitive moat of a great company culture. That means how happy employees are but also customers. That can seem petty, but retaining or attracting top talent with little perks and a great company culture is really an advantage and it doesn't show up in the books.Damon Verial: One of my friends, an investment advisor, says that my ability to predict the market accurately comes from being a trader, not an investor. He says that traders, who make daily actions in the market, have their fingers on the market pulse and can predict the market more correctly than can investors. If this is true, then I believe earnings traders have the best pulse-monitoring ability of all traders, as it is earnings that move the market. I have found that monitoring my earnings trades’ directions has helped me in predicting future market movements - More short earnings trades implies a general overpricing in the market, more long trades implies too much pessimism in earnings estimations and a better chance for companies to surprise on the upside, moving markets higher.Integrator: The power of patience. The markets often give you what you want, you just have to be patient and disciplined enough to wait for it. I saw this illustrated really strongly in 2019. I happened to pick up some Facebook (FB) stock during the throes of the late December 2018 panic that saw this name heavily sold off. 2019 saw a return to business as usual and the name rebounded 50%. Similarly, I have had my eye on high growth SaaS business like The Trade Desk (TTD) and Avalara (AVLR) for sometime, but couldn't get my arms around the valuation. Opportunity struck in late 2019. You need to be patient to wait for quality on sale, and if you stick with high quality names long enough and can maintain patience in the face of turmoil, the market eventually rewards you.Andres Cardenal: I reaffirmed a key concept - do not fight the Fed. I was heavily hedged and even net short during the fourth quarter of 2018, mostly because the Fed was mistakenly rising rates and the economic data overseas was looking quite ugly. But then monetary policy started to pivot and markets were oversold, so we turned long in January of 2019. Even if there have been plenty of reasons for concern on the economic and political front during the year, being on the right side of liquidity trends has proven to be of utmost importance once again.Bull & Bear Trading: China's communists have learned to weaponize capitalism and have been waging economic hybrid warfare against the west for decades. Chinese state-sponsored, corporate espionage is an enormous economic threat that is growing rapidly. This trade war was launched by the Chinese against the U.S. decades ago and we are very late in responding. This trade war is very likely to escalate despite the headlines of a Phase I deal. Many Chinese companies listed on both U.S. and Chinese exchanges are not using anything close to accepted accounting practices and some companies are outright fraudulent. China's national debt is a house of cards that is unsustainable. Alarmingly, China has now begun to export its bad debt by the billions on world credit markets. Why would anyone ever believe that communists who refuse to provide transparency of their accounting would be responsible capitalists? These two differing ideologies are incompatible with starkly irreconcilable differences. A dragon cannot also be a lamb any more than a communist can also be a capitalist. The west is allowing the capitalist foundation of the global economy to be destroyed by communist China's refusal to allow transparency into their accounting at all levels. Decades of bad Chinese debt are now unsustainable so they are being exported to the west via world credit markets and the IMF, which may have become corrupted by China. Western capitalists believed that introducing capitalism into communist China would provide a more attractive ideology that all Chinese would embrace. Instead, this effort has gone very wrong with China's communists weaponizing capitalism as a means to increase their power, build a world-class military, become integral to the world's supply chain, and weaken the financial structures of global capitalism. Capitalists have created a communist economic monster that now threatens to destroy its creators.Elazar Advisors, LLC: This economy is incredibly resilient. It held up given this ridiculously annoying trade war. If this trade deal sticks I have to believe the economy can actually improve.Julian Lin: The public has a seemingly universal hate for share buybacks, but the hate confuses me. This year confirmed my belief that share buybacks are an efficient catalyst to take advantage of an underperforming stock price. We saw this with Facebook, which rebounded over 50% from its lows as it directed all of its free cash flow to buying back shares at 16-18 times trailing earnings. Identifying companies trading at a discount with a large share buyback program is a highly underrated investment strategy.Robert Castellano: A correlation of revenues and stock prices doesn't exist in 2019 nor 2018 in tech.Rick Pendergraft: I came in to 2019 expecting the market to rally in the first quarter and then hit some resistance at the long-term moving averages. The resistance never really materialized and I learned to trade what I was seeing, not what I was thinking.Cestrian Capital Research: That nothing matters!Mark Hibben: The big lesson I learned was not to adhere rigidly to the buy and hold philosophy. Not all companies can be the next Apple (AAPL). Some companies such as Nvidia (NVDA) and IPG Photonics (IPGP) became so overheated in value by mid-summer in 2018 that it would have been worthwhile to sell. The indicator for me was that the share value was far above (like 100% above) my calculated DCF fair value. Nvidia has recovered somewhat since then, and IPGP continued to decline. Neither company returned to their high valuations of 2018. I missed an opportunity to take profit in these companies. I still hold Nvidia, however, since I believe that it does represent a strong long-term growth prospect at its current valuation.Joe Albano: To stick to the data and act on your data. Sometimes it takes longer for a thesis to play out. If your goals and time horizon are long term, don't fuss about the short term. Everyone wants instant gratification but the mature investor knows if the story hasn't changed the market will come to grips with the story.EnerTuition: The ongoing lesson of the booming market is that shorting high valuation is not a great idea and even shorting junk may not be a good idea.From Growth to Value: Tech is the engine of change so, over the long term, it will do great. Some tech stocks have high valuations and a lot of growth baked in. But because of that, some investors shy away from the whole tech sector, which can create opportunities for long-term investors.I think it's always best to scale into tech stocks, as some are very volatile. Because of their often very high gross margins, tech stocks will be rewarding patient long-term investors.Sometimes stocks that need time to grow into their valuation. A great example is Square (SQ) that has not revisited its high of mid-2018. Because some very vocal investors look too much at the stock price as an indication for the underlying business, there have been a lot of negative comments about Square. That gives long-term investors a chance to scale into the stock.Damon Verial: Tech stocks have been taking three steps forward and one step back: For every three good months, expect one correction the next. In the short term, we have several warning signs pointing to a pullback in tech. Recently, I issued warnings for both Apple and Oracle (ORCL), the latter of which we aim to play over earnings. In the medium term, too, the risk/reward is not in favor of the bulls, as many companies are becoming unsustainably overpriced. In the long term, the momentum in tech should continue to hold as companies improve their products/services, the fruits of which will be seen in stronger earnings reports, thereby helping justify the increasingly high prices.Integrator: Tech is home to many long-term secular growth stories including the shift to SaaS (Software as a Service), digital advertising, digital payments and digital commerce. These themes have been playing out over the last few years, but what's less appreciated is that they still have many years to play out. That means more years of strong earnings and cash flows for businesses that have competitive positions in these spaces. I think the SaaS correction that we saw toward the end of 2019 was good for the sector. I see many of the SaaS names having a strong 2020, when investors realize just how disruptive this space will be for a long period of time.Andres Cardenal: Valuations are getting extended in technology, so investors need to be more selective in terms of stock picking in the sector going forward. Short-term pullbacks are perfectly normal and should even be expected. However, over the long term the technology sector is creating enormous amounts of value and innovation, so investors in technology stocks will probably benefit from superior returns over time.Bull & Bear Trading: The character named Old Turkey in Jesse Livermore's classic novel Reminiscences of a Stock Operator"" would remind you that, ""It's a bull market, you know."" However, we might like to inquire of Mr. Old Turkey how he feels about very mature bull markets that have the Fed punch bowl of decreasing interest rates taken away at the end of the party? Generally, the scenario of the Fed reaching the end of an interest rate reduction cycle can signal caution in the markets. We believe caution is exactly the correct posture to adopt at this time. Bullish sentiments may be tempered with caution now to protect recent gains. We expect 2020 to be a trading range market where stock pickers excel. The optimistic expectations for the China trade deal may disappoint by the realities of communist China's incalcitrant focus upon its own global ambitions. A strong labor market and economy is likely to combine for the Fed's 2% target on inflation being met. The discussion may evolve to rising interest rates.Elazar Advisors, LLC: We're looking for stocks with 45% upside potential. I think there's always those opportunities in every market, if you do the work. Fundamentals held up nicely in the face of a trade war. Pull that trade war aside for election year and it's easy to see how things can actually get better. Plus the Fed printing and pumping can't hurt.Julian Lin: Everyone - everyone - is saying that tech is in a bubble. While I agree that many firms have traded at lofty valuations at some point in 2019, I however believe that the general skepticism shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the software business model. I have written many times that the lack of profits at tech companies is more of an accounting than fundamental issue - over time, the inherent operating leverage from the software as a subscription ('SAAS') model should generate substantial operating margins. The key, of course, is correctly projecting one's ability to capture market share and the overall size of the market. The big winners in the stock market have been tech companies over the past 10 years, and I expect that to continue over the next 10 years.Rick Pendergraft: I think you have to handle it on a company-by-company basis. I try to start with companies with solid fundamentals and then try to time the entry with sentiment and technical analysis. There are certainly some companies where I think investors should be defensive and I have taken profits on some. I think software is primed to pace the gains within the tech sector in 2020 after semiconductors outpaced the sector in 2019.Cestrian Capital Research: We anticipate continued growth in the sector. Why not? The economy is strong and we are only midway through a tectonic platform shift in tech, from on-premises to cloud. That means plenty of enterprise spending still to come.Mark Hibben: I have been getting more defensive, in the sense that when there was an opportunity to take a substantial profit in a company, I went ahead and sold. If I had thought that the near term (next couple of years) offered better prospects, I might have just held.In many cases, I missed out on some profit. I sold Qualcomm (QCOM), Teradyne (TER), Lumentum (LITE), ASML Holding (ASML), and TSMC (TSM) this year. These companies subsequently rose above my selling price on trade optimism. In most cases, I realized substantial (40% or more) returns, so I'm not too concerned.Generally, these companies were trading well above fair value, as far as I was concerned, so they had become problematic to justify as holds in any case. My perception was that we're very near a high point in the tech sector, so that added to the imperative to sell. But overall, I think tech is a great sector to invest in during a downturn, and some of the companies I sold this year I expect to buy back into.Joe Albano: It's just getting started. Semiconductors are a large part of the sector and they only have just come alive at the end of 2019. Some have hit new 52-week highs while others are still working their way there. Don't discount data center giants like Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), or Facebook either though, they are coming up on refreshes of hardware and infrastructure weighted toward the latter half of the year so it may take a few months to get rolling, but I see the momentum starting and the train gaining steam now.EnerTuition: Tech has seen a huge bull run and it is difficult to find good values unless one looks at the market with the lens of ZIRP/NIRP expansion. We are not fans of low growth companies in that context.From Growth to Value: I don't follow semiconductors closely, because I think it is more or less a commoditized sector and it is very dependent on outside factors, especially the trade war and its consequences. A prime example is the Chinese announcement that all foreign PC hardware and operating systems must be removed from all state offices in the next three years.Integrator: Largely macro, but I also feel there is a secular element to this as well. The semi's power all manner of embedded systems for connected devices, and with internet of things (IoT) still in the really early stages of a long term uptrend, I think there's some thought there could be a real structural shift underlying some of this movement and its not merely just cyclical any more. Time will tell.Andres Cardenal: One of the main positive factors is that semiconductors have already been through a slowdown in demand, and many of the companies in the sector delivered superior performance than what the market was expecting. Long-term demand for semiconductors is increasing due to technological trends, and cyclicality risk is proven to be more moderate than it was in the past.Elazar Advisors, LLC: Memory prices like NAND have turned up. DRAM is bottoming. 5G and the trade war behind us can keep the party going.Julian Lin: Commentary from semiconductor management teams has indicated that the cyclical downturn is trade-war related. No one, however, can judge the extent of the downturn. I am positioned only in semiconductor companies with strong balance sheets and ample free cash flow - Texas Instruments (TXN) is a conservative pick in the sector with an A-rated balance sheet, growing dividend, and strong share repurchase program.Robert Castellano: The semi drawdowns this year are largely company dependent depending on exposure to the China trade/technology war. But it is also impacted by micro factors such as delays in Intel (INTC) chip shipments or large inventory of memory chips at Micron (MU).Rick Pendergraft: The downswings from semis were mostly tied to the trade war as so many stocks in the industry are heavily dependent on trade with China. Now that we have the first phase of the trade agreement, we shouldn't see as many wild swings from the chip sector in 2020.Cestrian Capital Research: We believe semis will move up, but remain volatile and are challenging long-term holds, if only for the psychological damage the stocks can inflict. Trading semis can offer rich rewards, however. Trade isn't a real thing. It's just a game. It will wash out in the end.Mark Hibben: I viewed the semiconductor selloffs as trade related. Any time the Chinese market for semiconductors seemed threatened by the state of the trade negotiations, semis tended to sell off. Although my portfolio has been heavily into semis, I've avoided the more cyclical semis such as memory and storage. Instead, I've focused on what I call “new paradigm” semiconductor companies that combine extensive software and hardware into integrated products. Apple is the archetypical new paradigm company. Many of the companies I held fed into the new paradigm such as Lumentum, ASML, and TSMC.The new paradigm is not cyclical in the way memory is (or can be) but it was just as sensitive to trade concerns, especially Apple, given the importance of China to Apple, and the way that Apple's China business declined starting in the December quarter of 2018.Joe Albano: Macro is only part of it. Macro was the cloud over the recovery for semiconductors. It was an added weight on the squat bar as semis tried to stand up again as OEMs digested their inventories. The cycle is now at the bottom, as seen by the upturn in NAND spot and contract pricing and the stabilized DRAM contract pricing and upturn in DRAM spot pricing. The cycles have gotten more shallow, and each wave will be higher than the last. I see more discipline by OEMs and producers on this side of the cycle, so it may be more drawn out and more stable as things move up - which is good for reducing volatility and increasing visibility.EnerTuition: As far as the whole sector is concerned, we are still at the bottom of the cycle in terms of prospects. The valuations already discount strong up tick in the sector and healthy growth for individual companies. Outside of select segments, it is not clear that the view is justified. We see signs of growth but no signs of strong widespread uptick in 2020.From Growth to Value: The fact that Uber, Lyft and WeWork fell from their pedestals is very healthy for the markets. It separates companies that are profitable or have a path to profitability from the windmakers that just trade on sentiment. These companies put on a tech cloak but they are really just in commodity businesses, where pricing power is close to zero: taxis and real estate. The fact that investors saw through the fog these companies created, makes me feel optimistic about the market as a good judge between substance and talk.Damon Verial: Right now, tech stocks show a huge split in winners/losers. The upward momentum in the Nasdaq is mostly due to the winners outpacing the losers. As for unicorns, tech IPOs usually underperform. For long positions, stick with older companies that are producing new tech instead of hopping on the bandwagon with whatever is trendy at the moment. For example, I’ve been shorting the newly listed Slack (WORK), personally, as I do not believe it will outcompete the better-funded, more-experienced Microsoft (MSFT), with its equivalent, Teams.Integrator: I really focus on technology businesses with strong competitive advantages that are profitable, or have a path to profitability, so this is less relevant to me. I don't know if this has major impacts on the sector over all, but what it will do is make investors more discerning. Quality will continue to do well, and speculative business models will get punished. A flow on effect may be to pull down valuations of some of the earlier stage tech businesses coming to market. You are already seeing a retracement in valuations in the unlisted, venture capital space. Really high-quality tech with strong earnings and reasonable valuations will continue to do well.Andres Cardenal: I think investors are smart enough to differentiate between companies with solid fundamentals versus the over-hyped IPOs, so this is not much of a risk for the strong companies in the technology sector. But I still watch the more speculative stocks in the sector only to assess risk appetite levels and to monitor bubble risk.Elazar Advisors, LLC: I was around in the dot.com bubble. I'm earnings focused so I just ignore these distractions until I have some inkling of EPS. Ultimately a stock without earnings is a hot potato.Julian Lin: Poor IPO performance, ironically, indicates a sense of rationality in the markets. At this point, however, investors may actually wish to ask - is the IPO bloodbath overdone? Are there any buying opportunities in the former bubble party?Rick Pendergraft: I think it has a minor reflection on the industry, but almost everything I write about or recommend has been around for a number of years. The analysis tools that I prefer to use aren't really suitable to stocks that haven't been around for at least a few years.Cestrian Capital Research: The collapse of unicorn hubris is a wonderful thing for investors. It will lead to more appealing IPO valuations and more sustainable value growth post-IPO. Less catastrophic but no less meaningful that the dot com collapse. Unicorns were borne of Internet 2.0. They will pass more quietly than the casualties of Internet 1.0 but will be no more mourned.Mark Hibben: I've had no interest or holdings in these types of companies. They don't matter to my portfolio at all. These companies are grossly overvalued, in my opinion.Joe Albano: I see Uber and Lyft as having other issues coming to IPO. Other than any already bloated valuation, there were headwinds with legislation and classification of drivers. It was just a not so great time to have IPO'd with those things on the radar. For the overall tech sector, it's not impactful. For every Lyft there was a Zoom. We just hear about the ""big ones"" and the rest are forgotten or never publicized extensively. The ones with good leadership and a solid product are the ones I follow closely. Zoom is an example of that as it has come down from the IPO high (pun intended). There's going to be winners in the group of the IPOs, research and patience will lead you to the right investment with them.EnerTuition: We have advocated a short in Uber and Lyft with 70% to 80% valuation correction. Most of this has played out in 2019. Given the massive overvaluations, we see correction continuing in 2020 but likely less so given the ZIRP/NIRP dynamics.From Growth to Value: There are several aspects of regulation that make me enthusiastic as an investor. First, I think that the big tech companies are even worth more if they would be split up. The sum of the parts at Amazon (AMZN) or Alphabet (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is bigger than the total. If there is a restraint on advertising power, The Trade Desk (TTD), one of the Potential Multibaggers, might benefit a lot, because it is the biggest player outside of the walled garden players like Facebook (FB) and Google.Damon Verial: Ignore the news. Focus on the products. Focus on earnings. For example, Facebook is not going to hurt in the long-run from any government pressure on what ads the company can run. Digital marketing is a rapidly growing field, and any rapidly growing field will be the talking point for politicians, who are usually just speaking for the sake of holding onto their own positions. Every company with online presence wants to advertise with Facebook, and, like with YouTube’s changes to its advertisement policies over the years, policy changes to Facebook won’t dent demand for such services.Integrator: I have some meaningful interest in large tech such as Facebook, Amazon and Google, so I'm watching developments closely. Forced divestment of acquired properties would be the most concerning to me, particularly with Facebook and Google, and would undermine their ability to provide the broad user cohort for advertisers at scale that makes them valuable franchises. I don't think this is a realistic outcome though. More likely is a more extensive disclosure regime with opt in/out notices for consumers. I don't see this having meaningful impacts on as users have generally become immune to this. Also likely is a wave of political FTC/DOJ investigations, requiring settlement, which are more a distraction rather than meaningful threat.Andres Cardenal: Chances are that the stock market is overreacting to regulatory risk. The big tech players will need to provide more guarantees in terms of data protection and antitrust compliance, but this will not impair their ability to continue producing growing sales and cash flows for shareholders. If economic history is any valid guide, regulatory uncertainty could be a source of opportunity as much as a risk factor for the sector.Elazar Advisors, LLC: You're right. This is going to be an annoyance for Facebook, Google, and Amazon, and maybe Apple. It can probably help these stocks underperform. Big government can't be good for free trade and capital returns.Julian Lin: Regulation is inevitable, but Wall Street has overestimated the potential effects on fundamentals. Facebook is trading around 24 times trailing earnings with a net cash balance sheet and 25% revenue growth. If FB was trading 50% higher then its fundamentals would still support such a stock price - the fact that shares have traded at a deeply discounted valuation for several years indicates very clearly the negative sentiment seen at mega-cap tech names. In the meantime, mega-cap tech firms continue to buy back shares at a voracious pace.Rick Pendergraft: This is certainly a talking point on the campaign trail, especially with Democratic candidates, and I do think investors need to keep an eye on certain companies. Obviously companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google are big targets and some politicians would love to make a name for themselves for helping take the monopolies down. I can definitely see more regulation toward big tech going forward, but I don't think there is enough support for major changes. One thing that could impact such regulation is whether we continue to see the strong numbers in the labor market. If the jobs numbers start to fall at all, heavier regulations on major job providers will lose their appeal very quickly.Cestrian Capital Research: We assume Amazon will be at risk, Google less so, Facebook not so much and Microsoft not at all.Mark Hibben: Much of the regulatory attention has been focused on social media companies such as Facebook (FB) for a variety of reasons. Social media appears to be easily manipulated by various malefactors spouting fake news. There are issues of competition and how the media platforms govern access. With companies like Apple, there's always going to be concern about competition, just because the company is so big. Apple has shown that it can be stupid about competition as in the e-book price fixing case. Now the main issue before Apple is the way it regulates the iOS app store and the percentage it takes from App sales (30%). Apple will probably face some regulatory push back on the app store and could see itself forced to open up iOS to apps delivered from outside the store. This would amount to legitimizing “jail breaking.” I think Apple will be able to weather whatever happens by way of regulation.Joe Albano: If anyone expects Congress to do anything other than grandstanding and smacking CEOs around, they haven't been watching C-SPAN. Now, if they were to get serious about it, exactly how would the incumbents be hurt? The only way is through telling them and forcing them not to do things with their products. Take the supposed FTC injunction reported to come against Facebook. Meddling first hand in a company's business would be the only way. But I doubt it passes judiciary muster. The market sunk FB stock on that news but has since recovered above where it was prior. Facebook has continued to bring in cash in increasing amounts throughout all of this grandstanding. This issue only slows it down temporarily but doesn't stop the cash machine. Just remember it's about image, not about justice. Equifax (EFX) still exists today.EnerTuition: This is not a threat that we play special attention to. However, of the names that we watch, Uber and Lyft have significantly more regulatory risk than others.From Growth to Value: The integration of tech and health is only starting but will probably be more talked about next year. There are a few interesting companies that try to be the first in their markets and also big tech is moving more and more into health. Apple has the lead in big tech now but if Alphabet integrates Fitbit (FIT) fluently into its ecosystem, it could catch up very quickly.Damon Verial: I don’t think Apple suing NuVia’s CEO will be a mere blip on the radar. I believe Apple will be switching to ARM-based chips for its higher-end laptops and desktops quite soon – which itself should be big news in 2020 – and the timing for the lawsuit coincides with NuVia hiring Jon Masters, the main architect for ARM for Red Hat/International Business Machines (IBM). With Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) both putting ARM development on the backburner, it would be quite a market shake-up for NuVia to go public and pose a public threat to Intel (INTC). We could also see a large movement in Softbank (OTCPK:SFTBY), which is the designer of the ARM architecture.Integrator: The role of the Internet of Things in driving digital intelligence and predictive analytics which will power a wave of digital transformation. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is certainly hitting hype cycle levels, but IoT's role in powering the wave of data that makes AI really impactful is very underappreciated, because enterprises are still figuring out what IoT means to them and how to deploy it. I think 2020 is the year where this becomes a more prevalent area of focus, and the businesses that are leveraged to this start to become noticed.Andres Cardenal: Artificial intelligence in combination with big data. We are still in the initial stages of this major game changer, and we are not even imagining the possibilities that this technological revolution will produce over the long term. Investing in companies with top AI capabilities and access to strategic and financial resources can produce outstanding gains over the long term. Alphabet is a top name in this area.Elazar Advisors, LLC: Let's talk about Splunk (SPLK) and the data boom. This is a wow story for me. Revenue growth is accelerating. Cash flow is going to triple in three years. Oh and they have EPS which I love. What's crazy about this story is that recurring revenue growth is running 50% vs. their reported revenues running 30%. There's not much reason why their overall growth rate doesn't accelerate those extra 2000 basis points. That doesn't make you giggle? It did me. I like a stock when it makes me giggle.Julian Lin: It's unfortunate, but I think the narrative in tech will remain very similar to now - people will still complain about ""egregious"" price to sales multiples and a lack of profits. It may take a generational shift of investment thinking to change such a narrative.Robert Castellano: 5GRick Pendergraft: I go back to the software industry. My investment theory has always been that the fundamentals tell us what to buy and then the sentiment and technical analysis tell us when to buy it. Right now there a number of software stocks with really strong fundamentals and now it is just a matter of trying to time the entries. Instead of lagging the tech sector, like it did in 2019, I see software leading the tech sector in 2020.Cestrian Capital Research: The Trade Desk. It's a stock which is a favorite of tech folk like ourselves, but still relatively unknown amongst normal people - despite being an $11bn EV stock.Mark Hibben: Probably the arrival of Apple's augmented reality glasses, or “smart glasses.” These will be fairly inconspicuous and resemble normal sun glasses. These will be tethered wirelessly to iPhone and provide an ultra high definition display for iPhone as well as for augmented reality content that is superimposed on the real world. The glasses will also provide a way to control iPhone using voice and hand gestures. Smart glasses will be a boost to the wearables segment for Apple, but sell in small quantities initially do to their high price. Numerous pundits will criticize them as over-priced, non-essential toys.EnerTuition: AMDFrom Growth to Value: As a long-term investor, I think that most of my Potential Multibagger stocks are still great picks, but especially The Trade Desk and Square. They are both in industries at the start of a big secular trend and they are sometimes misunderstood. For Square, investors don't realize the huge potential of Cash App yet. It's only three years old, but it is already the biggest contributor to Square's revenue, bigger than the legacy point -of -sale technology. For The Trade Desk, investors don't understand enough that CTV and audio (podcast) commercials are still in their infancy and both grow by triple digits YoY.Damon Verial: With stocks nearing all-time highs, many have asked me whether to ditch stocks for bonds in 2020. The current state of the market shows that the probability favors the bulls, while the risk-reward favors the bears. In this regard, if you’re looking for both safety and income, the dividends offered in many industries, such as consumer discretionary, outperform the expected gains from bonds. Look for low-volatility, mid-cap stocks with solid dividend histories. Take a look at the ProShares S&P Midcap 400 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (REGL) or Vanguard Consumer Discretionary Index Fund ETF (VCR) for suitable alternatives to bonds.Integrator: Mastercard (MA). I've held this name for quite a long time, but the story and prospects just keep getting better. The part of the story that is known is that this business is a powerful cash generator with exceptional barriers to entry and strong returns on invested capital that is chasing the 85% of the consumer payments expenditure market that is still dominated by cash or cheque. That's a powerful secular growth story right there.What isn't as well appreciated is that the business will be a dominant player in B2B payments in 2-3 years time, through leveraging existing assets and relationships, with an addressable market that is 2-3x the size of its current core consumer payments market. Given the dynamics of this market, I see Mastercard and Visa sharing the spoils in this space over the long haul.I like to buy and hold and compound my capital over a decade long time frame or more, so I don't just see this as just a play for 2020, but one that can be held for a multi year time frame. I expect 2020 will see the company make more significant inroads into the space and that the stock will be rewarded accordingly.Andres Cardenal: The Trade Desk. The company is a market leader in programmatic advertising and it’s benefiting from massive opportunities due to the connected TV revolution and growing demand for online music and podcasting in the years ahead.Customer retention rates are above 95%, and revenue increased 38% last quarter. The company is aggressively investing for growth, but it's already producing positive earnings and cash flows.The Trade Desk has built key alliances with leading players like Amazon (AMZN) and Disney (DIS), so the company is strategically positioned to capitalize on exponential growth opportunities in 2020 and beyond.Bull & Bear Trading: We are proud of our 8-for-8 published and documented track record of trading calls on Snap, Inc. (SNAP). We were long the momentum on Snap's IPO day in March 2017. We sold short at $28 on day 3 after the IPO. And we covered our short and went long in January 2019 at $5 per share, pretty much nailing the inflection point at the bottom of the chart.We covered our short and went long Snap when sentiment was extremely negative, a good indicator of an oversold stock. During interaction in the comments section of a Seeking Alpha article on Snap, another SA contributor guided us to a very significant item of research. It was a brief Digiday article (yeah, rather obscure but that's the point here!) discussing Snap's low-end marketplace strategy just beginning to show first signs of gaining traction. In this case it was another SA contributor that deserves the credit for uncovering this golden research who contributes to SA as True North Alger. We covered our short and established a long position.This social media alternative to Facebook has successfully implemented a low-end of market strategy that has increased their market share among advertisers. 2020 may see the company begin to expand their margins and revenues by increasing prices and gaining a larger portion of ad-spend budgets. Facebook's current challenges are well documented and the threat of anti-trust regulation against tech giants has given Snap an opportunity. Newer, more experienced management has been rescuing Snap's business model methodically for the last 18 months. 2020 may be the time for Snap to begin trading at a premium in this bull market as the company's turnaround justifies the positive sentiment that has been replacing the overly bearish sentiment of the past. Snap has transitioned from the company that Wall Street loved to hate into what may become one of the best turnaround stories in social media since Twitter's (TWTR) financial engineering to boost its own stock price. However, Snap's turnaround may prove to be more legitimately based upon actual revenue growth and the taking of market share in social media than Twitter's turnaround. This revenue growth by Snap in a growth industry is the stuff that often rewards stocks with a very aggressive premium. We anticipate all-time new highs above the $29 per share mark in 2020 for this stock currently trading at about $15.00.Elazar Advisors, LLC: Tesla (TSLA). Way too many bears and volumes and margins are about to launch.Julian Lin: Simon Property Group (SPG) is my repeat favorite idea for 2020. SPG is a real estate landlord of high quality ""Class A"" mall properties. The stock has returned -40% since 2016 vs. +40% for the S&P 500. The fundamentals however remain strong, with the company guiding for 2% comparable cash flow growth in spite of numerous retail bankruptcies. High quality malls have had no trouble finding replacement tenants for store closures, but the high concentration of store closures has made the struggles appear secular rather than cyclical. SPG has a strong balance sheet with an A-credit rating and capacity to take on more leverage. SPG pays a 5.8% dividend and is generating enough free cash flow to fund the dividend, $1 billion to $1.5 billion in anchor redevelopment projects, and buy back stock. There is blood in the streets of malls, and SPG is best of breed.Rick Pendergraft: Looking at the list of stocks that currently meet my fundamental requirements, the two sectors that are most represented are tech and financials. Within those sectors, the software industry in particular is heavily represented so I can see software being attractive this year. In the financial sector, banks are well represented on my list of stocks to watch.Cestrian Capital Research: US space and defense stocks, particularly Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Lockheed Martin (LMT). Defense spending is rising and the newly-real Space Force will bring with it the arming of space. NOC and LMT are best placed to take advantage of that trend in our view. A more volatile but equally profit-capable stock riding the same wave is Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD).Mark Hibben: The recession of 2008 and the recovery of the tech sector this past year show how durable technology companies can be in the face of an economic downturn. This is the sector to buy into during the downturn to come. It's important to be selective and focus on quality companies with real technical advantages and good bottom lines. The story for the next few years will be what companies survive and prosper during the downturn compared to what companies do not. I will tend to avoid companies that have racked up large losses during the good times. Uber comes to mind.I think the “platform” companies will ride out any recession just fine. These include Apple, Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia. These companies combine hardware and software into integrated products, and have extended hardware development to the silicon level.Joe Albano: Anything semiconductor. With trade headwinds easing and inventories in the OEM supply chain normalized after a huge build up, 2020 will be setting itself up for anything with a bit or a byte in it. Nvidia, Western Digital (WDC), Micron (MU), Skyworks (SEKS), and Broadcom (AVGO). Each have their own strengths and story in the market so it depends how risky you want to get or how aggressive you want to get. I own them all, and I see large gains in 2020 and already have as 2019 comes to an end.EnerTuition: Advanced Micro Devices continues to be the top idea for 2020 in spite of being one of the best stocks in the market and Beyond The Hype subscribers in 2018 and 2019. While some view the stock as played out with a big run, we do not see slow down in market share gains against Intel (INTC) and, if fact, expect market share gains to accelerate in 2020.***Thanks to our panelists for participating!

4320046,50452,2020-01-30T01:47:41-05:00,"Mastercard continues to hum along. The company closed its 2019 fiscal year on a high note with a beat on both revenue and earnings.The stock's operational momentum remains strong, and 2020 should produce similar growth based on management's guidance.Investors should be careful entering the stock at these levels. Valuation is at/near its least attractive levels in years.","Payment processing technology company Mastercard Incorporated (MA) closed out its 2019 fiscal year on Wednesday. The company's performance indicated continued strong operational momentum, as its increasing size has yet to really slow down its rapid growth. We review the company's quarter, and the current state of shares to determine whether investors can realize upside from current levels. While Mastercard continues to be a high-performance ""unicorn"" type of a business, the stock has managed to outrun its earnings growth to excessive levels.Mastercard closed out 2019 with its Q4 earnings on Wednesday. It topped analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines, something that really shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. The company has produced a revenue beat every quarter since Q4 2016, and an EPS beat since Q2 2015 when it simply matched estimates (rather than topping them). Fourth-quarter revenues of $4.41 billion were up 16.1% over last year (topping estimates by $10 million). Earnings per share of $1.96 on a non-GAAP basis were up 26% over last year and cleared estimates by $0.09.When you peel back the layers of the onion, we see that operating momentum for Mastercard is still very strong. Reported revenue growth of 16% Y/Y continues to remain in line with long-term growth trends (3-year revenue CAGR of 15.60%). Dollar volume remains strong both in the US as well as internationally.(Source: Mastercard Incorporated)This is partially driven by continued macroeconomic tailwinds (growth of non-cash transactions and increasing e-commerce transactions). In addition to transaction growth, card volume increased 5% as well over last year. This is also in line with quarterly card volume growth over the past couple of years.(Source: Mastercard Incorporated)Mastercard was able to maintain strong margins as well. Its operating margin expanded from 52.3% in 2018, to 54.4% in 2019 on an adjusted basis. Considering the company's strong revenue growth, this produces a sizable uptick in Mastercard's cash flow. For the full fiscal year, operating cash flow jumped from $6.22 billion to $8.18 billion (+31.5% Y/Y).(Source: Mastercard Incorporated)Looking ahead to 2020, management is expecting momentum to carry. Net revenue growth is projected in the ""low teens"", the same guideline provided last year during Q4 2018 earnings. The company's projected effective tax rate will increase some in 2020 from the FY 2019 rate of 16.6%, a minor headwind. Given friendly macroeconomic conditions (strong spending, growth of non-cash transactions) and Mastercard's history of topping estimates, we expect another strong year in 2020.Mastercard's success has not been lost on the market. The stock has been roaring higher on sustained momentum. With shares trading at just over $318, the stock is up against all-time highs.(Source: YCharts)This positive price momentum shouldn't be a surprise given the company's consistently strong earnings growth. Based on the full year's earnings per share of $7.77 on an adjusted basis, the stock's current earnings multiple now stands at 41X. Because the company's growth over the past 10 years has been consistent with recent performance, we feel that historical metrics can still provide proper perspective on the stock's valuation. With a 10-year median P/E ratio of 28.38X, the stock's current valuation represents a 44% premium.In other words, the appreciation of shares has outpaced the actual growth of the business - despite that growth being very strong. We see this same trend if we look at the 10-year patterns of FCF yield. The stock's FCF yield has steadily compressed to what are now 10-year lows at just 1.78%.(Source: YCharts)Mastercard has a well-deserved reputation as a high-growth stalwart in the payment technologies sector. But the question for investors is how much near-term upside there is using today's valuations as a starting point. It can be tempting to look at a stock that has multiplied in value in recent years and let the ""fear of missing out"" compel someone to buy in.While Mastercard's operational momentum remains strong (as the most recent quarter and 2020 guidance illustrate), the share price will eventually begin to revert towards a more appropriate relationship with the actual value of the fundamentals. This may come in the form of share price contraction, or range-bound trading while the valuation catches up.Even if Mastercard maintains an earnings growth rate of 20-25% (similar to its performance over the past three years), it will still take approximately two years from now for the stock to recalibrate to its 10-year median multiples. If the company sees performance slow down (say, perhaps due to a recession that curbs consumer spending), the downside could be even worse. A target entry point of 30X earnings would represent a stock price of $233 per share. This represents an entry point that enables the stock to grow organically with the growth of Mastercard's business, while respecting the operating metrics/growth momentum that continues to perform at a high level.It's easy to say ""shares seemed expensive two years ago, and look at them now!"" But the reality is that the stock is more expensive now than it used to be. While Mastercard continues to flex its fundamental strength, the stock itself represents a bit of a ""growth trap"" for investors who are late to the party. We advise caution, as moving into a neighborhood of 41X earnings can easily disappointment investors at the first sign of trouble.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."
4312229,105417,2019-12-12T15:16:40-05:00,"We see payments volume acceleration in 2020, as total addressable market remains strong.Interchange likely going up, putting upward pressure on network pricing.Free cash flows should lead to more buybacks and deals in 2020.","Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is a network that facilitates electronic fund transfers via branded credit, debit, and gift cards. MA is one of the world's best-recognized brands, operating across nearly all countries around the world and commanding more than 60% of the global payments volume share together with its main rival Visa (NYSE:V). Unlike Visa, Mastercard derives more than 70% of total revenue from international markets (Visa is more around 50% US/50% international).There is a meaningful growth opportunity that we continue to expect from the Mastercard story, particularly from the untapped international developed markets, such as Europe and the BRIC nations. When we compare MA against its key competitors in the payments space (not only Visa, Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS), and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) networks, but also Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN), Alliance Data Systems Corporation (NYSE:ADS), PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), The Western Union Company (NYSE:WU), FleetCor Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:FLT), among others), we see the company meriting at least 38x P/E multiple on our 2020 EPS estimate of $8.98, yielding the target price of $345.Payments volume acceleration in 2020: Per our model, we expect the payments volume to accelerate in the following markets: United States (by about 70-80 bps), Canada, France, Germany, Brazil, India, and Japan, among others. In our view, credit growth has not yet saturated in the developing world and even in Western Europe, while the debit growth - arguably, one of the strongest levers in non-US markets - continues to grow in upper single digits/low teens.Market remains strong: Per latest Nilson data, card penetration stands at only 21% in Western Europe and at less than 15% in developing markets. On average, every year, 0.9% of paper (cash and checks) users convert to plastic (credit card, debit card, gift card) in the US, and approximately 0.65% convert in the European corridor (we note that data for developing markets is more murky). As a result, we expect solid double-digit growth in payments volume to continue. Since their respective IPOs in 2006 and 2008, Mastercard and Visa delivered very strong share performance largely due to meaningful growth in payments volume.Interchange likely going up, putting upward pressure on network pricing: As we conduct our channel checks across major banks, we note that the interchange (tied to the merchant discount rate and charged by issuing banks) continues to go up, with the average increase of 5-7 bps in 2019 alone, particularly for credit, which, in our view, should result in a slight increase in network pricing. We believe that over the next four quarters, we may see as much as half-a-basis point increase in pricing.Trade war a red flag, but not a major headwind: We are surprised to see some analysts tying tariffs to the businesses of Mastercard, Visa, and other networks. While these companies are susceptible to macro pressures, like most major firms and while sustained trade war may eventually lead to an economic slowdown, we don't see a direct impact from tariffs on consumer spending. In other words, even as tariffs were enacted over the last year by the United States and China, we haven't seen a direct hit to the payments volume.Free cash flows leading to buybacks and deals: We see two core sources for the generous free cash flow generation at Mastercard (with capex contained, we may see acceleration by as much as 2% in 2020). First, we believe the company is long overdue for a major deal (See our note on FLT and potential acquisition (See Article)). Second we expect share repurchases to continue, albeit we see them more packaged toward the second half of the year. Overall, we believe that MA's capital return over the next 1-3 years should average between 2.5%-2.8%.We see the following business risks for MA:"
4305418,33291,2019-11-11T11:27:53-05:00,"High growth stock MasterCard is a name we have had numerous profitable buy calls on over the years.
        In the last few months the stock has taken a breather.
        Growth metrics remain strong and the valuation can be grown into.
        Still a long-term buy under $275.","Mastercard (NYSE:MA) continues to deliver solid performance and in our opinion, this stock is a buy on any sizable pullback and makes an excellent addition to any portfolio focused on growth. Make no mistake, the name has been priced for continued near-perfect performance of the underlying company. For years, the argument of the name being overvalued has been made but shares continue to rise. However, the stock has recently taken a breather after being one of the best investments you could have made in the last few years. The company continues to grow into its valuation, and as such we are encouraging our members and followers to consider the name. That said, with the recent pause in shares, investors are getting the opportunity to buy into the next leg of growth. Let us discuss.Let us be clear you are certainly paying for performance. We say this because the Street has essentially baked into share prices continued beats against consensus estimates, growing volumes, well-managed expenses and double-digit growth in earnings.But the stock has stalled because the growth has slightly decelerated lately, but it is of minor concern in our estimation. However, on the bearish side of things, any real earnings missteps would send the name falling.Perhaps the greatest risk to ongoing performance would be a recession that slows consumer spending (and as such, less charges/swipes are made with cards), so keep that in mind. But as of now, Mastercard keeps delivering, and the market continues to assign a premium valuation to the name. This is evidenced by its multiple being nearly 40 times trailing earnings, and 35X forward EPS.Despite the recent stalling of the stock, MasterCard is a growth machine and the stock has still more than tripled from where we recommended it at $90 a share. With the exceptional growth the name is showing, the valuation has been justified. To continue to run higher and take out the psychological resistance point of $300 per share, we will examine trends in sales and earnings and discuss our expectations looking ahead.So the stock has pulled back, but the data remains strong. The recently reported quarter saw another impressive top line, with solid increases in third quarter revenues over the past three years:Source: SEC filings, graphics by BAD BEAT InvestingAs you can see the growth in revenues is impressive. The results strongly suggest that the company will continue its stable and reliable growth. Net revenue for the quarter came in at $4.47 billion, a 14.6% increase over Q3 2018. This was primarily due to better than expected performance in gross dollar volume and a large increase in processed transactions.Mastercard saw a 14% jump in gross dollar volume, surpassing our expectations for 12% growth, and saw a 20% increase in transactions processed. The transaction growth drives the huge gains we saw in revenues.Not only is this growth above what we thought we might see for volumes (18-19%), but it is simply impressive for a long-standing company like Mastercard and shows the company is still executing to near perfection. Of course, with so many more transactions processed we need to be on the lookout for rising expenses possibly pressuring margins.If there is one area of weakness that we can pinpoint for Mastercard it is that operational expenses do continue to rise rather sharply, right in line with rising revenues. Expenses grew year-over-year vs. last year by 15% on an adjusted basis. On a currency neutral basis, expenses were up just 14%. This is very well done considering the rise in revenues. What we mean is that the pace of revenue and expense growth are on par. However, continued investment in strategic initiatives as well as normal operational growth expenses resulted in the expense trend moving higher.Make no mistake, we hate to see rising expenses. Of course, on an absolute dollar basis, the growth in revenues outpaces the growth in expenses. Total operating expenses were $1.8 billion for several reasons including primarily spending related to strategic initiatives, as well as higher promotional spending and of course acquisition-related integration expenses. Of the total increase, 13 points were due to investments in strategic initiatives.Now, when we factor in the increase in revenues, as well as the increase in expenses, we still see that it led to operating income increasing 18%. This is strong growth. Adjusted operating margin expanded to 59.4% from 58.7% at the midpoint of the year comparing H1 2019 to H1 2018. With this margin expansion, earnings per share continues to impress, and you really cannot ask for better results.So we have more transactions being processed, we have growing revenues, and widening margins. What is not to like? The expense growth is justified by the pace of revenue growth. This has us bullish on this pullback, especially when we factor in the billions of shares repurchased over the years. With the continuing tremendous performance, we have seen a nice bump in earnings per share:Source: SEC filings, graphics by BAD BEAT InvestingThis earnings growth is inarguable even for the most biggest bears out there on the name. Simply put, every year the company has been expanding its bottom line, and meaningfully so. For this, the Street has rewarded this stock. This most recent quarter was no exception as the company saw net income widen to $2.1 billion from $1.9 billion, hitting $2.07 per share, up 16% from last year. When we adjust for this and other items, we see that the more comparable adjusted net income came in at $2.2 billion, up 20% from last year's $1.9 billion. What is more, earnings per share on an adjusted basis were up 23% to $2.15, and this trounced our expectations for $2.05 per share in adjusted earnings. This outperformance stems from higher than expected revenues, a commensurate increase in expenses, and the company also repurchased $1.8 billion worth of stock, 6.4 million shares). With this established growth, we see 2019 delivering impressive continued gains over 2018.Factoring in the trajectory of Mastercard's performance year-to-date, and considering the trends in new cards being issued, transaction volume, and gross dollar volumes, we remain bullish. Based on what we are seeing and what we expect for H2 2019, we now see revenues coming in at $16.8-$16.9 billion and earnings coming in at $7.70-$7.80.With earnings per share growing 30% or more annually, the stock's valuation of 30-40 times forward earnings is justified. The company grows into its performance. Mastercard is a buy under $275.If you like the material and want to see more, scroll to the top of the article and hit ""follow""."
4316335,41961,2020-01-12T06:40:49-05:00,"Mastercard had an outstanding 2019, increasing almost 58%.Core secular drivers, strong operating performance, and significant new markets mean that its growth story is not finished.Valuation levels are above historic averages, but not excessive and may even be favorable on a relative basis.","Mastercard (MA) had a very strong 2019, returning almost 58% over the course of the year. The position is a core holding in the Sustainable Growth Portfolio. After such a strong performance, it's very reasonable for investors to question whether Mastercard is in for a period of far more subdued performance going forward. I would suggest that there are several important factors to suggest that is not the case.Mastercard has put together a string of consistent, double-digit revenue growth quarters over the course of 2019, racking up ""mid teens"" levels of revenue growth. In the company's most recent quarter, it recorded 16% revenue growth. Even cross-border volumes, which has been an area of weakness in recent years for the business, is showing signs of strength, rising almost 17% year on year. This is significant, because this is a particularly lucrative segment for Mastercard, and a recovery in cross-border volume growth is suggestive of a likely future earnings upswing for the business.There is especially reason to be optimistic for Mastercard as fears of an imminent recession have largely subsided, which augers well for continued strength in consumer spending globally. An economic downturn would obviously impact both consumer transaction volume as well as dollar value of purchases; however, there are no signs that such a scenario is anywhere on the horizon.E-commerce shift has years to play outMastercard has an inherent secular advantage over cash and check in the e-commerce area, with its ability to settle such transactions through alternative means online. With the share of e-commerce growth in the retail landscape only increasing, and with a progressively greater share of total commerce being transacted online, this is something that will continue to power the business for years to come. There is some evidence to suggest that Mastercard has even been able to pull in a significant portion of the unbanked and underbanked populations, who were largely cash-only consumers, through its innovative prepaid products and the desire of these groups to participate in e-commerce offerings. E-commerce volumes are set to soar globally over the next decade, increasing at double-digit growth, which will continue to benefit Mastercard.Source: E-Marketer, 2019Strong exposure to emerging marketsMastercard had made a very strategic decision very early on to make investments globally for better long-term growth. This makes sense for several reasons, most notably that the steady growth in disposable income and GDP per capita in emerging economies will result in an increase in consumption and purchase volume, much of it likely to be put on cards.Further, as these economies ride the wave of increasing internet penetration, that will lead to a secular trend away from physical commerce to digital commerce, or away from cash-based purchases to card-based settlement.This is reflected in Mastercard's payments volume which is skewed 35% to the US and 65% international and has been this way for the better part of a decade. Approximately 30% of Mastercard's business is aligned with the faster-growing markets of Asia Pacific. As Europe and the US enter a slowing period of economic growth, Mastercard likely has the leg up on Visa (NYSE:V) for future growth.Innovations in mobile payments should boost usageThe introduction of smartphone-based payments through the iPhone has been a watershed moment for mobile payment. Apple Pay (AAPL) brought considerable convenience and utility to the idea of paying by phone. The convenience and utility of being able to pay by phone was coupled with easy access to detailed spending habits and spending analytics without the fuss of having to access other accounts. Fortunately for Mastercard, much of the mobile payments innovation thus far has just been alternative payment interfaces leveraging the existing Mastercard rails. Continued innovation in mobile payments is a positive, because this makes it likely that consumers will be more likely to use the mobile payments experience rather than cash or check to pay.Mastercard is also a key participant in the next round of mobile payments innovation as the payments network behind the Apple Card, which was introduced by Apple in mid 2019. The Apple Card promises innovation in mobile payments via integration of machine learning and Apple Maps to provide a far more comprehensive insight into weekly and monthly spending, detailed transaction history, and intuitive budgeting.Mastercard has been taking some significant steps to crack the market for fast, direct B2B payments. This represents a massive market opportunity which is almost 3x Mastercard's current personal consumer expenditure payments market, valued at close to $120T. ACH payments, which are the predominant method of B2B payments transfer today, are a slow and lengthy process for business disbursements. Payments can take as long as five days to get credited due to issues in the payments reconciliation process, which is plagued with delays due to inconsistent file formats and transfer authentication, both of which can cause the delays in receipt of funds. Mastercard has built on its acquisition of Vocalink with the $3B acquisition of Nets in August 2019. Nets is an electronic payments platform that allows for payment clearing and instant payment services and will facilitate Mastercard's ambition of being able to introduce additional efficiency and speed into the execution of B2B payments.An investment in Mastercard isn't without considerable legal and regulatory risks. Mastercard has been in the cross-hairs of regulators globally for quite some time. The most prominent of these regulations was the passage of the Durbin Amendment in 2010, which capped the interchange allowable on debit cards. More recently, Mastercard and Visa had to settle a massive $6B antitrust suit brought by a merchant consortium, and the business has come under scrutiny by the FTC for discouraging merchants to route debit transactions via alternative networks. Alternative payment mechanisms such as bitcoin (OTC:GBTC) or emerging fintech alternatives are yet to see meaningful traction as a trusted, broadly accepted source of payment, and I don't believe any of the existing alternatives meaningfully threaten Mastercard's position.Mastercard has generally traded at a premium to the S&P 500 from a valuation perspective; however, the business currently trades at a premium to its own historical valuation at close to 33x forward earnings. This needs to be kept in context of a business that has been growing revenues consistently in the mid-teens and has significant entry barriers in place to keep out competitors and significant secular tailwinds and new markets to ensure continued, sustained growth. When relative valuation is considered against such businesses and P&G (PG) and Colgate (CL) which trade at 23-24x forward earnings, with flat to declining revenues, the case for paying up more for Mastercard may be more palatable."
4307627,92456,2019-11-19T00:20:49-05:00,"Technically, Mastercard stock price looks balanced.Both the current revenue growth rate and its absolute size describe the company's current capitalization level as overvalued.But Mastercard is clearly undervalued in terms of profitability.The stock price is more responsive to the overall growth of the stock market than to its decline. That is a very positive sign.","Starting from 2009, Mastercard (MA) stock price has been following its long-term exponential trend, which is pretty typical of a growing public company:Since the beginning of the year, the company's actual stock price has been growing almost in line with this trend. This means balanced growth dynamics of the company's capitalization.Throughout the year, Mastercard's rolling annual total price return indicator has been fluctuating around the average. It also points to the balanced state of the company's stock price dynamics.Technically, now Mastercard stock price is balanced.There are several strong and long-term dependencies which allow us to judge how balanced the current multiples of Mastercard are.Based on the long-term relationship between the revenue TTM absolute size and the company's capitalization, Mastercard's current price is slightly overvalued:According to analysts' average expectations, in Q2 '20, the company's revenue TTM will be around $18 billion, and in my model, this means that Mastercard's balanced stock price will come close to $300.But having considered the long-term relationship between Mastercard's revenue growth rate and its P/S multiple, it should be recognized that the current ratio of this multiple is in the “expensive” zone:Let's turn to the profit parameters.Considering the long-term relationship between the EPS absolute size and the company's capitalization, Mastercard's current price is balanced:But if analysts' average expectations concerning the EPS of Mastercard in Q2 2020 come true, within the bounds of the proposed model the company's balanced stock price will approach $340. This means significant growth potential.The same conclusion is true of the P/E multiple:There is one common characteristic detail: Mastercard is rather overvalued in terms of revenue and undervalued in terms of profitability. Considering that Mastercard is transforming from a ""growth"" company into a ""profit"" company, at my glance, it should be assessed mainly in terms of its profits.The comparable valuation based on the P/S (forward) to growth multiple has shown that Mastercard is one of the most expensive companies in the market:But history teaches that it is absolutely normal for the market to evaluate Mastercard like this:Judging by the P/E (forward) multiple adjusted by the expected EPS annual growth rate, the stock price is now 16% higher than the balanced level. And by the way, more expensive than Visa (V):I am more inclined to believe that Mastercard isn't cheaper than the main blue chips in Nasdaq. Mastercard's Bearish Beta (a measure of how a stock price tends to drop when the market is only down) is much less than the Bullish Beta (a measure of how a stock price tends to rise when the market is only on the rise):A similar situation is observed in the case of Visa:This means that the bullish sentiment about Mastercard is growing.So, overall now, Mastercard is a buy."
4320098,105096,2020-01-30T08:40:25-05:00,"Mastercard shares have returned 36.6% since our initial Buy rating in March, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 and payment peers.19Q4 results this week completed another strong year, supporting our thesis of Mastercard being a long-term structural compounder.Mastercard is in a virtuous cycle of growing its number of cards, dollar volume, revenues (including value-add services), margin and profits.Management's confident 2020 outlook implies an organic EBIT growth of at least mid-teens, though acquisitions will weigh on profits.At $320.27, with a 2.2% FCF Yield and mid-teens EPS growth, Mastercard should deliver a low-to-mid teens annual return. We reiterate Buy.","(We previously wrote about Mastercard and Visa as ""Blue Sky Capital"")We initiated our Buy rating on Mastercard (MA) in March and followed that with a similar Buy rating on Visa (V) in June, with a preference for Mastercard due to its higher exposure to less mature non-U.S. markets and higher historic growth. Since our initiation, Mastercard shares have returned 36.6% (including $1.39 in dividvends), more than twice the rise in the S&P 500 (SPY), and significantly outperformed payment peers American Express (AXP) (Neutral-rated since March) and PayPal (PYPL) (Neutral-rated since May):In this article, we review Mastercard's 19Q3 results released this Wednesday, and demonstrate why we believe it will continue to be a long-term structural compounder, capable of delivering a low-to-mid teens annual return over time.Our Buy case on Mastercard (and Visa) was based on credit card networks' ability to grow EPS at 15% or more sustainably over the medium term:Mastercard's operational performance in 19Q4 showed its volume growth remains strong, and its long-term growth potential remains abundant.19Q4 saw Mastercard growing 8.8% year-on-year in the number of cards, 18.8% in the number of purchase transactions, and 11.3% in purchase volume (12.5% excluding currency). This brings the full-year purchase volume growth to 9.8% year-on-year (13.2% excluding currency); Gross Dollar Volume, which includes cash transactions, grew 9.6% (13.0% excluding currency):The year-on-year growth in purchase volumes in 2019 continued a multi-year period of strong growth, although slightly lower than 2018, and was again geographically broad-based, near 10% even in the oldest U.S. market. With innovations like contactless payments still having relatively low penetration, management is confident that even the U.S. retains strong growth potential:Mastercard continues to have the strongest volume growth among the three main card companies, both globally and in the U.S.:Mastercard's P&L showed its continuing ability to convert strong volume growth into strong revenue growth, while also achieving margin expansion.For 19Q4, on constant currency, with Gross Dollar Volume (""GDV"") growth of 12% year-on-year, Mastercard grew Net Revenues by 17%, expanded EBIT margin by 205 bps, and grew EPS by 28%. Similarly, for full-year 2019, with GDV growth of 13%, Mastercard grew Net Revenues by 16%, expanded EBIT margin by 99 bps, and grew EPS by 23%:Within revenues, ""Other Revenues"" grew by 23.8% year-on-year in Q4. While this includes a 2% tailwind from acquisitions (but a 1% headwind from currency), the growth was ""driven primarily by the company’s Cyber & Intelligence and Data & Services solutions"", demonstrating Mastercard's ability to grow its value-add services.Mastercard has continued to be in a virtuous cycle of growing its number of cards, its dollar volume and its revenues each faster in turn:It has also consistently enjoyed strong operational leverage, with an expanding margin leading to profit growth ahead of revenue growth, with EPS growth also benefiting from buybacks:Management's 2020 guidance is for revenue to grow organically at “low-teens” and Operating Expenses to grow at the “high end of high-single-digits”, before currency and acquisitions, which imply an organic growth of at least mid-teens for operating profits. Acquisitions are expected to bring Operating Expenses growth to “high-teens”, implying a temporary margin compression in 2020:Pending acquisitions include the $3.19bn acquisition of Nets' real-time payments unit, the largest in Mastercard's history, which is expected to close in 19Q2. While Mastercard continues to be an active acquiror, it also maintains the discipline of targeting only acquisitions that would break even within 24 months of closing.On the wider economy, Mastercard has a confident outlook, with recent card data so far indicating a strong 2020 that would be “similar” to 2019. However, management is monitoring some factors in the external environment, including the impact of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak.Management observed that the impact of the virus was still too early to tell, though such incidents by nature tend to be temporary, and Mastercard's business in China is also somewhat protected by the high proportion of e-commerce in its business mix.At $320.27, with respect to 2019 financials, Mastercard shares trade at a 40.7x P/E and a 2.2% Free Cash Flow (""FCF"") Yield; the Dividend Yield is 0.5%:During 2019, Mastercard has continued to return nearly all of its Net Income to shareholders through dividends and buybacks:Given Mastercard's growth potential and strong track record, and with a ""lower for longer"" interest rates outlook, we believe Mastercard shares are still be reasonably priced.Mastercard's results support our Buy case, again confirming the company's ability to grow EPS at 15% or more a year sustainably over the medium term, as it continues to benefit from broad-based, structural volume growth, which is converted into strong revenue growth and margin expansion.We believe Mastercard's valuation multiples are stable. FCF, if paid out entirely in dividends, would provide a 2.2% dividend yield, which we consider healthy given Mastercard's strong growth profile.Assuming stable valuation multiples, Mastercard's average annual share price growth will likely be the sum of its organic EPS growth (at least mid-teens over time) and the benefit of the share count reduction from buybacks (approx. 1.5%), so mid-to-high teens.Even conservatively assuming, say, a 20% contraction in valuation multiples over the next 5 years, which would reduce average annual return by c. 4%, an investor could still expect a low-to-mid-teens average annual return.At $ $320.27, we believe Mastercard shares will continue to compound in the long term with a low-to-mid teens average annual return, consisting of 0.5% in dividends, low-to-mid teens share price growth from organic EPS growth and a stable/slightly-declining multiple, and an approx. 1.5% share price growth from EPS growth due to buybacks.We reiterate our Buy recommendation on Mastercard.Note: A track record of my past recommendations can be found here."
4302143,60561,2019-11-04T09:37:06-05:00,"Mastercard is a Dividend Challenger with 9 consecutive years of dividend growth.  Shares currently yield 0.47%.Using Mastercard's cash flow and balance sheet to analyze the quality of the business.Valuing Mastercard using a MARR analysis and dividend yield theory.At current levels, Mastercard is a hold or a dollar cost average approach, not bulk buys.","Payments processing, i.e., credit card networks, might be young in their public history, but they are rich in generating wealth for owners. Since its IPO in 2006, a $10,000 investment in Mastercard (MA) would be worth over $600k and that doesn't include the dividends that have been paid out.Data by YChartsMastercard has ridden the wave of the transition from a society that largely uses cash and checks for transactions to one where most purchases are done with a swipe. Mastercard's existing network would take years for an upstart to build out which protects the business and keeps it earning high margins.The bulk of my investments are in businesses that qualify as dividend growth investments, primarily with companies that could be quantified at medium yield-medium growth or high yield-low growth. However, as a relatively young investor, I also recognize the power, and profit potential, of owning shares in the low yield-high growth category. Companies such as Visa (V), Ecolab (ECL), Automatic Data Processing (ADP), and the like, might not provide much in the form of current dividend income, but the growth potential is enormous.Image by author; data source: Mastercard Investor Relations*An interactive version of this data is available here.Mastercard is a Dividend Challenger with 8 consecutive years of dividend growth. Mastercard has paid a dividend every year since their IPO in 2006 without any decreases. Although, the dividend was frozen at $0.015 for 20 consecutive quarters from February 2007 through December 2011.The 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year rolling dividend growth rates since 2006 are shown in the following table.Table and calculations by author; data source Mastercard Investor Relations*Dividends and growth rates are based off calendar year payments based on the dividend pay date.As I mentioned above, Mastercard had 15 consecutive quarters of paying out $0.015 per share in dividends. That was centered around and coming out of the Great Recession which is excusable in my book. Despite the nearly 4 years with zero dividend growth, the worst 5-year period has still seen 14.2% annualized dividend growth.Image by author; data source Mastercard SEC filingsMastercard's payout ratio has climbed over the last decade as dividend growth has outpaced growth in free cash flow and net income. That being said, the dividend is still well covered by net income and free cash flow with ample room for further increases.With a goal of buying into a business and holding forever, determining the quality of a business is an important part of my investment strategy. The strength of the business will show itself through the financials.Image by author; data source Mastercard SEC filingsRiding the wave of the push to less use of cash, Mastercard has seen its revenues grow from $5.10B in FY 2009 to $14.95B in FY 2018 with growth every single year. In total, Mastercard's top line has grown 193% or 12.7% annualized.The increase in transaction volume and high operating income speaks to the negligible marginal cost to process additional transactions. Operating income grew from $2.27B to $8.37B from FY 2009 to FY 2018. That's 269% total growth or 15.6% annualized.Similarly, cash flow from operations has grown from $1.38B to $6.22B which is 352% growth in total or 18.2% annualized.Free cash flow has outpaced all of them, growing from $1.24B to $5.89B from FY 2009 to FY 2018. Growing 376% in total or a whopping 18.9% annualized. Image by author; data source Mastercard SEC filingsSince Mastercard's cash flow generation outpaced growth in revenues, it should come as no surprise that margins have improved. Although, they have leveled out since FY 2015.Mastercard's free cash flow margin is incredibly strong with a 10-year average of 36.8%. Over the last 5 years, the average comes to 39.0%. I want to see FCF margins >10% as a sign of a strong cash generating enterprise and Mastercard is well above that mark.My preferred profitability metric is the free cash flow return on invested capital, FCF ROIC. The FCF ROIC represents the annual cash return that a business generates based on the capital invested. Successful buy-and-hold investing is built on finding businesses that earn, and can re-invest, capital at high rates of return. I want to see a FCF ROIC >10%.Image by author; data source Mastercard SEC filingsMastercard's FCF ROIC has been well above my 10% threshold. The high, and climbing, FCF ROIC speaks to the strength of the business and its ability to see massive FCF generation with little additional capital investment. Over the last decade, FCF ROIC has averaged 41.6%, and over the most recent 5 years, the average comes to 43.7%.I want to find businesses with capital allocation plans that align with how I believe I would do so as an owner. That means with the cash the business generates, first and foremost, we take care of and grow the business via capital expenditures. Secondly, with any remaining cash, I would return some to shareholders in the form of a growing dividend. Any remaining cash would then be used to shore up the balance sheet, pay down debt or repurchase shares.To understand how Mastercard has used its free cash flow, I calculate 3 variations of the metric, defined below:Ideally, a business will have positive or negligibly negative FCFaDB more often than not. I'm not concerned about the FCFaDB in any given year, rather it's the trend over the longer term that gives a glimpse into how management is behaving. Image by author; data source Mastercard SEC filingsAs we saw earlier, Mastercard has generated positive FCF every year over the last decade which has allowed management to move to dividends as a way to enhance shareholder returns. In total, Mastercard has produced $34.37B in FCF over the last decade.Mastercard has also maintained a positive FCFaD every year despite a rapidly growing dividend. In total, $4.69B has been sent to shareholders via dividend payments which puts the cumulative FCFaD at $29.69B for the last 10 years.The positive FCFaD has allowed management to grow the dividend as well as move to share repurchases to return additional cash to shareholders. In total, Mastercard has spent $24.45B on buybacks, putting the FCFaDB at $5.24B. Image by author; data source Mastercard SEC filingsThe $24.45B Mastercard has spent on share repurchases have decreased the share count from 1,304M in FY 2009 to 1,026M in FY 2018. That's a total reduction of 21.3% or ~2.6% annualized.The following chart shows the breakdown of the cash used for shareholders via capital expenditures, cash funded dividends and share repurchases, and extra dividends and buybacks that were not supported by cash generated by the business. The extra dividends and buybacks had to be funded by either debt, cash on the balance sheet or asset sales. Image by author; data source Mastercard SEC filingsAs you can see, Mastercard has spent more cash than was generated through operations in 4 of the last 10 years. They do still have a net positive FCFaDB for the entire period. The bulk of cash used for shareholders has been generated through the business which is a positive sign as the extra buybacks can always be scaled back if need be.Until FY 2014, Mastercard carried essentially no debt on their books. Since then, debt has ramped up significantly with long-term debt at $5.83B at the end of FY 2018. The debt-to-capitalization ratio has subsequently climbed up to 54%. Image by author; data source Mastercard SEC filingsThe rapid increase in debt would be a big red flag for some companies; however, in Mastercard's case, there's nothing to be concerned about. The free cash flow interest coverage sits at a very healthy 28.5x for FY 2018. Meanwhile, the entire debt load at the end of FY 2018 could be paid off with 1.1 years of FY 2018's FCF and 1.3 years of FY 2018's FCFaD.The minimum acceptable rate of return, MARR, analysis is one method to determine whether an investment is attractive or not. The MARR analysis entails estimating the future earnings and dividends that a business will generate, applying a valuation on those earnings and then comparing the expected return with your threshold return.Analysts expect Mastercard to report FY 2019 EPS of $7.69 and FY 2020 EPS of $9.05. They also expect Mastercard to manage 17.1% annual earnings growth over the next 5 years in total. I then assumed that Mastercard would see 8.0% annual earnings growth for the following 5 years. Dividends are assumed to target a 22.5% payout ratio.Historically, Mastercard has traded at a premium multiple to the market within a range of 17x-35x. According to Morningstar, Mastercard's 5-year average TTM P/E is 34.8x. For the MARR analysis, I'll examine P/E ratios ranging from 15x-35x.Data by YChartsThe following table shows the potential internal rates of return that an investment in Mastercard could provide if the assumptions laid out above come to fruition. Returns include dividends taken in cash following Mastercard's historical payment schedule and are calculated assuming a purchase price of $279, Friday's closing price. Returns run through the end of calendar year 2024, ""5 Year"", and calendar year 2029, ""10 Year"".Alternatively, I want to determine what prices levels would provide the returns that I desire assuming the forecasts for earnings growth pan out. The target returns that I will use are 10%, my typical minimum threshold for investment, 14% and 16%. The 14% is derived from the ~13% annualized earnings growth plus the starting dividend yield with the 16% including 25% undervalued normalizing over 10 years, or ~2.3% annualized.Another valuation method that I use is dividend yield theory. Dividend yield theory is best suited for well-established businesses with a history of paying dividends. Dividend yield theory is based on mean reversion, with the 5-year average dividend yield being a good proxy for the fair price for the business in question.Image by author; data source Yahoo Finance & Mastercard Investor RelationsMastercard shares currently offer a 0.47% dividend yield which is well below the 5-year average yield of 0.66%. Dividend yield theory suggests a fair price of $200 for Mastercard shares.Mastercard, the business, is in rare territory on the quality spectrum. Not only is the business growing by leaps and bounds as the continued transition from cash payments to card and electronic payments continues to ramp higher, but Mastercard's marginal cost to process additional transactions is essentially nil.That's what has allowed Mastercard's margins to continue to expand over the last decade with operating cash flow margins >40% and free cash flow conversion around ~94%. Its strong free cash flow generation and minimal need for additional capital expenditures has seen the free cash flow return on invested capital expand 50.2% for FY 2018.And of course, Mastercard has a built-in inflation hedge in the way the business is constructed. Since Mastercard takes a cut of the transactions they process if inflation rises, Mastercard's cut rises along with it.There's no doubt that Mastercard is deserving of a premium multiple compared the market. In the case of Mastercard, the valuation seems quite rich at the moment with a TTM P/E of 41.4x, 36.3x 2019's estimates and even 30.8x 2020's estimates. The expected, and likely, growth that Mastercard will enjoy over the next decade will make up for overvaluation if the growth is sustained.However, the question right now is how long do you expect the tremendous growth to continue and how much of the growth in the business are you willing to forego due to the eventual valuation compression.That doesn't mean that an investment in Mastercard won't generate adequate results for buyers at current levels. That being said, investors at the current lofty valuation are banking on growth to bail out them out. There's a very high likelihood of investors losing out on upwards of 40% of the growth of the underlying growth of the business should valuations contract to a ~25x P/E in the future.Dividend yield theory suggests a fair value range between $180 and $224 based on the current annual dividend of $1.32. Since Mastercard is likely to announce a sizable increase in December, it makes sense to look at how the fair value range would shift due to the raise. Assuming an increase to $0.40 per share per quarter, a 21% increase, the fair value range based on dividend yield theory would increase to $242-$271.My fair value range based on the MARR analysis is $214-$253.Mastercard resoundingly qualifies as a business that I want to own for the long haul; however, I can't bring myself to add shares at current levels. If the share price declines into the $250s, I would begin to get interested in adding shares to my portfolio."

Readers who have already read our article on Visa's FY19Q4 results last week are advised to skip directly to the ""Operational Performance"" section.We initiated our Buy rating on Mastercard in March and followed that with a similar Buy rating on Visa in June, with a preference for Mastercard due to its higher exposure to less mature non-U.S. markets and higher historic growth.Since our initiation, Mastercard shares have risen 13%, more than twice the rise in the S&P 500, and significantly outperformed payment peers American Express (NYSE:AXP) (Neutral-rated since March) and PayPal (PYPL) (Neutral-rated since May), although underperforming Visa by approx. 130 bps:Having reviewed Mastercard's 19Q3 results released last week, we believe it will continue to be a long-term compounder, backed by strong structural trends, as we will explain below.Our Buy case on Mastercard (and Visa) was based on credit card networks' ability to grow EPS at 15% or more sustainably over the medium term:Mastercard's 19Q3 results showed that all the components of our Buy case remain intact.Mastercard's operational performance showed its volume growth remains strong, and its long-term growth potential remains abundant.19Q3 saw Mastercard growing 11.0% year on year in the number of cards (6.0% including Maestro cards), 21.9% in the number of payments transactions, and 12.5% in payments volume (14.7% excluding currency). This brings its year-to-date payments volume growth to 9.3% year on year (13.5% excluding currency):The year-on-year growth in payments volume was again geographically broad-based and exceeded 10% even in the oldest U.S. market:Volume growth has been strong for all three large card companies through 2019, both globally and in the U.S., albeit at a lower level than the exceptionally strong 2018 for American Express and Visa:Interestingly, Mastercard's 19Q3 volume growth exceeded Visa's even in their U.S. home market, in both credit and debit cards:Similar to Visa, Mastercard management has continued to observe a strong economy, including in the 3 weeks after the end of Q3 (through 21 October), with year-on-year switched volume growth down 1% sequentially in the U.S. and similar to Q3 outside the U.S.Mastercard's P&L showed its continuing ability to convert strong volume growth into strong revenue growth, while also achieving margin expansion.For 19Q3, on payments volume growth of 14.7% year on year, Mastercard grew net revenues by 16%, expanded EBIT margin by 2 bps, and grew EPS by 23%. Similarly, for year-to-date on payments volume growth of 13.5%, Mastercard grew net revenues by 15%, expanded EBIT margin by 66 bps, and grew EPS by 21% (all figures exclude currency):""Other Revenues"", which include value-added services, grew 32.7% year on year in Q3 (including currency) (22.9% year to date), due to both a 4% contribution from acquisitions and Mastercard's success in areas such as Data & Services and Cyber & Intelligence Solutions.Rebates & Incentives grew faster than gross revenues, but as mentioned, net revenues still grew faster than volumes.Mastercard's 19Q3 revenue growth of 16% appears only 1% higher than that of Visa (15%, both figures excluding currency) but, unlike Visa, there was no mention of any material benefit from the adoption of the ASC 606 accounting standard which increased Visa's revenue growth by 3%.Operating expense growth was roughly in line with revenue growth for 19Q3 (at 14.5%) and 170 bps slower than revenue growth for year to date. Acquisitions were again a contributor to expense growth (3% in Q3), while the rest was primarily related to ""strategic initiatives such as digital enablement, safety and security, geographic expansion, and new payment flows"":Some investments were shifted from 19Q3 to Q4, which means year-on-year expense growth will likely be higher in the last quarter of the year.Management outlook continued to imply a high-teens EPS growth in 2019. The actual outlook was revised upwards slightly, with revenue growth revised from “low teens” to “high end of low-teens” (all figures are non-GAAP):With operating expense growth still expected to be at the ""high end of high single-digits"", the implied EBIT growth (non-GAAP, excluding acquisitions) for 2019 is in the high-teens. EPS growth will also be in high-teens (and higher), helped by buybacks which have reduced the average share count by 2.4% for the year-to-date period.The high-teens EBIT growth implied by 2019 guidance will be in line with Mastercard's recent track record, with an EBIT CAGR of 17.2% in 2015-18. EPS growth has been higher due to the U.S. tax cut in 2017, as well as share buybacks (which were done at lower prices than the present one):At $279.05, with respect to last 12 months' financials, shares are on 37.2x P/E and a 2.0% Free Cash Flow (""FCF"") Yield; the Dividend Yield is 0.5%:Similar to Visa, Mastercard has a history of returning nearly all of its net income to shareholders through dividends and buybacks:Mastercard shares are on higher multiples than Visa shares, which are trading on a 33.0x P/E and a 2.9% FCF Yield with respect to last 12 months' (FY19) financials and have a 0.7% Dividend Yield.We believe both Visa and Mastercard are attractively valued, given their growth potential and strong track record.Mastercard's results support our Buy case, again confirming the company's ability to grow EPS at 15% or more sustainably over the medium term, as it continues to benefit from broad-based, structural volume growth, which is converted into strong revenue growth and margin expansion.Mastercard continues to grow volume and earnings faster than even Visa.We believe Mastercard's valuation multiples are stable. FCF, if paid out entirely in dividends, would provide a 2.0% dividend yield, which we consider healthy given Mastercard's strong growth profile.Assuming stable valuation multiples, Mastercard's average annual share price growth will likely be the sum of its organic EPS growth (in mid-to-high-teens) and the benefit of the share count reduction from buybacks (approx. 2%).At $279.05, we believe Mastercard shares will continue to compound in the long term with a 15-18% average annual return, consisting of 0.5% in dividends, mid-to-high-teens share price growth from organic EPS growth, and an approx. 2% share price growth from EPS growth due to buybacks.We reiterate our Buy recommendation on Mastercard and prefer it slightly over Visa (also Buy-rated) for its higher exposure to less mature non-U.S. markets and higher historic growth.Note: A track record of my past recommendations can be found here (updated)."

Today I will do the same analysis for Mastercard (MA).So, let's model how much Mastercard should now cost based on a very optimistic forecast for the next 10 years.I'll start with the revenue forecast.According to the average expectations of analysts, Mastercard's revenue will grow at a relatively moderate pace in the coming years:Source: Seeking AlphaI proceed from the assumption that the company's revenue will grow much faster and the CAGR will reach 12% in the next 10 years. I want to note that in the case of Visa's revenue, I assumed that the CAGR in the coming decade will be 9.85%.Let's ignore the fact that the digital payment market is becoming more and more competitive and assume that the operating margin of Mastercard will remain at the average level of the past five years, which can be seen as an optimistic forecast:Data by YChartsThe tax rate is assumed to be 25%, which is in line with the company's average level over the past five years:Data by YChartsI assume that CAPEX will remain at the current, relatively low level:Data by YChartsHere is the calculation of the Weighted Average Cost of Capital:Some explanations:And here is the model itself:So, this is what we have: with the optimistic forecast for the growth of revenue and profitability, we even got negative growth potential for Mastercard's shares.A company deserves a recommendation to buy if the DCF analysis conducted based on conservative forecast parameters demonstrates a growth potential of at least 30-40%. In our case, everything is different. Even based on the very optimistic development scenario, the DCF model has shown no growth potential. In my opinion, Mastercard is not a ""strong buy"" company at the moment."
4302210,41961,2019-11-04T12:29:07-05:00,"Mastercard is a business of exceptional quality, worthy of a long-term holding in any investor's portfolio.The business historically trades at a premium to the S&P 500, and is now at a premium valuation to even where it has historically traded over the last 5 years.What's often lost in the valuation analysis is that Mastercard is putting in place the seeds to grow some fairly substantial new revenue streams which may transform the business.","Mastercard (MA) is a very high quality business, possibly the highest quality business in the small universe of companies that I invest in. It is one of the 5 great businesses that I’ll never sell. The company has consistently increased both its revenues and earnings since listing, even through the severe downturn of 2009. Best of all, Mastercard has managed to achieve this with a great deal of financial discipline. Mastercard has net margins of almost 40%, and returns on invested capital of greater than 50%. Being able to invest capital at such high rates of return for extended periods of time where there are opportunities due to the secular shift from cash to digital payments and dramatic increases in per capita incomes in developing economies gives rise to exceptional long-term profitability and returns to shareholders. In fact, Mastercard returns almost the entirety of its free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks.However, accessing such a high-quality franchise very rarely comes cheap for investors. Mastercard typically trades on a premium valuation to the market and typically at a significant premium to the S&P 500’s average valuation. At this time, Mastercard now trades at a premium valuation to even its own elevated historical standards. The business currently carries a price to forward earnings ratio of over 30, the highest that it has traded at any point in the last five years.Morningstar.com, Mastercard valuation ratiosWhile this premium valuation may be causing investors pause, Mastercard is slowly transforming into a very different business, and the premium valuation that it carries maybe masking some fairly substantial opportunities that are hidden beneath the surface.Mastercard's recently reported results continue to show a core business in consumer digital payments that is firing on all cylinders. The company reported revenue growth of almost 16% (in constant currency), consistent with growth in recent years. Payment volume growth was up 14% year on year. Operating margins once again came in at just under 60%, indicating that the business still retains considerable pricing power and operating leverage as it scales with volume on a limited fixed cost base. Cross-border volumes, which tend to be a very lucrative part of the business for Mastercard, were also up approximately 17% year-over-year, excluding currency impacts. These results are extremely high quality given the economic malaise that affect various parts of the global economy in which Mastercard operates, including depressed growth in Europe as well as strong instability in Latin America.With the secular tailwind of an ongoing global shift from cash to digital-based payments and the acceleration towards electronic-commerce only gathering steam, Mastercard is extremely well positioned to benefit from both of these trends and therefore experience continued growth in its core business just from personal consumer expenditures alone.However, beyond Mastercard's core business, the company has set the stage to move into two fairly large adjacent markets which have the potential to increase its addressable market by 4x its current market.Mastercard 2017 Investor DayMastercard has been significantly bulking up its business to business payment initiatives, and has been putting in place the elements of delivering an enhanced B2B payments solution. ACH, which is the current standard in direct account to account transfers for business, often has delays in receipt of payments of at least several days. Part of Mastercard’s push here has been the development of a more efficient, real time payments infrastructure for B2B payments. This initiative received a real boost from the company’s acquisition of Vocalink in 2017, which itself was a set of existing ACH rails. By being able to innovate on top of these rails for enhanced payment delivery, Mastercard likely has a better chance of success to commercialize a B2B product, and have banks use and deploy this.Mastercard aims to streamline the payments reconciliation process, which is plagued with delays due to inconsistent file formats and a lack of standardization, causing the delays in receipt of funds. Mastercard’s push into this space has been complemented with the $3B acquisition of Nets in August 2019. Nets is an electronic payments platform that allows for payment clearing and instant payment services, and will facilitate Mastercard’s ambition of being able to introduce additional efficiency and speed into the execution of B2B payments.To put the size of this opportunity in context, B2B payments is close to 3x the size of Mastercard’s addressable personal consumer expenditure opportunity at almost $120T.As part of this push into B2B payments, Mastercard announced just over a month ago that it would be bringing all of its current and future B2B payments under the Mastercard Track brand.Another very large space that Mastercard has recently been pushing into is the consumer money transfer space, which the business estimates to be a $60 trillion market, larger than the consumer personal expenditure market that Mastercard currently serves. Mastercard Send is a service that Mastercard has developed to facilitate disbursements to consumers, whether these are peer to peer or business to consumer transfers, both domestically or internationally.While Mastercard Send initially focused on P2P payments, and was adopted by Google Pay to help facilitate transfers between consumers, Mastercard has arguably stumbled on a far bigger market, which is the use of Mastercard Send to facilitate payments from businesses to consumers, such as in the context of emergency insurance claims (Allstate) as well as making payroll for independent agents in the gig economy, facilitating direct payments for Uber drivers. Mastercard acquired Transfast earlier this year to further extend the reach and application of Mastercard Send, particularly for cross border transfers.While Mastercard hasn’t made significant revenue traction in either consumer payments nor in real time business to business payments, the company has the brand, infrastructure, systems and relationships to create significant new revenue streams in both these large markets. Companies with such significant wide moats typically have the ability to fairly easily cross into a new market areas where they can leverage their brand and existing infrastructure to do so. It is not a significant stretch to believe that Mastercard can make meaningful traction in both new markets, especially since they have acquired technology that is currently used to service both of these areas, which can in turn be scaled via Mastercard's assets.Mastercard may look overvalued and certainly is trading more expensively than it has been in its recent past; however, much of the potential growth from the new businesses that the company is pursing is not priced into the stock at current levels. Investors considering a position in this business have the opportunity to come and invest for the strong continuing growth in the core consumer expenditure payments business and stay for the likely considerable growth that will follow in business to business payments and consumer payments."
4294165,25047,2019-09-30T11:31:30-04:00,"There are many emerging fintech companies catering to the consumer. This is a worldwide phenomenon.They typically share a characteristic, they provide Visa/Mastercard cards to enable payments everywhere, or otherwise rely on the Visa/Mastercard payment networks.There are obvious consequences from this for Visa/Mastercard. However, over the longer term, things might turn out very different.","There is an interesting phenomenon taking place all across the world. In the U.S., in Europe, and in Asia. That's the emergence of fintech (financial technology) firms. These firms typically provide the consumer or corporations with easier ways to accept or make payments, deposits, money transfers and (sometimes) loans.In this article, I will mostly concern myself with fintech companies geared towards serving the consumer. Namely, providing the consumer with easy ways to make deposits, make payments and transfer money. I will show that the current wave of fintech companies in this area is producing a very positive effect for Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA). I will also show that, at some point, this positive effect will turn into a negative - possibly very negative - effect.Critical to understanding the effects of the fintech revolution on Visa and Mastercard is understanding how Visa and Mastercard made money.This is a simple process. When a Visa or Mastercard transaction takes place, the accepting merchant pays a commission for having received a payment through Visa/Mastercard. This is called the discount fee.This discount fee is then split between the company providing Visa/Mastercard connectivity to the merchant (the acquirer), and the actual issuer of the Visa/Mastercard card presented for payment (Visa/Mastercard don't issue the cards themselves, a third party - the issuer - does).Finally, Visa/Mastercard make money from this cycle by charging fees based on the volume and number of transactions handled both by the acquirer (providing connectivity to the Visa/Mastercard network to the merchant) and the card issuer.To simplify, we could say Visa/Mastercard also takes a cut from the fee charged to the merchant for accepting Visa/Mastercard payments, though in an indirect way.C2C (Consumer To Consumer) Fintechs come in many shapes and forms. Typically, they'll at least enable payments and transfers to be made easily. Oftentimes, they'll also accept deposits and allow for more services. I'll use Revolut's example here.Revolut is a European fintech that's spreading across the world. Revolut was launched in July 2015, merely four years ago. Revolut started out as a financial technology company. Right now, however, Revolut constitutes what's known as a ""virtual bank"" through an ECB-issued specialized banking license. This means that Revolut, like PayPal (PYPL), can now accept deposits and also provide credit.With Revolut, customers can (among other things) transfer or exchange money in 30 different currencies at very competitive exchange rates, and also make payments in 150 different currencies. Customers also have access to credit/debt cards, including a free tier, as well as make quick transfers between Revolut accountholders.How does Revolut accomplish a lot of this, namely the payments part? It leans on the Visa/Mastercard payments network across the world. It's thus also an issuer of Visa/Mastercard cards, both physical and virtual. This characteristic, shared by most fintech companies catering to the consumer, is very significant. It means that as consumers adopt the fintech ease of use, more and more of their resources and payments are made through Visa/Mastercard payment networksRevolut now has more than 7 million members, and it was born just four years ago. Its growth is explosive, same as with many other fintech companies.From the former example, it's very obvious that as more consumers rely on fintechs structured like Revolut, more payments will necessarily flow through Visa/Mastercard. Hence, the near-term effect on Visa/Mastercard from the fintech revolution is very positive.Where things get a lot more complex is over the long term. Remember, emerging fintechs have no chance but to use the Visa/Mastercard payment networks to enable payments for their own customers. Otherwise, their money wouldn't be accepted anywhere and that would also make fintechs unattractive for consumers.But what happens over the longer term? We already have an example. PayPal, the best-known ""old"" fintech. PayPal now has 286 million active accounts.PayPal is being accepted directly as a payment method by more and more merchants. Initially PayPal used Visa/Mastercard cards as a means of identifying customers, but now it can also use bank accounts for the same purpose. PayPal also often leaned on the Visa/Mastercard associated with the account to make payments. However, as its members built balances and as PayPal gained size, it slowly became less of a feeder into the Visa/Mastercard payment networks. Instead, it became more of an alternative. When PayPal accountholders pay from their own PayPal balances, PayPal needn't provide Visa/Mastercard with a cut on the transaction.The same stands to happen to other fintech companies as they grow large enough. For a fintech company to provide a transparent, cheap, fast, payment to a merchant, all that's needed is for the merchant to have a Revolut account (or just a regular bank account Revolut is aware of), plus a bit of interface. As Revolut (and others) grows large enough, it will be extremely attractive to provide this alternative means of payment, and skip the Visa/Mastercard payment network altogether.Why will it be very attractive? Because Visa/Mastercard is an oligopoly with very high margins. Hence, it's a business that's easy to undercut and still have high margins on.Thus, the threat to Visa/Mastercard over the longer term is that several fintech companies will slowly eat away at their oligopoly pricing power by providing payment solutions that do not rely on the Visa/Mastercard payments network. This won't be revolutionary in any way: it's what PayPal already does today, but multiplied several-fold as the fintech revolution evolves.Most consumer-facing fintech companies provide their payment abilities by relying on Visa/Mastercard payment networks. This means that as fintech companies expand, so does the Visa/Mastercard payments volume. In the short term, this means the fintech revolution is a positive factor for Visa/Mastercard.However, over the longer term, the fintech companies attaining sufficiently large scale will tend to (easily) provide their own payment abilities. This means that over the long term, the larger fintech companies will become competitors to Visa/Mastercard and erode the oligopolistic pricing that now exists for handing payments in the Visa/Mastercard networks.This isn't merely a hypothesis. PayPal already shows this is what happens over the long term. When you pay a merchant through your PayPal balance, Visa/Mastercard don't get a cut. The same will happen with several of the larger fintech companies over time."
4294435,92456,2019-10-01T15:49:58-04:00,"Technically, Mastercard is growing in full accordance with its natural trend.Mastercard is rather overvalued in terms of revenue characters and clearly undervalued in terms of profitability.Current beta of Mastercard is relatively high. t means a somewhat unstable state of the market price of the company.","Today I would like to continue with the topic of Mastercard (MA) valuation.First of all, it is worth noting that the last ten years the history of Mastercard's stock price growth is well-described by the exponential trend that acts as a specific average:This indicates an exponential increase in the company's share price, which is normal for an average public company and thus no technical signs of the local bubble appear.Throughout the year, the rolling annual total price return of Mastercard's stock has been fluctuating around the average. This is also a sign of stability.So, technically, Mastercard's stock price looks balanced.Speaking of Mastercard, there are several stable and quality dependencies which allow to judge how balanced are the current capitalization of the company.The first one is a strong dependence between Mastercard's revenue TTM absolute size and the company's capitalization:As you can see, this relationship identifies Mastercard's current capitalization as almost balanced. Moreover, according to analysts' average expectations, in Q1 '20, Mastercard's revenue TTM will be around $17.3 billion, and in my model, all other things being equal, this means that the company's balanced stock price will exceed $300.But, having considered the long-term relationship between Mastercard's revenue growth rate and its EV/Revenue multiple, it should also be recognized that the current ratio of the multiple is in the “expensive” zone:In the last quarter, Mastercard's revenue TTM growth rate wasn't the highest in the last five years. But, in the same time, the EV/Revenue multiple is almost at a record high.Going further, based on the long-term relationship between the EPS TTM absolute size and the company's capitalization, Mastercard's current price is balanced.If we take the analysts’ average expectations as a basis, within the bounds of this model the company’s balanced price per share in Q2 2020 will be around $350. It looks promising.But these relationships are not the only ones by which one can judge the fundamental state of Mastercard. And if you dig deeper, you will discover even more interesting one.In the long term, companies often demonstrate a strong direct relationship between return on equity (ROE) and the P/BV multiple. We can find an example of such a relationship in the case of Mastercard:As you can see, in this case, the current value of the P/BV multiple is below the balanced level.Also, it should be recognized that the ROE TTM of 126% is impressive:Data by YChartsLooking at all these graphs and models, I come to the conclusion that Mastercard is gradually becoming transformed from a “growth” company into a “profit” company. And that would be a problem if it were not for the huge acceleration of profitability Mastercard has been demonstrating for the last three years. Now, Mastercard's Bearish Beta (a measure of how a stock price tends to drop when the market is only down) is more or less equal to the Bullish Beta (a measure of how a stock price tends to rise when the market is only on the rise). It means that Mastercard's stock price is equally sensitive to both the overall decline of the stock market than and its growth.But at the same time, the overall Beta coefficient is relatively high, and this is alarming because Beta is a good indicator of speculative interest which tends to affect the volatility."
4295762,95006,2019-10-09T13:29:22-04:00,This analysis of Mastercard stock uses a 10-year time frame and assumes a recession will occur at some point over that period.It projects expected returns from sentiment reversion-to-mean and business/shareholder yield based on the last economic cycle.It offers a Buy/Sell/Hold suggestion and shares a strategy to take advantage of Mastercard's current sentiment cycle.,"SourceTraditionally, most of my analysis on Seeking Alpha has focused on how to avoid losses and how to profit from the price cycles of classic cyclical stocks. There is another group of stocks, however, whose stock prices and earnings fluctuate far less than the classic cyclical stocks I have traditionally written about. While these stocks aren't as cyclical as a ""classic cyclical,"" they can still be subject to large swings in sentiment and can go through what I call ""sentiment cycles."" Recently, I have been adopting some of the techniques I've used with classic cyclicals and applying them to sentiment-driven cyclicals. Today's stock is one of those.One of the major assumptions I make for both approaches is that history is the most reliable guide to the future. My experience has been that 80% of the time, even if we looked at nothing else, a stock will behave in a similar manner as it did the previous cycle or two unless there is a disruption to its core business. For this reason, I don't rely much on predictions of future earnings or sentiment that aren't supported by their existence during past cycles. That doesn't mean that ""this time is different"" isn't true sometimes - it just means that my analysis isn't counting on this time being much different. That said, if I think a stock is currently a ""Buy"" based on my 10-year, full-cycle analysis, before I invest I will examine the forward-looking trends and narratives more carefully to make sure there aren't major changes in the works that could affect the business.The main differences you'll find between my analysis and others' are that: 1) I focus on a clear 10-year time frame and the compound annual growth rate (aka CAGR) one might expect over that period of time; 2) I assume we will experience a recession during that time period, and I build that into the expected returns; 3) I try to calculate the expected returns based on a full business cycle; 4) I usually share both a basic shareholder return estimate and a more conservative shareholder return estimate, where I lower expected returns for companies with higher debt levels and raise them for companies with higher cash levels; and 5) I usually provide an ""opportunity risk/reward analysis"" if a stock is a ""Sell,"" so that we can get an idea of how likely it is that the stock will trade low enough to become a ""Buy"" again over the next few years.As part of the analysis, I calculate what I consider to be the two main drivers of future total returns: Market Sentiment returns and Business/Shareholder returns. (Within the Business/Shareholder return category, I further break down where the future expected returns will likely come from: dividends, buybacks, business reinvestment, and earnings growth. This can help paint a clearer picture for investors who prefer to get their expected future earnings from one category or another.) I then combine the CAGR estimates from Market Sentiment and Business/Shareholder returns to get an expected 10-year, full-cycle CAGR estimate. Currently, I consider an expected 10-year CAGR > 12% a ""Buy,"" 4-12% a ""Hold"" and < 4% a ""Sell.""With that, let's get into the analysis.Since I use different approaches for analyzing a stock based on how cyclical earnings are, historical earnings cyclicality is the first thing I examine. Let's take a look at Mastercard's (MA) historical earnings using a F.A.S.T. Graph, which is a great tool for this sort of analysis:I break down earnings cyclicality into five basic categories. The first category I call ""secular growth."" This category describes earnings that continue to rise every year, even during economic recessions. The next three categories are ""low,"" ""moderate"" and ""deep."" ""Low"" is usually for businesses which have earnings that have a history of declining in the single digits percentage-wise during downturns, but not much further than that. ""Deep"" I consider earnings that fall more than -50%, and ""moderate"" somewhere in between low and deep. And last but not least are businesses whose earnings go negative during cyclical downturns but recover soon after that, which I call ""highly cyclical."" For businesses that have earnings in the deep or highly cyclical categories, I use an entirely different type of analysis, so it's important to determine at the outset which category a stock falls into.Every year since 2006 when Mastercard went public it has grown its EPS. For me, this is good enough to place the company's historical earnings in the ""secular growth"" category, and on a scale of 1-8, I would rate Mastercard a ""1"" in terms of historical EPS cyclicality.For stocks ranked a ""1,"" their price cycles are not usually explained as much by earnings fluctuations as they are by changes in market sentiment. In Mastercard's case, with EPS this stable, it is appropriate to use a 10-year, full-cycle analysis (which focuses on earnings and sentiment) rather than the shorter-term, price-cycle-based analysis (which focuses on historical price cyclicality). So, using a 10-year, full-cycle analysis is what I will do.At this point, I want to impart a little bit of context after studying hundreds of stocks' EPS cyclicality over long periods of time. The first point is that that true 'secular growth' stocks like Mastercard are extraordinarily rare. I require that a stock at least be publicly traded since 2007 (before the last recession) to be considered a 'secular growth' stock. That way I know their business model has been tested through at least one recessionary period. I have found less than 20 publicly traded businesses on US exchanges that meet that standard and have grown EPS every year, including during recessions. So Mastercard's business is in truly elite territory with regard to its earnings growth stability.That said, often a business can go through one type of recession unscathed, and yet suffer more during another type of recession. Additionally, oftentimes businesses that go public within a few years before a recession as Mastercard did receive an influx of capital that they invest right before the recession that can help them grow through the recession. So I think that while it's undeniable that Mastercard is an elite and fabulous business, it's also important to point out that we probably shouldn't expect the business to go completely unscathed during the next recession, and we certainly shouldn't expect it to grow EPS at 60%+ per year as it did during the last recession.Unfortunately, since its closes peer, Visa (V), went public even later than Mastercard, there isn't a really good proxy that I can think of in order to estimate what sort of EPS cyclicality Mastercard might experience during the next downcycle. During the 2015/16 'industrial recession' we saw that Mastercard 'only' grew earnings at about 10%, though, so I think it's clear that Mastercard will not be totally immune during the next recession.With that context in mind, let's move on to the actual analysis.In order to estimate what sort of returns we might expect over the next 10 years, let's begin by examining what return I could expect 10 years from now if the P/E multiple were to revert to its mean from the previous economic cycle. With most stocks, I start the previous cycle around 2007, about a year before the last recession. However, since Mastercard grew EPS at an abnormally high rate during the last recession, I think it is more realistic to start measuring this cycle in 2009.Mastercard's current blended P/E is 37.26, while its normal P/E this past cycle has been 25.08. If over the course of the next 10 years, the P/E were to revert to 25.08 and everything else was held equal, it would produce a 10-year CAGR of about -3.88%.There are four components to the business/shareholder yield: the dividend yield, the expected buyback yield, the portion of the earnings yield that the business keeps to reinvest itself, and the full-cycle earnings growth rate. Ultimately, the business/shareholder yield is going to be limited by the earnings yield, so let's take a look at that.Data by YChartsMastercard's forward earnings yield is currently 2.78%.Since I'm using historical EPS estimates from F.A.S.T. Graphs for many of my calculations, I like to have a way to quickly check to see if a business is taking on debt (or already taken on debt) as a way to prop up those EPS numbers (often through stock buybacks). I like to look at free cash flow to equity/enterprise value yield in order to highlight potential problems. Looking at the longer-term chart typically also will show events like acquisitions, because there will often be a downward spike in the FCFE/EV yield. I tend to avoid stocks that have made bigger acquisitions or mergers and stocks that are borrowing money to buy back shares. So, this is a good, quick check for me to know whether I need to dig deeper or not.Data by YChartsThe FCFE/EV (and also the FCFE/market cap) as of the end of last quarter was essentially 0%. And since 2014 or so, it has mostly hovered in the 2-3% range. Since we are already dealing with pretty low numbers with earnings yield currently under 3%, I'm going to go ahead and use the earnings yield number for my analysis with the understanding that it's actually an optimistic number and not a conservative number. If the price of Mastercard were to fall and I started considering harder whether to buy it or not, I would take a closer look at the more conservative estimates, though, and try to pinpoint the cause of the currently low FCFE/EV yield. Personally, I don't really care how management chooses to allocate earnings, as long as how earnings are allocated isn't completely irrational. It is perfectly fine for me if a company takes its earnings and reinvests them in the business as long as it can do so successfully. And if the business is no longer growing much, I am satisfied with collecting a large dividend. Or, if the company's shares are cheap, I'm also happy with it buying back stock. Mostly what I care about is what the earnings yield is, and how much I can expect it to grow over the next 10 years so that I can estimate my likely return on the investment over that time frame.Currently, 0.48% is coming back in the form of a dividend from Mastercard. Let's see if we can expect something to come back in the form of a stock buyback.Examining the buyback history serves two purposes. The first is, much like the dividends, we want to know as investors how our money is being allocated. If the stock price of the business is low, then buybacks are a very efficient way of returning money to shareholders, especially if they are paid for with earnings instead of borrowed money. If the stock price is high, then buybacks are not a wise use of funds, because the returns might be lower than an investor might be able to get if they received a dividend and invested in something else or if the business invested in itself. The worst case is when a business is borrowing money to buy back expensive shares. I usually avoid businesses that are doing this, and I consider the practice a flashing warning sign that management's interests are not aligned with shareholders.Second, since I use long-term EPS trends in order to estimate earnings growth, I want to know how much stock was repurchased over the last cycle, so that I can back out those stock repurchases when making my earnings growth estimates.Data by YChartsMastercard has been fairly steadily buying back shares over the course of this cycle, having reduced their shares outstanding by about -25%. I'll back these share repurchases out of my EPS growth estimates later on in the analysis.Next, I want to check the more recent 3-year and 1-year buyback trends in order to estimate what sort of buyback yield we might expect over the next cycle.Data by YChartsData by YChartsAt current prices, I think it's reasonable to expect around a 1.77% buyback yield from Mastercard going forward. If we add the 0.48% dividend to that, it leaves about 0.53% for Mastercard to reinvest in its business. So about 1/5 of Mastercards earnings are going toward its dividend, about 3/5ths are going toward buybacks, and about 1/5th is going back into the business. This is interesting because if investors are planning on holding Mastercard stock for a very long time, they should be hoping for lower stock prices so MA can buy back those shares at cheaper prices. Right now the price is very expensive, yet that is where Mastercard is spending most of its earnings. Since I am interested in how much money Mastercard might be earning over the next 10 years, I also want to take into account any additional earnings from EPS growth that might occur over this time period. I'll estimate that by looking at the previous cycle, in this case, measured from 2009 through 2019, and I'll remove the effects of stock buybacks. When I do the math on that, I get a cyclically adjusted earnings growth rate of +17.83%, which is an absolutely fantastic rate of growth for a business the size of Mastercard.Next, I'll apply that growth rate to current earnings looking forward 10 years in order to get a final 10-year CAGR estimate. The way I think about this is, if I bought Mastercard's whole business for $100, it would pay me back $2.78 per year, and that amount would grow at +17.83% per year for 10 years. I want to know how much money I would have in total at the end of 10 years on my $100 investment, which I calculate to be about $176.53, and that translates to a +5.85% 10-year CAGR.Potential future returns can come from two main places: market sentiment or business/shareholder returns. If we assume that market sentiment reverts to the mean from the last cycle over the next 10 years, Mastercard will produce a -3.88% CAGR. If the business/shareholder yield and growth are similar to the last cycle, the company should produce a +5.85% 10-year CAGR. If we put the two together, we get an expected 10-year, full-cycle CAGR of +1.97%. This is significantly below the 4% threshold I use for a ""Sell"" rating, so Mastercard is currently a ""Sell"" for me.Since I think Mastercard is a good business but is simply priced too high, it's worth looking at the odds of the price falling to a level where we could buy it near its average P/E ratio if we sell at today's levels, versus what we might miss out on by rotating out of the stock at today's prices.The first step of this process is to see during how many years since Mastercard has traded publicly that it has traded below its average P/E of $25.08, and at some point during each year in 9 out of the past 14 years, you would have had a chance to buy the stock below its average P/E. The most recent year the P/E traded that low was in 2016. So, it doesn't seem unreasonable to me to think that during the next economic slowdown, or perhaps even before then, Mastercard's P/E will fall at least to that 25.08 level. (During the last recession, the P/E fell below 15.) If the company's P/E contracts from its current multiple of 37.26 to 25.08 while earnings are held steady, the price would drop about -32%.In order to estimate the opportunity risk/reward, I use F.A.S.T. Graphs' forecasting tool to estimate future price appreciation, including dividends, for the next 2-3 years using analysts' estimates. I assume we will have an economic slowdown after that point. What I want to know is, if a recession begins in 2-3 years, whether I will have a reasonable chance to buy the stock at a significantly lower price than it trades today or if I would likely never get a chance at a lower price.Forecasting out 2-3 years to the end 2021, including dividends, we can expect to add $127.33 to Mastercard's current price. That gives us a price estimate 2-3 years from now of $401.39 using today's 37.26 P/E ratio. If the stock price at that point reverts to its mean, it would lose about -32% of its value and produce a price of $272.97, which is essentially where the stock trades at today. So, even if we were to go over two years before the stock price reverts to its average P/E ratio and assume the analysts' growth expectations between now and then are correct, we would still probably get a chance to at least get back to even on the stock. If a correction were to start tomorrow, however, we could expect to lose over -32% of today's price. And if we were to have a recession, Mastercard traded at similarly high ~42 P/E multiple in 2008 going into the last recession and the stock price fell -60%.Data by YChartsAll things considered, Mastercard stock has much more downside risk than upside risk, unless one thinks the next recession is very far down the road.For these reasons, I don't see much opportunity risk in rotating out of Mastercard stock today.I am currently writing a series about high-quality businesses that are overvalued, like Mastercard. You can read about the strategy in these three articles: Part 1 ""Ignore Sentiment Cycles At Your Own Risk,"" Part 2 ""Mitigating Sentiment Cycles"" and Part 3 ""Sentiment Cycles: When To Sell And When To Buy Back Again."" My current suggestion is that owners of Mastercard who would like to avoid part of the eventual correction in the stock rotate out of it and into a 50/50 mix of the Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF (SPLV) and the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) until Mastercard's price falls to a more reasonable level that offers better forward returns. My expectation is that owners would be able to increase the number of Mastercard shares they own by 20-25% using this strategy without spending any additional money. (To see how this strategy works, read the three articles linked above.)I will track how this idea performs each month going forward, along with over a dozen other high-quality, overvalued stocks I have written about this year.

4292992,102548,2019-09-23T09:55:27-04:00,"Mastercard’s stock outperforms the market in the long run.The long-term stock price momentum remains justified by the recent growth rate of their earnings and intrinsic value.Call options on Mastercard are currently inexpensive, offering an opportunity to gain an elevated ROI on Mastercard.","Mastercard's (MA) stock price has been rising strongly throughout 2019, continuing its long upward trend move. We believe this uptrend is justified by the recent quarterly earnings the company has achieved (especially the growth in card count) and the current forward P/E ratio of 30 reflects the future growth prospects of this credit card company.As the long-term uptrend of Mastercard continues its way upward, we do get opportunities from time to time to purchase stock options of this company at a discount, as we will see in this article. We will close our review of Mastercard with a trade proposal investors that traders can use directly to benefit from Mastecard's growth.In the past weeks of August, the stock price of Mastercard has finally broken through the resistance price level of $280. In the beginning of August the stock price was still dropping as low as the $255, in line with the general stock market index. Worries about the US-China trade war created a volatility spike in asset prices, pushing their levels down sharply.Source: finviz.comComparing the stock price of Mastercard with that of the major stock market index (SPY), we can see Mastercard moved in tango with the market: the decline started on 5 August and the stock rebound together with the index in the following days. By 9 September the stock price of Mastercard declined strongly compared with the S&P 500 index:Source: stockcharts.comWhen we compare the long-term stock performance of Mastercard, we can see the stock has strongly outperformed the major stock market index over the last 10 years. An investment in Mastercard delivered a 1,900% return on investment while the index returned (only) 300%:Source: stockcharts.comThe outperformance started early in 2009, and the current stock price momentum is not slowing down its speed. In the last three years, Mastercard outperformed the stock market every year:Source: stockcharts.comOne share of Mastercard costs $271 today, bringing the total market capitalization value to $250 billion (the 18th-largest market cap, right after AT&T (T) and before Verizon (V)).When we compare the stock price performance of Mastercard with its main competitors (the credit card majors), we can see Mastercard has outperformed them all in the previous three years:Source: stockcharts.comMost people will know the main product of Mastercard, the commonly used credit cards, but few people are aware of the business model behind their earnings and the impressive stock price return this stock has delivered to its shareholders. In this article, we will have a look at their fundamentals and see whether they justify the momentum in the stock price. We will then present a trading idea to benefit from this stock in which we will focus on the risk/reward ratio.The revenue of Mastercard came in last quarter at is currently $4.11 billion for Q2 of 2019. This means a year-over-year growth of 12.2%, quite impressive for a stock whose revenue has been growing at double-digit rates for years. Growth in revenues has been consistent, quarter after quarter throughout the last 10 years, with accelerating growth in the most recent years.Source: created by author, with data from stockrow.comA similar growth can be seen in their book value per share and the yearly ROIC and ROE rates.Source: created by the author with data from stockrow.comMastercard generates revenue by the fees it charges to its issuers and acquirers for delivering services (e.g. domestic payment transactions, fees from international transactions, clearing services, offering network connectivity). These fees are mainly determined on a total transaction volume basis. The volume of these transactions has been growing steadily, as electronic payments are on the rise (the shift from paper to plastic). During the second quarter of 2019, the growth continued its momentum:Source: Mastercard's corporate websiteWhile the growth in the most recent quarter is solid, these business results are mostly an extension of their long-term success story. While more and more payments are digitalizing, the total number of credit card transactions increases strongly. As Mastercard shares a duopoly with Visa on this market, we can expect their revenues to continue their growth as long as the digitalization goes on.In my article of 12 May 2019 earlier this year on Mastercard, I described why I thought an investment in Mastercard makes sense and how to construct a trade with a improved risk/return profile. In the period since the trade proposal was made, Mastercard has reached a high price of $300, with the call option appreciating as well.Since the recent price decline, as of 9 September 2019, this price appreciation of the call options has evaporated. This makes sense as the underlying stock price has declined sharply on a short timeframe and the expiration date of the options has come closer to date. When we look at the historical price performance of MA we can see these short-term price corrections have occurred on a recurring basis, after which the stock price rebounded again and the option premium rose consequently.In the table below we gave an overview of the historical dates on which the stock price of Mastercard declined over 2% in one day and the stock price performance following in the next 3 months and 2 months:Source: created by the author with data from YahooAs you can see from the table above, MA's stock price tends to rebound strongly after price declines. This is in line with the long-term upward price chart of Mastercard we have placed in the beginning of this article.For this reason we would advise to purchase call options on Mastercard's common stock, when these price declines occur. This will allow the purchaser to enter in the long-term trend of the stock, often at a favorable price entry point.Mastercard has seen its stock price rising strongly in the previous years, systematically beating the S&P 500 stock index and its main competitors. This can be explained by the company's strong fundamentals and the ongoing digitalization of payment transactions. We expect this outperformance to continue in the future with a rising MA stock price.Investors who believe in Mastercard can buy common stock at $271 or purchase call options. We prefer the latter alternative, mainly because the implied volatility is this low. Call options are not expensive at these anticipated volatility levels, and investors can use this fact to make an investment in Mastercard. This will improve the risk reward ratio as the required investment in call options is much lower compared to buying 100 common stocks of Mastercard."
4291797,41961,2019-09-16T12:32:45-04:00,"Mastercard has numerous competitive advantages which have helped provide exceptional investor returns.The business has also benefited from several strong secular tailwinds which have assisted growth.The prolonged shift to e-commerce, adoption of M-POS and smartphone payment adoption all auger well for future growth .","Mastercard (MA) has been a fantastic investment for investors over an extended period of time. Its robust business model with strong barriers to entry has made it a business that investors can comfortably buy and hold. The difficulty for any new payments entrant to aggregate a significant volume of merchant and consumers at a large enough scale to be a meaningful threat is a daunting challenge. It requires significant capital, risk management, brand awareness and also displacing entrenched relationships. Mastercard is also riding numerous secular tailwinds that will continue to propel the business to new heights.While the shift in commerce volumes from in-store commerce to online commerce are causing significant concern for brick and mortar retailers, the trend is playing well into the hands of payment processors like Mastercard. Though electronic payments have been prevalent in developed economies for an extended period of time, cash and check-based payment still dominate overall payment volume. Mastercard estimated a couple of years ago that carded payment still only accounted for 10% of addressable total payment volume.The strong growth of e-commerce in global economies is helping to shift some of that balance, particularly in the retail sector from cash-based retail transactions over to ""carded"" volumes, given an inability to settle online transactions with cash. Curiously, this is having a particularly meaningful impact on unbanked and underbanked consumers who are now moving onto prepaid products issued by the payment networks, to experience the convenience that e-commerce provides. With almost 55M unbanked and underbanked households in the US alone that's a significant amount of potential spend that is being captured by Mastercard and others.With meaningful volume growth expected in global e-commerce over the next decade, Mastercard will have a natural tailwind to capture much of this commerce volume that was previously cash-based. While the interchange fees to the payment processors are lower for prepaid card product, this is revenue that would have otherwise escaped Mastercard and Visa (V). E-commerce volumes are set to soar globally over the next decade, increasing at double-digit growth, which will benefit the payment processors like Mastercard.Source: emarketer.comMastercard is a truly global business and one that is heavily leveraged toward emerging markets. 70% of Mastercard’s purchase volumes comes from international markets. In particular, Mastercard has almost 30% of revenues coming from the fast-growing emerging markets of Asia Pacific, where purchase volume growth is expected to be above trend given rapid growth in these economies. As per capita income steadily increases in these markets, consumer discretionary spending will also increase.Mastercard will not only be riding the natural cash to digital payments shift in these economies but will also benefit from a meaningful tailwind from increasing purchase transactions and purchase volume per subscriber. With much of the benefit from increase in incomes flowing through to younger, more digitally savvy workers in emerging markets who are more comfortable with non-cash payments, increases in income growth will flow disproportionately into higher carded payment volumes. This is a trend that has been observed in economies undergoing rapid economic transformation such as India.The last several years have seen the steady penetration of mobile point of sale (“MPOS”) hardware into small and midsize businesses by players such as Square (SQ) and PayPal (PYPL). Historically, small and medium-size businesses could not get easy access to the hardware and infrastructure necessary to accept carded payments. The costs of terminals were typically too expensive. Square has successfully disrupted this market with a much lower-cost reader that enables many mobile business owners (taxi owners, handyman, etc.) to start accepting carded payments. This is advantageous to small and mid size businesses in eliminating the heavy cash handling costs that they were otherwise incurring, but it also significantly expands the range of consumers that they are able to transact with.Of course, all of this carded payment volume will ride the rails of Mastercard and Visa. Estimates are projecting very significant growth in the mPOS market with 18% annualized shipment growth through 2024, or an estimated 35M merchants who have deployed mPOS. That's significant net new transaction volumes that would have not been possible for Mastercard or the other payment networks to capture which will now be carded.Source: Global Market InsightsThe introduction of smartphone-based payments through the iPhone has been a watershed moment for mobile payment. Apple Pay (AAPL) brought considerable convenience and utility to the idea of paying by phone. No longer does one have to fumble around for change or find relevant credit cards, with payment simply possible by pulling out their iPhone. The user numbers here are undeniable. Estimates put the number of Apple Pay users who have activated the Apple Pay service at over 380M, some 43% of all iPhone users. As the proliferation of accepting terminals increase, that will lead to even greater transaction volume and usage of the Apple Pay service. Notably, post the introduction of Apple Pay, the other major smartphone platforms quickly followed up with their own payments platform. Alphabet (GOOG), (NASDAQ:GOOGL) introduced Android Pay shortly thereafter and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) most recently debuted Samsung Pay on a select range of phones.Smartphone-based payment provides the user with considerable utility, not simply the ability and convenience of a faster payment transaction, but also with reconciliation and tracking of what’s been spent. Thus far, all of the major payment platforms have chosen to ride the rails of Mastercard and the other payment networks rather than looking to compete with alternate payment infrastructure. The continued success and growth of initiatives like Apple Pay augers well for Mastercard, as it means more transactions and more growth on the Mastercard network.Mastercard has a number of tailwinds which it is riding over the next decade which will ensure that the company continues to experience above-trend growth for an extended period of time. While the stock has appreciated almost 47% year to date and trades at 30x earnings, these secular tailwinds will continue to power growth for the business for a considerable time to come."
4291704,33291,2019-09-16T07:36:07-04:00,"Stock is up tremendously in 2019, as it was in 2018, and in 2017.We believe the stock is a buy on any sizable pullback.The growth is set to continue into 2020.Performance remains strong on all key metrics.","Mastercard (NYSE:MA) continues to deliver immense growth. In our opinion, the stock is a buy on any pullback and makes an excellent addition to any portfolio focused on growth. Make no mistake, the name has been priced for continued near-perfect performance of the underlying company. For years, the argument of the name being overvalued has been made, and yet, shares rise, year after year. This stock is one of the best investments you could have made in the last few years. The company continues to grow into its valuation, and as such on the next big pullback we will be encouraging our members and followers to buy the stock again. That said, the name has pulled back from its 52-week high this week quite sizably, so we think its a buy right now.Make no mistake, you are paying for performance. We say this because the Street has essentially baked into share prices continued beats against consensus estimates, growing volumes, well-managed expenses and double-digit growth in earnings. On the bearish side of things, any earnings missteps would send the name falling. Perhaps the greatest risk to ongoing performance would be a recession that slows consumer spending (and as such, less charges/swipes are made with cards), so keep that in mind. But as of now, Mastercard keeps delivering. This is evidenced by its multiple being 40 times trailing earnings, and 35X forward EPS.Right now, the stock has seen a rare pullback. It is a growth machine and Mastercard has now more than tripled from where we recommended it at $90 a share. With the exceptional growth the name is showing, the valuation has been justified. Can this run continue? We think so. In this column, we examine trends in sales and earnings and discuss our expectations looking ahead.So the stock has pulled back, but the data remains strong. The recently reported quarter saw another impressive top line, with solid increases in second quarter revenues over the past three years:Source: SEC filings, graphics by BAD BEAT InvestingRevenues were indeed stellar. The results strongly suggest that the company will continue its stable and reliable growth. Net revenue for the quarter came in at $4.1 billion, a 15% increase over Q2 2018. This was primarily due to better than expected performance in gross dollar volume and a large increase in processed transactions.Mastercard saw a 13% jump in gross dollar volume, surpassing our expectations for 12% growth, and saw an 18% increase in transactions to approximately 21.4 billion. The transaction growth drive the huge gains we saw in revenues, and continues an impressive trajectory:Source: SEC filings, graphics by BAD BEAT InvestingNot only is this growth above what we thought we might see for volumes, but it is simply impressive for a long-standing company like Mastercard and shows the company is still executing to near perfection.Of course, with so many more transactions processed we need to be on the lookout for rising expenses possibly pressuring margins.If there is one area of weakness that we can pinpoint it is that operational expenses do continue to rise rather sharply, right in line with rising revenues. Expenses grew year-over-year vs. last year by 17% on an adjusted basis. On a currency neutral basis, expenses were up just 1%. This is very well done considering the rise in revenues. However, continued investment in strategic initiatives as well as normal operational growth expenses resulted in the expense trend moving higher:Source: SEC filings, graphics by BAD BEAT InvestingMake no mistake, we hate to see rising expenses, especially when the percent increase in expenses outpaces the percent increase in revenues. Of course, on an absolute dollar basis, the growth in revenues outpaces the growth in expenses. Total operating expenses were $1.7 billion for several reasons including primarily spending related to strategic initiatives, as well as higher promotional spending and of course acquisition-related integration expenses. There was also a 5-point hit from hedges.When we factor in the increase in revenues, as well as the increase in expenses, we still see that it led to operating income increasing 23% as reported. This is simply 'winning.' Adjusted operating margin expanded to 57.6% from 56.6% at the midpoint of the year comparing H1 2019 to H1 2018. With this margin expansion, earnings per share continues to impress, and you really cannot ask for better results.Of course, as expenses continue to rise, we keep an eye on their impact, but the fact is margins expanded so far year-to-date. The expense growth is justified by the pace of revenue growth. This has us bullish on this pullback, especially when we factor in the billions of shares repurchased over the years. With the continuing tremendous performance, we have seen a nice bump in earnings per share:Source: SEC filings, graphics by BAD BEAT InvestingIt is undeniable to even the most ardent bears. Simply put, every year the company has been expanding its bottom line, and meaningfully so.Investors have been rewarded in this stock. This most recent quarter was no exception as the company saw net income widen to $2.0 billion from $1.6 billion, hitting $2.00 per share, up 33% from last year. When we adjust for this and other items, we see that the more comparable adjusted net income came in at $1.9 billion, up 15% from last year's $1.7 billion. What is more, earnings per share on an adjusted basis were up 17% to $1.89, and this trounced our expectations for $1.85 per share in adjusted earnings. This outperformance stems from higher than expected revenues, a commensurate increase in expenses, and the company also repurchased $1.9 billion worth of stock, 7.7 million shares). With this established growth, we see 2019 delivering impressive continued gains over 2018.Factoring in the trajectory of Mastercard's performance year-to-date, and considering the trends in new cards being issued, transaction volume, and gross dollar volumes, we remain bullish. Based on what we are seeing and what we expect for H2 2019, we now see revenues coming in at $16.8-$16.9 billion and earnings coming in at $7.60-$7.75.With earnings per share growing 30-40% every year, the stock's valuation of 30-40 times forward earnings is justified. The company grows into its performance. This pullback is a chance to come in and buy the dip, as rare as it may seem. The gains will continue until there is a clear recession. Right now, there are 'fears' but until we see confirmation of a truly stalled economy, we remain bullish. Mastercard is a buy here at $275.If you like the material and want to see more, scroll to the top of the article and hit ""follow""."

But it's OK.Proceeding from the current earnings forecasts, Mastercard is now fairly priced by the market.","I would like to offer a comparable valuation of Mastercard (MA) through historical-priced and forward-priced multiples. I provided something similar for Visa (V) the other day, and judging by the comments, not everyone has understood correctly the sense of such an analysis.I believe that a direct comparison of multiples does not give a correct result because companies are always in different phases of their business cycles. Accordingly, when comparing multiples, we should adjust them to the growth rate. In my calculations, I used a four-year CAGR.So, here's what I did.Based on historical data, I calculated the EV/Revenue, EV/FCF and EV/EBITDA multiples for each company on my list (PayPal (PYPL), Visa and others from the FAAMG list). Then, I adjusted these multiples for the growth rates of the basic indicators. And finally, I determined the median of the values ​​for each of the multiples and calculated how much a share of MasterCard should cost if its multiples corresponded to the median.Also, based on estimated data, I calculated the P/E (forward) and P/S (forward) multiples and adjusted them for the expected annual growth rates of earnings and revenue, respectively. And, in the same way, based on the median, I determined the implied price of Mastercard share.So, let's start with the EV/Revenue to growth multiple:As we can see, the comparable valuation based on the EV/revenue to growth multiple has shown that Mastercard is the most expensive company on my list except for Visa.But, as in the case of Visa, history teaches that it is absolutely normal for the market to evaluate Mastercard like this:Comparing Mastercard through the EV/EBITDA to growth multiple, we obtain almost the same result:Comparing Mastercard through the EV/FCF to growth multiple, we obtain the same result again: the current implied price is several times lower than the actual price.In July 2018, it was even higher. Obviously, this is due to the current extremely low long-term growth rate of Mastercard's FCF.So, it is obvious that in terms of the demonstrated growth rates of revenue, EBITDA, and FCF, Mastercard is practically the most expensive company on my list.But, most likely, all this doesn't tell the whole story, because the listed multiples are based on the historical data, but an investor usually invests not in what the company has now, but in what, in his opinion, it will have in the future.So, let's look into the future and do the similar comparable valuation using the P/E (forward) and P/S (forward) multiples adjusted by the expected annual growth rates of earnings and revenue.Let's start with the P/S to growth (forward) multiple. In this case, the implied price is significantly lower than the actual price. By the way, a similar situation is observed in the case of Visa.And, the most interesting, this is what we get after analyzing the P/E to growth (forward) multiple. In this case, the implied price of Mastercard share is a little bit higher than the actual price. And I think that this is the most correct result.Having conducted the similar analyses for Visa and PayPal, I came to the conclusion that the comparison based on the P/E to growth (forward) multiples gives the most qualitative fundamental valuation for companies of this type. And therefore, I conclude that Mastercard is fairly priced by the market now."

Click here to find out more »Cash transactions are dying out; digital transactions are becoming the norm. The extent differs across countries but there is a good correlation between ceaselessness and internet penetration across countries. Mastercard (MA) is positioned well to benefit from a long term shift away from cash and towards card and electronic payments, and the trend is clearly in this direction.Graphic Source: Mastercard Business Payments 2022 White PaperRecent acquisitions have given MA a real edge, and the most recent purchase of Nets gives a platform for expansion in new payments across Europe and complements its existing UK-based assets. I think MA shares represent good value at the moment even as the market is pricing shares at a seemingly premium 42x price-to-earnings multiple. As I detail in the article, I believe the $9 EPS target is achievable in FY2020 and considering payment providers trade anywhere from 40-50 times earnings, a conservative 30-35 times multiple range would still provide shareholders with decent upside potential.MA has announced the acquisition of the Corporate Services business of Nets, a privately held, Denmark-based payments platform, for approximately $3.19 billion. Through Nets, MA is getting access to a dense network in Denmark and Norway for account-to-account businesses clearing, instant payments, and e-billing services, with presence in continental Europe.The acquisition is expected close in the first half of 2020, and the assets will be added to the ""New Payment Platforms"" segment which includes Mastercard Send, Transfast, Transactis and Vocalink. Vocalink serves the account-to-account (A2A) fast Automated Clearing House (ACH) market in the UK, Transfast does A2A cross-border payment, and Transactis handles bill payment.Graphic Source: MasterCard 2019 Annual Stockholder Meeting WebcastMA's strategy is to offer a comprehensive payment solution for banks, businesses, governments, and people. This means providing debit and credit card services to customers directly or through partnering banks, making in-roads in the growing real-time and after payments business be it business-to-business (B2B), peer-to-peer (P2P), bill payments, business-to-customer (B2C) or A2A, and offering bill payment options, in real-time and also the typically lower cost batch clearing services.It also needs to offer these services cross-border. MA has a presence in the UK, South America, and Asia-Pacific, and can now tick off Europe more generally with the Nets acquisition assuming it takes the opportunity to move beyond the Scandinavian heartland of Nets, where some 300 thousand merchants are users.I think it is noteworthy that the deals have already been acquired to implement faster payment services in Italy, Slovenia, and Hungary. MA has now made 13 major acquisitions or investments since 2016, each one improving its exposure to payment flows, now it is primed to benefit from volume growth in each of the channels. The graphic below provides insight into how this strategy will play out.Graphic Source: Mastercard Business Payments 2022 White PaperAlso exciting is the possibility of building applications on top of the assets it has acquired. These would be value-added services like data analytics offerings and fraud detection and prevention and provide even more service growth potential aside from transaction volume and flows.MA has already reported gross dollar volumes rising by 13%, processed transactions increasing by 18%, with cross-border activity up by 13% in local currency terms in a conference call in July 2019.Graphic Source: MasterCard 2Q19 Earnings PresentationThough there has been some concern around its overall US market share (despite volumes growing), where it has purportedly been losing out to Visa (V), which has targeted volume growth more so than MA, the latest set of growth numbers indicate otherwise. MA has outgrown V across geographies in its latest quarter with even the US segment outperforming (+10% YoY vs Visa's +8% YoY).Graphic Source: Visa 3Q19 Earnings PresentationThe strong results come as MA, as mentioned previously, has added payment channels rather than pushing volume, and has done so in multiple markets.Also note that the Federal Reserve is launching a real-time payments system - called FedNow - in the US alongside The Clearing House being developed by a host of major banks, and for which Vocalink powers the real-time payment infrastructure for.I see more potential for MA compared to its peers outside the US - the rest of the world - particularly in India, China and Europe.A licence to enter the Chinese domestic payments market is expected, but the timing is uncertain.India lags the rest of the world in the adoption of non-cash payments, and there is a push there to change this. MA has been making headway in the country, with recent examples including the launch of a co-branded credit card with Flipkart - owned by Walmart (NYSE:WMT) - in India.The Payments Services Directive 2 (PSD2) regulation in Europe means that third-party providers can initiate payments for users directly from their bank accounts, breaking the monopoly of banks over their customer's data and actions. It also limits costs, requires stronger identity checks, and offers better protection against fraud. Rather than being a worry for MA, this could be a positive development. Consumers will have more choice over how they pay, and buying Nets and Vocalink, for example, makes MA more likely to be chosen. Also, European acceptance of different payment methodologies is likely to boost acceptance more generally, and again, MA is positioned well.MA has reported that the Nets acquisition will dilute earnings-per-share for up to two years after the close of the deal. This is because of accounting conventions and one-time costs of integration. It is important to bear in mind that Nets is not a loss maker that burns cash.The good news is that EPS will grow steadily over time. I do not expect the 40% or so growth in adjusted EPS seen for the 2018 fiscal year (FY2018), but growth in the 15-20% range is certainly plausible. MA has also consistently posted pre-tax and net income margins of near 50% and 40% respectively, and double-digit revenue growth. Graphic Source: MasterCard 2019 Annual Stockholder Meeting WebcastIn my base case, I envisage a scenario where revenue growth falls back towards 10% (from 19.6% for FY2018) in the coming years as the global economy cools. This leads me to an EPS estimate of about US$ 9.00 per share for FY2020. As payment providers have price-to-earnings multiples of anywhere from 40-50 times, and since MA offers a wide range of solutions including offerings in new payments, it could justify having a multiple near the upper end of this range.Source: Created by author using data from CapitalIQConservatively, I feel 30-35x is a reasonable range to consider and using this multiple assumption on forward earnings, arrive at a price of $ 270.00 - 315.00. Currently, the stock is trading at just about US$ 272.00 and is, therefore, at the lower end of what I deem to be the fair value range for MA shares. However, given MA's competitive strength and ability to compound earnings at above-average rates, a PE multiple of 35x EPS is certainly not out of the question.MA consistently delivers revenue growth, and margins hold up well. It has a defensible competitive moat and its technologies are difficult to replicate at the required scale. In addition, it continues to acquire or invest on-trend with continuous expansions into new payment areas.Globally, MA is positioned to benefit from the trend towards cashless payments across multiple channels, particularly in India, Europe, and possibly China. Competition is high, but the threat of new entrants is limited to major players or debutants. Regulation is always a concern in the industry, but as explained with European regulation, a well-positioned player like MA, can potentially take advantage of this.As MA has a superior ongoing growth model compared to peers such as V due to its exposure to international markets and new payment technologies, a premium multiple would not be out of the question. Even assuming the market prices MA closer to 35x EPS, there remains appreciable upside from here."

This stock is now up 233% since I last wrote about it on February 9, 2014. I believe that Insulet can still double again over the next 3-5 years.I also recently wrote about Visa (V), a competitor to Mastercard (NYSE:MA). I first wrote about it in early February of 2012. The stock is up a whopping 549% since then.Today, I am going to write about Mastercard, another big winner that I wrote about back in 2013. I last wrote about Mastercard on this week, six years ago. The stock was trading at $645.57 at the time. The title of my article was ""Mastercard: The Next $1,000 stock?"" At the time, Mastercard had a market capitalization of just over $78B.Today, Mastercard has a market capitalization of $275B. The stock is up over 252% since I last wrote about it. The shares easily crossed over the $1,000 (split-adjusted) mark that I projected with ease, and then some. Without a split, the stock would be trading at $1,626 today. Needless to say, I brought a big alpha deliverer to your attention at that time.Here is a screenshot from that article that I wrote six years ago of my 5-year valuation on the shares of Mastercard at that time (8/2/13).Data from Best Stocks Now DatabaseIn addition to the lofty target price ($1,160) that I presented in that article, I also shared another screenshot that showed the stock ranked at #73 overall out of the 3,439 stocks, ETFs, and Mutual Funds that were in my Best Stocsk Now database at the time.Data from Best Stocks Now DatabaseMy proprietary rankings are based on a combination of Value and Momentum.Mastercard also had excellent momentum characteristics at the time of the article back in 2013. In fact, it had a momentum grade of ""A.""Data from Best Stocks Now Database.I still own Mastercard today in two of the four portfolios that manage.Mastercard is one of the 19 stocks that I own in my Premier Growth Portfolio (Large-Cap). This portfolio is up about 25% YTD. It has been up as much at 35% this year. This portfolio seeks out the best of the best, large-cap growth stocks in the world today.Mastercard is also one of the 17 stocks that I own in my Dividend & Growth Portfolio. This portfolio is up over 17% YTD. It has been up as much as 22% this year. This portfolio focuses on companies that pay a dividend and are still growing their earnings at a rapid pace. This gives investors a good chance for capital appreciation and increasing dividends down the road.I would much rather invest in a dividend payer that is growing its earnings as opposed to dividend payers like MO, BP, and T, that are paying much bigger dividends but not growing their earnings much anymore.I also have an Ultra Growth and an Emerging Growth portfolio.My four portfolios are available to my premium subscribers. My subscribers also get to see the changes I make to these portfolios in real-time along the way.I will now explain why I still have a big position in Mastercard. I will also share my current five-year price target on the stock. I was more than right the first time around, and I am applying the same valuation methodology to the shares today that I used six years ago.Mastercard is one of the great IPOs of all time. During my 22 years as a professional money manager and research analyst, I have seen a lot of great IPOs, and this stock is right up there with the best of the best.The stock debuted back in April of 2006 at a split-adjusted price of about $4.00 per share. The stock closed yesterday at $269.31 per share. This works out to a gain of 6,625%! Again, this is one of the great IPOs of all time.We hear a lot about Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), etc., but I will put this less glamorous stock up against any of them. Mastercard provides global payment solutions supporting the credit/debit payment programs of financial institutions.Here is what the chart of the stock looks like since it went public:Mastercard is in the financial sector with a current market cap of $286B. I have it under a risk profile of Conservative Growth.Data from Best Stocks Now DatabaseWith the low-interest rate environment that we are in, I am not a big fan of the financial or banking sectors right now, but low interest rates actually benefit the credit card companies like Mastercard and Visa.As I mentioned previously, my stock selection is based on a combination of momentum and value. Let's next take a look at Mastercard's current momentum numbers.Data from Best Stocks Now DatabaseThe stock has delivered a lot of alpha to its investors over the years. The stock has outperformed the S&P 500 over the last one, three, five and 10 years. That is exactly what alpha is, excess returns over the market.The name of this site is ""Seeking Alpha."" Well, here is one of the best examples of what that looks like. There are obviously no guarantees that the stock will continue to deliver alpha, but we can look to its current valuation to give us some guidance going forward.My stock-picking methodology that I employ uses 5-year valuations. This helps me to focus further down the road and not get too shook up over short-term events in the market, sector, or stock. I am using the same valuation formula that I used six years ago to the stock today.Here you go, six years later, using the same exact valuation formulas.Data from Best Stocks Now DatabaseI still see a stock than has the potential to double again over the next 3-5 years. I currently have a $523 5-year target price. This gives the shares an upside potential of almost 98% five years from now. I like stocks that have 80% or more upside potential over the next five years. This stock easily meets my valuation criteria. But remember they must also possess momentum.Value investors make the mistake of not looking at momentum traits of their value stocks. This leads to far too many value traps.Conversely, momentum investors make the mistake of ignoring value before buying a stock. This leads to far too many momentum darlings like Beyond Meat (BYND) and Tilray (TLRY) that make no sense from a valuation point of view.Mastercard still has the two most important criteria in my stock selection process: Momentum and Value.When I apply my momentum and value algorithm currently to the shares of Mastercard, I still come up with a stock that is ranked at #118 out of 5,317. I like to focus on the top 250 or so as potential candidates for my portfolios. I check all of the charts daily of this all-important list.Data from Best Stocks Now DatabaseMastercard has more than tripled since I first wrote about it. It is currently one of the stocks that I own in both my Premier Growth and Dividend and Growth Portfolios. I believe that the stock can still double again from here.I am also active on Twitter. This is what I have had to say about the stock recently. Stay tuned!Thanks for stopping by!"
4290190,100666,2019-09-06T12:43:19-04:00,"The Pink Portfolio is the real-life portfolio that I have set up for our 5-year old daughter. I have added Mastercard to the Pink Portfolio.Mastercard has been a ten-bagger over the last decade. That doesn't mean that it cannot go on being a great investment, though.The company benefits from several tailwinds, such as betting, e-commerce, international expansion, and its B2B segment.Although Mastercard may seem expensive, because of its growth, it is always a good buy.The Pink Portfolio has done very well so far, and it beats the market substantially.","In May 2016, I started up the Pink Portfolio for our little girl. She was almost 2 years old back then, and she has become 5 on June 11. The system is quite simple: my wife and I add $150 per month to her portfolio and buy stocks with it. I focused mainly on dividend stocks in the beginning, but I have started adding growth stocks too and plan to add more.The last update that I have written is from June 2019, when I added PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). In this article, I report about a new stock I have added to our daughter's portfolio: Mastercard (MA).A quick summary for those who don't have much time to read the full article:I am sure you all know Mastercard and its core products. The Purchase, New York, based multinational has a current market cap of $285.47B. Its bread and butter is, of course, traditionally processed payments between the banks of merchants and the banks of their customers. But it does a lot more these days. The company itself says that it is 'connecting consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments and businesses in more than 210 countries and territories.'(Source)It also states:Coca-Cola (KO) vs. Pepsi (PEP), Home Depot (HD) vs. Lowe's (LOW), Boeing (BA) vs. Airbus (OTCPK:EADSF) (OTCPK:EADSY). Duopolies can be hugely profitable and often both companies (and both stocks) do very well. And that rule also goes for Mastercard and Visa.This is what Mastercard and Visa have done since Visa's IPO in 2008 (Mastercard's IPO was in 2006):Data by YChartsAs you can see, the patient investor has been rewarded by buying-and-holding both stocks. Both are ten-baggers and have beaten the S&P 500 index by a huge margin of more than 1,000%. But the less patient or more recent investor has had a lot to be happy about as well. This is what Mastercard has done YTD:Data by YChartsIf you are a dividend investor or looking for capital appreciation, Mastercard has got both. Although the typical dividend investor will look down on the paltry 0.46% dividend yield, that low yield comes from the high price appreciation. Mastercard's dividend has multiplied by more than 35 since its IPO in 2006:Data by YChartsDespite the huge dividend raises, because of the stellar stock performance, the dividend yield has always been lower than 1%, though:Data by YChartsMastercard's payout ratio has always stayed very low too, almost all of the time under 20%:Data by YChartsFor the Pink Portfolio, with such a long-term investment horizon, it would be shortsighted, in my opinion, to buy dividend payers like Altria (MO), AT&T (T), Macy's (M) or even Coca-Cola (KO). Yes, they still raise their dividends, but they don't grow their earnings (enough) to keep their pay-out ratio at the same level or lower. That is not a good strategy over the long term. If I take dividend stocks for a portfolio with such a long investment horizon, I want high dividend growth, combined with high earnings growth and a low payout ratio. Mastercard perfectly fits into this mold. But to each his own, of course.This is the dividend history of Mastercard:(Source: Seeking Alpha)As you can see, Mastercard has only a streak of 8 years of dividend raises. I expect the company to keep boosting its dividend by mid-teen percentages going forward, although it may be higher. The last dividend hike was a huge 32% (from $1 to $1.32 annually). Besides that, the company also installed a new share repurchase program of $6.5B, to boost shareholders' return even more.The company is still firing on all cylinders on the earnings side as well and you can see that in its most recent Q-10:The diluted earnings per share in the first six months of 2019 went from $2.91 to $3.80, an increase of more than 30%.Mastercard and Visa both benefit from the low-interest-rate environment. They have lower rates because their cost to borrow money sinks, but their own APRs stay as high as ever, averaging 17.8% now.A lot of consumers nowadays turn away from plastic cards, although the issues of Square's (SQ) and Apple's (AAPL) recent cards might suggest otherwise.(Square's Cash Card, source)(The Apple Card, source)But that doesn't mean that Mastercard or Visa become obsolete. They thrive in the new environment by adapting to new technological payment methods. Cash and checks are the big losers in the new era, and Mastercard can benefit from the transition. While Square's Cash Card works with Visa, Venmo's (PYPL) card works with Mastercard. Those two examples alone of arguably the two hippest payment apps available now show that both Mastercard and Visa will benefit from the cashless society.(Venmo card, source)A lot of the apps that are supposed to make Visa and Mastercard obsolete work with one of the two big systems and so they enable them to grow even faster. You can see that on this slide:(Q2 2019 earning slides)While the cards grew 6% YoY, not bad in any way, the star here is the switched transactions. These are the transactions that use Mastercard's software. It enables an interface (an ATM, POS, mPOS, etc.) to get the authorization from hosts such as your bank. Switched transactions grew 18%, and that is where the biggest growth will come from going forward too.Another important factor in Mastercard's growth is the globalization of the Mastercard system. The growth internationally is actually higher than in the US: 14% GDV growth in the rest of the world versus 10% in the US.(Q2 2019 earning slides)As you can see, the international GDV (gross dollar revenue) is more than double as big as the American. This diversification is a good thing for Mastercard since it makes it less vulnerable for national recessions. On the other hand, since the company reports in dollars, there are always fluctuations because of the many currencies that Mastercard deals with. You can see that on this slide that the currency-neutral growth for Q2 2019 was actually bigger than the reported growth in dollars:(Q2 2019 earning slides)Mastercard still develops its international pipeline. It has partnered with Angaza in February of this year to roll out a digital payment solution in emerging markets. Angaza removes the upfront costs for essentials like solar panels, cooking stoves, water pumps and other off-grid necessities in emerging markets like Uganda, India, Kenya, Malawi, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Sierra Leone and others. Because of this collaboration, Mastercard can dig the new oil of this digital era: data. The data of the unbanked in emerging markets are very hard to get, but this is certainly a way to do it.Of course, online shopping, another tailwind for Mastercard, won't fall anytime soon too. It is expected to keep growing at a healthy pace. This is a projection of Statista:Another growing market is online gambling. Mordor Intelligence expects that it will grow at a CAGR of 8.77% over the next five years:On May 14, 2018, the Federal Court removed the ban on sports betting. In a lot of states, sports betting is already legalized, and about all of the others are expected to follow soon. Only 8 states have not done anything yet, by which I mean legislation or pending legislation, to facilitate sports betting.The B2B services of Mastercard are a fast-growing segment too. Mastercard assists businesses streamlining and digitizing their payment processes in order to increase speed and security. This is a big market, and Mastercard has only started, and there remains still a lot of opportunities here. This is the answer Mastercard's CFO Sachin Mehra gave to analyst Bob Napoli's question about B2B on the last earnings call:The company doesn't split up this growing B2B business in its reports, but it is mixed with other initiatives, such as data, under 'Other revenues'. That category grew by 23% in the last quarter, even 24% on a currency-neutral basis.Mastercard is expected to earn EPS of $9.03 next year, according to finviz.com. That means that, while it has a high ttm P/E of 43, its forward P/E of 31 is somewhat more moderate. Despite the big rise in Mastercard's stock price in 2019, its P/E is actually lower than in 2018:Data by YChartsWith an expected earnings growth of 18.36% next year, the company trades at a 'forward PEG' of 1.69. In my opinion, that is not that expensive for a premium company.I think the low-interest environment we live in warrants Mastercard's higher multiple. Besides that, Mastercard is expected to have a CAGR EPS growth of 16.86% over the next five years according to finviz.com. That would mean the following for the valuation for the coming years:(Compiled by the author)And, this is just for five years. If you are a true long-term investor, you'll hold on for much, much longer. And probably, Mastercard will top the expectations, as it has almost always done. Look at this impressive track record:(Source: streetinsider.com)36 earnings results, 34 beats (a whopping 94.4%), 2 hits and just one single miss. That is really impressive! That also says to me that management knows very well how to navigate this business towards success and that it will probably continue its great streak for years to come.Despite the higher multiple, the stock could still return above 9% yearly over the next three years if the stock returns to its normal P/E multiple of 29, according to FAST graphs:Of course, any stock price could drop by, let's say, 40% or so in the next recession, but if you hold Mastercard shares for the long term (which is in my book at least a decade), you will probably have both high price appreciation as dividend growth.A lot of investors are afraid to invest in stocks like Mastercard because they always look overvalued. I used to be one of them. But if you look at the real long term, valuation matters much less. For the Pink Portfolio, with its investment horizon of at least 20 years and probably much longer, this means that I don't have to look at the valuation all that much.With all that potential under the hood, I thought Mastercard was an excellent addition to the Pink Portfolio. The stock has done extremely well over the last decade, and with the secular trends that it has as a tailwind, I expect that Mastercard will keep outperforming the market.As a whole, the Pink Portfolio beats the S&P 500 based on percentage points:The Pink Portfolio beats the market by an average of 17.7% since its inception. While this is a fun exercise, these numbers just show the return from the beginning. Some stocks have done better since I have added at lows, others have done about the same. Since I considered all positions as very valuable stocks for the long term, I don't mind that much for temporary underperformance.Just a remark before we go to the current state of the Pink Portfolio. As you might know by now, our girl's birthday is in June. But because of our, erm, let's call it inertia, we only have deposited the birthday money of her grandparents and our extra contribution in July. With the $150 of July, the extra birthday money and the $150 in August, I was able to buy two shares already, which excites me. This is how the Pink Portfolio looks like now:(Source: Compiled by the author; price = current price, purchase is average price of the several purchases per stock, cost is the cost of the broker, div py is dividend per year, prices: closing price August 30, 2019).As you can see, $150 per month (with extra bucks for birthdays and Christmas) can grow to a substantial amount. The total worth of the Pink Portfolio is already over $10,000 now. That is in just a bit over 3 years, with a small amount each month. That is the power of compounding!A few remarks:Even with $150 per month, you can make a great portfolio. I will keep adding money to the Pink Portfolio, and I intend to update you of every new purchase or on special occasions. I have added Mastercard to the Pink Portfolio because of the long-term potential of double-digit growth for years to come.If you want to see how the Pink Portfolio keeps growing, please push the ""Follow"" button.In the meantime, keep growing!"
4283207,65113,2019-08-08T12:05:00-04:00,"Mastercard has demonstrated another impressive earnings quarter.The stock is down significantly, which is likely to be as a result of profit taking.However, I reiterate my long-term bullish view on the company.","Back in May, I made the argument that Mastercard (MA) was a stock that was set for continued growth going forward. I had been covering the stock for quite a while, with several readers starting to ask why I'm not long the stock myself.Having initiated a position in June, the stock has continued to climb upward before seeing a significant tumble toward the end of July:Source: investing.comWhen Mastercard reported Q2 earnings at the end of last month, growth in revenue and EPS continued to be in the double digits:Source: Mastercard Q2 2019 Earnings PresentationMoreover, gross dollar volume continued to show growth both in the U.S. and abroad:Source: Mastercard Q2 2019 Earnings PresentationWith that being said, we can see that operating expenses also rose by double digits:Source: Mastercard Q2 2019 Earnings PresentationFrom this standpoint, we can see that the company has continued to show significant growth, and in particular I had previously cited growth in digital payments, online shopping as well as entry in emerging markets such as India would pave the way for further upside.Taking into account the price drop, does this now mark a good opportunity for investors to get in at a discounted price? Given the growth we have been seeing, it's quite plausible that the drop in price is as a result of profit taking, with investors possibly becoming skeptical as to whether such growth can continue. However, let’s take a look at the company’s P/E and EV to EBITDA ratios to get a better overview of this company’s valuation trends.We can see that the company’s P/E ratio is significantly below levels seen in 2018 even though EPS has continued to rise:Source: ycharts.comOn the other hand, we can see that EV/EBITDA also is at a three-year high, which indicates that the stock may be expensive when taking pure earnings (before interest and taxes) into account.Source: ycharts.comWith that being said, EV/EBITDA has been on a continuous upward trend for the past 10 years. Mastercard is an example of an expensive stock that has always seen growth - investors are willing to pay a premium price for what they perceive as a premium company.Source: ycharts.comThe main risk to the stock at this point in time appears to be macroeconomic. With risk factors such as Brexit and the US-China trade war leading to a downturn in the S&P 500, there's the risk that a slowdown in consumer spending could therefore impact gross dollar volume and hence earnings, at least in the short term. However, my overall view is that if there's downside for the stock, then it will be significantly lower given the drop we have seen at the beginning of this month, which is likely to be attributed to profit-taking.Overall, the fundamentals of this company remain strong and I anticipate further growth over the long term. While we may see a certain degree of downside (depending on whether the market downturn becomes particularly severe), I remain confident in Mastercard’s long-term prospects. I'm long and staying long."
4292602,105354,2019-09-19T21:02:58-04:00,"Mastercard provided optimistic guidance on its future growth.The company will employ a “one-stop shop"" strategy across all payment flows for consumers and business.I believe Mastercard shares are worth $303 per share, with limited upside of 9.6% from current levels.","Mastercard’s (MA) long-term prospects look especially bright. The company has made significant progress diversifying its business over the past years, expanding geographically as well as introducing new products and services. With a number of key initiatives already in place, and more on the way, MA is well-positioned to capture opportunities across payment channels, with a clear path to becoming a one-stop shop in global payment flows.I believe the shares should trade at $303 based on a 33x multiple on forward earnings per share of $9.2, implying an upside of 9.6% from current levels. MA shares' YTD outperformance (+52%) has limited the potential upside, and it may be more prudent to wait for a pullback.Mastercard hosted its latest ""Investment Community Meeting"" last week, highlighting the company’s various incremental opportunities and expanding total addressable market. It has laid out a strategy to become a “one-stop shop” across all payment flows for consumers and business through a three-pronged focus: 1) becoming a multi-rail payment network, 2) leveraging partners, and 3) embracing digital commerce.The key takeaways are as follows:1) The company will employ a “multi-rail” strategy to drive future growth. MA’s business has long moved beyond the traditional card business. The company addresses various opportunities on the horizon through innovative products, digital solutions, and by supporting different payments across multiple rails.Under the multi-rail strategy, the company offers solutions across all layers of payments, i.e., infrastructure, services, and applications, which will be powered by recent acquisitions.(Source: Page 12 of Investment Community Meeting Presentation)Recall that MA acquired VocaLink in 2016, an payments technology platform operator for UK-based payments, to boost its alternative payments capabilities. Further, it has agreed to acquire the account-to-account payment business of Nordic platform Nets. Following the Nets acquisition, the company holds real-time network management relationships covering >30% of global GDP by volume.(Source: Page 40 of Investment Community Meeting Presentation)2) Mastercard expects to be dominant in B2B payments, underpinned by its Mastercard Track product. The company introduced its Mastercard Track Business Payment Service, a new brand that will combine services such as supplier/buyer directory services, accounts payable/receivable automation, and partner-developed software. The product, which aims to support a range of payment solutions including cards and real-time ACH, will be distributed through MA’s buyer and supplier networks (banks and trade organizations) starting 2020.(Source: Page 33 of Investment Community Meeting Presentation)MA already has a big presence in the B2B payment space, but it could get a lot bigger - the payment volume opportunity could reach $125 trillion.(Source: Page 30 of Investment Community Meeting Presentation)Under CEO Ajaypal Banga’s direction, the company’s network has further diversified its services, focusing on a broader set of payment flows including B2B services, which represents a key growth lever for payment transactions.(Source: Page 85 of Investment Community Meeting Presentation)I do think this is the right strategy, as the payment business continues to be one of the most disruptive and dynamic financial service businesses. While the opportunity seems large, the net contribution to MA’s growth will likely be incremental rather than a step-change increase.3) The move to digital commerce presents a significant opportunity for MA, as the digital business is growing at 4x the rate of standard retail. The company’s distinct positioning allows it to facilitate commerce in various forms, such as e-Commerce, In-App, NFC, QR, Text, and Voice.(Source: Page 22 of Investment Community Meeting Presentation)MA management maintained its medium-term financial targets (which included performance through 2021) as outlined at the January 2019 conference. The company is expected to grow its revenues at low-teens CAGR through 2021, supported by modest share gains in the core consumer market, expansion in the adjacent B2B, P2P, and B2C markets (representing a $180 trillion opportunity), as well as via its offerings in safety and security, data analytics, and loyalty. Consequently, it expects to grow EPS at high-teens CAGR through 2021 - assuming annual operating margins of 50% is maintained over the period.(Source: Page 93 of Investment Community Meeting Presentation)For 3QTD, Mastercard’s volume metrics are essentially in line with guidance. This was positive news considering many had expected weakness in some parts of the global economy.(Source: Page 86 of Investment Community Meeting Presentation)In the event we do hit a rough patch, however, management thinks there are some expense levers they can pull, should a recession hit in the future. Additionally, the per-transaction fee should mitigate the impact of a decline in transaction volume, with some consumers more likely to make lower-ticket transactions in a recession.Taking the lower end of management guidance, I estimate revenue can grow by 10.6% on average annually, from $16.7 billion in 2019 to $22.03 billion in 2021. Accordingly, average annual net profit growth is projected to grow by 11.5%, from $7.95 billion in 2019 to $10.71 billion in 2021, driven by improved net operating profit margins, from 58% in 2019 to 60.5% in 2021, from higher margins in its payment services.In terms of capital allocation, plans are to focus on investments, acquisitions, dividends, and share buybacks. In the short term, acquisitions may have a greater priority over shareholder return, as the company has focused its investment priorities on growing, diversifying, and building.(Source: Page 88 of Investment Community Meeting Presentation)However, we see risks ahead, including slower consumer spending, share loss in key markets, litigation and regulatory issues, FX volatility, and slower B2B payment options - all of which could be detrimental to the achievement of the company’s guidance.On that note, I think diluted earnings per share could hit $9.20 in FY2020, representing a 17.9% year-on-year growth - in line with guidance for high-teens EPS growth. Mastercard should thus trade at $303.6 per share using a 33X P/E multiple on forward earnings - based on the average P/E of similar companies, such as Visa’s 33.9X P/E, PayPal Holdings' (PYPL) 51.24X, and American Express Company’s (AXP) 14.72X. As Mastercard shares have increased by 52% YTD, the P/E multiple-based valuation implies limited upside of 9.6% from current levels.Mastercard's various growth levers for the future, including a multi-rail strategy across infrastructure, services, and applications, is encouraging. Moreover, new products which will take advantage of its buyer/supplier network to boost its payment flows capabilities show the company is not resting on its laurels. Overall, the company's medium-term financial targets at low teens for revenues and high teens for the bottom line seem achievable. However, shares offer little upside from here following the YTD rally, as the market seems to have already priced in a lot of the optimism."
4281648,41961,2019-08-05T10:56:11-04:00,"Mastercard has been on fire, up over 40% YTD and almost 300% in the last four years.The company has a low-risk business model to repel would-be disruptors, providing steady returns and allowing investors to sleep well at night.The difficulty in replacing such a high-quality, consistent business should provide investors pause in selling Mastercard.MA has still only captured a small percentage of its addressable market and has a long growth horizon.","Mastercard (NYSE:MA) has been a core holding of mine in my growth portfolio - Project $1M - since 2015. Over that time, the business is up almost 3x, delivering a compound return of 32 % p.a. This year alone, Mastercard has appreciated almost 43% compared to gains of just 20% for the S&P 500. Given such a strong run, it naturally begs the question of whether the stock has run too far too fast and whether it may be time to take some profits. In spite of its heady growth, I don't plan to sell a single share. There are four key reasons why.While it seems that credit cards have been around for years in Western economies, the level of credit card penetration globally is still surprisingly low. Cash payments and checks still dominate in an international context.While the level of cash-based purchases has been steadily declining in developed economies, Mastercard cites a global credit card penetration of just 10% of addressable payments volume, which includes cash, check and ACH payment. There are likely years of growth to come in addressing the remaining 90% of global transaction volume that is still non-card based.Source: Mastercard 2017 Investor DayOnline commerce is still a small but growing share of retail commerce in the global economy. It is a trend that has barely scratched the surface in developing economies. Online commerce lends itself to card-based settlement rather than cash. Even in developed economies, e-commerce is just touching double-digit percentages in terms of total transaction volume.There is an increasing acceptance of credit card payments in areas that were dominated by cash. The emergence of mobile POS systems such as Square (SQ) allows for acceptance of credit cards by a variety of mobile professionals who were previously cash based only.The steady growth in disposable income and GDP per capita in emerging economies will result in an increase in consumption and purchase volume, much of it likely to be put on cards. Given non-US GDV accounts for almost 65% of Mastercard's business, it is particularly well positioned to benefit.Credit card networks have huge moats. It's not an easy task to set up a network, with banks needing to issue the cards, consumers to use the cards, and merchants to accept the cards. The network effects are significant and not easy to replicate. To be successful in removing incumbents in a payments ecosystem requires immense consumer awareness, significant capital, and a great deal of sophistication in risk management.There are very few players that can say they have that combination of skills. Sure, there's been a lot of noise about new payment systems, bitcoin, litecoin, and other cryptocurrencies. The lack of success that any of these technologies have had in creating broad based payment acceptance is painfully obvious to witness. With such dramatic variation in price of these instruments, people are loathed to look at these new currencies as any type of store of value.Any pretenders to the throne would need to win over both consumers and merchants, and do so at scale. It's hard enough to convince just one of these groups, either consumers or merchants, that they should consider an alternate payment mechanism, let alone being able to simultaneously convince both, in large numbers.Mastercard continues to post some impressive numbers for such a large business. For a company that reported almost $15B in revenue in 2018, it's natural to expect growth rates to decelerate over time; however, MA isn't showing any signs of a noticeable slowdown. The company recently reported 2Q revenue of $4.1B, a year-over-year increase of almost 15%, impressive for a business of Mastercard's scale. This revenue growth has been relatively steady and consistent over an extended period of time, with the business averaging revenue growth of almost 13% on an average five-year basis.Mastercard tends to share some of the spoils of success with its merchant customers in the form of client incentives and rebates, best considered as promotions and incentives for winning and retaining business. While the amount of these incentives varies from year to year, it has been generally steady in recent years, allowing MA to report consistently improving operating margins as a result of economies of scale benefits from increasing transaction volume and generally fixed technology costs. Operating margins have consistently increased from 53% in 2014 to 57% in 2019.Source: Morningstar.comWhile Mastercard's long-term outlook appears sound, with ample room for growth and an entrenched competitive position, the company's valuation multiples have been steadily increasing, with the business now sitting at the high end of its historic forward P/E multiples. Forward earnings multiples over the last five years have ranged from 23 to 36 currently. However, even if Mastercard is only valued at the midpoint of its historical valuation range, at say 28x earnings, if the company can continue to grow earnings over the next five years at a similar rate to the last five, it will still produce relatively low-risk, mid- to high-single-digit returns.Source: Morningstar.comMore important than the steady returns the company promises, a sale of Mastercard raises the ""quality of reinvestment"" dilemma in needing to find an alternate home for the proceeds. Unless one chooses to park the proceeds in cash and earn 2% returns, alternative homes for the cash in the equity markets face a number of structural risks, whether it's retail disruption from online commerce, a low interest rate environment for commercial banking, or consumer brand disintermediation by technology firms.Mastercard's historical consistency of earnings, coupled with riding secular tailwinds and propelling future growth, provides the prospect of continued, stable if not spectacular future returns."
4280445,50452,2019-08-01T19:25:27-04:00,"The ""Fear of Missing Out"" is a very real psychological phenomenon that can impact investors' decision making.Mastercard is still growing at a high rate, but the company's shares have outrun the actual growth of the business.The stock is overvalued, and at significant risk of PE compression.","One of the trickier aspects of investing psychology is a phenomenon known as ""FOMO"", which stands for ""Fear Of Missing Out"". What this means is that when a stock steadily appreciates, it creates doubt in the minds of investors who didn't buy in at an earlier stage in the game. For example, consider payment services technology company Mastercard (MA). Since January, the stock has appreciated nearly 50%. This has left many investors kicking themselves for not investing before the stock's massive run. This regret can tempt investors to pull the trigger on these high performers in fear of missing out on the stock's future potential. But while Mastercard qualifies for the growth label, the stock's appreciation has significantly outrun the company's value. Investing into Mastercard now would put investors at risk of PE compression that could take several years to burn off. We take a closer look at these risks below, as well as identify where it would make sense to look for an entry point.Mastercard certainly qualifies for the ""growth"" label, both as a company and as a stock. The company has grown like a weed since going public back in 2006. Over the past decade, top line growth has averaged more than 11% (per year), and EPS has grown at a rate of more than 16% over that same time frame.Source: YChartsThe consistent and sizable growth that Mastercard has experienced is the result of two factors. The first being that Mastercard benefits from owning the second largest market share of the global payment card market (second to Visa (V), because Union Pay is operated by the Chinese banking industry). Mastercard branded debit/credit cards are used all over the world. This position in the market share hierarchy gives Mastercard both presence/stability (especially in the US market), as well as the upside that comes with potential gains in market share.Source: Business InsiderMastercard's positioning also gives it exposure to macro-economic growth from a large scale trend of consumers migrating to non-cash payments. While there is plenty of growth still occurring in mature markets, there is even more room for expansion in emerging markets where middle class systems are developing.Source: World Payments Report via DWThe majority of the world's non-cash transactions occur in developed markets. As the rest of the world continues to modernize, the strong population base in markets such as India, etc. offers a long growth runway for these non-cash trends to continue. Mastercard will continue to grow as well. The company's 5-year average revenue growth rate in 2009 was 14%, and 12% as of last year. Revenue growth has remained quite stable, so we expect consistency to continue (we expect at minimum high-single-digit revenue growth) moving forward, given macro trends of the payments industry.While we are bullish on continued growth at Mastercard, it is still possible for positive sentiment to push the stock faster than the actual growth of the business itself. In the chart below, we can see that, despite strong EPS growth, the stock's PE ratio has trended higher over the course of the past decade.Source: YChartsIf the stock price and growth of the business were in rhythm, the PE trend line would be flat rather than trending higher. Both the TTM PE ratio (46.06X) and current full year's PE ratio (35.77X) sit above Mastercard's 10-year median earnings multiple of 28.11X.In these circumstances, we have two options. We could justify the discrepancy and adjust our valuation expectations. For example, maybe the company's growth outlook has improved over time, and the stock now deserves a higher earnings multiple. If this doesn't apply, the stock may truly be overheated, and investors would be wise to avoid the stock until a more attractive valuation presents itself.Mastercard's growth over the past decade has ballooned the company to a market cap of $284 billion. The company generates more than $15 billion in annual revenues. At a certain point, the math behind growing large numbers begins to make it increasingly difficult to maintain such a rapid growth pace. Analyst consensus also points to a minor slowdown over the next five years. While we see the potential for growth to maintain (or come close to) its current pace, we don't find it likely that Mastercard will accelerate the growth of its business moving forward from recent performance. Because of this unlikeliness, we don't feel that the currently elevated valuation is justifiable.Given the stock's current 28% premium to historical norms (even using this year's estimated EPS), there seems to be a very high risk of PE compression present in Mastercard shares. PE compression is essentially when an overvalued stock reverts back to its ""normalized"" valuation. This typically means underperformance for investors who bought at elevated valuations.To illustrate what this could look like for Mastercard, let's plot out the next few years below. Based on the current share price of $272 per share and estimated EPS of $7.63 in FY19, $9.02 in FY20, and $10.65 in FY21, we will project potential share prices based on a few valuation scenarios.Now, the point of this chart is illustration, and some of these circumstances are less likely than others. For example, it's unlikely that Mastercard will drop to 22X earnings (from all the way up at 36X) within a matter of months without some catastrophic market event. However, it is very possible that Mastercard reverts back to around 25X-28X earnings over the next few years. I last bought Visa about two and a half years ago at 25X earnings (which seems like forever ago). Today, Visa is trading at 33X this year's earnings, so these types of valuation movements do happen. With Mastercard at a similarly steep valuation, we expect minimal upside over the next couple of years. Should the stock retreat to the approximate $214 level that would replicate historical norms, we like Mastercard as a long-term holding. Sometimes ""fear of missing out"" can cause investors to do just that.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."
4267061,65113,2019-05-29T13:02:35-04:00,"Mastercard has significantly outpaced the S&P 500 this year in terms of growth.Increasing digitization of the global payment market, along with growth in India both mark significant opportunities for this company.I continue to take a bullish view on this stock.","Back in December, I made the argument that while I remain optimistic on Mastercard’s (MA) growth, growth could moderate going forward.The main reason for my argument was that pressure on card payment fees in Europe coupled with growing difficulties in entering the Chinese market due to domestic competition could mean that the company might see lower levels of growth as a result.That said, the stock shows no signs of slowing down. Since December, Mastercard’s share price is up by 27% compared to 7% for the S&P 500.Moreover, we see that EPS (normalized diluted) has shown significant growth since 2018, while the P/E ratio of 42.2x is still significantly below the high of 48x seen last year:Source: ycharts.comIn spite of my prior fears regarding Europe and Asia, we see that growth in gross dollar volume has remained in the double-digits, even if having moderated somewhat since 2018:Source: Mastercard Form 10-QAdditionally, we observe that while net revenue showed slightly below double-digit growth at 9%, this was accompanied by a 5% decrease in operating expenses coupled with a decrease in the effective income tax rate – resulting in a 25% increase in net income compared with that of last year:Source: Mastercard Form 10-QFrom a valuation standpoint, given that the P/E ratio is significantly below levels seen in 2018, it is increasingly likely that further upside exists for the stock given recent growth rates.In spite of short-term challenges that Mastercard may face such as cutting of fees for EEA transactions due to regulatory considerations, there are three particular reasons why I see this stock continuing to have significant upside.Online shopping in 2019 has hit a significant milestone, with total market share of sales conducted online outpacing that of department store sales.This is of particular advantage to credit card retailers – given that the incidence of credit card usage will typically be higher online than in brick-and-mortar stores.Specifically, Mastercard saw an 18% increase in transactions from the year earlier to 24 billion, with a significant part of this being driven by online transactions.Moreover, with Mastercard having recently partnered with Apple (AAPL) and Goldman Sachs (GS) to form the Apple Card, allowing for digital payments through iPhone devices, the company is making the right moves to take advantage of increasing digitization in the marketplace and ultimately bolster transaction volumes.Aside from the company’s partnership with Apple, Mastercard’s partnership with Samsung is particularly noteworthy, as both firms are seeking to develop a new digital identity security system for smartphone devices. This would allow users to make payments in an easier manner, whereby biometric data or a single user ID could be used in place of multiple login details.In particular, the purpose of these secure digital identities would be to allow consumers to verify their identity without disclosing personal information. This would be done with the aim of making it easier for consumers to open and access bank accounts or make online payments in an easier manner.If the initiative is successful, then this would significantly reduce the transaction costs associated with making digital payments, and would allow Mastercard an even larger digital footprint.While I recently stated that the Chinese market may be somewhat of a tough nut to crack due to domestic competition and regulation, the Indian market is one that could in fact prove to be particularly valuable to Mastercard going forward.Specifically, the company intends to invest $1bn in the country over the next five-year period, and it is expected that the value of digital transactions in India will be worth over $1 trillion by 2025.Moreover, as users from rural and semi-urban areas increasingly make use of digital transactions, the user base is expected to increase from 90 million in 2018 to 300 million by 2020.In this regard, Mastercard is eyeing a big opportunity in the form of the Indian market, and I estimate that this country will form a large part of growth for the Asia Pacific region more generally.My overall conclusion is that Mastercard will continue to grow vibrantly. Aside from the fact that the stock appears to still be trading at quite a reasonable valuation on a P/E basis, the company’s growing digital payment capacity and its expansion into vibrant emerging markets means that the demand for Mastercard’s offerings have far from peaked. I see further upside from here."
4276090,104502,2019-07-19T14:08:57-04:00,The payments industry is being driven by two trends: contactless credit cards and the move to a cashless society.MasterCard has been riding that wave to higher revenues and big gains in stock price.MasterCard's return on equity is four times that of Visa.,"Two merging trends, the increased use of contactless credit cards and the growing belief that society will become cashless, have propelled MasterCard's (MA) stock to new heights. The payments industry is still in the early innings of this new game, and MasterCard is well positioned to capitalize on the changes.Currently 82% of Millennials believe society will eventually become cashless, according to a TD Bank Consumer Spending Index. That's unlikely to happen any time soon, but people are increasingly using cards for smaller payment amounts. A report from payments and business services company Square (SQ) said that in 2019, for transactions under $20, consumers paid with cash only 37% of the time, a 9-percentage-point decrease from the 46% cash usage in 2015. And this will only decline as more people use their phones to pay for things.Part of that drop in cash payments comes from the increased adoption and ease of contactless credit cards, which are replacing swiping or inserting plastic. While the U.S. has adopted contactless payments at a slower pace than other countries, both MasterCard and its top competitor, Visa, have been riding that wave to higher revenues and big gains in stock price.MasterCard's stock is up 47% year-to-date and more than 200% over the past three years. The global electronic payments processor, based in Purchase, N.Y., will continue to benefit as the transition from cash to plastic accelerates worldwide.Last year, MasterCard's revenues jumped 20% to $15.0 billion. Adjusted net income surged 39% to $6.9 billion, or $6.49 a share. For the first quarter of 2019, the company reported revenues climbed 8% to $3.9 billion. Adjusted net income leapt 13% to $1.8 billion, or a $1.78 a share.The company reports second-quarter earnings on July 30. Thomson Reuters has a consensus earnings estimate of $1.83 a share for the second quarter. For the full year, the earnings estimate is $7.63 a share, an 18% increase from 2018. Earnings are expected to grow another 18% in 2020 to $9 a share, and 19% in 2021 to $10.69 a share.Bryan Keane, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, raised his price target on MasterCard to $330. Currently the stock is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 35. If you multiply that by the $9 earnings forecast for 2020, you get to $315. If you multiply it by the $10.69 a share estimate for 2021, I get a price target of $374.Operating margins came in at 57% last year. Value Line forecasts operating margins of 58.8% this year, and 62.5% in 2020.Both MasterCard and Visa (V) have similar business models. They let banks, credit unions, or other financial institutions issue cards with the payment processor's branding on the cards. They then process the payments and transactions between cardholders at point of purchase and the merchant.With a network in place consisting of merchants, consumers, and banks, there is a high barrier to entry into the payments industry. That network is defended by a moat of regulation, security, and fraud protection that no technology company wants to deal with, Lisa Ellis, payments analyst at research house MoffettNathanson told Barron's.On average, both Visa and MasterCard take in just 15 basis points, or 0.15%, per card transaction, according to estimates by Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette. The low fee decreases the incentive to displace Visa and MasterCard. Yet, the fee brings in huge amounts of cash because of the enormous volume that flow through the networks.Last year, Visa did $11.2 trillion in total payment volume on 3.3 billion cards outstanding, while MasterCard did $5.9 trillion in payment volume with 2.5 billion cards outstanding.The Nilson Report, a leading payments trade journal, estimates that the global purchase volume of credit, debit, and prepaid cards will rise to $78.5 trillion by 2027 from $23 trillion in 2017, according to Barron'sAbout 43% of global consumer purchases were made on cards last year, up from 28% in 2010, according to MoffettNathanson, putting the increase at about two percentage points annually.In 2018, Visa and MasterCard had 57% and 30%, respective shares of the global card purchase volume, excluding the Chinese market, versus 8% and 1% for American Express and Discover, according to MoffettNathanson estimatesSo, why pick MasterCard over Visa (V)? Because, MasterCard's return on equity last year was 125%, while Visa's was 32%.As people stop using cash, the move to electronic payments will be the growth driver for both companies. Compared with China, the U.S. is far behind in terms of digital payments. This means the U.S. is a huge opportunity for MasterCard.Earlier, this year, Apple (AAPL) announced it would launch the Apple Card credit card, which would be linked to Apple Pay and integrated into the iPhone Wallet app. It would also offer tools to help users manage their spending. The card is a joint venture with Goldman Sachs (GS) and it will use MasterCard's network. With the Apple Card expected to launch this summer, the partnership will give MasterCard a leg up with digital payments in the U.S.Finally, MasterCard's float is being reduced by 10% every five years. In December, the company announced a new share buyback program. It plans to repurchase $6.5 billion worth of common stock as soon as it finishes the $4 billion buyback program it started in 2017. It also raised the annual dividend 32% to $1.32 a share."

While the stock is not particularly cheap at current prices, any pullback down the road should be considered a buying opportunity in the stock.Consumers all over the world are increasingly replacing cash with more efficient methods for payments, and Mastercard is one of the main beneficiaries from such a trend. The company owns one of the most recognized brands in a business in which brand recognition and customer trust are crucial differentiating factors.With a presence in more than 200 countries, Mastercard is the second-largest payment processor in the world. The company has over 2.5 billion brands in circulation, and it processed 19.2 billion transactions in the first quarter of 2019. This massive scale provides a key source of competitive advantages in areas such as the network effect and cost efficiencies.Customers want the cards that are accepted everywhere, and merchants need to accept the cards that can bring more customers to the stores. This means that merchants and customers attract each other to a leading payments platform such as Mastercard, creating a self-sustained virtuous cycle for the company.In addition to this, a large percentage of the operational costs in the industry are related to building the technological infrastructure necessary to process payments. Massive scale allows Mastercard to distribute costs on a large revenue base, reducing costs per transaction. It would be remarkably difficult for new and smaller players in the industry to achieve the same level of cost efficiency from a smaller revenue base.Since costs tend to increase at a slower speed than revenue, profit margins tend to expand over time. Strong revenue growth in combination with a larger share of revenue being retained as profits has allowed Mastercard to deliver exponential increases in cash flows and earnings over the years.Data by YChartsThe most recent earnings report from Mastercard confirms that the business keeps firing on all cylinders as of the first quarter of 2019.Fundamental momentum has been a powerful return driver for Mastercard's stock over the past several years. In simple terms, stock prices incorporate a particular set of expectations about the future of the business, with variables such as sales and earnings being amongst the most relevant factors.If the company consistently delivers earnings numbers above expectations, this means that forward-looking expectations will tend to increase over time, and rising earnings expectations can be a powerful fuel for the stock price.The chart shows the average earnings estimate for the company and the actual reported numbers over the past 12 quarters. Mastercard has an impressive track record in terms of exceeding market expectations.Source: Seeking Alpha EssentialThe chart below shows how revenue and earnings forecasts for Mastercard have significantly increased over time. Like usually happens, the stock price and fundamental expectations are moving in the right direction.Data by YChartsIn simple terms, Mastercard is not only doing well, but the company is also consistently performing above expectations. As long as this trend remains in place, fundamental momentum should be a strong tailwind for the stock.The discounted cash flow valuation for Mastercard stock is based on the following assumptions:Based on these assumptions, the stock should be fairly valued at around $264 per share, which represents a discount of 4.15% versus the current price.This valuation exercise is not intended to estimate the company's true intrinsic value in a precise way. Far from that, discounted cash flow valuations necessarily carry a high margin of error, since it's practically impossible to predict free cash flow generation over the long term with much certainty.The main point is assessing if the stock is reasonably valued or not based on achievable assumptions about free cash flow generation. In this particular case, Mastercard stock is trading roughly in line with such a fair value estimate.The PowerFactors system is a quantitative algorithm available to members in The Data-Driven Investor. This algorithm ranks companies in the market according to a combination of quantitative factors that includes: financial quality, valuation, fundamental momentum, and relative strength.In simple terms, the PowerFactors system is looking to buy good businesses (quality) for a reasonable price (valuation) when the company is doing well (fundamental momentum) and the stock is outperforming (relative strength).Data from S&P Global via Portfolio123The backtested performance data indicates that companies with a high PowerFactors ranking tend to deliver superior returns over the long term. Mastercard is in the top 4% of stocks in the market according to the PowerFactors ranking, with a score of 96.02 as of the time of this writing.The value factor ranking is reasonable but not particularly attractive at 62.64. However, the stock ranks remarkably well across the other indicators considered: quality (99.42), fundamental momentum (79.72), and relative strength (94.84).In simple terms, Mastercard is not undervalued at current prices, but other quantitative indicators look quite bullish for the stock, and the big picture is still quite solid from a multi-factor perspective.Mastercard is a high-quality business that generates impressive financial performance and has consistently outperformed market expectations over time. At current prices, the stock is fairly valued, but not particularly cheap.For investors who are holding Mastercard over the long term, the stock looks well positioned for solid performance at these prices, but it won't be easy for the company to outperform the market by a wide margin from current valuation levels.One thing looks quite clear, though, if there is any significant price pullback over the middle term, this could create a big buying opportunity in Mastercard."

An investment in Mastercard delivered a 1,700% return on investment while the index only returned 291%:Source: stockcharts.comThe outperformance started early in 2009, and the current stock price momentum is not slowing down its speed. In the last three years, Mastercard outperformed the stock market every year:Source: stockcharts.comOne share of Mastercard costs $246 today, bringing the total market capitalization value to $250 billion (the 19th-largest market cap, right after Walt Disney (DIS) and before Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A)). When we compare the stock price performance of Mastercard with its main competitors, we can see Mastercard has outperformed them all in the previous three years:Source: stockcharts.comMost people will know the main product of Mastercard, the commonly used credit cards, but few people are aware of the business model behind their earnings and the impressive stock price return this stock has delivered to its shareholders. In this article, we will have a look at their fundamentals and see whether they justify the momentum in the stock price. We will then present a trading idea to benefit from this stock in which we will focus on the risk/reward ratio.Fundamentals of MastercardThe revenue of Mastercard is currently $14.95 billion for 2018 (up from $5.0 billion in 2009). Growth in revenues has consistent, quarter after quarter throughout the last 10 years, often with double-digit growth rates.Source: created by author, with data from stockrow.comA similar growth can be seen in their book value per share and the yearly ROIC and ROE rates.Mastercard generates revenue by the fees it charges to its issuers and acquirers for delivering services (e.g. domestic payment transactions, fees from international transactions, clearing services, offering network connectivity, ..). These fees are mainly determined on a total transaction volume basis. The volume of these transactions has been growing steadily, as electronic payments are on the rise (the shift from paper to plastic). During the first quarter of 2019, the growth continued its momentum:Source: Mastercard's corporate websiteIn addition to these strong growth rates in earnings and return on equity, Mastercard's ability to turn earnings into free cash flow is impressive. Mastercard is able to generate large free cash flows, often as high as 40% of their revenues. The free cash flow is a well know metric to analyze how much cashflow a company can generate after all the capital expenditures have been deducted.Mastercard has been using these cashflows to return money to its shareholders, by buying back its own stock and paying out yearly dividends. Taking into consideration the strong free cashflow generation and the earnings growth, we can understand why the stock price has risen this strongly in the previous years.Opportunity: Buy long-term call options on MastercardConsidering these points above, we think Mastercard remains a strong investment in 2019 and in the upcoming years. The current P/E ratio of MA is 44, which may seem high, but when we take a closer look at their strong growth rates, it does not seem unreasonable. Anticipating their earnings will grow further in the future at their current growth rates, there is still plenty of room for their market valuation to appreciate further. This is confirmed by the higher earnings anticipated for Mastercard by market analysts.For this reason, we would suggest initiating a long position in a call option contract on Mastercard. In this way, you can minimize your required investment to benefit from a rise in the underlying stock price. Here we would suggest buying a call option contract expiring on January 17, 2020, with a strike price of $280 (around 13% above the current stock price).Source: nasdaq.comThis call option contract gives the holder the right to buy 100 shares of Mastercard for $280 at any time until 17/01/2020. The total cost of the call option contract will be $610 ($6.10 per common share).The trade has the following benefits:Source: optionistics.comIn conclusionMastercard has seen its stock price rising strongly in the previous years, systematically beating the S&P 500 stock index and its main competitors. This can be explained by the company's strong fundamentals and its growing revenue and the strong free cash flow generation figures. We expect this outperformance to continue in the future with a rising MA stock price.Investors who believe in Mastercard can buy common stock at $247 or purchase call options. We prefer the latter alternative, mainly because the implied volatility is this low. Call options are not expensive at these anticipated volatility levels, and investors can use this fact to make an investment in Mastercard. This will improve the risk reward ratio as the required investment in call options is much lower compared to buying 100 common stocks of Mastercard."
4267916,105096,2019-06-03T09:30:38-04:00,"Mastercard and Visa are both high-quality businesses and good investments. We have already recommended Mastercard as a Buy.We compare the two companies' historic volume growth, volume mix, earnings growth and valuation.Mastercard is ahead in growth rates and mix. While the stock is 15-25% more expensive, we prefer it marginally over Visa.At $254.19, our recommendation on Mastercard shares remains Buy.","Both Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V) are high-quality businesses with strong structural growth and entrenched market positions. We have already recommended Mastercard as a Buy (see article ""When Growth Beats Value""). In this article we will show a side-by-side comparison of Mastercard's and Visa's volume growth, geographic mix, earnings growth and valuation.For readers interested in the payments industry, this article is part of a series that has also covered American Express (AXP) (""Grows At 10%+ A Year, Until It Doesn't"") and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) (""Much More Expensive Than You Think""). Gross Dollar Volume (""GDV"") is the total volume that flows through a card company's credit and debit cards, covering both purchase transactions and cash withdrawals. Historically, Mastercard's GDV growth has been higher than Visa’s by 2-3% annually on a global basis, but lower than Visa’s for the U.S. alone until 2018, as shown in the charts below:(Note: For Visa's CY16 and CY17 global growth rates, we have excluded the impact of the Visa Europe acquisition in Jun-16, by using CY16H1 and CY17H2 growth rates as proxy to represent the full-year growth rates.)The large gap in the two companies' U.S. GDV growth rates in 2016 and 2017 was mostly due to the move of one co-brand partner (U.S.A.A.) by Mastercard to Visa. This was mostly in debit cards and represented lower-margin business. As we will see below, Mastercard continued to deliver strong revenue and earnings growth in those years.On total volume growth, Mastercard is the better performer.Mastercard has a more international volume mix, with only 30.0% of its CY18 GDV from the U.S., vs. Visa's 37.7% as shown in the charts below. This is a structural reason why Mastercard has higher growth rates - it has lower exposure to more mature U.S. market. International markets, including even many developed economies in Europe, remain significantly behind in the use of debit and credit card payments. We believe having exposure to such markets is an advantage.On geographic mix, we prefer Mastercard for being more international.(NB. For Mastercard, APMEA = APAC, Middle East & Africa. For Visa, LAC = LATAM & Caribbean; CEMEA = Central & Eastern Europe, Middle East & Africa.)In addition to having more international exposure, Mastercard also tends to grow its volumes faster than Visa in each international market. As shown in the charts below, Mastercard's volume growth rates in Europe and Latin America in CY18 were twice or more those of Visa; it also likely grew much faster in Asia Pacific, which is part of its ""APMEA"" region.The faster growth rates are an indication of how Mastercard has been more successful in signing up new partners across the world. Examples of Mastercard's bank issuers in China and in Brazil, both fast-growing economies are shown below - these are among the most important financial institutions in each country. Even in the U.S. home market, Mastercard has had a number of high-profile wins with new innovative players, for example being the network for all of PayPal’s US co-brand cards, and for the upcoming Apple Card to be issued by Apple (AAPL) and Goldman Sachs (GS).Mastercard’s growth has also been particularly strong in debit and prepaid cards, with their GDV growing 17.1% year-on-year in CY18 to reach 49% of Mastercard's total GDV. By comparison, Visa's debit card GDV (at 56% of total) grew ""only"" 8.1% in CY18, a growth rate that is actually slightly lower than that of Visa's credit cards (9.7%).On volume growth by region, Mastercard is the better performer. The key financials for Mastercard and Visa are shown in the tables below. Since 2013, Mastercard and Visa have delivered an almost identical CAGR in EPS of just under 20%. However, Visa's growth was helped by its 2016 acquisition of Visa Europe, which was an one-off opportunity.In addition, Mastercard's growth has begun to accelerate over Visa's - in 2018, Mastercard grew EPS by more than 40%, much faster than Visa's 32.5% in the corresponding FY18 (ending September 2018). Mastercard's faster earnings growth is the product of higher revenue growth (from higher volume growth described above) and more margin expansion. We expect this trend to continue, as Mastercard has consistently grown its GDV faster, and its lower margin gives more room for operational leverage and improvements.On earnings growth, Mastercard is the better performer.The tables below show the net income and cashflows for Mastercard and Visa. With respect to the last 12 months (ending March 2019), MA is trading on a 36.9x P/E and a 2.2% Free Cash Flow (""FCF"") Yield, while Visa is on a 32.1x P/E and a 3.0% FCF Yield.However, Mastercard's FCF has been reduced by a large cash outflow for customer and merchant incentive payments in 2018, which should reverse over time; excluding this, Mastercard's FCF Yield is 2.4%.On these metrics, Mastercard stock is between 15-25% more expensive than Visa, likely due to investor expectations of Mastercard continuing to deliver higher growth. We believe this premium is largely justified.On valuation, Visa is the more attractive stock.Mastercard and Visa shares have historically moved closely together, but with Mastercard catching up since early 2018 and outperforming in early 2019, as shown in the charts below:Mastercard and Visa are both high-quality businesses with strong structural growth and entrenched market positions. At $254.19 and $162.76 respectively, both Mastercard and Visa shares can be good investments.Assuming no de-rating, both stocks will deliver investor returns in the mid-to-high teens, given they expect to continue growing their EPS at double-digits (high teens in Mastercard's case). The high growth rates provide a margin of safety, ensuring a good return even the stocks were to de-rate somewhat.We prefer Mastercard between the two, because of its consistently higher volume growth (both globally and in key markets), higher international mix, and faster earnings growth in recent years. Our recommendation on Mastercard remains Buy."
4277792,102404,2019-07-25T18:48:18-04:00,"Visa and Mastercard are two credit card companies with a superior business model that makes both companies highly profitable and leads to double-digit growth.The powerful network leads to a competitive advantage for both companies, while Visa might profit from a “winner-takes-it-all” effect as it has the more complex and denser network.While growth rates are similar for both companies, Visa has higher margins, but Mastercard could report a higher return on invested capital.Right now, both stocks seem overvalued but should belong in every portfolio.","Visa (V) as well as Mastercard (MA) have been part of my ""Preparing for the end of the cycle"" series, and while it currently seems as stocks move forward to even higher prices, because investors don't expect the end of the cycle (the huge decline and economic contraction) yet, we can take another look at those two high-quality companies. In this article, I will not only provide an update on both credit card companies but also a comparison which of the two is the better investment.(Source: Pixabay)The business model for Visa and Mastercard is quite similar. Both companies provide transaction processing services (authorization, clearing, settlement) to financial institution clients (of Visa or Mastercard) as well as the merchant clients. Both companies are also providing value-added services like fraud and risk management or consulting and analytics and both companies operate almost all over the world.Visa's and Mastercard's network is a four-party model consisting of account holder (individuals using the credit cards to shop and buy items), issuers (the financial institution that issued the credit cards to account holders), acquirers (financial institutions that contract with the merchants) and merchants (retailers, billers and others who accept electronic payment). It is important to point out that neither Visa nor Mastercard are financial institutions, and both companies don't issue the cards or extend any credits or set rates. Both companies are therefore facing no credit risk as both companies are only providing the network and technology for all four parties to authorize, clear, and settle transactions.(Source: Visa 2017 10-K)Visa reports in four different segments - service revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues, and other revenues. The first three are each responsible for $7 billion to $9 billion in annual revenue, while ""other revenues"" is only generating $900 million. From the total gross revenue, Visa has to subtract $5.5 billion in client incentives it has to pay leading to $20.6 billion in annual revenue for 2018. On Tuesday, Visa reported its third quarter results and revenue could grow 11.5% YoY; the adjusted EPS grew 14% YoY, but the company revised guidance a little to the downside.(Source: Visa 2018 10-K)Mastercard's business is quite similar - it also reports in four different segments, which are domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees, transaction processing and other revenues. Similar to Visa, the company also has to subtract rebates and incentives from the gross revenue. While Visa already reported quarterly results in this earnings season, Mastercard will report its results in a few days.(Source: Mastercard 2018 10-K)Not only the business model is very similar, but both companies are creating similar barriers to enter the industry, and the wide economic moat around both companies is also quite similar. The wide economic moat of both companies stems from the impressive network these two created over the last few decades. The resulting network effect is the reason why Mastercard's and Visa's business models are among the very best we know. The network effect arises, when the value of a product or service increases with every new user - and not only for the existing user but also for the new user. And, the network is very difficult to replicate because new competitors would have to replicate the entire network (or at least a big part) before the value for the users is similar high as with the already existing network. Visa and Mastercard are connecting millions of cardholders and a very large number of retailers and merchants all over the world, and replicating this network is a really tall order for every company.But both networks have two additional characteristics making the network effect really powerful:But there are differences between the two companies - also regarding the economic moat. While the competitive advantage and the network effect are quite similar for both companies, Visa has a much more complex and denser network than Mastercard as can be shown by the numbers below. And as networks often see a ""winner-takes-it-all"" effect, this could be an advantage for Visa - especially when growth might slow down at some point and the competition between Visa and Mastercard will get more intense.(Source: Visa 2018 10-K)When looking at the dividend, both companies are not very interesting for dividend investors as both have a very low dividend yield. But both companies have also a rather low payout ratio and a high dividend growth rate, making it a bit interesting for dividend growth investors. While Visa's dividend yield is a little higher (0.55% instead of 0.47% for Mastercard), Visa increased its dividend only 20.4% annually during the last five years while Mastercard increased the dividend 36.6% on average. The payout ratio is between 19% and 20% for both companies right now.When analyzing the financial health of the companies, we are looking at the debt levels and compare them to the shareholders' equity as well as the operating income. Both companies have some amounts of short-term and long-term debt on the balance sheet, but in the end, both companies are healthy, and the numbers are very similar.Mastercard has currently $500 million in short-term debt and $5,799 million in long-term debt on its balance sheet. When comparing these amounts to the stockholders' equity of $5,168 million, we get a D/E ratio of 1.22. When comparing the debt to the operating income, we get a ratio of 0.75, which means it would take only 9 months to repay the outstanding debt with the operating income of 2018. And, we also have to take into account the $5,857 million in cash and cash equivalents Mastercard has on its balance sheet.Visa has currently $16,630 million in long-term debt on its balance sheet, and when comparing it to $34,275 million in shareholders' equity, we get a D/E ratio of 0.49. When comparing the debt to the operating income of Visa ($16,810 million in 2018), we get a ratio of 0.99, which means it would take one year to repay the debt with operating income. And similar to Mastercard, Visa also has cash on its balance sheet ($7,648 million in cash and cash equivalents) we have to consider.When looking at the growth rates of both companies, we also get a very similar picture. When looking at the last decade for Mastercard, we see that all three numbers (revenue, earnings per share, and free cash flow) grew with a stable pace. Revenue grew 12.7% on average during the last decade, earnings per share grew almost 20% on average, and free cash flow grew 18.52% annually on average.(Source: Own work)When looking at Visa, the picture is quite similar. Revenue grew also with a steady pace and 12.91% on average during the last decade. Earnings per share fluctuated a little more, but there is a clear uptrend visible and earnings per share grew 21.26% on average during the last decade. Finally, free cash flow also fluctuated a little, but the annual average growth was 53.60%. However, the free cash flow in 2009 was extremely low, which is distorting the number and making it rather useless.(Source: Own work)In the end, both companies are growing with a similar pace and aside from Mastercard's numbers that offer a little more consistency during the last decade, there is not much difference when talking about the growth rates of Visa and Mastercard.When looking at different profitability numbers, we first of all look at the free cash flow in comparison to the generated revenue. During the last five years, 37.88 cents of every dollar in revenue was generated as free cash flow for Mastercard. For Visa, the number is even more impressive as for every dollar in revenue, the company could generate 47.59 cents in free cash flow (five-year average). When looking at the operating margin, we can see that, aside from 2012, Visa always also had a higher operating margin than Mastercard, which means that Visa is more profitable. An explanation could be the bigger network, which gives an advantage to Visa and making it more profitable.(Source: Own work)However, when looking at the return on invested capital, both companies can report high, above-average numbers, but Mastercard is clearly outperforming Visa. During the past ten years, Mastercard has outperformed Visa in every single year, and with an average RoIC of 43.32% during the last decade, Mastercard could not only report an impressive number but also a much higher number than Visa (15.83% average RoIC).Visa seems to be more profitable than Mastercard as it has a higher margin and is able to convert its revenue to higher amounts of free cash flow. But Mastercard is clearly outperforming Visa when looking at the return on invested capital, which should be a very important number for every investor.The stock performance of Mastercard and Visa in the past might also give us a hint about the quality of the business. The stock price is not always reflecting the true value of a business as a stock can be extremely overvalued or extremely undervalued, but it can at least be a hint. Over the last ten years (which includes no bear market!), Mastercard's stock increased 1,404% while Visa's stock price increased only 975% in the same timeframe (not including dividends). While both numbers are extremely impressive, Mastercard seems to be outperforming Visa as investment (the higher RoIC is also indicating that).Many of the mentioned metrics are quite similar, making it really difficult to decide which of the two companies might be the better pick. When looking at the dividend (similar low dividend yield, similar payout ratio, high dividend growth rate) or the financial health (acceptable D/E ratio and ability to repay the debt within a very short timeframe), there hardly seems to be any difference between the two. When looking at the growth rates for revenue and earnings per share, both companies seem to grow almost hand-in-hand. And while Visa has a higher operating margin and a better FCF/revenue ratio, Mastercard has a much higher RoIC.While the fundamentals seem to be rather similar for Mastercard and Visa and are making it difficult to decide which business might be better, we also can look at the stock's valuation, because a good investor is not only looking for a great business but is also buying the business at a reasonable price. When taking the earnings per share for the full year of 2018, Visa is valued with a P/E ratio of 41 while Mastercard is valued with a P/E ratio of 50. Both are rather high P/E ratios that can only be justified by a very high growth potential over the next years and decades. But as both companies seem to grow at similar rates, the valuation aspect would rather speak for Visa as it is the cheaper among the two.When forced to decide between the two, I probably would choose Visa right now as it is valued more attractive and has the more complex and denser network (which should not be underestimated) that can provide an advantage in the future when competing against Mastercard. Although growth expectations for Mastercard seem to be higher and the company can also report a higher RoIC, it remains unclear if Mastercard can really outperform Visa over the long run. In the end, I wouldn't buy either of the two, as both stocks are too expensive, in my opinion. But when we see a contraction in stock prices, it will make sense to split up the position between the two companies."

The company has partnerships with more than 25,000 financial institutions, creating a vast and not easily replaceable electronic payment network. Mastercard has more than 2.5 billion credit and debit cards in use worldwide. The stock currently sports a market cap of $229 billion.Non-cash transactions are increasing worldwide. Though stats were not available for 2018, financial transactions using credit or debit card increased by more than 10% in the U.S. in 2017. Growth of electronic payments are expected to increase at a CAGR of low-double digits worldwide over the next few years, with at least 20% annual growth in emerging markets.This puts a company like Mastercard, with its size, scale and acceptability around the world, in a prime position to capitalize on consumer’s change in spending habits.Mastercard released fourth quarter financial results at the end of January.Source: Mastercard’s Fourth Quarter Financial Release Presentation, slide 3.The company earnings per share, or EPS, total $1.55 for the quarter. This was $0.03 above consensus and a 36% improvement from the previous year. Revenue increased more than 15% to $3.8 billion, which matched what analysts had expected. The company’s tax rate was 18.3% versus 26.8% from a year ago due to tax reform legislation.EPS for 2019 was $6.49, $0.23 above the company’s midpoint guidance. EPS improved 37% from 2017. Revenue increased 20% to $15 billion for the year.While new revenue recognition rules related to U.S. tax reform that require companies to book revenue and expenses sooner added 5% to both the fourth quarter and annual revenue totals, Mastercard still showed impressive year-over-year growth rates. This was due to gains across a number of metrics.Source: Mastercard’s Fourth Quarter Financial Release Presentation, slide 4.Worldwide gross dollar volumes grew 15% to $1.55 trillion, which includes a negative 2% headwind due to currency. Growth in international markets also outpaced growth in the U.S, but both regions were an improvement on a sequential basis. As stated above, electronic payments are expected to increase at a higher CAGR in emerging markets. Investors can expect growth in emerging markets to continue at a higher rate than in the U.S. because the transition from cash to electronic payment has more room for acceptance in these countries.Cross-border volumes and switched transactions were each higher by 17% in the fourth quarter. The number of cards in use increased 5%, or 7% excluding Venezuela, to 2.52 billion. These figures show that Mastercard’s credit and debit cards continue to gain acceptance by both consumers and vendors.Operating margins improved more than 1.3% to 52.3% during the quarter while expenses grew 14% on a currency neutral basis. This increase in expenses was due to a combination of new revenue recognition rules, investments in the company’s business and increased advertisements.Mastercard returned nearly $6 billion to shareholders in 2018, with $4.9 billion spent to repurchase 26.2 million shares of stock at an average price of $187. The company has $4.0 billion, or 1.7% of the current market cap, remaining on its repurchase authorization. In addition to being a shareholder-friendly company, Mastercard was able to buy back shares at what seems to be a reasonable price. Given that the current share price is above $220, the company appears to have used its capital in a wise way.Mastercard has guided towards a midpoint for EPS of $7.53 for 2019, which would be a 16% increase from 2018. Revenue is expected to grow at a low teens rate.From 2019-2021, Mastercard believes that it can grow EPS at a CAGR in the high teens with operating margins of at least 50%. There are not many companies available in the market that can offer such a bullish forecast.Mastercard shares currently yield just 0.6%, one of the lowest yields in our portfolio. The yield is also well below the 1.9% yield of the S&P 500. While investors searching for income might ignore Mastercard, I think those looking to add dividend growth should consider purchasing the stock.After increasing its dividend by 32% for the payment made in early February, Mastercard has now raised its dividend for eight consecutive years. According to the U.S. Dividend Champions, the company has increased its dividend:As you can see, the most recent increase is much closer to its five-year average than its three-year average. Investors should take this as a sign that management feels very bullish on the future prospects of the company.Mastercard has an average payout ratio of 11.9% and 17.8% over the past five and ten years, respectively. Based on expected dividends of $1.28 and EPS of $7.53 for 2019, the company has an expected payout ratio of 17% for the current year. Even after a 30%+ raise, the expected payout ratio is still below Mastercard’s five-year average. This likely gives the company plenty of room to continue increasing its dividend, even if the world’s economy were to enter a recessionMastercard’s business performed well last year and the dividend growth is impressive, but I won’t pay just any price to acquire more shares.If you’re not familiar with how I value stocks, I take the current price and compare it to fair values and price targets from a number of different sources to see how over or undervalued shares are currently. I then take the average of these values to determine a price target.For a company with less than 10 years of dividend growth, like Mastercard, I would require shares to trade at my fair value estimate before buying.Before making an investment decision, I consult Value Line for their safety and financial strength ratings. I am looking for at least a 2 for safety and a B++ for strength for reassurance that the company is on fairly sound financial footing. Value Line gives Mastercard a 1 for safety and an A++ for financial strength. These are the highest ratings a company can receive from Value Line.Using Friday’s closing price of $223.32 and EPS guidance for 2019 of $7.53, shares of Mastercard trade with a price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E, of 29.7. The stock’s five-year average P/E ratio according to F.A.S.T. Graphs is 29.3. Shares are currently 1.2% overvalued compared to their five-year average valuation.CFRA has a one-year price target of $231, which would offer investors a 3.4% gain from the current share price. CFRA’s fair value estimate is $218.01. Shares are 2.4% above this fair value estimate.Morningstar has a fair value estimate of $165, meaning shares are 26% overvalued by this metric.Value Engine has a one-year price target of $238.38. The stock is currently trading at a 6.7% discount to this price target. Value Engine’s fair value estimate, on the other hand, is $202.08. This would mean shares are 9.5% overvalued.Average these valuations out and I find fair value to be ~$213. I find that shares are currently 4.8% overvalued. Any price under $213 qualifies Mastercard for purchase under my investing guidelines.Mastercard has been one of the best-performing stocks in the markets in recent years. The increase in share price has caused the stock to become one of our largest positions. While the gain in price may scare some investors, I want to own more of Mastercard. The company is one of the leaders in the electronic payments space. As such, Mastercard stands to capture a significant portion of the increase in electronic payments worldwide.Mastercard’s most recent quarter showed that this trend continues. I find shares of the company to be slightly above what I would consider fair value today, but I would be a buyer of Mastercard’s stock on a pullback as this is a name I very much want to own more of in 2019.What are your thoughts on Mastercard? Feel free to leave a comment below."
4242408,104579,2019-02-20T08:55:02-05:00,"Mastercard benefits from increased consumer spending.The company is a secret beneficiary of inflation due to its revenue being driven from fees on gross payment volume.The shares are expensive, but, in a market pullback, could become more attractive.","SourceI recently discussed why Visa (V) is a stock for the long term here. As there are predominantly two large players in the space, I decided to take a look at Mastercard (MA) and see if shares are worth starting a position in as well. While the stock trades at more lofty valuations than Visa, it stands to have room to gain market share from its counterpart. The company benefits the same way Visa does from global spending increasing. Owning both could be a great way to hedge against one another from underperformance.Mastercard recently reported earnings that were a slight beat on the bottom and in line on the top.Source: Seeking AlphaRevenue grew 17% when accounting for currency fluctuations, a very strong number and better than Visa. Though it was pointed out that 5% of this growth was due to new revenue recognition methods. Without that, the 12% growth was in line with Visa's quarter. However, it is on a smaller base. What is rather interesting is that operating expenses grew 44% year over year. This is quite high and generally, we would like to see this in line with earnings growth. Earnings per share grew a healthy 40% when adjusted for currency fluctuations, helped in part by the tax regulation, higher revenue, and better operating margins.Mastercard continues to benefits from growing volumes of transactions. This leads to more processing and more fees.Source: Earnings SlidesAs the company shows us above, it saw a rather healthy growth of 14%. What is more intriguing is that it saw stronger international growth than domestic. This is at a time when arguably the United States is one of the few actually growing. This could be a good sign that despite an economic slowdown, the consumer still spend money and use their credit cards to do so. However, a severe recession like we saw in 2008-2009 could lead to a decline in payments and thus begin to hurt Mastercard.As we can see most of the operating increase came from general administration expenses as well as advertising expenses.Source: Earnings slidesIn the future, investors should keep an eye on this. While administrative expenses should increase, the preference would be on marketing to drive growth in product adoption.Looking ahead, Mastercard projects its compounded annual growth in earnings to be in the high teens and revenue to grow high-single digits. This should keep the stock moving forward, however, any miss on these expectations could lead to the highly valued stock to decline.Looking at the balance sheet, we see Mastercard is in a healthy financial position.Source: 10-QWith $6.68 billion in cash on hand and only $5.83 billion in long-term debt, the company is in a positive net cash position. Because of this and its growing cash from operations, which was a lovely $6.2 billion for 2018, the company can continue to return cash to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, Mastercard repurchased about 4.4 million shares for $888 million. Through January 30th, the company repurchased an additional 4.0 million shares costing $773 million, which left $6.0 billion for future repurchases under the currently authorized program. For the full year of 2018, Mastercard repurchased approximately 26.2 million shares at a cost of $4.9 billion. This equals about a 2% reduction in shares outstanding and by the time it uses the rest of the program, another 2% could be reduced. Not too bad, and I would expect this to continue. I do believe Mastercard should take more precaution in its purchases as the shares don't exactly scream undervalued.Lastly, the company has been growing its dividend for the last 7 years at an impressive rate. While the total yield is low at less than 1%, the company has been growing the dividend at a CAGR of 36%. Despite this fast pace, it still has a payout ratio of less than 20%, meaning the dividend is safe.Looking at valuation, we can see that Mastercard is trading at a higher multiple than its peers.Data by YChartsWe see from the chart above that Mastercard trades with the highest forward P/E compared to peers and the lowest yield. This would suggest the stock doesn't offer value over peers. It would also suggest perhaps looking into competitors for investment.Next, looking at the 5-year average valuation for Mastercard, we can see the stock appear overvalued.Source: MorningstarThe shares currently trade at a higher than average P/S, P/E, P/CF, and P/B ratio. They also offer a lower earnings yield than they have recently. Looking at this ratio, one would not like to start a position here. I would rather enter at a 15% discount to historical averages. This would mean the shares would need to trade at forward P/E of about 22x earnings. This would imply a share price of $168. Even if it were to fall in line with its peer, Visa shares would need to be priced closer to the low $200 range or about 10% lower than here.Mastercard benefits from the same trends as Visa. Yet, despite this, the shares trade at a higher valuation. This would make more sense if Mastercard growth was outpacing Visa, however, it appears this is not the case. Mastercard would be a great way to offer additional exposure to the payments processing space, however, it has to make sense from a valuation perspective. At the very least, it should be closer in line to Visa's, not above it. Investors looking to start a new position may be wise to wait for a pullback. Shares would begin to look attractive when they trade at a discount to their 5-year average and not a premium. While it may take some time for this to happen, a disappointing earnings report or slowdown in the economy could give investors the opportunity they have been waiting for."
4258269,92586,2019-04-30T19:40:49-04:00,"It was hard to find a single weak spot in Mastercard's first quarter financial results.Mastercard seems to have done even better than Visa in the most recent period, growing payment and transactions volume and expanding margins.MA (and V, to be fair) would probably be an excellent core holding in an equities portfolio built for long-term growth.","Purchase, NY-based payment processor Mastercard (MA) impressed me this quarter.The company reported consensus-beating revenues of $3.89 billion that landed an inch above consensus expectations - producing reported growth of 9% that could have been four percentage points higher, if not for FX headwinds. Adjusted EPS of $1.78 left expectations in the dust, rising an encouraging 24% YOY on a constant-currency basis. Credit: MarketWatchRight off the bat, a few similarities with the results reported by peer Visa (V) earlier in the month can be spotted. First, purchase and transaction volume continued to march forward relentlessly, driving service and processing revenues higher despite the currency challenges. Second, the additional gain in scale, coupled with tight cost management, allowed margins to expand in both cases, which helped the companies maintain a healthy, high-teen EPS growth pace.The difference is that Mastercard seems to have done all of the above better than its competitor in the most recent period. The chart below illustrates how each of the company's revenue categories grew at least 14% YOY, excluding the impact of significantly richer rebates and incentives and on a currency-neutral basis. And, as far as I can tell, the unfavorable Easter holiday timing that impacted Visa's quarter more noticeably did not seem to have dented Mastercard's financial results by nearly as much.Source: company's earnings slidesMastercard's op margins improved an astonishing 266 bps compared to Visa's more modest 51 bp margin expansion, the latter probably hurt by the lack of profit momentum in Venmo. Although both companies saw similar EPS growth of 17% to 19% on an as-reported basis, Visa's was more anchored on gains from investments in private companies, while Mastercard's seems to have been more closely associated with robust operational performance.See Mastercard's summarized P&L below. Notice how a decrease in effective tax rate and a reduction in shares outstanding accounted for nearly one-fifth of the YOY increase in adjusted earnings per share.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company reportsIt was hard to find a single weak spot in Mastercard's first quarter financial results. The company continues to provide enough arguments to support a bullish stance towards the stock, given the growth opportunities enabled by (1) the ongoing transition to plastic and electronic payments, (2) geographic expansion into under-penetrated markets, (3) growth in e-commerce, and (4) the rise of peer-to-peer and other ""alternative"" transaction forms.Data by YChartsI believe MA is a stock worth considering for the same reasons that I have been a fan of V for a while: the recurring-like nature of the business supported by a strong merchant-consumer network that predictably drives an increasing number of revenue-generating transactions. In the case of the former, higher trailing and expected earnings growth along with lower balance sheet leverage may explain the stock's richer valuation of 33.7x current-year earnings vs. V's more affordable price tag of 30.7x.It is hard to decide which stock looks more compelling between MA and V, keeping in mind that the first has already moved 35% so far this year vs. its peer's more timid (but still respectable) 25% gain. More importantly, either would probably be an excellent core holding in an equities portfolio built for long-term growth, especially after both (Mastercard, in particular) delivered encouraging results in the first quarter of the year."
4264886,102646,2019-05-17T10:23:44-04:00,"Visa and Mastercard have one of the biggest moats in the world.
        The two companies are the biggest financial technologies in the world with a combined market cap of almost $600 billion.
        I compare their performance and explain why I love Mastercard more.","Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) are the biggest financial technology companies in the world, with a combined market capitalization of more than $589 billion. The companies are known to be exceptional defensive stocks, which tend to do well even in tough market conditions. In the past one year, the two companies have outperformed the S&P 500 index as shown on the chart below. The same trend of overperformance can be seen in virtually all periods you look.Source: YChartsAs with my last week’s comparison of Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), this article will compare these two giants in the payment world. The article will conclude on the one I would recommend as an investment.The Business ModelVisa and Mastercard operate with a very easy and similar business model. They use a four-party system to make financial transactions easy. This system includes the issuers like banks who issue products, the account holders who get the card from the issuers, the acquirers who contract with merchants to accept payments, and the merchants such as retailers and billers. Because of their business model, the companies do not issue the cards, and set the fees of the account holders. Also, they don’t earn revenues from the interest paid by the account holders. Instead, they generate revenue from the payments done using their cards.This business model allows the companies to operate at high margins. It also makes it difficult for small startups to disrupt the industry. In fact, companies like JCB that have tried to disrupt the industry have found it difficult to find mass appeal. This is shown in the chart below.Source: VisaFinancial PerformanceIn the past few years, the two companies have managed to grow their revenues. The reason for this is simple. The world’s population has increased from 6+ billion in 2000 to the current 7.3+ billion people. This growth in population coupled with the overall improvement in the world economy has led to more digital transactions. In my many travels in the emerging and frontier markets, I have observed that many many people are today using their Visa and Mastercard cards to pay in the supermarkets and gas stations. This trend is expected to continue.As a result, the two companies have seen their revenue continue to grow. For Mastercard, revenue has grown from $5 billion in 2009 to more than $18 billion in 2018. The company is expected to have annual revenues of more than $18.4 billion in 2020 and $21.5 billion in 2021. At the same time, the net income has grown from $1.4 billion in 2009 to almost $6 billion in 2018. The chart below shows the financial performance of MA in the past ten years.Like Mastercard, Visa too has continued to see its revenue grow. The total revenue has grown from $$6.9 billion in 2009 to more than $25 billion. The net income has grown from $2.3 billion to more than $10.3 billion. The chart below shows the financial performance of V in the same period.As shown in the two charts, Visa has been a better performer in terms of revenue growth, free cash flow, and EPS.Part of the reason why the two companies are able to generate high cash flows and profits is that they are high-margin businesses. Their margins are high because most of their staff are focused on developing the technology. As such, they don’t spend a lot of money on sales and marketing, which is common with other businesses. The EBITDA and operating margins of the two companies are shown below.Based on the revenue growth and other financial metrics, Visa has outperformed Mastercard by a slight margin. In the near future, while I expect the growth of the two companies to grow, I believe the growth will plateau. This is because most of the world’s middle class already have and use the Visa and Mastercard cards. Also, the two companies are already found in most geographical locations, which means that the room for growth will be small. I also believe that new startups like Cash App (SQ) and WeChat will take some market share from the two companies. I don’t expect this market share to have any meaningful impact on Visa and Mastercard’s business.Financial PositionAs a long-term investor, it is always important to look at the financial position of a company. Ideally, you don’t want to invest in highly indebted companies that could fail to honor their financial obligations.In the past ten years, Visa has grown its debt load from $44 million to more than $16 billion. Part of the reason for this growth in debt was the 2015 acquisition of Visa Europe. The acquisition was valued at more than $23.4 billion and was the biggest acquisition in the company’s history. While I am often critical of such large-scale transactions, I believe that this acquisition was a good one because of the role Europe plays in the global financial economy. The company has cash and short-term investments of more than $11.5 billion.Mastercard on the other hand has grown its debt load from $22 million to more than $5.8 billion. The company has used the debt to fund acquisitions and return money to investors. It now has more than $7.1 billion in cash, which means that its balance sheet is cash positive on a net basis.Source: YChartsShareholder ReturnsInvestors generate their returns through stock price appreciation and through dividends and buybacks. On the stock price, Mastercard has been a clear winner as shown in the chart below.Source: YChartsOn dividends, Visa and Mastercard have a forward dividend yield of 0.62% and 0.54% respectively. Because of their huge margins and free cash flows, the companies will continue to return funds to shareholders for years to come. This is because their payout ratios are just 18%. This is much better than that of companies like Apple and Microsoft (MSFT), which have payout ratio of 24% and 38% respectively. In the past ten years, Mastercard has returned more than $4 billion to shareholders through dividends. It has also returned more than $24 billion to the shareholders through repurchases. This has seen its outstanding shares decline from more than 1.35 billion to the current 1.02 billion.Visa on the other hand has returned more than $9.36 billion to shareholders through dividends and more than $39 billion through buybacks. Its outstanding shares have declined from 2.4 billion to the current 2.1 billion.While the yields on the two companies are relatively low, they are stable and will continue for a long time because of their strong margins, FCF, and their strong balance sheets.ValuationSource: YChartsBecause of their fundamentals, Visa and Mastercard are known for their pricey valuations. As shown, Visa has a market capitalization of more than $352 billion compared to Mastercard’s $242 billion. On a trailing PE basis, Mastercard is more overvalued than Visa. However, based on the forward PE ratios, the two companies valuations are just similar. The chart below shows the forward PE ratios of the two companies.Future GrowthThe two companies are also investing for growth. In April, Mastercard announced a partnership with Apple and Goldman Sachs (GS). This partnership will see the company use its tokenization technology to get rid of card numbers. This is a breakthrough technology, which will help prevent fraud and increase safety for the card users. They are also increasing their partnerships with startups in the fintech industry and other industries. This week, Mastercard announced a new partnership with Lyft (LYFT) that will help create a Lyft debit card. In addition to these, the two companies are increasing their investments to promote cross-border transactions. Mastercard has its Mastercard Send while Visa is about to launch its Visa B2B Connect that will use the blockchain technology. These are steps in the right direction and will lead to more volumes and transaction charges.Verdict and Final ThoughtsWarren Buffett has always talked about the moat and by his definition, I believe that Visa and Mastercard have some of the biggest moat in the world. This is simply because starting a card business is an expensive thing that requires building a lot of trust with banks. This means that it is unlikely that any startup will challenge the two companies. The only company that has succeeded is UnionPay, which is used all over China. The company has succeeded because of the large population and the fact that the financial industry has been closed to foreign companies for years. Beyond China, UnionPay does not have any meaningful market share. Another country that has succeeded to challenge Visa and Mastercard is India, where its Rupay platform has more than 65% of the market share.As mentioned above, I don’t believe that the new startups trying to disrupt the industry will have any major impact on them. In fact, I believe that most of them will complement the work these companies do. In fact, all the major companies getting into the industry are using the Visa and Mastercard’s technology. This includes companies like Paypal, Cash App, Apple Card, and Venmo among others.Source: FortuneIn addition to this moat, the two companies have excellent margins, growing FCF, and continue to return money to shareholders. Also, the two are actively investing in other fintech companies with their venture funds.While I have the two companies in my portfolio, I continue to own more of Mastercard than Visa because of its better balance sheet and its stronger cash position. This means that the company can easily fund growth, increase returns to shareholders, and fund acquisitions."
4238957,50452,2019-02-07T09:10:40-05:00,"Mastercard has provided stellar capital gains to investors throughout the decade thanks to growth, profitability, and strong buybacks.The stock has outrun its earnings growth and currently sits 20% above its 10-year median PE ratio.Management expects earnings growth to slow down from its past three-year performance, to its upcoming three-year forecast. This could mean that the stock's upward trajectory will slow down.","Payment services company Mastercard, Inc. (MA) has been on a tear over the past 10 years. The stock has appreciated 1,240% over that time frame, easily besting the indexes. This has been thanks to a combination of sparkling fundamentals and growth that has seen both the top and bottom lines grow at a double-digit CAGR over this time frame. While these high-growth, blue-chip stocks have a tendency to burn off premiums, investors should be careful with Mastercard. The stock is well above its historical valuation levels, and management recently projected that earnings growth (although robust) will slow down some over the next few years. Buying at this level puts investors at a high risk for suppressed returns when Mastercard's overvaluation eventually catches up to shares.Over the past 10 years, Mastercard has traded at a median earnings multiple of 27.55X earnings. While this is a high valuation to pay for most stocks, Mastercard has had the fundamentals to justify such a high multiple.The company has roughly tripled its top line to almost $15 billion over the past decade, and the company has almost doubled its EBITDA since the recession. Revenue has grown at a 10-year CAGR of 11.88%, while earnings per share have paced at 16.39% per annum.Source: YChartsWhile growth is the foundation of a business's forward momentum, these results are amplified when a company runs an efficient business model. Mastercard is extremely profitable, running at an operating margin of more than 56%. As a result, the business is able to convert more than $0.38 of every revenue dollar into cash flow. This is more than triple the rate we look for as a benchmark (10%). The company's profitability and lean, non-capital-intensive structure results in high rates of return on the capital that Mastercard puts to work. The company generates cash returns at a 62.38% rate on invested capital.Source: YChartsWhen your business is growing and cash efficient, the cash trickles down to the balance sheet and shareholders. Mastercard is able to operate at a very strong financial position. The balance sheet is cash positive on a net basis. Cash assets of $6.68 billion against total debt of $6.33 billion result in a positive difference of $350 million.Source: YChartsWith well north of $5 billion in free cash flow and no real need to spend it anywhere, it tends to find its way in the pockets of shareholders. Mastercard is very aggressive with share buybacks, spending almost $5 billion over the past 12 months alone. Over time, the share count has been reduced from 1.3 billion to 1.05 billion. This drastic share reduction helps supercharge the EPS growth rate.Source: YChartsMeanwhile, Mastercard is working its way up the ranks of dividend growth stocks. While some investors may shy away from a yield of just 0.61%, the dividend has been raised each of the past eight years. Over the past five years, the dividend has grown at a CAGR of 36.6%. This blistering pace results in surging yield on cost for those who hold over the long term. The dividend yield is low because of capital gains, not because of a lacking payout.Mastercard ""checks all of the boxes"" that we look at for a long-term investment, so why do we hesitate to recommend shares? Even the best companies can disappoint investors if the valuation is out of sorts.Mastercard closed out its FY 2018 on January 31st. During the call, management walked through the company's past three years of performance. Over the past three years, Mastercard has grown earnings per share at a CAGR of 28%. Given the full year's earnings of $6.49 per share, the stock's current PE ratio is just north of 33.1X earnings. This puts the stock at a 20% premium to Mastercard's 10-year median earnings multiple (27.55X as mentioned in the introduction). With a three-year growth rate that has outpaced its 10-year average, we can see how the stock could ""get hot"" and outpace its historical valuation.However, this trend can also go the other way. Management also laid out its three-year forecast for upcoming years 2019-2021. Partially due to expected softening in consumer spending (management detailed this in prepared remarks, and again in analyst questioning), the expected EPS CAGR has been lowered to the high-teens.Source: Mastercard, Inc.A reversion back to historical growth rates could easily result in a similar move with the stock's PE ratio. If we extrapolate Mastercard's EPS using a CAGR of 16-19%, we would see FY2021 earnings between $10.13 and $10.93 per share. If the stock were to revert to its 10-year median valuation, the resulting share price would range between $279 and $301. While this sequence of events would result in total capital gains between 30% and 40% (not a bad three-year return by most standards), the rate of return would greatly lag historical performance because of PE compression that had taken place.But what if Mastercard falls short of expectations? What if there is a global recession that drags the market into a full-on bearish environment? The current valuation doesn't allot a margin of safety for investors. If Mastercard were to see EPS growth of even 14% and a PE ratio of 25X three years out, the numbers change quite a bit. FY2021 earnings per share become $9.61, and the share price at that time becomes $240. This means capital gains of just 11% over a three-year time period (a mediocre return on investment by most standards). When you have no margin of safety, even a slight ""tweak"" to the numbers can drastically impact the bottom-line result.We are bullish on Mastercard over the long term (5+ years), where barring an unlikely event, the company's stellar fundamentals will win out in most cases. But just because a company is strong doesn't mean that investors should write a blank check to own the name. Mastercard's projected slowdown in earnings growth warrants a margin of safety, which isn't provided at more than 33X earnings.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article.Author Disclaimer: Wealth Insights is an investor and investment author.

We recommend Buy, but leaving some room for further opportunistic purchases.","Mastercard (NYSE:MA) shares are heading towards a new 52-week high, continuing a multi-year compounding journey, which has generated a 2.9x return in the last 5 years (since the end of 2013). MA shares are now trading on a 36.3x LTM P/E. However, we believe MA shares offer an example of how ""growth"" has beaten ""value"" and continue to be an attractive investment.MA shares have massively outperformed fellow card company American Express (AXP) since the end of 2013, returning 2.9x vs. AXP's 1.3x (including dividends). This is despite MA having started with a far higher P/E multiple, with MA at 32.0x vs. AXP at 18.6x as of 2013 year-end (as shown below). During this period, AXP's P/E multiple has in fact contracted by nearly 4x to 14.9x, while MA's has expanded by more than 4x to 36.3x.However, changes in valuation multiples have only played a minor role in MA's outperformance. Most of the return in MA shares since 2013 year-end has come from earnings growth, with its EPS nearly tripling from $2.61 to $6.49 (see table above). For AXP, even had its multiple not contracted, its shares would still only have returned 1.6x, far inferior to MA's 2.9x. A graphic representation of the different contributors to the shares' returns is below:Our view on MA's valuation is that its strong earnings growth would continue to more than offset the negative impact of any de-rating. Below are illustrative return calculations showing this - we have assumed compound annual growth rates (""CAGR"") of 15% for both MA's EPS and dividend which, as will be explained later in this article, we believe are perfectly achievable.The first table shows our downside case where, even if MA's P/E multiple were to contract from its 36.3x to 26.0x over the next 5 years, the annual return (Internal Rate of Return, ""IRR"") would still be 9% at the end of the 5-year period. (We have chosen a 26.0x P/E for the downside case because, as shown earlier, MA shares have finished each of last 5 years with a P/E above 26x.)The second table shows our upside case where, should MA's P/E remain flat at 36.3x, then the annualised IRR would be 16% over the next 5 years - basically, the combination of EPS growing at 15% a year and a small dividend each year.MA operates a global payment network for consumers and enterprises, with both credit and debit cards. For each transaction, MA's ""four party"" network typically connects the issuer, the merchant acquirer, the merchant, and the account holder. MA's network generates revenues by charging fees to issuers and acquirers for performing services, including:These fees tend to be volume-based, calculated on the total value of transactions. Pricing is determined in a variety of ways, including regional price lists and individual deals.MA also generates revenues from value-add products and services (""Other Service""), such as safety & security, card program management, etc.MA is geographically diversified, with each continent represented solidly in its Gross Dollar Volume (""GDV""); however, it is currently not involved in China beyond issuing international cards with Chinese banks. North America is the most important, with 33% of MA's GDV and a slightly higher percentage of its revenues; Europe is 30% of GDV and APMEA 31%.We have a high degree of confidence in MA achieving a ""high teens"" EPS CAGR for the medium term (or even the long term).MA is a natural ""GDP+"" earnings grower, given how most MA revenues are based on the value of transactions, the rising use of electronic payments, and its ability to generate revenues without incurring much new costs.MA has demonstrated a track record of strong growth in the number of cards, in total transaction value (Gross Dollar Volume, or ""GDV"") and in revenues.As shown in the first chart below, since 2013, MA has had an average annual growth of 10% in the number of cards, 13% in GDV, and 15% in net revenues (all growth rates are in constant currency). This has enabled an average annual growth of 15% in MA's EBIT and 21% in EPS (the latter also helped by the U.S. tax cut in 2017), as shown in the second chart below:(Note: GDV growth rates in 2016 and 2017 have been adjusted to exclude the impact from the EU Interchange Fee Regulation in 2015, which had a minimal impact on MA revenues. Net revenue growth in 2015 was impacted by a 20% increase in rebates and incentives, a contra-revenue item, which was due to the timing of new deals. Net revenue growth in 2018 was adjusted to exclude a 4% benefit from a new accounting standard.)MA's GDV growth has been broad-based, with the U.S. still growing solidly and all regions seeing growth accelerate in 2018, as shown below:MA's long-term growth potential is based on strong structural growth in both existing and newer markets, as shown in the chart below. MA's existing business is largely in the personal consumption expenditure (""PCE"") market, but even there, the penetration of cards remains low. (Even in North America, cards are only c. 55% of PCE, and MA's GDV grew by 10% year on year in the U.S. in 2018.) Technological advances such as wireless connectivity and mobile devices have also opened up new markets in peer-to-peer (""P2P"") and business-to-business (""B2B"") payments, each larger than the PCE market, and where card use is minimal and many people still rely on cash and checks.Our confidence in MA's future revenue growth is also based on the competitiveness of its offerings vs. other card players.We have already shown above how MA has grown much faster than AXP. MA is also competitive against Visa (V), with MA growing its volumes faster and thus gaining share vs. V globally, as shown in the first chart below. In the U.S., after losing some ground in early 2016 (but maintaining strong growth globally), MA has been holding its own and generating similar growth as V.(Note: All growth rates are year-on-year and in constant currency. V global growth rates before the Visa Europe acquisition in June-16 are excluded.)In the U.S., since 2017, MA has maintained competitiveness vs. V, winning share among large issuers (see table below) as well as the more recent high-profile win in Apple Card. (The losses in 2016 were due to large contracts, with MA losing the United Services Automobile Association, and also allowing V to win the Costco U.S. contract from AXP.)MA management targets are for a ""high teens"" EPS CAGR (and a low-teens revenue CAGR) for the next forecast period of 2019-21, as shown below:If growth were to slow, MA could protect its earnings growth by reducing costs, as MA has made large expense ""investments"" in recent years.AXP has shown how the card business is scalable, requiring little incremental operating expenses (""OpEx""). As shown below, excluding marketing and card rewards/services (the latter do not apply to MA), AXP has reduced its OpEx at a CAGR of -3.5% in 2013-18. By contrast, MA has been growing its General & Admin. costs at a CAGR of 14.3% in 2013-18 - most of these as ""investments"" for future growth:MA management has been explicit that recent growth in OpEx has been due to ""investments"" and can be reduced in a downturn:Martina Hund-Mejean, MA CFO (18Q4 earnings call)Ajay Banga, MA CEO (18Q4 earnings call)MA is currently trading on a P/E of 36.3x, a high level historically; since 2011, MA has finished each year with a P/E between 26x and 33x, as shown below:Since 2014, MA has returned nearly all of its net income to shareholders via buybacks and dividends:(The difference between reported and adjusted net income is primarily litigation costs, which, while significant in some years, are not material to overall MA earnings.)At present, there is net cash on MA's balance sheet, although borrowing for share buybacks will not be accretive, given there is little difference between MA's current cost of debt (2.7%) and the implied yield of its shares (2.8%).MA generated $5.52bn of Free Cash Flow (""FCF"") in 2018, implying an FCF yield of 2.3%. Excluding $1.31bn of working capital outflows, 2018 FCF was $6.84bn, implying a yield of 2.8%.We believe MA's strong EPS growth more than offset its high valuation.We believe MA will continue growing its EPS at a CAGR of more than 15%. It is a unique asset and a natural ""GDP+"" earnings grower, given its volume-based revenues, and the structural growth in both existing and new markets.MA is currently on a P/E of 36.3x, admittedly high vs. its historic range (26-33x at each year-end since 2011). However, even if MA were to de-rate to 26x, a 15% EPS growth would still achieve a 9% IRR over the next 5 years. And, with its strong structural growth, MA shares could maintain their premium rating, in which case, the IRR would be in ""high teens"".At $235.45, our recommendation on MA is Buy. We recommend building a position, but leaving room for further opportunistic purchases."
4230926,104254,2018-12-31T20:41:50-05:00,Mastercard's financial performance over a long period of time has been stunningly good.The Electronic Card segment of the Global Payments system has secular tailwinds as transactions are converted from cash & cheques.Mastercard and Visa dominate their market with an estimated combined market share of 72%.The future will not be all plain sailing with the most difficult issues being growing regulation and system integrity/security.Mastercard will provide excellent long-term shareholder returns if it is purchased at the right price.,"Semi-annually I cycle through the stocks in my investing universe and update my intrinsic valuation for each company. It is now time for Mastercard Inc. (NYSE:MA) to be updated.I have been a Mastercard shareholder since 2015. The only regret that I have had with this company is that I didn't buy more when it was much cheaper. I have been a seller of the stock back in September of this year. There has been a significant pull-back since then so it is now time to see whether it is cheap enough to buy back what I sold.Mastercard is a technology company in the global payments sector. Mastercard partners with financial institutions to issue Mastercard branded cards (generally co-branded with the issuing financial institution) that are processed through the Mastercard payments network.In this operating model, Mastercard has no exposure to a breakdown in the credit process of the consumer or the corporate using the card. This risk is borne by the issuing financial institution.Mastercard predominantly makes its revenues by charging a fee for every transaction flowing through its network but it also has a growing service business where it is using a SaaS approach to providing services such as cyber fraud detection and prevention, loyalty programs, etc.Mastercard's origins go back to a group of Californian banks which in 1966 formed an association called the Interbank Card Association (ICA). The association created a card called Master Charge to compete against the BankAmericard which was the precursor to Visa (NYSE:V). In 1979, the Master Charge card was renamed Mastercard.The Interbank Card Association was organized as a co-operative of its bank owners. In 2006, the company was floated on the NYSE.The company currently only has 1 reportable operating segment but it does break down gross revenues into 4 sources (the proportion of total 2017 FY revenues is shown in brackets):Mastercard has primarily grown organically. Its focus has always been to replace cash and cheques in the consumer payments sector. It has gained share by signing up financial institutions to issue cards and merchants who are prepared to accept the card.Mastercard has made a total of 12 acquisitions since its IPO. The majority of these acquisitions have been relatively modest in size but nevertheless important strategically, particular in regards to its growing services business.Mastercard and its main competitor Visa have entrenched positions in the global payments sector. In 2017, Mastercard estimated that the Gross Dollar Volume (GDV) for credit cards, debit cards and prepaid cards was $22 Trillion. According to the 2017 10-K filings by Mastercard and Visa the combined GDV of these 2 companies is $15.8 Trillion – this equates to a combined market share of 72%.Mastercard (and Visa) has a strong competitive position with a wide-moat based on:The key sustainable competitive advantage is the network effect. A network moat is one of the strongest and most enduring of all competitive positions. Its strength comes from the benefits that flow to all users within the company’s universe.Mastercard’s stated strategy has aspects of a McKinsey’s 3 horizons approach:Recent Share Price ActionSource: Yahoo FinanceThe chart indicates that over the last year the Mastercard share price has increased by just over 15% and has exceeded the S&P 500 index by over 25%. During the recent market correction, Mastercard’s share price has dropped harder than the overall market.Source: MorningstarThe data from Morningstar shows that Mastercard and the Credit Services sector have been consistently outperforming the S&P 500 index for over 10 years. Mastercard has also consistently outperformed its sector over the last 10 years.The Global Payments system is the subject of numerous annual updates detailing the estimated size of the market. The normal consulting suspects are the authors of these reports and they include McKinsey & Partners, Boston Consulting Group, et al.One of the better presentations in this area was by Mastercard at its 2017 Investment Community Meeting. The company presented the following slide:Source: Mastercard 2017 Investment Community Meeting presentation.The key takeaway from this slide is that in 2017 the size of the carded payment market was $22 trillion (note that this figure refers to the Gross Dollar Value of the financial transactions and not the service revenues generated by the market participants). The key market for cards (credit, debit and stored value) is the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) market which is estimated to be $45 trillion in size. Cards have an estimated market share of the PCE market of 44%.The total payments market is considered to be mature. The various market participants and observers agree that the market is currently growing at 4 to 5 per cent. However, within the total market, emerging markets are growing faster than developed markets and cards are growing much faster than cash and cheques.The major listed public companies in the card market (the Global Industry Classification Systems calls this sector Financial Services) are Mastercard, Visa, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Discover Financial (NYSE:DFS) and American Express (NYSE:AXP).I have developed a table showing the historical Gross Dollar Value (GDV) of card transactions of these companies using data from each company's 10-K filings:Source: Author’s summary table from company 10-K filings.The data shows that Visa is by far the largest company in the sector and that Visa, combined with Mastercard, create a very powerful duopoly. Remembering from the previous slide that Mastercard claims that the GDV of the card sector is $22 trillion – this implies that Mastercard and Visa combined have a market share of 72%.When comparing the financial statements of the various companies in this sector care must be taken. Only Visa and Mastercard are “pure” plays (they predominantly derive their income from collecting transaction fees for processing payments on their networks). The other companies not only process payments but they also issue cards directly to consumers. As a result, their financial statements have a net interest income component.I have developed the following table using the company 10-K filings to show the historical margins for each of the major companies in the sector. Note that for American Express and PayPal the operating margins exclude the impact of net interest income from their card business:Source: Author’s summary table from company 10-K filings.The data shows the very high margins that Mastercard and Visa enjoy probably as a result of the relative volume that is processed through their networks.The key information takeaways are:For the last 5 years Mastercard’s revenues have had a CAGR of 11.1%.Source: Author’s summary of Mastercard’s 10-K filings.Note that the 2008 operating margin has been adjusted for the impact of litigation expenses which were unusually large in that year. An adjustment was also made in 2017 where a one-off expense was added back into the result.The chart demonstrates the long-term consistent growth in revenues and the stability of the operating margins which has taken place.Why are Visa’s Operating Margins Higher than Mastercard's Margins?The data indicates that Visa and Mastercard both report operating margins which are significantly higher than their competitors. At the same time, Visa’s margins are consistently higher than Mastercard's margins. The question might well be asked – why is this so?The answer must be in one, or a combination, of the following 3 areas:Let’s go through each of these possible reasons to see if we can draw any obvious conclusions:Net Revenue per TransactionI have estimated the net revenue per transaction by deducting Other Revenue (which I have assumed to be non-transactional revenues) from the reported Net Revenues and divided by the reported number of system transactions.Source: Author’s summary from company 10-K filingsThe data indicates that Mastercard’s revenues per transaction, after being relatively steady for many years, have had a step-decline since 2015. This coincides with the period when the European Union regulators started raising objections about Mastercard’s practices relating to interchange fees and central acquiring rules.It would appear that Mastercard has been forced to lower its fees (it seems that this may have taken the form of increased rebates as the Rebate / Gross Sales ratio has increased significantly since this time).At the time when this took place, Visa International and Visa Europe were separate companies. Visa International acquired Visa Europe in June 2016. It would appear that the EU regulation has not significantly impacted Visa’s transaction revenues.Operating Cost per TransactionTo create this chart, I have divided the company’s total operating costs by the number of reported transactions. I recognize that this estimate is overstating the true cost of each transaction but I think that it provides for an interesting comparison between the 2 companies.Source: Author’s summary from company 10-K filingsThe data shows that both Visa and Mastercard’s operating cost per transaction has been slowly declining over time (the odd spike is probably due to one-off costs which haven’t been eliminated in the calculation).It appears that Visa has a slight cost advantage over Mastercard which could be process-related but I suspect that it is probably more volume-related. Visa has been more successful than Mastercard in gaining customers for its network. This is demonstrated by the following chart which shows a time series of the reported number of processing transactions by company:Source: Author’s summary from company 10-K filings.Visa has historically always had more volume through its system than Mastercard but recently this step has increased further following the integration of Visa Europe into the Visa International business. The additional volume of transactions through the Visa network should allow Visa to have even lower fixed costs per unit transaction relative to Mastercard.Capital EfficiencyA quick way to look at a company’s capital efficiency is by calculating the ratio of Sales Revenues to Net Capital (where net capital is book equity plus book debt plus operating leases less cash, marketable securities and equity investments).I created the following table from the most recent 10-K filings of Mastercard and Visa:Source: Author’s compilation from 2017 company 10-K filings.The data indicates that Mastercard is a more efficient capital allocator than Visa.It is worth mentioning at this point that the invested capital in both Mastercard and Visa is probably understated. In order for both of these companies to maintain their competitive position I suspect that a reasonable portion of their labor expenses is involved in product and system development. In order to accurately assess the investment required to support the business, these expenses need to be capitalized and amortized over the life of the assets that are created by this activity. This would increase the operating margins of both companies but it would also lower the reported returns on invested capital.Higher Unit Revenues and Higher Invested Capital are the Sources of Visa’s Higher Operating MarginsThe data indicates that Visa is able to generate higher operating margins than Mastercard because it has higher revenues per transaction and it has a higher amount of invested capital per unit sales value.Mastercard’s operating expenses, more than likely, contains a reasonable amount of expenditure which technically could be described as capital in nature (relating to product or process development). This is probably a significant contributor to Mastercard having a lower operating margin compared to Visa.In preparation for estimating Mastercard's intrinsic value there is some tidy up work to be done on the Financial Statements.The Financial Services Sector is a minor user of operating leases. Operating leases are a disguised form of off-Balance Sheet financing. This Discounted Cash Flow valuation is based on the Free Cash Flow to the Firm – because we do not include Interest Income received in our cash flows we must be consistent and eliminate any Interest Expense as well.Mastercard’s reported Income Statement contains an interest expense component in the operating rents paid by Mastercard. For this reason we need to re-state the Operating Income in order to ensure that we are being consistent.At the same time we need to add back any one-off expenses which have been included in the reported Operating Income. In 2017, Mastercard incurred an expense of $167M relating to the deconsolidation of their Venezuelan investment. I have treated this as a one-off expense.Operating Lease RestatementThis adjustment requires the creation of an Operating Lease Asset which is equivalent to the present value of the Operating Lease Debt. The value of the asset is then amortized over the life of the operating lease.The value of the Operating Lease Asset can be calculated:Source: Author’s calculations from Mastercard’s 2017 and 2016 10-K.From Mastercard’s published 2017 10-K we can now calculate the restated Operating Income:Mastercard Mastercard’s 2017 10-K.This means that the restated 2017 Pre-tax Operating Profit increases by $211 M and the restated pre-tax Operating Margin increases from 53.0% to 54.7%.Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)This metric is trying to estimate the return on the company’s operating assets which can then be used to determine whether the company is allocating capital efficiently.Return on Invested Capital = After Tax Operating Profit / Invested CapitalA number of adjustments need to be made to the Balance Sheet in order to get a “true” picture of how profitable Mastercard’s operating assets really are. Unfortunately, this becomes a little technical for those without an understanding of accounting.We have already adjusted the Operating Income for the impact of Operating Leases and the notional New Asset. The Operating Income now needs to be taxed. For the 2017 year, Mastercard’s reported effective tax rate was high due to the implementation of changes to the US tax codes. For this calculation I have used a notional effective tax rate of 23% for 2017 (which should be close to Mastercard’s future long-term tax rate).Now we need to clean up the Invested Capital.First we start with the premise that it is the Invested Capital reported at the end of the previous year that generates the earnings in the current year. We do not use the invested capital reported at the end of the current year (2017) but instead use the reported 2016 numbers.We need to establish the book value of invested capital used to fund the operating assets. In this instance we take the total equity in the company’s Financial Statements and add the total debt. In the last section we established that Operating Leases are really debt. We add the value of the Operating Lease Debt to the reported total equity and total debt.We need to subtract the non-operating investments from this total because the benefits from these investments are not included in the Operating Profit. This means that the value of the Cash and Marketable Securities and Equity Investments are all eliminated from the Invested Capital.We also need to look at what acquisitions the company has recently made. Invariably these acquisitions create an item on the Balance Sheet called Goodwill. There is an argument that Goodwill represents the over-payment for productive assets but there is also a counter-argument that elements of Goodwill also represent future growth investments. I think that there are merits on both sides of this argument so I am hedging my bets.If a company has Goodwill on its Balance Sheet I eliminate 50% of it and subtract that value from the company’s total capital. However, I then progressively add back the discounted Goodwill to the Invested Capital over the remaining forecast period in my model because all of the growth benefits should have been consumed by then.Finally, we need to check what asset write-offs the company has made over the last 10 years. Companies attempt to expunge the record of their past mistakes by writing down the value of their operating assets. Unfortunately, shareholders have funded these investments and they need to be accounted for. I estimate the after-tax total of these write-offs and add it back to the Invested Capital.In the case of Mastercard there has only been one write-off over the last decade totaling $167 M (this is very impressive).You may ask why I have gone to all of this trouble in making these adjustments. The answer is - in Valuation one of the key questions to be answered is - what is the difference between the company’s return on invested capital relative to its cost of capital and if there are excess returns – how long will they last? This will be revealed later on.So for Mastercard the invested capital to use for the 2017 Return on Invested Capital is calculated as follows:Source: Author’s calculations.I have used this approach to restate Mastercard’s Operating Income and Invested Capital for the last 10 years. The result is quite unusual – for the majority of the time between 2006 and 2013, by my definition, Mastercard has negative invested capital. This has been caused by the subtraction of 50% of the reported Goodwill. In order to generate a positive return on invested capital I have included all of the Goodwill in the invested capital for the purposes of this chart. I have also included Visa’s return on invested capital which has been calculated using the same process:Source: Author’s calculations.At this point readers of this article may now understand why I have chosen to invest in Mastercard and not Visa.We are nearly ready to do some valuation work but there is one important metric left to consider. In order to develop a long term Cost of Capital for Mastercard, it is often insightful to understand what the typical capital structures are in for comparable companies. Once again I have relied on a comparison with Visa.A useful metric, which is relatively easy to calculate, is the Adjusted Book Value of Debt to Market Value of Equity ratio. This metric is calculated by adding the Book Value of Debt to the Book Value of Operating Leases and dividing by the Market Capitalization:Total Adjusted Book Value of Debt/Market Value of EquityThis screen is used to estimate the amount of leverage that a company is applying to its Balance Sheet.Source: Company 2017 10-K and 3rd Quarter 10-Q filings.The data clearly demonstrates the financial strength of both Mastercard and Visa. Both Balance Sheets are very conservatively geared and probably could sustain an increase in leverage. But I suspect that in the case of Mastercard, due to its relatively high Book Value Debt to Equity ratio and the importance of this ratio in certain financial calculations, I think that the level of gearing is unlikely to change significantly.This means that Mastercard’s current Cost of Capital is higher than it may need to be. A higher cost of capital leads to a lower valuation.I think that Mastercard has a number of issues relating to its future growth which will require management’s vigilance if the current growth trajectory is to be maintained:Mastercard’s sustained high operating margins and high returns on invested capital demonstrate the strength of its competitive advantages or “moat.”I believe that both Mastercard and Visa have a wide moat relative to their competitors that will remain intact for many years to come. The moat’s strength has several elements:The company has benefited from excellent management over many years. They have made sound decisions regarding the company’s strategy and capital allocation.It must be noted that the company operates in a cyclic market which is heavily dependent upon consumer confidence about the near-term strength of their local economy. Mastercard has seen continuous growth in revenues since as far back as 2003 (over 15 years).By virtue of the opportunity to convert cash and cheque payment transactions to cards in developing economies I think that Mastercard’s revenue growth can continue. My market assumptions are:Discounted Cash Flow MethodologyThe DCF is relatively straight-forward. A Free Cash Flow to the Firm approach is used with a 3-stage model (high growth, declining growth and maturity). The model only seeks to value the cash flows of the operating assets. The valuation has been performed in $USD.Key Assumptions in Mastercard’s ValuationThe output from my DCF model is: I also developed a Monte Carlo simulation for the valuation based on the range of inputs for the valuation. The output of the simulation was developed after 40,000 iterations.The Monte Carlo simulation can be used to help us understand the major sources of sensitivity in the valuation:The Monte Carlo simulation clearly demonstrates that the value driver in Mastercard’s valuation is the Revenue growth forecast. This variable most affects the valuation and is the greatest source of risk in the valuation.The simulation indicates that at a discount rate of 8.5%, the valuation for Mastercard’s equity per share is between $113 and $178 per share with an expected value around $142.This suggests that the stock is currently Expensive.Although I don't use Relative Valuations for my investment decisions - I know that lots of folks do. So for completeness I also provide an estimate.MethodologyGuruFocus was used to generate a list of comparable companies. The list contained 12 publicly listed North American Financial Services companies.A range of financial ratios were calculated for these companies and they were used in developing a series of linear regressions for various market multiples utilizing their companion variables.Multiples InvestigatedThe table below shows the regression coefficient of determination for each of the multiples tested:The regression whose multiple had the highest coefficient of determination is the EV/Sales multiple. This multiple was used to estimate the relative valuation for Mastercard.EV/Sales Regression StatisticsAn EV/Sales regression was developed using the independent variablesThe regression statistics were:Regression OutputAt the time of writing this article, the EV/Sales multiple for Mastercard was 13.15 (Source: GuruFocus).Using the regression coefficients and the current metrics for Mastercard (as supplied by GuruFocus) we can calculate the regression EV/Sales multiple:The calculated regression multiple is 11.43. This is lower than the actual multiple of 13.15. This indicates that on a relative basis compared to other Credit Services companies, Mastercard is expensive.We can convert the regression multiple into a share price using the following calculation:The relative valuation for Mastercard is indicating that relative to its peers the stock is currently overvalued. It is worth noting that the Relative Valuation is not showing the same degree of overvaluation compared to the Intrinsic Valuation.The purpose of this article was to value the equity in Mastercard. The estimation of the company’s intrinsic value is not overly challenging, but is highly dependent upon the assumptions behind a small number of key inputs. The company’s published financial statements are very “clean” and very little manipulation of the financial information was required for the analysis.My intrinsic value model, based upon my expected future scenario, shows that the key value driver for Mastercard is overwhelmingly the revenue growth rate over the next 5 years with a minor impact from the expected long term operating margin. I estimate that the potential spread in sales growth generates 68% of the spread in the valuation.Using regression statistics I developed a relative valuation for Mastercard based on the EV/Sales multiple. The company is currently trading at an EV/Sales multiple of 13.15 whilst the predicted regression multiple is 11.43.The results are summarized below:Mastercard appears to be currently priced above both my estimate of the company’s intrinsic value and its relative value.On a relative basis – Mastercard is only slightly expensive in a relatively expensive sector. I don’t invest based on relative valuations but even on this basis the indication is that Mastercard is at best, currently a ‘HOLD.’Mastercard and its close competitor Visa, have both had tremendous share price appreciation since the Global Financial Crisis. These 2 companies have enjoyed the benefits of the global post-GFC global expansion. They are, however, cyclical stocks, heavily dependent upon the strength of the global economy. I suspect that the global economy is closer to the peak of the current expansion (if it hasn’t already peaked) in which case I would be waiting for a further market pull-back before buying Mastercard stock.I wouldn't recommend buying Mastercard at the current price but I would certainly do so if the price fell below $142.Thanks for reading my article.

If you purchased shares at the IPO for a split-adjusted $4.60 per share, the investment would have grown over 4,000% or 34%+ per year. Mastercard the ""stock"" has performed wonderfully and as you'll see below Mastercard the ""business"" has been excellent as well.Mastercard's share price has declined nearly 17% from its peak on October 1st through this past Friday. That kind of decline gets my attention especially since it wasn't limited to just Mastercard itself, rather it was, for the most part, the entire market seeing big declines.When I look to invest my capital into a business I prefer to find companies that treat their shareholders as owners. That means I want companies that have ample cash to return some of it to me in the form of dividends.Mastercard has paid a dividend every year since their IPO in 2006 and increased the dividend payment every year since 2012. That 7 year streak of rising dividends gives them the title of Dividend Challenger.Image by author; data sourced from Mastercard's Investor Relations. A full-screen version of this chart is available here.Despite the pause in dividend growth from 2009 through 2011, Mastercard's dividend growth rates are extremely impressive. Granted that's coming off a really small base; however, the ""worst, if you can even call it that, year over year increase since the current streak started has been 13.6%. In early December management also signaled a vote of confidence in the business by raising the dividend up to $0.33 per share or a whopping 32% increase.Thus far in Mastercard's life as a public company I believe they've satisfied my requirement to both pay and grow a dividend. However, the safety of that dividend is also a top priority.The rapid dividend growth has been fueled by Mastercard's growth in both free cash flow and net income, as well as a modest increase in payout ratio. From 2009 through the TTM period the traditional payout ratio, based off net income, has averaged 12.4% and 19.5% for 2014 through the TTM period. Mastercard's average free cash flow payout ratio has looked equally impressive at 11.4% and 17.7% over the same periods, respectively.Image by author; data sourced from Mastercard SEC filings.Mastercard is a transaction processing company that provides services both in the United States and internationally. The company makes it easier for money to move around by facilitating transactions between merchants, consumers and financial transactions. In exchange for using Mastercard's network, they receive a fee for their service. Mastercard, like Visa (V), doesn't take on the credit risk of their end user like Discover Financial Services (DFS) or American Express (AXP).Mastercard's network operates in over 210 countries/territories and with more than 150 currencies. For FY 2017 approximately 35% of total revenue was generated within the United States with the balance coming from international sources with no international market generating more than 10% of revenue.*Image taken from Mastercard's 2017 Annual ReportAll business and geographical segments are seeing gains for Mastercard; however, the United States is the obvious laggard with only 6% growth for 2016 and 5% growth for 2017. The international markets and cross-border volumes are the main drivers of top line growth.I prefer to examine companies that I'm interested in through their cash flows since it gives a clearer picture of the cash moving in, out and through a business.Image by author; data sourced from Mastercard SEC filingsFrom the end of 2008 through the end of 2017 Mastercard saw its revenues climb from $4,992 M to $12,497 M. That's good for 150% total growth or 10.7% annualized.That rapid revenue growth has moved down the financial statements to give outstanding growth in both operating and free cash flow. From 2008 through 2017 operating cash flow grew 1,244% or 33.5% annualized while free cash flow grew 2,063% or 40.7% annualized.Fiscal year appears to be a bit of an outlier so I've removed that year and examined the growth from 2009 through 2017. Revenue growth came in at 145% cumulative / 12.2% annualized while operating cash flow grew 303% cumulative / 19.0% annualized. Free cash flow grew 324% cumulative / 19.8% annualized. All told the last 9 years have been very good for Mastercard.Image by author; data sourced from Mastercard SEC filingsI consider the 10% threshold to be a sign of a business with strong cash flow generation. My preference is for a >10% free cash flow margin.Since cash flows grew at a much faster pace than revenue that's led to improving cash flow margins from already lofty levels. Mastercard's free cash flow margin grew from 24.3% in 2009 up to 42.1% for 2017. The TTM period has seen a further expansion with free cash flow margin coming in at 43.3%.Mastercard's cash flow margins are impressive in their own right and what's equally impressive is just how little capex is needed to grow the company. We can see this through their free cash flow conversion, the amount of operating cash flow that's converted to free cash flow. Mastercard has averaged 93.7% free cash flow conversion from 2009 through 2017.Another metric that I like to sue to examine profitability is the free cash flow return on equity and invested capital. The FCF ROIC is the excess cash that a business generates above and beyond what is needed to grow the business for every external dollar that's been invested in the business. It's also the return that one would theoretically earn each year if one owned the entire business under the current capital structure. I want to see both of these over 10%.Image by author; data sourced from Mastercard SEC filingsMastercard has maintained a FCF ROE and ROIC well above the 10% level since 2009 with averages over that time of 53.8% and 40.9%, respectively. Up until 2014, Mastercard carried no or negligible debt on their balance sheet which is why the ROE and ROIC overlapped. Mastercard's FCF ROIC has lagged behind since then, as it should, and has dipped slightly since its 2013 peak to 48.3% although it's still at a very healthy level.The reason that I focus on cash flow, especially free cash flow, is that it's the excess cash above and beyond what a company needs to both maintain and grow the business. That free cash flow can then be used to search out new business opportunities, reduce debt or return cash to shareholders through dividends or buybacks. To see how Mastercard uses its free cash flow I like to examine 3 variations of the metric.By looking at these 3 variations on free cash flow I can see if Mastercard generates enough cash internally to fund the entire capital allocation process. Investment candidates should generally maintain a FCFaDB over time since the business would be generating more cash than is needed.Image by author; data sourced from Mastercard SEC filingsAs we saw earlier Mastercard has done a wonderful job growing free cash flow through continued expansion of their market as well as through increasing their free cash flow margins. That increasing free cash is flow is what has allowed Mastercard to grow the dividend at a rapid pace.Mastercard has maintained positive FCFaD every year since 2009 as well. With excess FCFaD Mastercard has been able to generate more cash than is needed to expand the business and pay a growing dividend and in turn move further down the capital allocation tree to buybacks as a means to generate returns for owners.Generally, Mastercard has maintained a positive FCFaDB since 2009. Cumulatively over the entire period they've generated a positive FCFaDB of $5,460 M from 2009 through the end of 2017. However, since FY 2014 management has a cumulative FCFaDB of -$576 M for the 4 years. That's excess cash than what was generated via the company which means it had to come from their balance sheet or debt.However, I'm not currently concerned about this since Mastercard has $9.04 B of cash and equivalents on their balance sheet. While the headline number of $576 M might seem large, it's only approximately 6% of their current cash hoard. Also for the TTM period FCFaDB has come in at $170 M.Over the last 4 years, and the TTM period, it appears that management is targeting roughly 100% free cash flow return via dividends and buybacks to shareholders. Image by author; data sourced from Mastercard SEC filingsFrom the end of 2008 through the end of 2017 Mastercard has reduced their share count by 17.6% or 2.1% annually. The share repurchases have certainly helped to fuel Mastercard's share price appreciation; however, given its typically expensive valuation there could be better uses of that capital.Throughout Mastercard's life as a public company, it's proven itself to be high quality and capable of strong growth. They generate mountains of cash that they've returned to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. From 2009 through 2017 Mastercard returned a total of $23.16 B to shareholders with $3.64 B being dividends and the remainder being buybacks.That being said the valuation for Mastercard still needs to make sense before I'd be willing to purchase shares. Mastercard's growth will dampen the effects of overpaying for shares, however, an investor must realize what they are giving up by doing so. One method that I like to use to determine a fair price is the minimum acceptable rate of return, ""MARR"", analysis. The MARR analysis uses estimates for future earnings and dividends, applying a reasonable future valuation on those earnings and determining whether the return meets your minimum threshold for investment.The average analyst estimate is for Mastercard to earn $7.52 per share for FY 2019 and to grow earnings on average at 18.9% per year for the next 5 years. I then assumed that Mastercard would maintain 8% per year earnings growth for the next 5 years. Annual dividend growth is assumed to track earnings growth in order to maintain a constant payout ratio at 20%.Moving on to the reasonable valuation I like to use the historic valuations that the market has assigned Mastercard in the past. Mastercard's valuation has steadily been climbing higher over the last 10 years ranging from ~12x up to 50x. Currently the TTM P/E ratio for Mastercard sits at 37.6x and the P/E for FY 2018's estimate is 29.5x. Mastercard's shares could trade at a near 50x P/E ratio 5 to 10 years down the line; however, I don't think it'd be prudent to assume so. For the MARR analysis I'll examine P/E ratios ranging from 15x-30x.MA Normalized PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsThe following table shows the potential internal rates of return that Mastercard would generate with a purchase price of $186, the closing price from December 28th. The returns include estimated dividend payments using the above criteria and are run through the end of calendar year 2023, 5 year, and calendar year 2028, 10 year.Assuming that Mastercard's growth is close to that assumed above then the returns look solid. Mastercard has a high likelihood of delivering 10%+ annualized returns if the growth pans out.Alternatively, I've started calculating target purchase prices assuming a 15% discount rate based on the various future P/E ratios. A purchase at these prices should generate ~15% returns for the respective time frames.Mastercard has a huge tailwind pushing the company forward with the continuing trend away from cash/checks and towards cards. Personally the only times I don't use my card is when places, such as my upcoming property tax bill, charge too much to make me use my card. This trend isn't limited to just the United States, rather it's a global trend that should continue humming along.Mastercard the business is doing just fine. The biggest issues facing Mastercard are: (1) further limitation of swipe fees (2) Visa's dominance in market 61% of payment volumes/61% of cards versus Mastercard's 30% share of volume/34% of cards. (3) some currently unknown disruptor to the business model.Regarding the swipe fees I'm not too concerned about this as it would likely only limit some of the profitability, but not take the business down. Mastercard's network is large and makes financial transactions convenient. Even if swipe fees are limited the overall market is still likely to grow and will make up for any lost fees.Visa's dominance in the market is potentially a good sign or a bad sign and that determination will be made based on how Mastercard is able to proceed going forward. If Mastercard loses market share to Visa or any of the other competitors that would obviously hurt the business; however, Mastercard very well could increase their market share going forward.The last risk to Mastercard is the ""unknown disruptor"". Something very well could come along to disrupt Mastercard's business model; however, speculating on that happening seems foolhardy at this time. Mastercard is still growing quickly and the potential market for is estimated at an additional $17 T of cash/check transactions that can potentially be converted to any of the major transaction networks.Since Mastercard's dividend yield is only 0.71% at this time, it might not be a suitable for some dividend growth investors. However, younger investors or investors that don't currently need the dividends should consider Mastercard as a low yield/high growth part of their portfolio.At this time I won't be purchasing any shares of Mastercard although it was much more tempting a week or so ago with the share price in the mid $170's. If Mastercard dips to the low $170's or into the $160's, I would consider adding shares at that time.I am not a financial professional.

        This stock remains fundamentally strong, but competition in its sector is increasing.
        While I remain optimistic, growth in net income could moderate going forward.","Back in July, I made the argument that the price drop in MasterCard Incorporated (MA) was unjustified, and that we could expect to see a rebound again soon.The two key reasons for my argument included:However, we have seen that price has fallen significantly since October, from a high of $225 to $193 at the time of writing:Source: investing.comWith equity markets having taken a fall, along with concerns over recessionary risks, one could understand why a stock like MasterCard could also take a hit.In the event of a recession and a slowdown in consumer spending, this would likely also mean less spending on the part of consumers and a subsequent slowdown in Gross Dollar Volume.Since October, we see that MasterCard is down by 12.20%, in comparison to a 10.15% fall in the S&P 500:Source: investing.comHowever, analysis of 3Q 2018 financial results reveal that:Source: MasterCard Incorporated Third-Quarter 2018 Earnings ReleaseFrom a financial standpoint, there does not appear to be specific issues inherent to the company itself that would cause a significant price drop - the same appears to be market-related.That said, while I have been quite optimistic on MasterCard’s prospects in the past, tempered optimism is an important trait for any investor. In this regard, what are the risks associated with this stock?We are now living in a world where payment options are becoming ever greater. The use of cash has been declining significantly in importance. As a case in point, Sweden has become one of the most cashless societies in the world, where cash is no longer accepted for many transactions. The use of credit cards would see a significant increase in usage in this instance, but the increased prevalence of online transactions has also meant significant competition from online payment platforms such as PayPal (PYPL), SagePay, and Skrill.Moreover, while cryptocurrencies have yet to be accepted into the mainstream and have also been somewhat ridiculed, the fact that payments can be made with cryptocurrency by avoiding traditional debit or credit card fees is an enticing prospect. Should cryptocurrency payments significantly increase in popularity going forward, then this could pose a threat to MasterCard, even as the company attempts to enter the market itself.Additionally, I had previously stated that the Chinese market could mean a significant opportunity for MasterCard to expand its business. However, this may not necessarily be as easy as anticipated. For instance, while China has technically allowed American card companies licenses to operate in the country, China’s UnionPay still has a solid hold on the industry. Moreover, mobile payments from the likes of Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) and Alibaba (BABA) have been increasing rapidly, and such competition may prove too great. MasterCard is a world-renowned brand in many countries, but would be entering China as a new player, which would be a different ball game.While MasterCard has continued to see impressive growth in net income and gross dollar volume, pressure on card payment fees has forced MasterCard and competitor Visa (V) to cap fees charged on tourists in the European Union. In particular, scrutiny from European regulators has meant that card fees have had to come down, meaning that MasterCard has had to make up the shortfall through increased Gross Dollar Volume.Ultimately, I still remain optimistic on MasterCard. Depending on when the broader market rebounds, I would expect this stock to do the same. However, competition is intensifying for this company, and it is worth bearing in mind the risk that MasterCard could see growth in net income moderate going forward as a result.Disclaimer: This article is written on an ""as is"" basis and without warranty.

4240357,104122,2019-02-12T18:23:29-05:00,"Mastercard operates a venerable business with significant competitive advantages.The stock remains a lucrative investment holding.Although Mastercard exhibits stable long-term prospects, the company (even by its own metrics) is significantly overvalued, creating an unattractive risk-reward proposition for short-term investors.","Source: Google ImagesRight alongside Visa (V) and American Express (AXP), Mastercard (MA) is one of the most renown payment processing networks in the world. MA has a strong global presence with its payments being accepted in over 210 countries and territories worldwide. The company has been in existence since 1966 with its business operations centralized around payment processing. With over 853 million cards in circulation, MA controls roughly 22% of the total payment interchange market.Based on card quantities, payment volumes, and total number of transactions, MA remains a formidable domestic and global player within the card processing space. MA's significant scale and substantial brand utilization make the company well positioned to expand revenues from new merchants. Aside from significant scale advantages, MA benefits from a continuous business feedback loop. As more customers use MA debit and credit cards, more merchants accept them, creating an enduring revenue expansion cycle. As society progressively moves toward a cashless economic system, MA is well positioned to capture not only incremental demand but increased market share. Online buying preferences, the convenience of using cards, and buyer protections cause consumers to increasingly utilize card payments over cash. A U.S. consumer payment study conducted by PYMTS.com demonstrates how cash usage has gradually diminished over time. As depicted by the graph below, cash usage fell from 16% of GDP in 2003 to around 13% in 2018.Source: PYMTS.comAlthough the United States has a very cash-intensive economy, the overall usage of cash is far less than the use of debit and credit card payments. In 2015, Americans spent a total of $2,359 billion with cash and $5,527 billion with cards. Already payment processing companies ranging from MA, V, and AXP benefit from significant transaction volumes, and over the coming decade, increased card utilization will continue to bolster revenues. Furthermore, the deviation from cash to card payment methodologies will be enhanced by online retail purchasing. Consumers are highly motivated by convenience and the current e-commerce and digital purchasing environment is conducive to increased card usage.Another noteworthy tailwind for MA will be rising inflation. An increase in pricing for various consumer goods will bolster MA's revenues, as revenues are correlated with transactional dollar amounts as opposed to pre-determined fees. Continued inflation in both domestic and international markets appears to be an unchanging and worsening reality. Inflationary expectations in Europe are the highest they have been in five years and the United States continues to face inflationary pressures despite the government's misperception of no real inflation. The Fed's repeated policy of quantitative easing, supplemented with pervasively low-interest rates, has had the effect of causing significant monetary inflation. Over the past decade, the costs associated with consumer goods, cars, tuition, and real estate have increased dramatically. Although detrimental to the everyday consumer, rising inflation will have positive implications for MA's revenues.MA demonstrates pristine financial and operational health. The company exhibits consistent asset expansion, substantial liquidity reserves of $8.6 billion, and a manageable long-term debt load. MA's sizable liquidity reserves better position the company for monetary deployments on new technologies, acquisitions, and debt reduction initiatives. Furthermore, the company's long-term debt load of $6.3 billion is unproblematic as MA's liquidity reserves eclipse debt obligations and debt is overwhelmingly covered by operating cash flow, at 98.2% coverage.Data by YChartsSomething I would like to point out is that MA does not assume the role of a creditor much like AXP. MA does not derive revenue from interest or fees paid by account holders on Mastercard products such as credit cards. MA only receives transaction interchange payments from the financial institutions brandished on the credit or debit cards. MA eliminates any of the credit default risks associated with lending money. This results in very low volatility in the stock price and preservation of the company's balance sheet. MA has disassociated itself with a number of risks tied to the global financial system, allowing the company to be somewhat shielded from downturns in the financial markets.Yet, another compelling reason for investment is MA's unparalleled operating margins. MA boasts an impressive 39% net profit margin as the company's payment interchange services eliminate many traditional supply related expenditures. MA is one of the most profitable companies on the planet, resulting in a very high return on invested capital. Furthermore, MA's business as a payment gateway has enabled inelastic revenue expansion for the past couple of decades, even amidst economic calamities. Also, MA along with its counterparts V and AXP, operate as virtual oligopolies within the payment interchange space. These three companies account for 21.9%, 52.7%, and 21.6% of the total card market respectively. Due to their entrenched market share and low number of competitors, all three companies demonstrate a highly stable revenue outlook.Data by YChartsFrom an investment returns perspective, MA has much to offer in the form of sustained capital appreciation, elevated dividend payments, and continued share buybacks. Over the past five years, MA has sustained capital appreciation of 179%, and over time the stock has experienced very little volatility. Because MA does not have to reinvest much of its free cash flow back into operations, the company is able to divert a substantial amount of money to share repurchases: In 2018 alone, Mastercard's board of directors approved a $6.5 billion share buyback program. In addition to capital appreciation, MA currently offers a dividend yield of .61%. While a yield under 1% is unlikely to excite investors, the company has consistently increased its dividend over the last 7 years and the dividend payout ratio is quite low at only 20% of free cash flow.MA's business strengths and operational stability furnish a hefty trading premium. MA's share price at $216 is hovering around its 52-week high of $225. Based on a discounted cash flow valuation, MA's share price of $216 far exceeds the future cash flow value of $158, implying significant overvaluation. Although I would find a 10-15% trading premium justifiable, a 27% premium creates an asymmetric risk-reward proposition. Such significant overvaluation provides investors with a strong impetus to sell and realize capital gains. I recently exited my position at around $214 but always keep MA on my stock watchlist in the event of a good pullback. I think a compelling entry point for MA would be under $180, but even at around $190, the stock seems more reasonably valued, given a broader time horizon.In the general sense, MA is a fantastic stock to have in your investment portfolio. The company displays numerous business advantages ranging from entrenched market share, high-profit margins, significant amounts of free cash flow, and a stable growth trajectory. From an investment standpoint, MA has delivered formidable capital appreciation, dividend growth, and routine share buybacks. Although I wouldn't encourage investment at this moment, MA remains a highly lucrative and promising stock for the long-term investor.Author's note: Thanks for taking the time to read the article.

4195321,104152,2018-08-06T12:09:59-04:00,Looking at Mastercard's 2Q18 success and evaluating why it's still not enough to justify current levels.Evaluating the P/E ratio in comparison to its competitors and addressing concerns about its lack of sustainability.Giving the company various price target valuations based on different market environments.Looking into the value of the dividend.,"I have been asked to write an analysis with a recommendation on Mastercard (NYSE:MA). I am a fan of banks and companies in the financial services sector; however, when it comes to Mastercard, I believe it is a little too pricey for my taste in retrospect to other companies in its sector. I am going to evaluate Mastercard's dividend, gross dollar volume (GDV), switched transactions, and credit card results to explain why, even though the results aren't bad, they aren't good enough to justify purchasing Mastercard at current market levels around $200 per share. I am going to outline why I believe Mastercard is worthy of investment at the right price, as well as why I believe its current market levels are above that price. I will outline one outlier in which I do believe MA could be worth purchasing at current market levels, however, that belief is only contingent on whether or not a said investor believes that the company will continue to trade at its above-sector-average P/E ratio. With that being said, my overall consensus on Mastercard is to hold it if you were lucky enough to get it at lower price levels, and to hold off purchasing at current levels.Mastercard did see impressive growth in gross dollar volume figures. I want to iterate again that the company is posting impressive results, but when translated to forecasted earnings down the road when compared to sector P/E ratio averages, I don't see a lot of potential for the return I'd like to see in association with the way I value companies. With that being said, Mastercard has posted 9% growth in GDV in the United States, 16% growth in the rest of the world, and worldwide growth of 14% holistically. Double-digit global GDV growth is quite impressive for a company of Mastercard's size in its sector; as it is the second largest credit card company next to Visa (NYSE:V), with 191 million cardholders. While these figures are impressive, as I will discuss below, they still don't justify its current market price.(Image Source: Earnings Presentation: Pg. 4.)Mastercard has also demonstrated impressive growth in its switched transactions segment of its business model. The company posted 2Q17 transactions of 16,014 (in millions) and 2Q18 transactions of 18,161 (in millions), representing 13% growth from the same quarter a year ago. Double-digit growth for any company is respectively impressive, but again, I do find it intriguing that Mastercard has managed to post this level of growth. Another thing to keep in mind is that the company also posted adjusted growth figures for the impact of Venezuelan deconsolidation in both 2Q17 and 2Q18. With adjustments for Venezuelan deconsolidation, Mastercard posted adjusted transaction growth of 17%. Again, impressive numbers, but as I will discuss below in my valuation paragraph, the numbers just aren't good enough for me personally.(Image Source: Earnings Presentation Pg. 5.)Mastercard's credit card growth card growth is the weakest of all, but still not bad. Mastercard posted 2Q17 cardholders of 2,329 (in millions) and 2Q18 cardholders of 2,441 (in millions), representing 5% growth from the same period a year ago. With adjustments for Venezuelan deconsolidation from 2Q17 and 2Q18 their adjusted growth comes out to 7% growth. Although, Mastercard's Maestro card actually saw a decline in cardholder's, having 610 (in millions) in 2Q17 and 527 (in millions) in 2Q18. Mastercard's cardholder growth wasn't incredible, but also wasn't bad. Regardless, the growth translation to earnings and sector-average P/E ratios does not justify an investment entry price at current market levels.(Image Source: Earnings Presentation Pg. 5.)Mastercard's dividend situation is an interesting one. I believe MA has plenty of potential to consistently increase the dividend, and even with impressive growth. The problem I have, along with the rest of my analysis, is the current market price. At current market prices, Mastercard has a dividend yield of 0.50% with an annualized payout of $1.00 per share. The company has increased its dividend for the last six years and has a payout ratio of 15.7%. What I like is the fact that with a 15.7% payout ratio, Mastercard is providing an annualized payout of $1.00 per share. It has plenty of room to increase the dividend with a 15.7% payout ratio. What I can't stand here is the 0.50% yield. Mastercard would have to have a payout ratio of 62.8% just to have a 2% dividend yield with its market price. For those lucky enough to get into MA at lower prices have the potential to be holding a good dividend company in Mastercard with enough time. However, at current market levels, the dividend is not that attractive to me.I am using a basic valuation method to demonstrate why I believe Mastercard's impressive historical growth and recent financial results still don't justify an investment in it at current market levels. To begin with, Mastercard is trading at roughly $200 per share and has a P/E ratio of approximately 45. While it hasn't been terribly uncommon for companies to trade at relatively high P/E ratios in today's market, the financial services industry trades at a much lower sector-average P/E ratio than 45. The financial services sector-average P/E ratio is 17.70. I narrowed that P/E ratio down and took the average P/E ratio of American Express (NYSE:AXP), Discover Card (NYSE:DFS), Capital One (NYSE:COF), and Visa. With Mastercard included, the average P/E ratio was 26.35; without Mastercard the average was 21.69, thus, I took the average between the two to get an approximate average of 24.Considering Mastercard has beat earnings forecast expectations in the last four quarters, I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt when looking at future forecasts. NASDAQ forecasts Mastercard to have FY20 earnings of $8.81 per share. When looking at the last four quarters, Mastercard has beat NASDAQ's forecasts with an average surprise factor of 9.57%. If I apply that surprise factor to its FY20 forecasted earnings, the company would post FY20 earnings of $9.65 per share. I generally believe companies in the same sector with an equal level of competitive edge to its peers will trade at similar P/E ratios. When it comes to Mastercard, its main competitor is Visa, which not only has significantly more cardholders, but also trades at a lower market price and P/E ratio. Visa also has a higher dividend yield.As stated above, the average P/E ratio for the largest credit card companies is 24. With that earnings multiple, and a generous FY20 estimate of Mastercard's earnings coming in at $9.65 per share, the company will theoretically trade around $231.60 per share by the end of FY20. That would represent a return of roughly 15.5% in 2.5 years, and a CAGR of just over 5%. While some investors may not think this level of return is terrible, it's not as good as I would personally like to see. Also keep in mind this level of return is based on companies in specifically the credit card sector trading at a relatively high P/E ratio of 24, on top of the fact that the earnings estimate I used is generous. I would not be surprised if Mastercard grew at a CAGR under 5%, and would say it's even possible that its market price could go down.The fundamental behind my caution with Mastercard comes from the fact that while it has posted impressive results and beat earnings forecasts, the market price is still too high for me to justify purchasing now. I like the growth it's demonstrated, and it's always great to see a beat in earnings surprise, but even with all of that, MA is still trading at a P/E ratio of 45; considerably higher than competitor averages. Even with its growth and applying an earnings surprise factor of nearly 10%, MA would only appreciate by 15.5% in 2.5 years if it trades in line with its competitors' average P/E ratios. So, while I believe that Mastercard has demonstrated great success and results, I believe the company, and its early buying shareholders, have already been quite generously rewarded for such performance. I am putting an FY20 price target of $231 per share on Mastercard based on this valuation.If a 15.5% return over 2.5 years, representing a FY20 market price of $231 per share, is sufficient for the readers of this article, I would recommend purchasing MA at current market levels. If you purchased Mastercard under current market levels, I would certainly recommend holding onto it. If a 15.5% return over 2.5 years does not seem too favorable, I would recommend looking into other securities with more capital gain and dividend potential.The main principle surrounding my caution with Mastercard is the fact that it is trading at a much higher P/E ratio than its competitors without any kind of substantial competitive edge to justify the higher P/E ratio. However, the one outlier that I haven't entirely addressed is the fact that it is possible for Mastercard to continue trading at the current P/E ratio of 45. If this is the case, MA would trade at a FY20 market price of roughly $396.45 per share, and that is with the forecasted earnings of $8.81 per share, not my generous estimate of $9.65. For investors or individuals that believe that Mastercard will continue to trade at a P/E ratio of 45, clearly a buy recommendation would be warranted as that market price would nearly represent a 100% upside in 2.5 years. I, however, do not see this being the case, but figured I would include this outlier.Overall, I believe Mastercard has posted quite impressive results when it comes to the gross dollar volume growth, switched transactions growth, and cardholder growth. I think the management is impeccable. I believe it is absolutely worth an investment at the right price, probably anything under $175 per share. However, at current market levels combined with Mastercard's extremely high P/E ratio in comparison to competitors, lack of significant competitive edge, unimpressive dividend at current levels, and earnings forecasts that don't paint a growth picture that I am personally looking for, I would not recommend purchasing it at current levels unless you're okay with a CAGR of roughly 5% or maybe less. Based on the average P/E ratio of credit card companies and Mastercard's earnings forecasts, I believe MA will trade around $231 per share by the end of FY20 unless it can sustain its extremely high P/E ratio. My general consensus on Mastercard is to hold onto it if you purchased at lower prices, and to look to other securities with higher upside potential if you were considering investing in MA at current levels. I will also say I would recommend purchasing Mastercard at a market price lower than $175 per share."
4211818,102764,2018-10-16T07:03:51-04:00,"Mastercard is a high-quality business with solid competitive strengths.The company shows exceptional financial performance.The stock is relatively expensive in comparison to the broad market, but not necessarily overvalued when considering the company's fundamental strength.","Mastercard (NYSE:MA) has delivered spectacular returns for investors over the years. The stock has gained over 1,080% in the last decade, far surpassing the S&P 500 index and its cumulative gain of 175.8% in the same period.MA data by YChartsPast performance does not guarantee future returns, of course. But high-quality companies with solid competitive strengths tend to keep on winning over time, and Mastercard has what it takes to continue producing outstanding performance in the years ahead.Second only to Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard is one of the most powerful and globally recognized brands in the payments industry, a business in which brand recognition and trust are key strategic advantages.The network effect creates a virtuous cycle of sustained growth and increasing competitive strength for MasterCard. In a nutshell, the network effect means that the value of the service increases as it gains more users over time. The telephone and the internet are textbook examples, and the payments industry works under the same dynamic.Merchants need to accept the debit and credit cards that can bring more customers to the stores, and customers want to have a card that is accepted everywhere. This means customers and merchants attract each other to the main card networks, and this makes the network more valuable over time.MasterCard is not only getting bigger when it grows in size but is also getting stronger from a competitive point of view, while also creating more value for customers and merchants. The payments industry still offers massive opportunities for growth in the years ahead. Visa calculates that replacing cash and checks with cards is worth nearly $17 trillion in annual spending around the world.Financial performance over the long term has been truly exceptional. Back in the year 2008, Mastercard was producing $4.99 billion in revenue and $240 million in free cash flow. Fast forward ten years and the business is generating $13.96 billion in sales and $5.52 billion in free cash flow on a trailing twelve-month basis.The chart below shows how key financial metrics such as revenue, free cash flow, and earnings per share have evolved in the past ten years.MA Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsMost of the direct costs of doing business in a particular region are related to the technological infrastructure necessary to process payments, so costs are relatively fixed and profit margins tend to increase with revenue growth. For this reason, Mastercard retains almost 54% of revenue as operating profit, and free cash flow margin is in the neighborhood of 40% of sales.It's one thing to say that a stock is expensive, meaning that it is priced at a premium versus the broad market, and a very different thing to say that such stock is overvalued in comparison to its fundamental quality. In other words, superior quality deserves an above-average valuation, and Mastercard is clearly a high-quality stock in a remarkably promising industry.The chart below compares valuation ratios such as enterprise value-to-EBITDA, forward P/E, and price-to-earnings growth for Mastercard versus other players in the payments industry like Visa and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). The numbers clearly show that Mastercard stock is priced in line with industry standards.Importantly, the company has an impressive track record in terms of delivering earnings numbers above Wall Street expectations. The chart below shows earnings expectations, the actual reported number, and the difference between the two - both in absolute terms and as a percentage - over the past several quarters.Stock prices don't reflect a company's fundamentals in isolation. Expectations in comparison to those fundamentals can be even more important. If the company is reporting better-than-expected financial performance, this can be a powerful upside fuel for the stock price.Wall Street analysts have consistently underestimated Mastercard's ability to generate profits over the years. The chart below shows how earnings expectations for the company in both the current year and the next have materially increased over time.MA EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YChartsIf Mastercard continues to beat expectations in the years ahead, this would make its valuation figures more attractive than what current numbers are indicating.The PowerFactors system is a quantitative investing system available to members in my research service, ""The Data Driven Investor"". This system basically ranks companies in a particular universe according to quantitative return drivers such as financial quality, valuation, fundamental momentum, and relative strength. The system has produced solid performance over the long term. The chart below shows the annualized returns for companies in 10 different PowerFactors ranking buckets since January of 1999 in comparison to the SPDR S&P 500.There is a direct relationship between the PowerFactors ranking and annualized returns, meaning that companies with higher rankings tend to produce superior returns, and vice-versa. In addition, stocks with relatively high quantitative rankings tend to materially outperform the market over the years.Data from S&P Global via Portfolio123Mastercard is among the best 10% of stocks in the market based on the quantitative algorithm. This means that the stock looks clearly attractive when considering quantitative return drivers such as financial quality, valuation, fundamental momentum, and relative strength in combination.Historical performance does not guarantee future returns, and performance numbers for quantitative systems should always be interpreted with caution, since the future is always a matter of possibilities and probabilities as opposed to certainties.Because of its own nature, a quantitative system is always backward-looking. This means a system can tell you that a specific group of companies with certain quantitative attributes has a good chance of delivering market-beating returns over long periods of time, but it does not tell you much about a particular stock.When it comes to Mastercard, the stock is priced for demanding growth expectations, so it's vulnerable to the downside if the company fails to deliver in accordance with those expectations.Besides, the industry is particularly dynamic and prone to technological disruption. Big players from the technology sector, such as Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), and Alibaba (BABA), are increasingly venturing into digital payments.Companies in the sector seem to be inclined to making profitable alliances and playing nice with each other as opposed to savagely competing for customers and earnings. As long as this remains the case, the size of the market opportunity should be big enough for both card operators and tech players to benefit substantially from the death of cash over the years and decades ahead. Nevertheless, it’s important to monitor the industry in case competition becomes more aggressive, which could have a negative impact on margins.Legal and regulatory risk is perhaps the most important risk factor to watch for in Mastercard. The company operates in a market with few big players and limited competition, and it generates extraordinary profitability. This makes of it an easy target for politicians and lawyers trying to impose limitations and new regulations on the business.Those risks being acknowledged, Mastercard is a world-class business with rock-solid competitive strength and outstanding profitability. As long as the fundamentals remain strong, chances are that the company will continue to deliver market-beating returns in the years ahead."
4199676,104662,2018-08-16T06:24:38-04:00,"Mastercard has seen impressive growth in both performance and share price appreciation.But compared to their traditional competitor Visa, Mastercard appears overvalued.The company's business strategy is moving the company away from their reliance on transaction revenue.Mastercard has spent the last several years building up their SaaS platforms, and investors should expect continued revenue growth from these offerings.","Mastercard (MA) has long been known for a simple business model: Every time someone uses a debit card or credit card with the Mastercard logo on it, Mastercard is paid a small percentage of the amount. This has led the company to achieve extremely high share growth since their IPO, while maintaining an operating margin above 50%.However, Mastercard is also expanding their business model. Their latest Letter to Stockholders focused almost solely on services being provided outside of payments, such as their Early Detection System, Decision Intelligence Tool, Safety Net, etc. Although their main revenue still comes from transactions, Mastercard is beginning to diversify from transaction revenue, and become a software as a service (SaaS) provider.As Mastercard’s SaaS offerings continue to build capabilities, they will be able to continue to grow revenue even if transactions begin to lag. Because of this, I believe Mastercard should not only be compared to Visa (V), but also PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ) as well. Below, I plan on discussing Mastercard’s SaaS offerings, their current success of diversifying beyond transactions, as well as why I don’t believe a relative valuation shows Mastercard as overvalued.The core revenue driver for Mastercard is still transaction fees. In an effort to diversify away from this, and take advantage of their ability to collect payment data, Mastercard has begun offering SaaS products as well. Revenues from their SaaS offerings are labeled as “Other Revenue.”Source: Mastercard IRAlthough their SaaS revenue is relatively small compared to their other sources, the expansion beyond transactions is the focus of Mastercard’s diversification. This is also what is separating Mastercard from Visa, as Mastercard has been more aggressive in acquisitions and SaaS offerings. In the last few years, Mastercard has added offerings for financial institutions, governments, merchants, and advertisers. Although it is difficult to track the progress of the individual offerings, we can assume these solutions make up most of the $785 million in ""Other Revenue."" ""Other Revenue"" is all revenue that is made from consulting and analytics, safety/security, as well as other sources that aren’t directly related to their transaction revenue.If we compare the revenue made by their SaaS offerings with their competitors, we begin to see how successful Mastercard’s business model expansion has been. Below, I will compare the non-transaction revenue (labeled differently for each company) from PayPal’s and Visa’s last quarter, as well as Square’s ""Subscription and Services-Based Revenue."" As a disclaimer, PayPal, Visa and Mastercard don’t break down their SaaS revenue from their other revenue category, so we will need to assume that SaaS revenue makes up a high percent of “Other Revenue” (or similar name), which is where the SaaS revenue is booked.Source: Gathered by Author from each company’s 10-QFrom a revenue perspective, we see Mastercard match up favorably with similar offerings from PayPal and Square (these companies use different names for where their SaaS revenues are recorded, with Visa labeling ""Service Revenue"" as revenue obtained from transactions as an example). Although Mastercard is seeing smaller revenue growth compared to PayPal and Square, we still see the possibility that Mastercard may be generating more revenue from their SaaS offerings than the other two, with the assumption that most of “Other Revenue” comes from their SaaS offerings.As mentioned before, growth of their SaaS offerings was the main takeaway from the latest annual letter. Mastercard also believes that expanding their SaaS offerings will help maintain their current contracts, as well as gain new deals. This will lead to higher transaction revenue growth as well. These beliefs Mastercard holds appear to be confirmed so far, as CEO Ajaypal Singh Banga stated in the last earnings call, “We're also running our services through them, which gives us scale, be it safety and security, be it other kinds of data analytics. What that does is it gives us a much broader, wider relationship, as that is what we're investing our money into is to create a stable system of having a broader, wider relationship beyond just the core payment transaction revenue stream that used to be in this company the primary source of revenue 8, 9, 10 years ago.”Investors won’t be able to accurately track how much revenue is generated purely from their SaaS offerings, or the indirect transaction revenue growth. However, investors should begin to see the SaaS offerings bring in higher levels of revenue growth as it expands, as they focus on growing this aspect of their business and directly competing with Square and PayPal.Because of their business model expansion, simply comparing Visa and Mastercard should not be enough to deem Mastercard as overvalued. Mastercard’s focus and success in their SaaS offerings should lead investors to compare Mastercard’s metrics with PayPal and Square as well, although we have limited information on Square due to their inability to make a profit yet. Below, we will compare Mastercard with their traditional competitor Visa, as well as PayPal.Source: Yahoo FinanceI believe that Mastercard should see valuation metrics above Visa, and below PayPal. PayPal has been more aggressive in growing their SaaS offerings, but Mastercard is seeing success in this area as well. The focus on growing their SaaS offerings leads to the disparity in operating margin compared to Visa. Beyond this, we do not see any signs that Mastercard is overvalued on a relative valuation measure. PEG ratio for all three companies is above 1, but this is likely due to optimism of the growing fintech sector. Both trailing and forward P/E ratios suggest Mastercard is fairly priced, acting as the middle ground between Visa and PayPal.I believe that Mastercard shows no signs of being overvalued relative to their peers. In fact, if Mastercard were to be more transparent with their SaaS revenue and revenue growth, the company might see a slight undervaluation possibility. However, PayPal and Square have been more aggressive in growing their ecosystem and SaaS offerings, so their valuations are rightly above Mastercard’s. But if Mastercard is able to become a successful SaaS competitor, investors should expect Mastercard’s valuation to continue to be above Visa’s, but slightly below PayPal’s. Due to Mastercard’s future business model plan and their transaction fee platform, I do not believe Mastercard is overvalued.Mastercard shares have seen excellent growth over the last year, as they expand beyond transactions. Mastercard has made several acquisitions over the past five years, and investors are beginning to see the positive effects of this expansion. Mastercard also appears to have SaaS offerings that are close to PayPal’s and Square’s offerings as well, in terms of revenue.Comparing Mastercard to their traditional competitors presents an overvalued case. But with their SaaS offerings growing and adding an extra component to their revenue and business model, I believe Mastercard does not appear as overvalued relative to their peers. Investors should follow Mastercard’s SaaS expansion, as this will likely allow Mastercard to diversify their business offerings and revenue sources, and provide better long-term growth prospects for investors.Disclaimer: The above references an opinion and is for information purposes only.

The stellar performance is backed by the continued growth in the global payment volumes particularly across the US and Europe. Management cited headwind especially within Asia courtesy of trade wars despite consumer sentiment remaining positive.Mastercard's financial performance results go only to prove the firm's success in its specific industry. Despite some ramifications expected due to the China - Asia trade wars, the firm continues to grow their revenue base, market share and secular growth to ensure it continues to beat analysts' projected growth thus their target price.The result has been that the firm has experienced a 17% year over year growth in revenue - foreign exchange neutral revenue. While this was the case, the purchase volumes, however, decelerated as the gross dollar volume growth, purchase volume growth and FX cross-border volumes which experienced a 13.3%, 14.9% and 16.6% year over year growth decelerated in growth from their previous quarter values. Mastercard purchased an additional $1.2 billion in shares during Q3 2018 - purchasing some $385 million through October 25 - to see their EPS rise to $1.78 per share thus beating consensus analyst estimates.The transactions business is driven primarily by growth in macroeconomic conditions. Stable or growing economies, especially those with robust banking systems, provide the platform on which companies such as Mastercard can grow their brand. Currently, the United States and Europe have been the platform on which Mastercard has risen to the top.Source: Yahoo FinanceThis, however, comes in the backdrop of rising tensions between China and the United States. During the investor briefing, the company's management announced that there was expected to be serious windfall especially in their operations within Asia courtesy of the trade wars which have rocked the two financial giants. On the overall, however, consumers remain positive despite this, a factor which has assured management of positive tidings going forward.The continued uncertainty within the United Kingdom coupled with the political and economic upheavals within the Latin American region - Brazil, Mexico and Argentina - have also been a key factor especially when transactions come to play. The exchange rate volatility is Argentina has especially hampered growth in the transaction volumes of the firm, negatively affecting their bottom lines.Source: Yahoo FinanceDespite this, the firm has continued to beat analysts' consensus earnings per share estimates. For the third quarter especially, the firm's projected revenues continued to provide a high-teen growth and this, coupled with the better margins performance, led to them producing stellar results. The result was thus a better EPS performance than was expected by analysts. However, the current tax rate of 19% - below the consensus rate of 20.3% - also played a critical role in ensuring that the above EPS was produced.Domestic assessments were noted to be the only segment which beat analysts' consensus. Catering to about 27.7% of the entire revenue, their growth rate was critical towards ensuring that the firm's top line was maintained. Following closely on this path was the cross-border volume fees - accounting for 23.7% of total revenue - which missed analysts' expectations of 15.7% narrowly to close at 15.6%. Transaction processing fees, however, missed their target growth by a higher margin as they grew by 15% as compared to the estimates of 17%.The operating margins also rose 2.3% to close the quarter at 59.4%. Furthermore, their yield to date which has increased by 24%, higher than the 16% offered by Visa, has also ensured that they trade at a higher valuation that their counterparts. With estimates showing an average growth within the US of 11%, 9% and 13% in payment volumes, credit and debit activity, higher than that of Visa as well as a 22% volume growth in Europe, the firm is pegging their growth on that of these countries.The firm believes that the continued growth in the transaction volumes of stable economies, especially the United States and Europe, will provide the impetus for their growth. Their Asia market operations are also expected to be affected especially by the expected meeting between the presidents of the United States and China as they work to resolve the current economic crisis caused by tariffs from both countries which have had an impact on both regional blocks as a whole.All in all, backed by the continued growth in the earnings from stable markets, it is expected that the growth in MA's performance and share price is imminent over the coming quarters.The stellar performance seen by MA over Q3 2018 is a precursor to their expected future performance. With the firm's top line being better than those of their competitors - 2% higher revenues than those of Visa - and earnings being better than the consensus analysts' earnings, it presents investors with an opportunity to benefit further from higher gains and dividend yields. As such, in line with the recommendation from most analysts, MA remains a buy."
4205909,103321,2018-09-12T17:23:55-04:00,"MasterCard operates the second largest electronic payment networks in the world.The company’s Q2 2018 revenue growth rate of 20% was lower than Q1’s 30.9% growth rate.However, MasterCard should be able to sustain its revenue growth rate due to its arranged investment activities, favorable secular trend, and strong global economic activities.MasterCard’s current valuation is higher than its historical average.","MasterCard (MA) saw a slowdown in its Q2 2018 revenue growth rate compare to Q1 2018. We do not believe this should be a concern as the company had a good start in its Q3 2018. The company's investments in the second half of the year should help it to maintain its future revenue growth rate. In addition, the company should continue to enjoy tailwinds from favorable secular trend, and solid global consumer confidence level. Its forward P/E ratio is currently about 3 multiples above its 5-year average.MA data by YChartsMasterCard posted another quarter of revenue growth. Its Q2 2018 revenue of $3.7 billion was a growth rate of 20% year over year. This double-digit growth rate was good. However, its growth rate of 20% in Q2 was slower than the growth rate of 30.9% in Q1 2018. One of the reasons why its revenue growth rate declined sequentially was due to MasterCard's closing of its acquisition of Vocalink, which happened in late April last year. However, the impact was minor as Vocalink's annual revenue of 195 million pounds in 2016 (or $252 million) was quite small when compare to MasterCard's annual revenue of $10.8 billion in 2016.Source: Created by author; MorningstarWe are not concerned about its sequential revenue growth decline for the following reasons:A Good start to Q3 2018We are encouraged by management's comments in its Q2 2018 conference call. In the conference call, management indicated that they continue to see strong growth in the first three weeks of July (Q3 starts in July). MasterCard's overall volume growth of 15% in the first three weeks of July was inline with its Q2 2018 growth of 14%. Similarly its switched transactions growth of 17% in the first three weeks of July was similar to the adjusted growth of 17% in Q2 2018.Operating Margin consistently above 50%We like the fact that MasterCard's operating margin has consistently been over 50% (see chart below). In fact, its operating margin of 59% in Q2 2018 was an increase of 490 basis points year over year. Although we do not think this higher margin of 59% is sustainable as MasterCard typically have some quarter of higher margin followed by some quarter of slightly lower margins (the target is to keep it above 50%). This is because management indicates that its operating expense will increase as they look to invest in data analytics, loyalty programs, etc.Source: Created by author; Company reportsStrong network effectOver the past few decades, MasterCard has established a vast network of merchants and cardholders. While MasterCard still trails behind Visa, it accounts for a little over a quarter of the world's total card transactions (see table below). MasterCard has about 1.91 billion total cards issued at the end of Q1 2018. Together with its millions of merchants, the company create a network that is not easily replicable. This also creates strong network effect. Its merchants risk losing customers if they do not join the network. On the other hand, its cardholders can access to millions of merchants worldwide. MasterCard's network essentially acts as a tollbooth as MasterCard will receive a small portion of revenue from each transaction.Source: Created by authorFavorable secular trendCurrently about 85% of the world's transactions still involve cash and checks. As the world continues to shift towards digital transaction, mobile payments, and plastics, there will be a lot of growth potential for financial services companies like MasterCard to grab more market share. Although other lower cost payment methods exist and may grab more market share, we believe MasterCard's strong network effect will allow it to stay competitive and grow its card numbers and transaction volumes.Strong economic activities will act as its tailwindBeside favourable secular trend, MasterCard should be able to benefit from solid consumer confidence level globally. Below is the chart that shows the consumer confidence index in OECD countries. Since OECD countries comprised 62% of global nominal GDP, the index provides a good representation of the entire global economy. In addition, these countries typically have higher digital, and mobile payment transaction rates. As can be seen from the chart, consumer confidence index continues to remain at a high level in the past few months. Therefore, global spending should remain at a high level. We believe MasterCard's revenue growth should remain solid at least in the second half of the year.Source: OECD DataAlthough MasterCard enjoys strong secular trend, its business can be impacted by government regulations. For example, its interchange fees are being reviewed under the Dodd-Frank Act in the United States. In addition, mobile technology also makes it much easier for new entrants to enter the market. For example, in many countries in Asia, many consumers are bypassing the current banking system. Merchants are willing to join these new networks as they charge much lower interchange fee than Visa and MasterCard. At the moment, these networks are mostly regional networks and are still not a threat to MasterCard and Visa.Share price of MasterCard has appreciated by about 55% in the past year. It is currently trading at a forward P/E ratio of 27.9x (see table below). As the table below shows, MasterCard's forward P/E ratio of 27.9x is about 3x multiples higher than its five-year forward P/E ratio. Its forward P/E ratio is slightly above Visa's 24.3x. Its price to cash flow ratio of 28.3x is slightly above Visa's 28.0x.Source: Created by author, MorningStar.ComMasterCard currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share. This represents a dividend yield of 0.47%.MA Dividend data by YChartsWe believe MasterCard should continue to perform well thanks to its superior management team, favorable secular trend, and strong global consumer confidence level. Its shares are slightly overvalued against its 5-year average. However, given its strong growth trajectory, we believe any pullback will be a good buying opportunity.Thank you for reading.

Despite decent results shares pulled back further.MA shares are rarely in bargain territory and you will be waiting a long time if you want to acquire shares at a sub-20 P/E.Don’t get hung up as to which company (Mastercard vs. Visa) is better. Invest in both.,"Mastercard (NYSE: MA), currently held in the FFJ Portfolio, released its Q3 results October 30th. Despite decent results, dysfunctional Mr. Market promptly lopped ~$3.30/share from MA’s share price before the end of the October 30 trading session.In my February 1, 2017, July 31, 2017, and November 1, 2017 articles, I explained my rationale for investing in MA and indicated it was one of my strongest conviction holdings.In my November 1st article I indicated:I also pointed out that:At some stage of the game, however, a great company does not always mean a great valuation. This is how I felt when I wrote my February 2, 2018 article.At the time of my February article, MA had just reported FY2017 diluted EPS of $3.65 and adjusted diluted EPS of $4.58. Based on the February 1, 2018 $172.93 closing stock price I arrived at a P/E of ~47.38 and an adjusted diluted P/E of ~37.76.EPS was expected to grow in the mid 20% range giving us a forward diluted EPS of ~$4.50 and a forward adjusted diluted EPS of ~$5.73 based on adjusted diluted earnings. The mean consensus from 37 brokers, however, was a forward EPS of ~$5.81 based on adjusted diluted earnings.Using the $172.93 stock price as at the time of my February 2nd article and my earnings estimates of $4.50 and $5.73, I arrived at a diluted P/E of ~38.43 and an adjusted diluted P/E of ~30.18.While MA is a company in which I have invested for the long term and I would like others to also view MA in a similar manner, I just could not justify recommending MA as an investment based on the numbers at hand.Subsequent to my February 2nd article, MA continued to generate decent results but its stock price went parabolic and rose to a shade over $225 by early October. If I felt MA was overvalued in February, I viewed it as even more overvalued at the beginning of October.Now that MA has pulled back ~17% to ~$187.75 and Q3 results have just been released I view this an opportune time to once again review MA.Anyone thinking of investing in MA or Visa (NYSE: V) should be fully aware of their dispute with retailers which began in 2005 when both companies were still owned by banks. Merchants had accused MA and V of violating antitrust laws by illegally inflating swipe fees (aka interchange) that merchants pay on every purchase transaction and which banks use to fund consumers’ credit-card rewards.Very recently, MA and V have agreed to pay $5.54B-$6.24B to a class of more than 12 million merchants who accept the payment networks’ cards in the largest-ever class-action settlement of a U.S. antitrust case; this dollar range is in line with the amounts MA and V previously set aside to cover the costs of the litigation.This recent settlement, however, only addresses the monetary damages associated with the lawsuit. The next fight between retailers and the world’s biggest payment networks has to do with MA’s and V’s business practices. Any changes to their business practices could include reductions in interchange fees and this ongoing litigation has the greatest potential risk to future earnings for the U.S. businesses of MA and V. The earlier settlement (2013) was once valued at ~$7.25B, but was reduced after many large retailers such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), and Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) opted out.I strongly suspect these large companies, which have been ferociously litigating for so many years, are not going to give up easily. I strongly suspect this legal matter is going to drag on for quite some time.MA’s October 30th Earnings Release can be found here and its Earnings Presentation can be found here.On the October 30th call with analysts, MA indicated it continues to see solid overall growth. It is, however, monitoring the potential impacts related to fiscal stimulus reductions, rising interest rates, and the increased trade barriers as these could slow global economic growth. In addition, it is monitoring the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on cross-border flows and the economic weakness in some emerging market countries.On the conference call, MA noted that:Some members of the investment community have expressed concern that Q3 revenue growth was largely being driven by rebates and incentives and not by transaction volumes. Payments processors and card companies use rebates and incentives to forge alliances with banks and merchants, which then pass on these incentives to customers who begin using their networks for transactions.In my opinion, there is nothing to be concerned about the manner in which MA has increased its revenue in Q3 and I think looking at a quarter in isolation is somewhat short-sighted. If this was a recurring theme then I would view this as a strike against MA.MA’s diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS for the first 3 quarters of FY2018 are $4.73 and $4.94 respectively; comparable results for FY2017 were $3.43 and $3.44.In Q3, MA generated $1.82 of diluted EPS and $1.78 of adjusted diluted EPS. If we conservatively estimate that MA will generate $1.80 in diluted EPS and $1.76 in adjusted diluted EPS in Q4, we get estimated FY diluted EPS of $6.53 and estimated FY adjusted diluted EPS of $6.70.Based on the October 30th closing stock price of ~$187.75, we arrive at a forward P/E of ~28.75 and a forward adjusted P/E of ~28. These levels are ever so slightly lower than the 5-year average P/E of ~29.So how do the current figures compare with those at the time of my February 2nd article? Well, have a look at the Introduction section of this article.In my opinion, MA was overpriced at the time of my February 2nd article but MA’s valuation now appears to be closer to its historic norm.Moody’s rates MA’s unsecured long-term debt A2 and S&P Global rates it A; these ratings are unchanged from the time of my previous articles.Both ratings are the middle tier of the Upper Medium Grade category and are satisfactory for an investor such as me who has a low tolerance for risk.MA started trading as a publicly traded entity on May 25, 2006.I recognize past performance does not predict future performance but I get a greater sense of comfort investing in a company with a proven track record of being able to outperform the index than I do from a company which has not.I show MA’s performance relative to the S&P 500 over three different time frames. Having said this, I checked out time frames and MA continually outperformed the S&P 500.Source: TickertechMA’s dividend history can be found here and its stock split history can be found here.Investors focusing their investment decisions very heavily, or exclusively, on dividend income will most likely exclude MA as a potential investment given its ~0.53% dividend yield; MA is a stock more suited for investors seeking long-term capital gains with a smattering of dividend income.The $1.00/share annual dividend represents a dividend payout ratio of ~15% based on my estimated forward diluted EPS of ~$6.53. I envision MA will continue to generate strong Free Cash Flow and servicing the dividend will be a non-issue.I indicated that MA’s dividend takes somewhat of a back seat to capital gains. Their capital gains have been partially achieved through the repurchase of a significant number of shares over the years.Share count as at FYE2008 was 1,301 million shares.As at the end of FY2016 and 2017, share count was 1,101 million and 1,072 million respectively.Here we are… end of Q3 and the weighted-average shares outstanding is down to 1,050 million!There are some industries out there where the top 2 or 3 companies own a commanding market share and despite all the challenges they face… they just seem to continually print money. MA and V are examples of two companies that fit this description.Some people will debate whether V is better than MA or MA is better than V. Quite frankly, I don’t really care and this is why I have chosen to own both.I do not yet know what MA has forecast for 2019 but my instinct tells me that earnings will be higher in 2019 just like 2018 earnings will be higher than 2017, and 2017 earnings were higher than 2016 earnings… and so on and so on.The outstanding legal matter I reference earlier in this article… sure, that is a huge cloud hanging over MA and V but I envision this legal matter dragging on for a few more years. During that time, these two companies will continue to print money. Even after they come to a settlement, I expect them to continue to be highly profitable.With the recent pullback from the $225.35 52-week high and the earnings I anticipate MA will generate this year and in the future, I decided to acquire another 150 shares for the ‘side accounts’ segment of the FFJ Portfolio on October 30th; the FFJ Portfolio currently holds 400 shares at an average cost of ~$124.There are also 22 MA shares that were acquired some time ago that have been sitting in an investment account. I am taking these 22 shares and am also moving them into FFJ Portfolio ‘side accounts’ thus bringing this portfolio’s MA exposure to 572 shares.I wish you much success on your journey to financial freedom.Thanks for reading!"
4219814,102404,2018-11-08T10:03:25-05:00,"Mastercard is generating revenue by receiving fees for every single transaction, but is also increasing its value-added services like security and consulting services.Mastercard has a powerful interconnected network combining fragmented sellers and fragmented buyers which is extremely difficult to copy and creates a competitive advantage.Aside from competitor Visa which has a bigger market share, Mastercard could be affected by a recession in the short-term and by alternative payments in the long-term.The wide moat, the growth perspectives and stability of the business justify a premium for the stock price, but right now Mastercard is overvalued.","In October I started my series called “Preparing for the end of the cycle” in which I analyze companies that have a great business model and should outperform over years and decades to come, but seem to be too expensive right now. I chose the title for two different reasons: on the one side because I believe we are near the end of the cycle meaning the bull market will (or already has) come to an end. On the other side, these companies need massive bearish sentiment in order to be undervalued and without a stock market crash and maybe a recession we probably will always have to pay a premium for those companies.Another example and the company we will analyze in the following article is Mastercard (NYSE: MA). As in the last two articles about 3M (NYSE: MMM) and Facebook (Nasdaq: FB) we first will describe what makes Mastercard’s business so great and why the wide moat of the company is so powerful. Following that, we take a short look at the dividend and finally try to determine a fair intrinsic value and a price at which we will enter the market.Mastercard is a financial service corporation that was founded in 1966 and went public 40 years later in 2006. Its main business is to process payments between the banks of merchants (restaurants, shops, retailers) on the one side and the card issuing banks or credit unions of the purchasers who use the Mastercard brand (customers, shoppers, buyers) on the other side. Mastercard is authorizing, clearing and settling these transactions, but Mastercard is not providing credit and doesn’t issue the cards (and hence doesn’t have any credit risk). The following model (taken from Mastercard’s 10-K) is visualizing how such a transaction is working:(Source: Mastercard’s 10-K filing)Mastercard is offering a brief description of its business model:(Source: Own work based on numbers from Morningstar)Revenue stems mostly from fees and is split up in two components. On the one hand, Mastercard receives a fee for every single transaction (for domestic as well as cross-border) which is called transaction processing and on the other hand Mastercard also receives fees based on the dollar volume of activity. These are called domestic assessments for those examples where the merchant country and the issuer country are the same. When merchant country and issuer country are not the same, these fees based on the dollar volume of activity is reported as cross-border volume.(Source: Mastercard’s 10-K filing)Aside from its core revenue streams, Mastercard is also providing value-added products and services (so far called “other revenues”). These are for example services related to safety and security (preventing, detecting and responding to fraud and cyber-attacks) as well as Mastercard advisors that provide consulting and marketing services to help clients optimizing and growing their business. Mastercard has a fifth segment which can be seen as contra-revenue: rebates and incentives which are subtracting from the gross revenue. So far, revenue of value-added products is contributing the least to overall revenue, but the segment had the highest growth rates in the recent past (17% in 2017 and 22% in 2016).(Source: Own work based on numbers from Morningstar)Mastercard’s business is extremely profitable. The gross margin is 100% as it doesn’t make much sense to calculate a gross margin. But the operating margin is a meaningful margin for Mastercard and was about 80% for the last decade. Not only is an operating margin of 80% extremely high, the margin even improved during the last years.Aside from the margins, Mastercard could also report a very impressive return on equity as well as return on invested capital. In the year of the financial crisis (2008), Mastercard had to report negative numbers, but the following years return on invested capital was about 40% in most years and even above 50% in 2009. I don’t have to point out that only very few companies can report such high numbers for such a long timeframe and with such consistency.Until 2013, RoIC was almost identical with RoE, but since then RoE was higher every year and increased constantly. But while those high RoE numbers might look great at first, the reason why RoE was so high in the recent past is not so great. In 2013, Mastercard didn’t have any long-term debt. But since then Mastercard constantly increased its long-term debt to $5,424 million at the end of 2017. And while long-term debt increased from year to year since 2013, the shareholder’s equity decreased from $7,495 million in 2013 to $5,497 million in 2017. This also explains why the return on equity constantly increased since 2013 and is much higher than RoIC in 2017. But we should absolutely not be concerned about the current debt levels as the long-term debt equals the average annual operating income of Mastercard in the past five years and it would take Mastercard only one year to repay the debt.We already described Mastercard’s business model above and I think it was quite obvious that the business model is outstanding. The reason why Mastercard outperformed the general market in the past and why Mastercard is such a superior business is the wide moat the company has. Aside from the high regulatory hurdles everybody who wants to enter the financial industry is facing, we especially have to mention Mastercard’s brand as well as the network effect.First of all, we have to mention Mastercard’s brand. The company itself as well as Maestro, Cirrus and Masterpass are well-known brands. Brand Finance lists Mastercard on the 117th spot of the most valuable brands in the world. But while the brand is certainly a valuable asset, I doubt it will qualify as source of a wide moat for the company. In order to create a competitive advantage, the brand name has to influence consumer’s behavior and for example increase the willingness to pay a higher price. In case of Mastercard, it is the issuing banks and the merchants that decide which card to use or to accept and for these businesses, the brand name is not really important. And I seriously doubt, that customers will choose a different bank to get a Mastercard credit card instead of one from Visa (NYSE: V) or American Express (NYSE: AXP).But the true source of Mastercard’s moat stems from the network which Mastercard created over the past decades. The resulting network effect is what makes Mastercard’s business model probably one of the best in the world. The company has built a powerful network by connecting customers that use Mastercard to shop on the one side and the shops, retailers and restaurants that accept Mastercard and use it as a way to collect the payments from the customers on the other side. Mastercard is connecting two very fragmented groups – on the one side everybody who likes to sell a product or a service and needs a way to collect cash and on the other side everybody who wants to buy a product and has to pay for it.The network is especially strong as it is a densely interconnected network. The network consists of many different nodes (every customer that owns a Mastercard and every shop or restaurant that is accepting Mastercard) and it consists of many different connections as every customer can pay everywhere and every shop can accept the Mastercard of every customer. And although some retailers are responsible for a big part of Mastercard’s revenue (five customers of Mastercard are responsible for 23% of revenue) and are therefore more important nodes in the network, it is still extremely difficult to copy the network. The network generates its strengths by the fact that every customer can pay at every shop and every shop can accept the card of every customer. Therefore, it is not enough to just copy a few nodes and connections, but a new competitor has to copy the entire network. And even those nodes that drive revenue probably won’t switch because many other nodes (customers) can’t use their cards any more which is dangerous for the node (the retailer, the restaurant).Despite the strong moat and competitive advantage, Mastercard is facing risks like every other business. A big risk is the competition to Visa as the competitor has – at least in the United States – an even denser network than Mastercard, has a greater market share and Visa therefore has greater volume and scale which is creating a significant competitive advantage. In 2017, Visa could report a purchase volume of $3,332 billion, while Mastercard could “only” report a purchase volume of $1,385 billion in the same year. While Mastercard had only a market share of 21.9%, Visa had a market share of 52.7%. Being only number two can be dangerous because these networks often experience a winner-takes-it-all effect. But for the international market Mastercard seems to be positioned better and the company should profit from the many countries (like China or India) with a rising GDP, a rising income as well as rising spending and more and more people using credit cards.But Mastercard is not only competing against Visa and American Express, but also against all other forms of payment. We have to think about digital wallet providers like PayPal and Amazon, but also about cryptocurrencies which could be a potential threat for Mastercard and Visa. Many of these competitors are rather focused on e-commerce and online payment and considering the major trends towards e-commerce it probably won’t help Mastercard or Visa in one or two decades when both still have a huge competitive advantage in “offline” payments if the market share of online transactions will continuously increase. Especially due to the massive network effect, I don’t see other forms of payment (like cryptocurrencies) to be a real threat, but management and investors should keep a close eye on them.At least for the short term, a potential recession will affect the business of Mastercard and Visa. The generated revenue is dependent on the consumer spending and consumer spending is affected by factors like unemployment, the rise or decline of income levels as well as currency fluctuations. In 2008, Mastercard had to report a loss and while the company does not necessarily have to report another loss in case of another recession, we can assume that EPS (and probably also revenue) will decline in such a scenario.Finally, we also have to mention Mastercard’s reputation. Although Mastercard’s brand is not enough to create a competitive advantage, the company has to think about the negative consequences when its brand (and reputation) are affected negatively. For Mastercard trust is extremely important as customers and merchants have to trust Mastercard that their personal information and money transfers are secure. The network effect is preventing new companies from entering the market, but it doesn’t prevent customers switching to American Express or Visa if Mastercard’s reputation is damaged.Mastercard is also paying a dividend to its shareholders and the dividend was raised every year since 2011. With a current payout ratio of 25%, there is room to grow the dividend and I assume Mastercard will raise the dividend in the years to come. However, you should not invest in Mastercard for its dividend and the company should rather reinvest the cash flow into its business as long as the business can still grow. The dividend is also far below 1% and probably not interesting for a dividend investor and as long as Mastercard can create above average returns by growing the business, investors are rewarded more by reinvesting the cash flow into the business than paying it out to shareholders.(Source: Own work based on numbers from Morningstar)In my series I have covered two companies so far: when using last year’s EPS, Facebook has a P/E of 27.90 and 3M has a P/E of 24.53. On the one hand we want to buy companies as cheap as possible, on the other hand we also have to realize that we have to pay extra for high quality as well as for a wide moat. Nevertheless, Mastercard is currently trading at a really high P/E of 54 when using last year’s earnings per share. To justify such a high P/E the company has to grow at a high pace for a very long time.As usual, the P/E ratio can only be a first approach to get a feeling for the company’s valuation. In order to come up with a fair value for the stock we use a discount cash flow analysis. A first step is to look at past data (which can at least be a clue for the future). Revenue grew 11.86% since 2009, earnings per share grew 15.91% in the same timeframe and free cash flow grew even 19.44% (I deliberately left out 2008 because it would have led to unrealistic high growth rates – especially for free cash flow as the 2008 numbers were extremely bad).In order to be fairly valued right now and assuming a 10% discount rate, Mastercard has to grow its free cash flow about 16% for the next decade and then 3% for eternity (similar to overall GDP growth). In my opinion however, these numbers are extremely unrealistic. On the one side, I think it is unrealistic that Mastercard will grow only 3% after 2028 as the extremely powerful network will ensure higher growth rates for a very long time. I would calculate with a 5% growth rate for eternity, which seems to be the right combination between reflecting the power of the moat but not being too optimistic. For the next decade, I assume at least one recession to affect the free cash flow in a massive way and we should include at least two years with a free cash flow way below he current level. Taken every aspect into account I would assume an average annual growth rate slightly below 10% is realistic for the next decade. Using those numbers (10% discount rate), we get an intrinsic value of $150.96 for Mastercard.Additionally, I would include a margin of safety of at least 20% to reflect the risks of competing against Visa and especially the risk of being too optimistic about future growth which leads to an entry point of $120.77. Technical analysis is only little help here, but two possible entry points would be around $125 (200 weeks simple moving average) and around $100 (multiple highs of 2015 and 2016 that could form a resistance level).In my opinion, Mastercard’s business model is one of the best we know. Not only can Mastercard continue to grow by global expansion, Mastercard will also profit from the ongoing trend towards e-commerce and more and more countries trying to eliminate ready cash and replacing it with digital cash. And Mastercard is operating in a segment with only three main competitors and such extreme barriers to enter that it is unlikely for any new competitor to arise in the near future.MA data by YChartsWhile I think it is quite natural that we have to pay a premium for such a business, a P/E above 50 seems too expensive. And we can also see that the stock price growth for Mastercard exceeded the free cash flow growth. Therefore Mastercard stays just on our watchlist for the time being and we wait for lower entry prices."
4191956,65113,2018-07-30T12:03:13-04:00,"Mastercard Incorporated has impressed once again in the most recent earnings season.That said, price has been dropping on fears the stock is overbought.However, I see such fears as irrational and believe the stock will continue to climb.","I have previously described Mastercard (MA) as one of those stocks that you “buy regardless of price.”In other words, this is a high-quality stock that will always be expensive given its record of strong earnings growth, so it makes little sense to wait for a discount before going long.In an article I wrote back in December 2014, I used a dividend discount model to attempt to value Mastercard’s future earnings over a five-year timeline.Specifically, I yielded the following target prices for the following average annual rates of earnings growth:10% annual growth:Source: Author's Calculations15% annual growth:Source: Author's Calculations20% annual growth:Source: Author’s CalculationsSince then, Mastercard has surpassed all my expectations, trading at $202.94 at the time of writing:Source: investing.comIf the past five years are anything to go by, Mastercard is a company that is set to see strong growth into the future, and attempting to wait for the right price is an exercise in futility.In terms of the most recent earnings quarter, results continued to be very strong. For instance, overall Gross Dollar Volume grew by 14%, while the company saw year-on-year growth of 45% in net income on a currency neutral basis.2nd Quarter Gross Dollar Volume:Source: Mastercard Incorporated Second Quarter 2018 Financial Results Conference Call2nd Quarter Selected Financial Performance:Source: Mastercard Incorporated Second Quarter 2018 Financial Results Conference CallWhy then, has price dropped in the immediate aftermath of these results? I cannot determine any rational explanation for the drop in price, other than investors might be taking profits on the stock given strong returns up till now.As a matter of fact, the reason for the decline may be almost entirely on a technical basis. For instance, one article from CNBC reports that the Relative Strength Index (or a measure as to how overbought or oversold) a stock is, rests at 92 for Mastercard, which is an all-time high for the stock indicating Mastercard is heavily overbought.That said, that does not give any reason to suggest that growth for this company is ceasing. As a matter of fact, one particularly big opportunity I see for this company in the next couple of years is further opening of the Chinese credit card market. While Shanghai’s UnionPay used to be the sole domestic payment processor in China, a WTO ruling has since directed China to open up its market to competitors.While the implementation of this is likely to still take some time, full access to the Chinese market would mean a vast increase in Gross Dollar Volume for Mastercard. With China’s credit card market poised to be the largest in the world, and an average of six cards per person expected in China by 2020, this clearly represents a huge opportunity for Mastercard.In light of recent earnings, I take the view that the market may be overreacting in selling this stock. While it may be overbought from a technical standpoint, I see no evidence to suggest that earnings growth is set to stagnate in any way, and I retain the view that Mastercard is a stock that would be worth going long on even at this price. The stock is definitely on my watchlist, and I am highly considering going long before this year is out.Disclaimer: This article is written on an ""as is"" basis and without warranty.

4191163,33291,2018-07-27T10:43:09-04:00,"Mastercard is pulling back after just reported earnings.The name is seeing higher revenues on volume increases, reasonable expense growth, and widening margins.The stock is priced with a premium multiple that it deserves because we continue to see earnings grow 30-40% each year.","Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is having a rare session where it is down a few points following its just reported earnings. Still, the company once again delivered immense growth. In our opinion the Street will soon be bidding up the name once again. Make no mistake, the name has been priced for continued near-perfect performance of the underlying company. For years the argument of the name being overvalued has been made.We say this because the Street has essentially baked into share prices continued beats against consensus estimates, growing volumes, well managed expenses and double-digit growth in earnings. Those who follow the company on the bearish side of things have (correctly) argued that earnings missteps would send the name falling. And yet it keeps delivering. This is evidenced by its multiple being well over 50 times trailing earnings. Right now, the stock is just off a 52-week high, again, and Mastercard has now more than doubled from where we recommended it at $90 a share. With the exceptional growth the name is showing, the valuation has been justified. The question is, can this run continue? In this column, we examine trends in sales and earnings and discuss our expectations looking ahead. With tax reform now a reality, we also offer our 2018 projections.Despite the stock pulling back, the just reported quarter saw another impressive top line, with solid increases in second quarter revenues over the past three years:Source: SEC filings, graphics by BAD BEAT InvestingThis figure suggests once again the company delivered a strong report, and revenues were indeed stellar. The results strongly suggest that the company will continue its stable and reliable growth. Net revenue for the quarter came in at $3.57 billion, a 20.3% increase over Q2 2017. This is a strong result and surpassed our expectations for $3.5 billion by $70 million. We had been expecting a strong 2018. This was primarily due to better than expected performance in gross dollar volume and a large increase in processed transactions. Mastercard saw a 14% jump in gross dollar volume, surpassing our expectations for 12% growth, and saw a 17% increase in transactions to approximately 18.2 billion. The transaction growth should keep the bears on edge:Source: SEC filings, graphics by BAD BEAT InvestingNot only is this growth above our expectations, it is simply impressive for a long-standing company like Mastercard and shows the company is still executing to near perfection. With the increased company activity, we need to be on the lookout for rising expenses possibly pressuring marginsIf there is one area of weakness that we can pinpoint it is that operational expenses do continue to rise rather sharply, right in line with rising revenues. Expenses grew year-over-year vs. last year by 23%. However, if we adjust for special items, on a currency neutral basis, expenses were up just 6%. This is very well done considering the rise in revenues. The trend is higher, but less so that what we saw for revenue growth:Source: SEC filings, graphics by BAD BEAT InvestingWhile we hate to see rising expenses, given that revenues were up almost 17%, it is acceptable. That is, we can absorb the 6% rise in expenses and still see a nice bump in earnings.Total operating expenses were $1.6 billion for several reasons including primarily spending related to strategic initiatives, as well as higher promotional spending and of course acquisition-related integration expenses. There was also a 5-point hit from new accounting requirements, but a 7-point benefit from balance sheet renumeration.When we factor in the increase in revenues, as well as the increase in expenses, we still see that it led to operating income increasing 19% as reported. Because adjusted expenses were so much less than expected, adjusted operating margin expanded to 56.6% from 54.8:Source: SEC filings, graphics by BAD BEAT InvestingWith this margin expansion, earnings per share continues to impress.While expenses continue to rise, they are justified by the pace of revenue growth, which was impressive, and margins expanded on an adjusted basis. This has us bullish, especially when we factor in the billions of shares repurchased over the years. With the continuing tremendous performance, we have seen a nice bump in earnings per share:Source: SEC filings, graphics by BAD BEAT InvestingEvery year the company has been expanding its bottom line. Investors have been rewarded. This quarter was no exception. The company saw net income widen to $1.6 billion from $1.2 billion, hitting $1.50 per share. When we adjust for this and other items, we see that the more comparable adjusted net income came in at $1.7 billion, up 48% from last year's $1.2 billion.This is impressive. What is more, earnings per share on an adjusted basis were up 51% to $1.66, and this trounced our expectations for $1.50 per share in adjusted earnings. This earnings performance is a result of higher than expected revenues, lower than anticipated expenses, and the company also repurchased $1.2 billion worth of stock (8.3 million shares). With this established growth we are revising our 2018 outlook higher.Factoring in the trajectory of Mastercard's performance year-to-date, and considering the trends in new cards being issued, transaction volume, and gross dollar volumes, we are revising our 2018 expectations higher. We previously saw revenue coming in at $13.5 billion to $14.1 billion and earnings approximating $5.50 to $5.75. We now see revenues coming in at $14.2-$14.5 billion and earnings coming in at $5.90-$6.10.With earnings per share growing 30-40% every year, the stocks valuation of 30-40 times forward earnings is justified. This small pullback is a chance to come in and hold. The gains will continue. We remain bullish.Quad 7 Capital has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012.

4191483,57252,2018-07-28T00:13:26-04:00,"Mastercard posted excellent Q2 results.The company benefits from the same tailwinds as Visa, so I finally initiated a position.I love Mastercard's capital allocation strategy, and I love the payments processing business even more.Shares are not dramatically undervalued, but I like the stock a lot on a pullback.","Shares of Mastercard (MA) fell slightly after the company reported fantastic Q2 earnings. I think the muted reaction is the result of higher profile companies dominating headlines. As long-time readers may know, I am one of the biggest Visa (V) bulls imaginable, but I recently initiated a position in Mastercard after watching the business perform exceptionally well every year. I am officially initiating coverage with a fair value of $217 – only small upside from current levels, but like Visa, the company’s underlying value is likely to grow for the indefinite future. Let’s take a look at Q2 results as well as Mastercard’s opportunity to grow its business.Due partially to its smaller size, Mastercard regularly grows its top line faster than Visa. This was the case in Q2; Mastercard grew revenue 18% y/y (ex-fx) to $3.7 billion. Growth was driven by the total increase in transaction value, which was up 14% in total, with 9% growth in the US and 16% growth internationally. Mastercard continues to trail Visa in the United States, which I believe is winning the most market share of the issuers based on its extensive network of partnerships and strong relationships with top banks. Nevertheless, Mastercard is performing well in every region, especially outside of the US. Some of the revenue and profitability growth is also driven by the increase in switched transactions (think of these as full Mastercard transactions). Switched transactions were up 17% y/y to nearly 18.2 billion transactions. Total Mastercards and Maestro cards in circulation also jumped a solid 7% y/y.Operating margin is an area where Mastercard still greatly underperforms Visa. While Visa posted an operating margin of 67% in its most recent quarter, Mastsercard’s operating margin was “only” 51.9%, down about 300 basis points y/y adjusted for fx. Mastercard’s management team is happy to keep running a 50%+ operating margin and investing capital in lower margin services and to improve the quality of Mastercard’s offering. This includes programs like loyalty programs and data analytics. Over time, some of these lower margin businesses will grow faster, enabling margin expansion as they leverage fixed costs. For now, management has explicitly stated little interest in matching Visa’s operating margin prowess, but frankly, that would be quite the lofty goal. Even a 52% operating margin would make Mastercard one of the most profitable businesses I can think of.Mastercard’s business model throws off terrific cash flow due to its combination of high operating margin and low capital expenditure requirements. As a result, Mastercard has reduced its share count by 12.6% over the last five years. Mastercard’s dividend is up about 57% over the past three years, and it would not be surprising to see sustained growth of 10-15% per annum. In addition, Mastercard makes tuck-in strategic acquisitions that can improve the company’s overall product offering. I would not expect any blockbuster deals, but I can imagine Mastercard making additional purchases like Vocalink, which provides real time bank-to-bank transaction processing.Overall, I love this capital allocation strategy. Mastercard’s intrinsic value will grow continually, meaning repurchases will largely be value-creative. I don’t love the dividend, but it is necessary for a company like Mastecard. It would be easy to say that Mastercard should simply use those funds to buyback more stock, but there are executional limitations to repurchases that make a dividend necessary to return capital to shareholders.The growth drivers for Visa and Mastercard are virtually the same – the shift away from cash, e-commerce, and general economic growth. Mastercard interestingly addressed B2B as another huge growth driver going forward. They size the opportunity at roughly $20 trillion, and Mastercard is making tangible progress here. The company is increasing its business T&E presence as well as bolstering services like Vocalink that are useful ways for large corporations to transfer huge sums of money quickly and securely. I love the secular trend, and I am dumb for not buying Mastercard earlier.After reporting its Q2 earnings, shares of Mastercard have slipped, slightly exacerbated by general market weakness. By my estimate, shares are trading only 7% below their current intrinsic value, but remember, that intrinsic value should grow at a low double digit pace for the next few years, so buying the stock near its intrinsic value is not the worst outcome in the world. That said, I typically like to wait for a larger margin of safety before establishing a sizeable position. Dips don’t come that frequently, but if shares fall to the $190 level, I will add to my position."

        Not only has the company seen performed well in consensus growth markets, but also in Europe.
        Despite being adaptable, MA has stuck to its core business.
        The company’s technology, scale and focus are likely to snowball into sustained superior growth over the long term.","MA is focused on offering customers and consumers a choice by building a portfolio of offerings that seamlessly blend together. This strategy has seen the company win competitive bids across and also help increase value per transaction. MA’s focus on payments business, adaptability and scale is likely to result into industry leading growth, making it a long – term investment.MA is one of the biggest payments technology company. The company generates revenues as commissions on transactions and from advisory services.Source: 10K – 2017MA has around 15% of the global share of non-cash transactions, behind Visa’s 28%.The company’s philosophy has been to build its brand to connect better with consumers. The work started in 1997 with an ad commercial that said There are some things money can’t buy. For everything else, there’s MasterCard.This philosophy continues to shape the MA of today. To the company, there are two only forms money can take – cash and Mastercard! MA does not care about “the form factor, as those are coming through the system” – cash is the Goliath, digital (mobile) or card are the David.The trends emanating from this approach, coupled with MA’s industry knowledge and experience has allowed the company to develop solutions for data analytics, fraud management, security and other related advisory services. When these get added on to the loyalty and reward services, the entire package is irresistible from the customer’s point of view – MA can offer a seamless experience to the end consumer (since they now own the different parts that used to be earlier done by multiple vendors). Not only does this ‘completeness’ brings stickiness with an existing client, but also creates a major competitive differentiation for MA. This competitive differentiation has helped build momentum in the company’s RFP wins over time, something that is likely to continue given the strong execution.In line with the company’s operating philosophy and the evolving market landscape, MA has been expanding its capabilities in the B2B space:Additionally, MA is actively building (and looking to buy) in emerging technologies such as VR, IoT among others. The company considers these technologies as additional arrows in its quiver, rather than a stepping stone to a consumer facing distribution network (to compete with the AliPay, TENPAY, Paytm, Amazon Pay, Apple Pay etc).MA’s core focus is to have the user transact with a MasterCard branded product as the point of interaction. This focus has made MA into a large payments technology company – a far cry from the money management business models of wallet providers. The management is very clear: Neither is MA a money management does not want to be in this space.And I think there is in this marketplace and the way things are growing, the days of thinking that you can control from point A to point B, every inch of space and not be fought against on even of them, I don’t think that’s the case. I think you got to think about what you do well and partner like hell and find the right connections and then you can deliver very well… Know what you do and don’t try and become something you aren’t.This laser focus has ensured that MA has not forayed into capital intensive business of building out distribution channels or in money management, which in turn has allowed for healthy growth in free cash flows.In addition to China and India, (which are consensus growth markets) MA expects Europe also to be a long-term growth market.I think you got to remember that Europe is still a very largely cash dependent economy. Outside of the U.K. its basically 78%, 80% cash. I mean Germany is 80% cash even now, and yes Sweden is not, but that’s not the largest part of Europe…The majority of Europe is still very much cash depended. I see that as a huge runway of growth for the next decade, if not longer.The other areas of growing importance for the company are:While the management guidance appears consistent with the company’s growth trajectory, MA’s steadily steam gathering marathon run in the payments market should not be assessed by a well-run sprint of a few quarters.Source: 1Q18 Earnings PresentationGoing forward, MA’s brand philosophy, focus and investments are likely to compound the expected acceleration in growth.I have built three cases: Base (using management commentary), Bull (using growth assumptions as outlined in the article) and Bear (the worst-case scenario). In the base case, the key financials for the next few years are summarised in the table below.Source: MA Financial Model built using 10-Ks, Earnings Call Transcripts, Investor Presentations, Nilson Report, World Payments Report by Capgemini & BNP ParibasThe expected revenue growth rate for F2017-F2023E in the base case is a heady 18%, which is higher than what has been seen in the past. The revenue for the company is the function of its average revenue (commission) and volumes. Thus, even if one of these metrics witnesses growth, revenue growth is likely to see a fillip.1. Gross revenue/transaction: The management has re-iterated it over and over again that even the advisory business is dependent on the transactions. Thus a good way to assess this business is to look at what money comes out of each transaction, before client incentives.The gross revenue/transaction has been steadily recovering, after bottoming out in F2015. Given a recovering global economy, MA's focus (Europe, higher value cross border transactions and B2B) and momentum in RFP wins, it is likely that this number will keep treading higher (albeit at a lower pace).2. Growth in number of non-cash transactions: As per the World Payments Report by Capgemini & BNP Paribas, the number of non-cash transactions are expected to grow at ~11% over 2015-2020E. If MA can continue to maintain (or even lose some) share in this growth, the company still would benefit from huge volumes.Despite losing ~2.1% in market share, the transaction volumes are still at a huge 75.8 billion. The impact to volumes from VocaLink and B2B is likely to be a tailwind to this number, which in turn will lead to significant revenue growth as highlighted. In order to value MA, I have used a DCF methodology. MA is a mature company, with stable growth prospects. The stability of the company's cash flows makes it an ideal candidate for a DCF based valuation. Using the base case financials and applying a terminal growth rate of 3.5%, and a CAPM derived WACC of 7.3%, the base case value per share comes to $328.9. One must remember, MA is a play on operating leverage - as long as the company is able to spread its fixed costs over a large base (in this case transactions) and cover its variable costs, the operating profits will continue to grow. Thus, given the revenue growth expectations, my estimates of the stock’s price across cases are quite bullish. Source: MA Financial ModelThe difference in expectation across the three cases is reflected in the 'Gross revenue/transaction' and 'Growth in number of non-cash transactions' (or change in market share). In 2017, the company saw abnormal changes of 20% and -2% in 'Gross revenue/transaction' and change in market share, respectively. Despite factoring for this aberration, the average price of $354.6 is almost an 80% premium to the closing price of $196.5 on 29/6/2018.MA operates in a large and competitive market, where the pace of technological changes and regulations can lead to abrupt market share upheavals. However, the company’s brand philosophy, coupled with execution efficiency has held the company in good steed and likely to continue to deliver incremental performance. This makes MA an attractive, long-term investment."

In almost a photo finish win, Mastercard (NYSE:MA) comes out as a relatively better investment choice that Visa.After the recent articles on Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard, many readers have debated on which is the better of the two. This article aims to find the first between two of the best investment choices of our times. To attempt this hair-splitting exercise, we look through the comparison across historical financial performance, shareholder returns, and difference in management approaches.V and MA are commission-based businesses, and what can be a better gauge for the two companies than the volumes (transactions) and pricing (commission or the value/transaction).Source: V and MA Financial ModelsSource: V and MA Financial Models, Note: Numbers for V have been calendarisedWhile volume is a function of scale - V has almost 2X the transactions of MA, pricing depends on the areas of focus - MA is clearly focused more on the higher ticket size geographies (Europe etc.) vs. V's volume-oriented focus (India etc.). Despite higher average pricing, higher client incentives doled out by MA lead to lower EBITDA margins relative to V.Source: V and MA Financial ModelsSource: V and MA Financial ModelsThe higher EBITDA margins for V also translate into higher FCF margins for V.Source: V and MA Financial ModelsScore: V's financial discipline does make it go past MA by a good margin. (V - 1, MA - 0)The following table presents a comparison of shareholder returns for V and MA since V's IPO on March 19th, 2008, until July 2, 2018:While total returns for V have been marginally higher, MA sneaks past V if only capital appreciation is considered.Score: The historical returns are virtually identical for both the companies. Equal points to both, still advantage V! (V - 2, MA - 1)While the underlying strategies continue to evolve in response to market and competitive pressures, there is a remarkable difference in management views about approaching the payments domain.Source: Management presentation transcriptsIn context of the volumes and pricing, the difference in management approaches are likely to favour MA for the following reasons:Score: All things considered, the balance looks tilted toward MA. This kind of evens the score for both. (V - 2, MA - 2)As per the latest guidance for F2019, V expects revenue growth to be ""low double digits"", and MA expects revenue growth to be in the ""high teens"".Using the management guidance as the base case, I have built out bull and bear cases. The primary levers in these cases are the pace of market share contraction (volumes are likely to still continue growing) and gross revenue/transaction changes.From the V financial model:From the MA financial model:The difference in the expectations of market share decline is based on historical market share, changes in historical market share, and management initiatives to sustain growth.Considering the momentum that of the last few quarters, relative pricing strength, and management positioning for the future, tilts the balance firmly in favour of MA."

        Limited fundamental risk will ensure cash flow for many years to come.
        High valuations today equal low valuations tomorrow.","In the face of geopolitical, economic and technological tensions, Mastercard Inc. (NYSE:MA) has two major tailwinds that continue to fuel the company and keep the stock price moving forward. These tailwinds are: the world continues to deviate away from cash in favour of digital forms of transactions, and a huge growth in global middle class population throughout the world.Much like Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard does not issue cards, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by issuers. They are companies that generate revenue from assessing customers based on the gross dollar volume (“GDV”) of activity on the products that carry the card companies brands. If you are planning on investing in Mastercard or Visa, this is important because this business model limits the risk the card companies have regarding credit, interests rates and delinquencies. Their goal is to increase the number of payment transactions between cardholders, merchants, and lenders and is not concerned with the financial results of the transaction. The pic below shows how a typical Mastercard transaction works: Source: Mastercard 2017 Annual ReportAs the goal for Mastercard and Visa is to increase payment transactions, the global environment of growing cashless transactions coupled with an increased number of middle class people will continue to create substantial tailwinds for these credit card companies. According to the 2017 Nilson report, Visa Inc. racked up $147.9 billion in purchase transactions on global cards, while Mastercard Inc. (MA) racked up $75.8 billion, according to this report.In an article issued by Forbes in 2017 they state: ""As of 2014, most Americans carried less than $50 in cash in their wallets and half carry less than $20. In 2016, Mastercard found that, in the UK, the average person carried less than £5. By 2020, more than two-thirds of mobile payments will be for items costing between $20 and $100, meaning consumers are becoming more comfortable making significant purchases with their mobile device -- not just the occasional $5 coffee."" This solidifies that the trend of cashless transactions is here and will increase into the future. Using the analysis below, I will analyze the past four years of Mastercard's performance. I will look at Mastercard's past profitability, debt and capital, and operating efficiency. Based on this information, we will look for strengths and weaknesses in the company's fundamentals. This should give us an understanding of how the company has fared over the past few years and will give us an idea of what to expect in the future.ProfitabilityProfitability is a class of financial metrics used to assess a business's ability to generate earnings compared with expenses and other relevant costs incurred during a specific period of time. In this section, we will look at three tests of profitability. They are: net income, operating cash flow and the return on assets. From these metrics, we will establish if the company is making money as well as gauge the quality of the reported profits.Over the past three and a half years or so, Mastercard's net income has increased significantly. Mastercard has increased their net income from $ 3.808 billion to $4.326 billion.Operating income:Operating income is the cash generated from the operations of a company, generally defined as revenue, less all operating expenses, but calculated through a series of adjustments to net income.Much like the net income, the operating income has also significantly increased.Return on Assets, ROA = Net Income / Total AssetsROA is an indicator of how profitable a company is relative to its total assets. ROA gives an idea as to how efficient management is at using its assets to generate earnings. Calculated by dividing a company's net income by its total assets, ROA is displayed as a percentage.Total Asset Growth:Return on AssetsBased on the results above, we can see that on the top line, the assets have begun to pay off. Mastercard has a very respectable ROA of 18.85%.Debt And CapitalThe Debt and Capital section establishes if the company is sinking into debt or digging its way out. It will also determine if the company is growing organically or raising cash by selling off stock.Total Liabilities To Total Assets, Or TL/A ratioTL/A ratio is a metric used to measure a company's financial risk by determining how much of the company's assets have been financed by debt.Total assetsTotal Liabilities[object HTMLElement]Over the past three and a half years, Mastercard total assets have increased significantly. In 2015, Mastercard's total assets were calculated at $16.269 billion while Mastercard's most recent data suggest they now have $22.944 billion in total assets. We also see that the company's total liabilities have also ballooned up from $10.207 billion to $17.213 billion.As we can see, the total assets and total liabilities have both increased significantly over the past 4 years. From the criteria below, we will be able to assess some of the effects to the company's bottom line.Working CapitalWorking capital is a general and quick measure of liquidity of a firm. It represents the margin of safety or cushion available to the creditors. It is an index of the firm's financial stability. It is also an index of technical solvency and an index of the strength of working capital.Current Ratio = Current assets / Current liabilitiesCurrent AssetsCurrent LiabilitiesCurrent RatioOver the past three and a half years, Mastercard's current ratio has decreased slightly but is still very stable at just under 1.64. Because Mastercard's current ratio is well above 1, this indicates that Mastercard would be able to pay off their obligations if the came due at this point.Common Shares OutstandingOver the past 3 and a half years, we can see the shares outstanding has decreased. This is a positive as it shows the company is not issuing shares to support growth, thus diluting investor value.Operating EfficiencyOperating efficiency is a market condition that exists when participants can execute transactions and receive services at a price that equates fairly to the actual costs required to provide them. An operationally efficient market allows investors to make transactions that move the market further towards the overall goal of prudent capital allocation without being chiseled down by excessive frictional costs, which would reduce the risk/reward profile of the transaction.Asset TurnoverThe formula for the asset turnover ratio evaluates how well a company is utilizing its assets to produce revenue. The numerator of the asset turnover ratio formula shows revenue found on a company's income statement and the denominator shows total assets, which are found on a company's balance sheet. Total assets should be averaged over the period of time that is being evaluated.Over the past three and a half years, the revenue has increased by 38.02% while the assets have increased by 41.02%. This is an indication that the company from a percentage point of view has become less efficient at generating revenue.So, based on the criteria above, we can see why Mastercard has significantly outperformed the market over the past few years. Most of the above criteria are still expanding and the criteria that are not expanding is supporting growth within the company. At this point I would keep an eye on company's revenue to total assets ratio. Over the longterm, I would like to see the revenue outpace the assets. As we can see above Mastercard has been riding the wave of increased Volume (GVD). The next point want to take a look at is, the company from a valuation point of view. I am looking for any weakness that the market may find an excuse to sell on. Based on this criteria, the next question is, where do we go from here?ValuationOver the past 10 years, Mastercard has averaged a EV/EBITDA in the 17X range. At the current valuation, I have calculated the company to be trading at ~26* EBITDA.Based on a full-year 2018 forecast, Mastercard is estimated to produce an EBITDA of $~8.867 billion. Based on this forecast, the company is trading at the current value of 26* EBITDA. Currently Mastercard is trading at 2020 EBITDA estimates, which could provide opportunities in the near future if the market continues its recent volatility. If we get some more volatility, I could see the Mastercard trading closer to 20* EBITDA, which would lower the price to around $160.00.At this point own shares of Visa. Currently, Visa is 5.53% of my portfolio which in my opinion is enough right now. I have composed this article as a direct comparison to Visa at the request of ChuckXX. Having stated that, when the time comes to add more, I may decide initiate a position of Mastercard over Visa just to add to the diversification of my portfolio. I believe they are both excellent companies with outstanding business models that will ride the wave of cashless transactions for many years to come.Like Invest4Dividends stated in my previous article ""Visa: Buy this Compelling Growth Story"", ""Potential investors will continue to miss the train waiting for this to become fairly valued. Just jump on and enjoy the ride."" I couldn't have said it better myself. If you don't own any shares at this point, now is a fine time to initiate a position and if you own shares already I say, ""buy on weakness""."
4177834,103314,2018-05-29T14:29:04-04:00,"Mastercard reported very strong results in Q1 2018, and adjusted revenue guidance accordingly.Mastercard has significant tailwinds from secular trends which will continue to drive revenue growth.Mastercard shares are worth $206 based on a DCF valuation. An 8% upside to the current share price.","Mastercard (MA) reported its Q1 results on May 2, 2018. Results were simply astonishing, exceeding investor and analyst expectations. The share price has risen from $180 to $191 after the Q1 earnings. One could argue Q1 results are reflected in the share price, but I think Mastercard still has some room to run for the simple reason that Mastercard is on top of two secular trends. The first one is sustained growth in personal consumption expenses. The second trend is the transition from cash to card payment.Mastercard is worth $206 based on a DCF valuation which still provides 8% upside versus the current share price of $191.Mastercard reported truly terrific results in Q1. Revenue was up 31% or 27% on a currency neutral basis. Revenues, excluding acquisitions and new revenue recognition rules, grew a healthy 20%. The highlight of the quarter was Mastercard’s largest revenue and EPS beat ever. Other highlights include accelerating volume metrics, and new issuer wins (most importantly, Santander's (NYSE:SAN) U.K. debit portfolio, which could increase debit volume by 10%). Underlying operating expenses increased just 12%, significantly less than the 20% revenue growth (Source: Q1 press release). Furthermore, the company bought back 7.9 million shares in Q1, reducing the outstanding share count.Mastercard confirmed it won the Santander U.K. portfolio. This is important for several reasons. First of all, Mastercard wins the portfolio from Visa (NYSE:V) which is the dominant player in the U.K. Secondly, based on Nilson data, the portfolio could realize of $70 billion in annual volume (Source: JPM analyst report, no link because it is a paid subscription service). The transition adds about 10% to Mastercard’s international debit book and simultaneously reduces Visa’s international debit book by 3%. The conversion is expected to start early in 2019 and phase in over 4 years.Mastercard is on top of two important secular trends, according to UBS research. The first secular trend is the sustained growth in personal consumption expenditures. According to UBS, people are spending more which is a positive for Mastercard. The second trend is the gradual transition from cash/cheque to card payments, which is really interesting in my opinion. The total worldwide transaction volume is currently about $95 trillion per year. The total transaction volume is divided into $70 trillion cash & cheques transaction volume and $25 trillion in card-based transaction volume. The result is a total addressable market for Mastercard of $95 trillion. Mastercard has an approximate 4% penetration of the total addressable market. The card-based transaction penetration is approximately 17%. The total addressable market is derived from UBS Global Economics PCE, GDP forecasts and data from the Bank for International Settlements (Source: UBS Research).UBS provided a survey which contained 800 mid-sized businesses in 4 countries (the USA, UK, Germany & France). In these countries, just 70% of the companies accepted Mastercard payments. 94% of the businesses that do not yet accept electronic payment intend to add support for this over the next 12 months. Even in first world countries, not all merchants accept electronic payments. This in itself provides a growth opportunity for Mastercard. I assume the shift towards card payments will continue, and this in turn fuels Mastercard’s revenue growth. The revenue growth is an important factor in the valuation of Mastercard.Mastercard is worth $206 based on a discount cash flow valuation. I use the following inputs for my model.Tabel 1: DCF assumptionsI use a future tax rate for Mastercard of 22%. This is based on the new federal tax rules, with a federal tax rate of 21%. I have added 1% to be on the safe side. I use a discount rate of 8.5% which is widely used in the industry and a terminal growth rate of 3%. I use 3% because my DCF model forecasts 5 years, and I think Mastercard has the moat to grow at 3% thereafter. The terminal growth rate valuation is mostly used by academics to calculate terminal value. Analysts usually use free cash flow (FCF) or EBITDA multiples to calculate the same terminal value. The terminal value is the main contributor to the Enterprise value. Because the terminal value multiples are so important, I didn’t assume these multiples by myself. I screened through several analysts' reports and averaged the multiples used in the reports. The multiples assigned to Mastercard are not uncommon in the industry. Lastly, I used the diluted amount of shares outstanding as of Q1 2018.Table 2: Mastercard cash flow forecastOn the revenue front, I forecast 20% revenue growth in 2018 which is in line with guidance provided by Mastercard. I expect the growth to decline somewhat to 12% in FY 2022. I expect the EBITDA margin to increase slowly over the years, primarily driven by the strong revenue growth.Depreciation and amortization have been quite stable as a percentage of revenues in the last couple of years. Therefore, I forecast D&A as a percentage of revenue in line with previous years. I assume Capex to grow somewhat as a percentage of revenue, mainly to keep fueling revenue growth. I use a discount rate of 8.5%, but I do not fully incorporate the rate in the first year. An 8.5% discount rate in 2018 would mean all cash would flow into Mastercard at exactly 31 December 2018. In reality, cash flows into the company during the year. I correct for this using a discount rate of 3.5% after which I add 8.5% on a yearly basis.Table 3: DCF ModelThe present value of the free cash flow from 2018-2022 is $37.15 million. The terminal value for the terminal growth rate is $160.5 million. The terminal values for the multiples are $188.0 million and $183.0 million. I average the three terminal values and add the present value of the free cash flow from 2018-2022. The result is an average EV value of $214.3 million. The market value is equal to the enterprise value – debt + cash & investments. The total market value is $218.2 million. The last step is to divide the market value by the shares outstanding to get the equity value. The equity value ends up being $206.42 or $206 when rounded. The DCF valuation has an 8% upside versus the current share price of $191.Mastercard reported truly astonishing first-quarter results with the highest revenue and EPS beat in the history of the company. The company is riding the waves of two positive secular trends and has ample room to grow. Mastercard will produce strong cash flow growth fueled by growth in revenue and margin expansion. The value of the company is based on my personal cash flow forecast combined with three models to calculate the terminal value. Based on my model, shares are worth $206 which provides an 8% upside potential."

But coming with the rise in its stock price has been the inflation of   Mastercard  's P/E ratio for the trailing twelve months.MA PE Ratio  (TTM) data by YChartsMastercard's P/E ratio now stands sharply at over 47, well above the industry average of 29.1 and Mastercard's own 5-year average of 28.9. These figures beg to question whether shares of Mastercard still have any room to run, or if the company has become overvalued. It is still a great company that has demonstrated solid free cash flow and continuous revenue growth, but the issue is whether a good entry point still exists. I will take a closer look at the valuation of Mastercard, and discuss the ways in which its value can appreciate.Source: Mastercard Financial Statements, With Author's CalculationsThe discounted cash flow analysis indicates that current shares are not trading cheaply. Key assumptions for the model include ~11% revenue growth and 53% operating margins (derived from historical figures). One big change to note is the assumed 21% effective tax rate for projected years; as we can see above, fiscal 2017 saw a $1 billion increase in taxes due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December 2017. The legislation reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, but also imposed a one-time repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings (a transition tax towards this new tax system). While 2017 saw a large hit to free cash flow (only $3 billion) due to the larger tax provision, we can expect the lower income tax rates to benefit Mastercard in future years.The line items following net profit after taxes were also derived from historical averages as a percent of revenue. And divided by the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), we can find the present value of the projected cash flows for Mastercard. After determining the terminal value from industry exit multiples (provided by NYU finance professor Aswath Damodaran) we calculate the enterprise value, and consequently the equity value for the company.As the implied share price ($192.70) suggests, Mastercard currently isn't cheap, as the shares are trading at roughly the same price as its intrinsic value. The calculated value is also highly dependent on the terminal value and WACC, and the sensitivity analysis below shows that there could be a wide range of values for Mastercard shares. At first glance, it makes it difficult to argue that now is a good entry point.Source: Author's CalculationsMastercard has consistently shown its ability to operate on high margins, which have risen significantly from ten years ago.Source: MorningstarOperating margins have improved from 39% in 2008 to over 53% as of 2017. And when considering the new corporate tax rates, Mastercard will able to translate a good portion of its revenue into free cash flow. As the chart below shows, P/FCF has not changed significantly over the past year as free cash flow continues to grow.MA Price to Free Cash Flow  (TTM) data by YChartsBut further increases to operating margins will be difficult, as Mastercard still has important operating expenses such as acquisitions, investments, and competitive rebates/rewards to continue encouraging customers to use credit; these will eat up a considerable part of revenue. So the focus should shift to Mastercard's revenue growth, and how much more it can grow considering its already dominant market share.Source: World Payments Report 2017The World Payments Report shows the expected growth of the cashless market. With non-cash transactions expected to grow at ~11% CAGR through 2020, and e-payments and mobile-payments expected to grow at ~18% and ~22% respectively, there remains a lot of room for expansion.Mastercard has shown developments, specifically in the space of mobile and e-payments. It continues to develop its Masterpass platform, allowing customers to make fast, secure transactions via any device. Mastercard Send capabilities allow for seamless transactions customer-to-customer, and the introduction of QR codes gives customers the ability to make in-person purchases without a card, reducing the need for expensive point-of-sales equipment for the merchant.Source: Google PlayBut most importantly, the past few quarterly reports have shown that these developments have taken off. For Q4 2017 and Q1 2018, Mastercard saw net revenue increases of 20% and 31% respectively. Important figures to consider are the growth in switched transactions (17% and 17%), cross-border volumes (17% and 21%), and gross dollar volumes (13% and 14%). Keeping in mind that credit card companies do not experience seasonality in earnings, it appears that Mastercard could potentially have reached a new level, as these reported revenue earnings are unprecedented when compared to historical growth.Mastercard has benefited from multiple tailwinds. The expanding market and the success in the development of their new products via reinvestments have both contributed greatly to this profound revenue growth. But acquisitions have played a role as well. For example, Q4 2017 saw the acquisition of Vocalink (a payments systems company headquartered in the UK) contribute three percentage points to Mastercard's revenue growth; more acquisitions have been attributed to the 17% increase in its operating expenses (and have been discussed in its annual report). Acquisitions are proving to be a growing presence in Mastercard's strategy and indicating its focus on increasing growth, which is the right move to me. To fully maximize shareholder value, revenue growth must continue, and Mastercard definitely has the means to do so. Just take a look at its debt:Source: Mastercard Financial Statements, With Author's CalculationsMastercard enjoys a low cost of debt at only 2.6%, and should have no issues with repayments; over the next 5 years, Mastercard will be responsible for only $1.9 billion in principal, less than two-thirds the free cash flow Mastercard generates in one year. And at $5.5 billion, the total debt only accounts for 2.7% of Mastercard's total capitalization. Moody's has given them an A2 rating, citing its ""strong market position, high barriers to entry, and long term prospects"".Mastercard certainly has the means to pursue an aggressive growth strategy, and can afford to borrow to do so if necessary. With the acquisitions and enhancements in its platforms, Mastercard can continue to ensure its dominance in the global payment world with better cybersecurity and heightened value creation for customers.While I do not expect the 31% growth rate experienced in Q1 to continue, even if Mastercard sees a slight uptick in revenue to an annualized average of 15%, the price of shares should be worth ~$230, representing a 20% upside to the current price. I believe this is realistic and possible, considering the promising results from recent quarterly reports.Visa (V) is a competitor to consider, but the dynamic between the two is similar to Coke and Pepsi, where competition hurts both companies. As we can see, cooperation between the two companies has resulted in default interchange fees (price fixing), prohibiting surcharges for use of Visa/Mastercard, and requiring merchants to accept the card at all locations. I would not worry too much about Visa stunting Mastercard's prospects.Again, Mastercard is not the cheapest company out there. But if an investor believes in the growth prospects discussed, as well as Mastercard's ability to flush out its other platforms and acquisitions, then it should still be an investment to consider."
4177631,65113,2018-05-28T08:56:18-04:00,"Mastercard and Visa have both shown very respectable growth in earnings in the past year.Of the two, Visa may be better valued at this point in time from a price perspective.However, Mastercard has very significant growth potential as a result of acquiring Vocalink.Of the two companies, I continue to favour Mastercard.","For some time, I've been arguing that Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is one of those companies that could be bought at any price. It's expensive - but an investor is paying a premium for a quality stock.Clearly, price growth is showing no sign of slowing, with the stock reaching $191.17 at the time of writing:This company continues to perform very strongly on its core financial metrics. For instance, we see that gross dollar volume - or fees charged by Mastercard for activity carried out on its cards - has continued to grow by double digits:Source: Mastercard Incorporated - First Quarter 2018 Financial Results Conference CallMoreover, when we look at earnings and free cash flow, we see that as price has risen - so has growth in these core metrics. This indicates that the stock is still trading at a fair value based on these metrics:I've already written at length about Mastercard's success and financial performance - and won't elaborate on it again in great detail.That being said, one topic that I've failed to address in the past is competition from Visa (NYSE:V). Does Mastercard's closest competitor pose any threat to this company?To clarify, there is not much of a particular difference between Mastercard and Visa per se. The two companies act as a payment gateway provider - and any transaction fees or interest that a customer pays is charged by a financial institution directly - not by Mastercard or Visa.When we look at Visa's Payments Volume growth, we see that the year-on-year change in percentage terms is quite similar to that of Mastercard:Source: Visa Inc Fiscal Second Quarter 2018 Financial ResultsLet's take a look at Visa's earnings and free cash flow metrics. We see that the stock has seen a significant rise in earnings and free cash flow, while the PE ratio and P/FCF ratio have trended lower.In this regard, there is somewhat of a contrast between Visa and Mastercard in that Mastercard appears to be more expensive on a relative basis when looking at earnings and free cash flow. However, prices for both stocks have continued to climb regardless, with Visa also showing a large increase in price in the past year:Taking into account the above - both stocks have continued to see growth and given that there does not seem to be any striking differences in terms of financial performance or brand loyalty - it is my opinion that an investor would likely do well over the long-term with either stock.With that being said, we could see Mastercard set to grow significantly over the coming months. As a result of Mastercard's acquisition of Vocalink, Santander will become the first of the ""big five"" banks in the UK to issue debit cards through Mastercard. While over 95 percent of debit cards in the United Kingdom run on Visa, the switchover will start to take place as existing cards for current customers start to expire from Q1 2019. While this shift won't necessarily affect customers directly, it does allow for banking institutions to reap savings from offering both debit and credit cards from the same provider (Mastercard is a significantly more popular option for credit cards currently in the UK).More broadly, Vocalink has given a boost to Mastercard's ""Other Revenues"" segment - since the technology allows for Fast ACH (or instant electronic bank account transfers). Along with the other services offered by Other Revenues (including loyalty reward management, fraud protection, and data analytics) - this segment saw a 33% year-on-year increase to $748 million. It is estimated that without Vocalink - growth for this segment would have been closer to 23%. Moreover, Mastercard could also be set to see significant growth in B2B payment offerings due to the combination of Mastercard's cross-border capabilities and Vocalink's domestic ACH capabilities. All in all, Vocalink could well provide further differentiation opportunities for Mastercard and I would be quite bullish on this company as a result.To conclude, both Mastercard and Visa have shown significant growth over the past couple of years. However, Mastercard has seen significant growth as a result of Vocalink and could be set to challenge Visa's dominance in the United Kingdom - which holds big potential for Mastercard going forward. I like both of these companies - but Mastercard ultimately pips it for me."
4174837,103321,2018-05-16T17:03:16-04:00,Mastercard reported 18% revenue growth and 24% EPS growth year over year.The firm continues to enjoy favorable tailwind as the world transitions from cash towards cards and digital transactions.Mastercard just announced a 14% dividend increase with a renewed $4 billion share repurchase plan.,"Mastercard (MA) operates the second largest electronic payment networks in the world. The company continues to enjoy strong network effect and favourable secular trend. It also has excellent track records of free cash flow growth and dividend growth. However, its shares are not cheap. For investors with a long-term investment horizon, Mastercard may be a good choice. Investors desiring higher margin of safety should patiently wait for a pullback.MA data by YChartsStrong network effectOver the past few decades, Mastercard has established a vast network of merchants and cardholders. It accounts for about a quarter of the world’s total card transactions (see table below). Mastercard has nearly 2.4 billion total cards issued at the end of Q1 2018. Together with its millions of merchants, the company creates a network that is not easily replicable. As the number of cards issued and participating merchants continues to increase, it creates an even stronger network effect. Its merchants risk losing customers if they do not join the network. On the other hand, its cardholders can access millions of merchants worldwide. Mastercard’s network essentially acts as a tollbooth as Mastercard will receive a small portion of revenue from each transaction.Source: Created by author; Company ReportsFavorable secular trendBesides having a strong network as its moat, Mastercard should continue to benefit from the continual transition from cash towards digital and plastic transactions. At the moment, cash transaction still consists about 85% of the world’s total transactions. As the trend towards digital/mobile/plastic transactions continue, Mastercard’s top and bottom lines are expected to continue to grow in the next decade.Growing free Cash flowGiven strong revenue growth in the past and its ability to keep its capital expenditure low (thanks to economies of scale), Mastercard has been able to increase its free cash flow at a double-digit growth rate in the past decade. As the chart below shows, its free cash flow increased from $243 million in 2008 to $5.1 billion in 2017. Given favorable secular trend, Mastercard should be able to continue deliver free cash flow growth in the near future.Source: MorningstarDouble-digit dividend growth and generous share repurchasesMastercard currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share. This represents a dividend yield of 0.52%. Late last year, the company increased its dividend by 13.6%. As the chart below shows, the company has a good track record of double-digit dividend growth since 2012.MA Dividend data by YChartsIn addition to its double-digit dividend growth rate, Mastercard has also been buying its shares aggressively in the past few years. Over the past 5 years, its average weighted shares outstanding have been reduced from 1.26 billion shares to 1.06 billion shares (see chart below). In the past quarter, the company repurchased about $1.4 billion worth of stock. This repurchase in Q1 2018 has contributed about $0.03 per share to its EPS. Looking forward, the company’s share repurchases will continue to positively impact its EPS and help support its current share price.MA data by YChartsFavorable tax rateThanks to the U.S. Tax Reform, Mastercard’s effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 19-20% in 2018. This is considerably lower than last year’s tax rate of 26.8%. This will boost its 2018 EPS considerably. If we apply last year’s tax rate, Mastercard would have to pay an extra $161.4 million of tax in Q1 2018. This is equivalent to a savings of C$0.153 per share.Although Mastercard enjoys strong secular trend, its business can be impacted by government regulations. For example, its interchange fees are being reviewed under the Dodd-Frank Act in the United States. In addition, mobile technology also makes it much easier for new entrants to enter the market. Merchants are willing to join these new networks as they charge much lower interchange fee than Visa and Mastercard.Mastercard currently trades at a forward P/E ratio of 29.6x. Its forward P/E ratio is significantly higher than its 5-year P/E average ratio of 24.1x. Both its forward and 5-year P/E ratios are slightly above Visa’s ratios. The consensus for Mastercard’s fiscal 2018 and 2019 EPS are $6.01 per share and $7.06 per share, respectively. Even using its 2019 estimated EPS of $7.06 per share, we still have a P/E ratio of 27.4x at today’s price of $193.35 per share. This valuation is 3.3x multiples higher than its 5-year P/E ratio of 24.1x. I believe Mastercard’s shares are overvalued.Source: Created by author, Morningstar.ComMastercard continues to enjoy strong network effect and favourable secular trend. This has helped it to deliver excellent track records of free cash flow growth and dividend growth. Its excellent cash flow generation also helps it to fund its share buybacks. However, its shares are not cheap. For investors with a long-term investment horizon, Mastercard may still be a good choice.

4165990,102764,2018-04-25T21:33:55-04:00,"Factors such as financial quality, valuation, momentum, and relative strength can be powerful return drivers for stocks.The following article takes a look at Mastercard stock based on these quantitative factors.Its valuation ratios are comparatively elevated, but the company looks remarkably strong across all of the other indicators considered.For investors who are not afraid to pay premium prices for a great company firing on all cylinders, Mastercard looks like an attractive candidate to consider.","Investment decisions based on cold hard quantified data generally lead to superior performance in comparison to buying stocks based solely on subjective opinions and speculation. Even for investors who make decisions based mostly on qualitative assessments, the numbers can provide an important reality check in order to evaluate if the investment thesis is confirmed or rejected by the quantitative evidence.Statistical research has proven that factors such as financial quality, valuation, fundamental momentum, and relative strength can be powerful return drivers for stocks over the long term. The following paragraphs will be looking at Mastercard (NYSE:MA) stock through that perspective in order to evaluate the company’s main strengths and weaknesses from a quantitative point of view.When looking at financial performance over the long term, Mastercard has an outstanding track record. The charts below show how revenue, earnings per share, and free cash flow have evolved over the years, and the company doesn't leave much to be desired in that area.MA Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsTo put the numbers in perspective, in 2010 Mastercard was making $1.55 billion in free cash flow per year, and it is now generating $5.13 billion in free cash flow on a trailing 12 months basis.The business model is remarkably profitable, since most of the fixed costs are related to the technological infrastructure required to operate the payments network. This allows the company to drive expanding profit margins as revenue outgrows costs over time, and operating profit margin is exceptionally high at around 54% of sales.Top quality rarely comes for a cheap price, and Mastercard stock is valued at a substantial premium versus the broad market. This is one of the main risk factors to consider when evaluating a position in the stock.Wall Street analysts expect the company to make $6.01 in earnings per share during 2018 and $7.06 in earnings per share in 2019. Under this assumption, Mastercard stock is trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio around 29 times earnings forecasts for 2018 and 24 times earnings expectations for 2019.As a reference, the forward price-to-earnings for the S&P 500 index based on earnings expectations for the next twelve months stands at 16, so Mastercard is priced at valuation levels considerably above average.That comparison is not particularly fair, though, since Mastercard is far superior to the average stock in the index in terms of financial performance. Visa (NYSE:V) is arguably a much more reasonable comparison for Mastercard, and the two companies are trading at valuation levels which are not very dissimilar. The forward price-to-earnings for Visa is 28 times earnings expectations for 2018 and 23 times earnings expectations for 2019.Investors are clearly willing to pay premium prices for companies like Mastercard and Visa, and for good reason. Both companies are benefiting from the death of paper money, while generating rock-solid profitability for investors in the process.That notwithstanding, elevated valuations reflect demanding expectations. If Mastercard does not deliver in accordance with those expectations, the stock is vulnerable to the downside from current price levels.Stock prices reflect market expectations. When a company is delivering better-than-expected numbers and forward-looking expectations are also moving upwards, this generally means the stock price is moving in the right direction too.The chart below shows earnings expectations, the actual reported number and the difference between those two - surprise! - in percentage terms. Mastercard has delivered earnings numbers above expectations over the past 4 quarters in a row, showing consistency in its ability to fare better than expected.The following chart shows the stock price in comparison to earnings expectations for both the current fiscal year and the next. You don't need a Ph.D. in economics to see the close relationship between the stock price and earnings expectations.MA data by YChartsTo the extent that Mastercard can continue delivering earnings numbers above expectations as well as driving increasing earnings expectations on a forward-looking basis, this should serve as a powerful upside fuel for the stock.In the stock market, as in life in general, winners tend to keep on winning over time. Mastercard has substantially outperformed both the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) and the iShares U.S. Financial Services ETF (NYSEARCA:IYG) over the past five years.MA data by YChartsLooking at returns on a shorter time frame, relative strength over the past year also shows that Mastercard is also considerably ahead of the two relevant ETFs.MA data by YChartsMoney has an opportunity cost - you don't only want to invest in stocks that are going up in price, but those that are also doing better than other alternatives in the stock market. Mastercard is in a strong uptrend and is also delivering superior performance in comparison to both the broad market and the sector in particular.The PowerFactors system is a quantitative stock-picking system exclusively available to members in my research service, ""The Data Driven Investor"". This system basically ranks companies in a particular universe according to the factors analyzed in this article for Mastercard: quality, valuation, momentum, and relative strength.The system has produced solid backtested performance over the long term. The chart below shows how the 50 stocks with the highest PowerFactors ranking in the S&P 500 performed in comparison to the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF since 1999. The backtesting assumes an equal-weighted portfolio, monthly rebalanced, and with an annual expense ratio of 1% to account for trading expenses.Data from S&P Global via Portfolio123The system more than doubled the benchmark, with annual returns of 12.6% per year versus an annual return of 5.93% for the market-tracking ETF in the same period. In cumulative terms, the system gained 888.76% versus 203.92% for the benchmark.Mastercard is one of the 50 stocks currently picked by the system, which means the stock is among the best 10% of those in the S&P 500 based on a combination of quantitative indicators that measure financial quality, valuation, business momentum, and relative strength.Yes, the stock is expensive, and this is an important risk factor to consider. That said, Mastercard is not necessarily overvalued when considering the company's financial quality and its ability to outperform expectations over time.For investors who are willing to pay premium prices for a top-quality company enjoying strong momentum and beating the market by a considerable margin, Mastercard looks like a promising candidate to consider."
4165508,34821,2018-04-25T03:07:52-04:00,"Insiders own 10.93% of the stock at Mastercard, and management seems to focus on bottom-line results.Insiders own only 0.10% of the shares at Visa, and management seems to focus more on top-line growth.The two companies will join forces via one single online payment function as a competitive response to e-commerce alternatives like PayPal and other fintech firms. This should help both firms.MA iscurrently trading at a bargain price compared to V.","Insiders at MA own 10.93% of the stock. At V, they own 0.10% (source: Yahoo). Does this result in a different kind of corporate culture? We think it does.These companies could locate anywhere. Their choices of cities for headquarters are revealing. V is headquartered in San Francisco, a city with the highest cost of living in the entire U.S., 48.8% above the national average. Presumably, workers need to be paid more when they live in this part of the world. The average yearly cost to rent office space per employee in San Francisco is $13,032. This compares to $6,702 in L.A. and only $4,618 in Dallas.MA, on the other hand, is located in Purchase, NY, a 3,600 population hamlet of the town of Harrison, NY, a good 30 miles outside the New York City, and surely with a much lower office rental cost. PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is also located there.MA does other things differently. Four of the top five MA executives listed at Yahoo are women. How many other major U.S. companies do you imagine have this amount of female representation at the top? Only one of the top five V executives listed at Yahoo are women, and she is the general counsel (and probably doesn’t have direct managerial responsibilities).Costco (NASDAQ:COST) is the second largest retailer in the U.S., trailing only Walmart (NYSE:WMT). The Motley Fool estimates that Costco has 64 million card-holders, or about 26% of the total U.S. population. Remarkably, it is the only major retailer that accepts only a single credit card. AmEx was the only credit card accepted at Costco for 15 years leading up to 2015 when Visa was selected as a new partner.The Costco partnership represented 8%, or $80 billion, of AmEx's billed business and about 20%, or about $14 billion, of its interest-bearing credit portfolio. When the AmEx contract expired, Costco clearly asked for a better arrangement. We can assume that Costco would have preferred AmEx to accept their new terms to avoid the hassle and expense of converting its huge membership base to another credit card company, but AmEx declined to accept those terms in spite of the even bigger cost they would incur to replace their lost business.For 20 years, I had had an AmEx card which I migrated to a Costco AmEx card at some point. When Visa replaced the AmEx card for Costco, AmEx offered me $300 of free buying power as well as cash rebates greater than those the Costco card had offered if I would accept a new non-Costco AmEx card. This had to cost AmEx many millions of dollars during this conversion.What stands out to me here is that AmEx had concluded that there was insufficient margin in the deal that Costco offered to them, yet Visa accepted what was probably a worse deal (assuming that Costco would have preferred AmEx to Visa if the terms were the same). Visa’s acceptance of the Costco contract would increase their top line but probably not make much difference to their net profit. This decision seems consistent with a corporate philosophy that was more concerned with the top line growth rather than the bottom line.Let’s check how these companies stack up by some important measuresSource: YahooV sales are 1 ½ times as much as MA, but their return on assets lags far behind MA’s. It is even worse for return on equity – MA makes more than three times as much as V. MA trades at a slightly higher forward P/E while growing at a rate which is more than double V’s growth rate.Neither company pays much of a dividend. V’s yield is slightly higher, but they have to employ a higher payout ratio to deliver it.Bottom line, it looks like MA is a much better value at this time than V. MA has a slightly higher P/E and a considerably higher growth rate. The chart shows that MA has clearly outperformed Visa over the past year:Weekly stock prices seem to fluctuate pretty much in tandem for the two companies, but MA’s stock price edged consistently higher throughout the year. For the past year, MA has advanced 53% while V has picked up only 35%. The market seems to reward bottom-line performance rather than top-line results.Analysts seem to like both companies about equally. Their rankings are unusually high across the board:MA has traded mostly sideways over the past three months which signals some exhaustion from the earlier bull run. On a daily chart, the bullish trend remains intact as the stock continues print successions of higher highs and higher lows. The most recent retracement that originated from highs posted in mid-March was met with buyers at a horizontal level residing at $169. This level remains strong support especially as the 100-day moving average nears the horizontal price point. Ahead of it, $175 has acted as both support and resistance and is found near the 50-day moving average. Near-term resistance is found at $179 followed by $183 which is a level that held the stock price lower on a few attempts in March.Here are the numbers:For the past eight quarters, MA has had an unblemished record of exceeding analyst expectations. That didn’t prevent the stock from trading lower after the announcement half of the time, however. The market apparently expects the company to slightly exceed these estimates (which are basically conveyed to the analysts with their guidance statements). The significant point is that the fluctuations were extremely small, regardless of whether they were up or down.Option traders have priced in a 3.8% price fluctuation after earnings while the actual historical change has been only 1.1%. If this pattern persists this time around, MA would be a perfect candidate for what we call the Diagonal Condor Earnings Strategy.EarningsWhisper.com reports that the whisper numbers for next week’s report is $1.29 compared to the composite analyst estimate of $1.26. This seems consistent with the approximate amount that MA has exceeded estimates for the past two years.The numbers in green in the above table are less than the price of the stock on the close of the day before the announcement. The pattern for MA is similar to what we see for most companies heading into earnings – the stock usually trades higher as hopes rise for a positive announcement. Short-term gains in the stock prior to the announcement are common. They are often a sign that expectations might be running a little too high, as evidenced by the lower post-announcement prices exactly half the time even though the company bested estimates.On the other hand, it is rare to see prices fall in the few weeks leading up to the announcement. When that occurs, it is usually a sign of diminished expectations, and most of the time, the stock trades higher after the results are made public. In the last eight quarters, that has only happened once for MA (1/31/17) and the stock did indeed climb on the reported earnings.Lots of people have been extolling the prospects for Visa. In our opinion, if Visa is good, Mastercard is great. We prefer the MA business model to the V model based on what looks like MA’s focus on the bottom line while V seems to prefer higher sales to higher profits. MA sports a slightly higher forward P/E than V but is slated to grow at twice V’s rate. We like to see top management own a large share of the company stock, as does MA.We would be surprised if MA failed to best estimates once again. That is surely the pattern. However, what happens after the announcement is anyone’s guess. Whatever it is, it will probably be a small fluctuation, and the best way to capitalize on that is with an options strategy that uses diagonal and/or calendar spreads which do best if there is only a small post-announcement price fluctuation."

4165193,24491,2018-04-24T12:05:50-04:00,"Very few companies benefit from a competitive advantage known as the network effect, and Mastercard is one of them.The company's growth during the past few years has been excellent, and we don't view the changing regulatory environment or crypto-currency asset proliferation as overwhelming threats to Mastercard's longevity.Mastercard generates considerable free cash flow and holds a net cash position on the balance sheet. It can raise its dividend at will, but management is holding back.The high end of our fair value estimate range for Mastercard is still below where shares are trading at, so value investors might be cautious. We still like the company a lot, however.","Image shown: Mastercard's (MA) equity price performance since the doldrums of the Great Recession of last decade.By The Valuentum TeamWhen it comes to competitive advantages, there may be nothing stronger than a network effect once it's put in motion. The basic idea of a network effect is that as more and more customers use something, more and more businesses want to use it to serve those customers, and this in turn, drives even more customer adoption, and so on. It's quite a wonderful thing. Though the concept has likely been around for decades, eBay's (EBAY) dominance in the online auction market in the late 1990s, early 2000s, followed by the launch of Facebook (FB) in the mid-2000s are probably two of the most prevalent examples of such a dynamic. However, the credit card network providers benefit from such a network effect, too.As more and more customers use their respective credit cards, more and more merchants want to accept them, and this then drives more and more customer adoption. The beauty about the Mastercard model, however, is that Mastercard is not the participant issuing the card or extending credit, or generating revenue from the interest rate or other fees charged by the actual issuers of the card (generally the account holder's financial institution). Mastercard's business model, on the other hand, takes on practically-nil customer credit risk, generating revenue on the basis of gross dollar volume and the fees charged for providing transaction processing services. It gets paid on each swipe of a Mastercard. The company's business model is a beautiful thing.Image Source: Mastercard 2017 10-K, page 35• MasterCard is a payments industry leader. Every day, the firm's network makes payments happen. It doesn't issue cards, set interest rates or establish annual fees. MasterCard generates revenue by charging fees to issuers and acquirers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related services based on the gross dollar volume of activity.• When it comes to the credit-card processing space, we generally prefer Visa (V) and MasterCard, which do not take on customer credit risk like Discover (DFS) or American Express (AXP). MasterCard's free cash flow generation is a sight to behold, with the company hauling in $5.26 billion in free cash flow on just ~$300 million in capital spending during 2017. Its top-line growth has been great, too, with revenue expanding to $12.5 billion in 2017 from $8.3 billion in 2013 (see image above). Over the same time period, operating income has leapt to $6.6 billion from $4.5 billion, a very nice growth rate. The company's operating margins are through-the-roof. Cash dividends paid remain a mere fraction of diluted earnings per share, too, revealing considerable opportunity to grow the dividend. At the end of 2017, cash and cash equivalents stood at $5.9 billion while long-term debt stood at $5.4 billion, good enough for a net cash position.• Though uncertainty persists in the global economy, the fundamentals of MasterCard's business and its approach remain unchanged. The firm's digital wallet MasterPass will continue to be a focus of the firm as it moves into an increasingly-digital world. The payments industry is a rapidly evolving one. The larger secular trend moving society towards electronic payments remains very much intact, and technological advances and demand for adjacent services will continue to drive growth opportunities. However, risks for the industry include cybersecurity and privacy concerns, increased regulatory presence and nationalism, and new competitive entrants.• As we noted previously, Mastercard benefits from one of the strongest competitive advantages out there - the network effect. As more consumers use credit/debit cards, more merchants accept them, thereby creating a virtuous cycle. Amazingly, nearly 85% of the world's transactions are still completed by cash and check as of 2015. This provides a long runway for growth, even if the adoption of crytocurrencies ramp considerably in coming decades.• MasterCard's cash-rich business model drives its outstanding Dividend Cushion ratio, which is one of the best in our coverage universe. We like MasterCard's solid capital planning priorities of maintaining a strong balance sheet, liquidity, and credit ratings as these lead to stronger dividend potential. The company will continue returning excess cash to shareholders, though existing plans are considerably biased toward share repurchases. Its current payout has an extremely long runway of growth potential ahead of it, in our view, should management choose to ramp up its dividend policy.• One of the headline risks with respect to Mastercard will always be of the regulatory variety. Interchange fees continue to be reviewed and sometimes challenged via regulations around the world. The United States, for example, caps debit interchange fees for regulated activities, and legislation in the European Union considers the capping of consumer credit and debit interchange fees within the European Economic Area (source: Mastercard, 2017 10-K, page 15). Though we don't like this long-term regulatory risk, it is part of doing business at Mastercard, and we don't think it will ever go away.• Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) may be the way of the future, but we think the very idea of idea of greater adoption of cashless technology can only be viewed as a positive for Mastercard and its brother Visa at this time. For starters, there are billions in the world still without core banking services, and while Bitcoin and blockchain technology pose a fascinating long term to ponder, Mastercard and Visa still have a long growth runway themselves. We think there are more opportunities than threats when it comes to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies at this time, and the potential fees that Mastercard and Visa could generate on crytocurrency adoption may be considerable.Image Source: ValuentumThough the risks related to regulation and consumers leapfrogging credit cards from cash to crytocurrency assets are present, we don't think a worst-case scenario will come to fruition, and given the vast percentage of transactions still being done by cash and check, adoption rates may continue to play into the credit-card networks' hands. The biggest risk for Mastercard shareholders may be pegging down a reasonable long-term rate of top-line expansion and just how strong leverage within its business model will drive operating-income growth. During the past few years, operating income has surged, and we can only expect that to continue for the foreseeable future, but we might be a little light with our forecasts.There are a couple other companies in our stock universe that benefit from the concept of a network effect, including Mastercard's brother Visa, but the network-effect dynamic is no less of a significant contributing factor of Mastercard's competitive advantages than it is with others. At the moment, our fair value estimate ($140 per share) suggests Mastercard's shares are a bit ahead of themselves, but we could be conservative on a number of fronts. The high end of our fair value range implies that a more optimistic view on Mastercard's valuation is closer to $170 per share, but this, too, is still below where shares are trading at. Though value investors may have a hard time getting comfortable with shares, we think Mastercard has staying power regardless of what the regulatory environment or cryptocurrency-asset adoption throws at it.When it comes to the dividend, unfortunately, Mastercard has not made increasing the payout a major priority. The company's capital allocation has been geared toward investing for growth via organic investments, capital expenditures, and mergers and acquisitions, as well as share repurchases. The only real weakness we can see in MasterCard's dividend at this point is simply the lack of willingness of management to significantly increase the payout. On the basis of free-cash-flow to cash-dividends-paid, Mastercard registers annual coverage north of 5 times! If Mastercard did increase the payout materially, its stock might become a big favorite for dividend growth investors seeking meaningful current yield. In the meantime, Mastercard remains a competitively-advantaged growth story with powerful free-cash-flow generating capacity across its capital-light operations.

The fund’s expense ratio is 1.50%.The fund’s principal underwriter is Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC.The fund returned 11.44% in the fourth quarter, versus 6.64% for the S&P 500. The retail sector, which had been hit hard by negative investor sentiment in the first half of the year, continued its rebound in the fourth quarter. Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST) added 1.2% to the fund, and Carter’s (NYSE:CRI) and AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) each added 0.9%. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) continues to benefit from higher rates and contributed 1.0% to the fund. Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) also added 1.0%.In a rare occurrence, there were no detractors from the fund’s performance; all our stocks went up. If only every quarter were like this….As longtime shareholders know, we’ve always admired Ross’s direct competitor TJX Companies (TJX), parent company of the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores, and the slump in retail shares allowed us to add TJX to the fund at a great price. In addition to T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, TJX runs a couple of furniture concepts (HomeGoods and HomeSense), an outdoor goods retailer (Sierra Trading Post), and stores in Australia and the UK (TK Maxx), all of which run the “treasure hunt” model of deeply discounted, name-brand goods that TJX was able to grab on the cheap. This model has grown steadily in popularity over decades, and we think that trend will continue for a very long time.For the year, the biggest contributor to performance was the fund’s largest holding, Alphabet (i.e., Google) (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which accounted for 2.5% of performance. Other significant contributors were Bank of America 2.0%, Mastercard (NYSE:MA) 2.0%, Union Pacific 1.9%, Carter’s 1.7%, and American Express (NYSE:AXP) 1.7%.MEDNAX (NYSE:MD) was again one of the fund’s largest detractors, hurting the fund by 0.9%. And despite rebounds in their stock prices toward the end of the year, both Discovery Communications (NASDAQ:DISCA) and AutoZone had negative impacts on the fund for the year, dragging down performance by 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively.Despite the large returns this year, we managed to avoid making any tax distributions, thanks to the fund’s low holdings turnover. Generally speaking, the faster a fund changes its holdings, the more tax is generated for shareholders.* Cash represents cash equivalents less liabilities in excess of other assets.Tax CutsGenerally speaking, we are focused on microeconomics: we own a small portfolio of companies that we would like to think we know well and make investments that we think will do well over various macroeconomic climates. We try to avoid investment theses that rely too much on government action; hard experience has taught us that while the government may eventually do the right thing, it will only be after exhausting all other alternatives.That said, the Internal Revenue Service is our partner in each of our investments, with a priority claim on all cash flows. Most of our investments have relatively conservative balance sheets, and all are profitable in the US. Historically, this meant that our investments paid more in taxes than they might have given different geographic and financing arrangements. The corporate tax cuts that were passed in December should disproportionately benefit our companies.The corporate tax rate dropping from 35% to 21% mathematically results in an immediate 22% increase in after-tax income for our companies’ US operations. But how much they eventually benefit over time remains to be seen and will depend in part on each company’s competitive advantage. In highly competitive industries with undifferentiated products, a reduction in everyone’s costs—taxes being a universal cost—typically gets passed through to customers. E.g., if every grocery store in your city saw wholesale milk prices fall by half, they’d be forced to drop their retail prices by a similar amount. But if, say, Visa and Mastercard saw a drop in their computing or rent costs, that probably wouldn’t lead to a reduction in how much they charge retailers and banks for clearing payments. Given most businesses in the fund have strong competitive advantages, we expect our companies to capture most of the gains.The change in tax law caused a lot of non-cash, accounting charges for companies’ earnings in the fourth quarter, so for comparability purposes, we are adjusting our companies’ earnings growth for those charges.IndustrialsUnion Pacific, now our second largest holding, returned 32.3%, which is on top of a 34.0% return in 2016. Traffic ticked up, pricing firmed, costs were managed, and in general investors were more sanguine about the economy’s—and rail’s—prospects. Earnings per share increased 14%.Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) property insurance division suffered significant losses from the string of natural disasters in the back half of the year (Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria; California’s multiple wildfires). The year will likely end up as the largest loss year for insurers in history. But this won’t happen every year, and Berkshire, like much of the industry, was more than properly reserved for these incidents. A diversified conglomerate, Berkshire’s industrial and retail businesses, as well as its investments, performed well. Overall, we estimate Berkshire’s earnings per share declined 12% last year; the stock’s total return was 21.9%.Wallboard maker Continental Building Products (NYSE:CBPX) saw a nice uptick in demand due to rising home construction, and we estimate earnings per share increased 5% last year. The US significantly overbuilt houses in the mid-2000s, and in the subsequent recession, new home construction hit a low in 2009 that was a fraction of the level just a few years prior. Home construction has been climbing back ever since. Despite being almost 10 years into a recovery, the number of new homes being built each year is still well under the long-term average, despite an increasing population. Households are being formed, and people need places to live. The growth of home construction is likely to persist for many more years. We think Continental will thrive as this trend continues. The stock returned 21.9% last year.Despite a weak environment for paint and coatings, PPG increased its earnings per share by 4%, and its stock returned 25.2%. It initiated a bid for Dutch paint company AkzoNobel, which would have been a sizable acquisition, but was rebuffed by management, partially on nationalistic grounds of keeping a Dutch company Dutch. We loved the deal at the original price, and we think PPG walked away at the right point. We remain confident PPG will use its cash wisely.HD Supply (NASDAQ:HDS) continued its transformation. It sold off its water infrastructure division, which didn’t complement the core business, used the proceeds to pay down excess debt, refinanced some remaining debt at a lower rate, and most important, ironed out the operational hiccups that hurt results last year. Management estimates its operating earnings before depreciation and amortization increased 6%, yet the stock performed poorly, declining 5.8%, which we mostly attribute to the stock getting ahead of itself at the end of 2016 when it surged 43% on inflated investor optimism about the potential for federal infrastructure spending. We think the business will continue to grow at a healthy rate while returning significant capital to shareholders.Rail volume in Canada rebounded in 2017 after an off year, and Canadian Pacific’s (NYSE:CP) earnings per share increased 11% on stronger volume and pricing. Our total return since our August 2017 purchase is 20.5%.ConsumerThe retail sector went for a bit of a roller-coaster ride in 2017. Mainline department stores Macy’s (NYSE:M), J.C. Penney (JCP), Sears (SHLD), et al., have major, structural challenges that could well be fatal. Durable goods, such as TVs and dishwashers, lend themselves well to e-commerce, to the point that Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) has been forced to reinvent itself as an art gallery, charging consumer electronics manufacturers for display rights and not moving anything to the cash register. Apparel has seen some of this showrooming effect, plus the logical conclusion of decades of variable pricing: as customers have gotten used to seeing clothes at wildly different prices between Thanksgiving and the Super Bowl, they have come to value them only at the lowest price. We think there are reasons why our retail holdings are comparatively well positioned for the changing environment, and when investor sentiment turned sharply negative in the middle of the year, we were able to add to our positions at Ross, Carter’s, and AutoZone, and initiate a position in TJX.Ross Stores’ stock price started the year at $65, dipped to a low of $53, and ended the year at $80. To put that in perspective, that’s a swing of $10.5 billion of value—in an otherwise calm market—for a steady, thriving business. Ross operates the lowest cost business model in apparel retail—it is what Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) would look like if customers picked up their clothing at the distribution centers—and we believe they are well positioned for a more price-competitive future. We had not bought shares of Ross since 2014, but the sharp (we say irrational) swoon in the share price gave us an opportunity to bulk up the position, buying some at $55, just above the year’s low and just before the sharp run-up through the end of the year. From start to finish, Ross’s total return for the year was 23.5%, and we estimate earnings per share increased 17%.Carter’s continues to perform. The children’s apparel maker acquired Skip Hop, a niche- yet-popular baby-products brand, and increased its distribution with Amazon, leading to an estimated 10% earnings-per-share growth. Despite some clear differences from the adult apparel market, investor concern has focused on Carter’s exposure to mall foot traffic. This is a serious concern, but we felt that it was significantly overstated in the spring downturn. Carter’s total return was 38.3%As we discussed in the semiannual report, AutoZone’s stock price has been under pressure from weak sales due to the lack of inclement weather last winter (cars fail more often in harsher weather), but more so from the perception that the auto-parts retail business will move to Amazon. Some of it already has—and more of it will—but we think the bulk of the business will remain with the incumbents. Mechanics need parts delivered on a same-day basis, and the large majority of AutoZone’s retail customers ask for help in finding the right part, with employees often installing parts for customers. Despite investors’ concerns, there hasn’t been a material impact to date from online competition, and after falling almost 40%, the stock rebounded to end the year down only 9.9%. Earnings per share increased 6%.Operationally, Discovery Communications had a good 2017, on track to grow free cash flow by double digits and making a significant, accretive acquisition (Scripps Network Interactive (NYSE:SNI), operator of HGTV, Food Network, and other channels). But in the battle for the hearts and minds of investors, Discovery continued to lose ground, its share price declining by 18.4% as the market remains spooked about Discovery’s prospects in a world where viewers choose programs (e.g., via Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)) rather than have the programs served to them according to a master schedule (“linear programming”).The concern is that Discovery’s massive content library of human interest and reality shows may be better suited to background viewing than appointment television. We think the traditional pay TV market in the US will continue to shrink, but we also believe Discovery’s overseas operations (where half its earnings come from) and other distribution agreements will maintain Discovery’s cash flows at attractive levels. With the valuation so low now (seven times free cash flow), we believe the odds are in our favor, but this is a rapidly shifting environment.Armanino Foods of Distinction (OTCPK:AMNF), our little Hayward, California–based maker of frozen pesto sauce, keeps on chugging away. Its stock returned 18.4% in 2017, and the company is on pace to increase its earnings per share 12%. First purchased in 2013, our overall total return is now close to 200%.We expect TJX’s 2017 earnings per share to come in 11% higher than 2016’s levels. We acquired our shares at a price-to-earnings ratio of 16 times earnings, the company’s lowest level in almost five years, which we think is a bargain (especially in this market) for such a great business. Our return to date is 9.2%.FinancialsAs interest rates rose and loans grew, the banking sector continued its rebound. Through strong cost-cutting and higher interest revenue, Bank of America increased its earnings per share 22% and its stock returned 35.7%. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) also saw a surge in interest income, which led to earnings per share growth of 11% and a total return on the stock of 26.8%.Historically, particularly leading into and through the financial crisis, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) consistently outperformed its rivals by producing stronger deposit and loan growth, with better credit quality, while keeping costs lower, which earned it a long-running and well-deserved reputation as the best-run large bank. But in recent years, not only has earnings growth lagged, the company has also stumbled badly in treating its customers properly (ignoring the opening of fake accounts by aggressive bankers, overcharging its auto-loan and foreign-exchange customers) and complying with regulation (having its “living will” filing rejected by regulators).We’ve done okay on the investment so far with an annualized 14% return to date, but the missteps have been disappointing. We are cautiously optimistic that the new management team can improve operations and the low valuation will lead to outperformance. The stock returned 13.2% last year, and earnings per share were roughly flat from 2016.American Express (AXP), after a couple rough years adjusting to the loss of its largest partner, Costco (NASDAQ:COST), increased its earnings per share 4% on growing card usage and a large share buyback. The economics of high-end co-branded credit cards are not what they once were, but the company prospects for growth are still strong. Despite a 36.2% return last year, the shares remain much cheaper than the rest of the market.Information TechnologyAlphabet, already one of the largest companies on the planet, seems to be defying the laws of physics by continuing to grow like a startup. Despite being over $100 billion, revenue is still growing at a rate of over 20% per year. And that’s not just the developing world catching up to mature markets; the US continues to grow at a rate of 20%. Despite this absurd growth rate, which looks to persist for a while, the company trades at only a small premium to the rest of the market. We think the likelihood of someone displacing Google in search anytime soon, or growth suddenly slowing down, are fairly remote, which is why it’s our top holding. The total return on the stock last year was 32.9%, and earnings per share grew an estimated 22%.It was a great year for Visa and Mastercard, whose stocks returned 47.7%, and 47.2%, respectively. Mastercard increased its earnings per share an estimated 21%, while Visa increased 23% and is starting to see significant benefits from its Visa Europe acquisition. The world is moving to card payments, and the economics of their card ecosystems remains intact and durable.HealthcareMEDNAX’s struggles continued, with earnings per share declining an estimated 17% and the stock dropping 19.8%. The doctor-staffing company is facing some ephemeral issues—2017 was an off-year for births in the US, its nascent radiology business had growing pains—that will work themselves out soon enough, but it also faces structural challenges: it hasn’t been able to pass on its increasing physician costs to its customer base, comprised of consolidating commercial insurers and, increasingly, government health programs that pay lower rates. We sold half our shares in June.In November, an activist investor, Elliott Associates, took an ownership stake of 7% in MEDNAX and indicated it would urge management to review its “strategic options…to maximize shareholder value,” standard hedge fund euphemisms for seeking a sale of the company. We hold our remaining shares in the expectation this comes to fruition to our benefit.Investments Initiated in 2017Canadian Pacific RailwayTJX CompaniesInvestments Exited During 2017Despite an expensive market, we maintain our family office mindset of preserving wealth and compounding capital.

4164994,102762,2018-04-23T19:00:17-04:00,"Mastercard has been successful in growing its business stably over last years.The increasing inflation will contribute to the future growth of the company.Mastercard's financials are in good shape. Low debt and high EPS growth reduce the level of risk in this stock.DCF model demonstrates Mastercard stock is reasonably valued, with the fair price of $177-185.","It is clear Mastercard (MA) has been more than successful as a corporation over last years. Hence, the company has grown its business rapidly, evident by the fact that the revenue increased double-digits in 11 out of last 16 quarters, which sets a promising trend. As a result, the stock has soared about 100% over last two years, reflecting the positive improvements in the business.MA data by YChartsThe company not only outperformed the market during the period but also surpassed its main rival - Visa (V). Barrons names such reason as MA's successful expansion to the European market as the primary rationale behind the success. The newspaper provides a comment by Evercore ISI's David Togut:It can be expected the positive trend in Mastercard business will continue in the near future, as credit-card corporations will likely see many fundamental prerequisites for growth. For instance, the increase in the e-commerce market means the demand for credit and debit cards should grow rapidly. Notably, the market grew about 20% year-over-year in Q4 2017, outpacing the global retail industry. Moreover, such topics as mobile and contactless payments and lowered costs of card acceptance should encourage investors.However, there is another reason for being optimistic when it comes to credit-card corporations, which is rising inflation. As Mastercard seems to outperform Visa in such key regions as Europe, I believe MA will be a primary winner from an increase in consumer prices.So, the corporation has been more than successful over last years, and now it seems that the positive trend will continue in the near future. One of the reasons for this to happen is the fact that the rising inflation will provide an especial boost for Mastercard's revenue. It can be expected that the increase in the price index in regions like the US and Europe will lead to a growth in MA's revenues from fees.The connection between these two events lies at the core of Mastercard's business. Hence, credit card corporations, like Mastercard or Visa, generate most of their revenues by charging a fee to a merchant's bank whenever debit or credit cards are used to make transactions. This is justified by the fact that these card providers offer a safe and simple network, a technology for processing the payments. The main sources of revenue in the case of fees are the cross-border volume fees and transaction processing. Mastercard explains this as follows:Notably, cross-border volume and transaction processing revenue account for about 56% of the total Mastercard's revenue, and the segments increased by 17% and 20% in 2017, which made them the fastest-growing sources of revenue for the company. As these segments are correlated with the dollar volume of transactions, it seems clear that increasing inflation will contribute to the company's growth in the near future - the rise in prices inevitably leads to higher transaction volume, other things equal.The data for several countries confirms that the price index is likely to rise in the coming years. For instance, the inflation expectations in Europe are the highest in five years, and they have increased significantly over last three quarters.(Source: European Central Bank)The same trend is seen in the US. The data by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis indicates the 5-year inflation expectation rate has increased by about 40-50 basis points over the last year. Notably, Reuters reports a consumer survey conducted by the Fed in February showed the one-year expected inflation rose to 2.83% in February, the highest level since February 2017. It is clear the Fed will address the issue by increasing the interest rates this year, but the process will take time to achieve any results.(Source: St. Louis FED)As a result, Mastercard is likely to receive a boost from rising prices, which is one of the reasons why the future of the company remains promising.In regard to financials, Mastercard looks stable in a positive way. The company increased its revenue double-digits in 11 out of last 16 quarters, which was achieved due to a comprehensive strategy set by the management. Moreover, the company has very low debt, with a debt-to-cash ratio of less than 1, which means the obligations are fully covered by liquid assets. Other encouraging points include balanced dividend payouts, which do not hurt the main business, solid EBITDA margin of near 65%, and a stable tax rate of 20%, which means the company's success is achieved organically rather than due to artificial tax optimization.To strengthen the analysis, I use a discount cash flow model to value the company. The model is based on the following assumptions:1. The average annual revenue growth rate over the horizon period of five years is estimated to be around 11%, with 16% increase in fiscal 2018 and 12% increase in 2019. This complies with the management's expectations provided during the last earnings call.The growth from 2020 to 2022 is estimated to be on the level of 10%.2. The average EBITDA margin will stay at around 65%, the level that has been seen over last three years.3. I capitalize average gross PP&E growth of 10% for the next five years, adjusting the number according to management expectations.4. The after-tax cost of debt is 2%. The cost of equity capital (13.3%) is computed using CAPM, with 1.16 beta, 2.9% risk-free rate, and 9% market premium. The WACC is, therefore, 13%.Here is the operating and balance sheet data used in the modeling:As a result, the model shows $190 billion equity value under the base scenario, which assumes EV/EBITDA multiple will decrease to the average of 19 by the end of the horizon period (2022). In this case, the fair value of the stock is $180.8. The sensitivity analysis shows a range of possible outcomes that will be driven by actual results of the corporation. In light of this, the fair price range is $177-185, which means the current stock price of $177 reflects a reasonable valuation, with a slight upside potential.Overall, while Mastercard has been more than successful over last years, the future of the company also looks bright. The corporation has been able to capture a solid share of the European market, which will help MA outperform its main rival Visa.Therefore, MA stock seems to be a solid hedge against the inflation in regions such as Europe and the US. As the consumer prices are expected to rise in the near future, the transaction volume-based fees charged by Mastercard should grow as well, generating higher revenue for the company. Besides, the advancements in such areas as e-commerce and mobile payments will be especially beneficial for Mastercard's performance.Financial analysis shows the company manages its resources exceptionally well. Low debt, high margins, and steadily growing dividends should encourage long-term investors and reduce the level of risk for the stock. DCF analysis demonstrates the company is reasonably valued, with a fair price range of $177-185, which reflects the current stock price. As a result, I believe investors who seek ways of hedging against rising prices will be rewarded for holding MA over the coming years.My detailed analyses of other tech companies can be found on my profile page.

4159334,102173,2018-03-27T15:56:16-04:00,An update on the Mastercard and Visa disruption hypothesis.Whatsapp fire: Incoming.Why investors should take these developments seriously?,"In a very controversial piece a couple of months ago, I asserted that MasterCard (MA) and Visa (V) risked losing a key market in India. This was based on the argument about a developing threat from disruptions in the payments space which are more severe in nature compared to protectionist regulations.Needless to say, my assertions attracted the attention and irked not only readers but also the higher-ups in the communications team within MasterCard (after calling me irresponsible they asked me to remove a quote which I, thanks to SA, obviously didn't). But I think the argument is logical. And if the latest data is anything to go by, I think both the companies will be toast in India in less than five years.As seen below, UPI related transactions at four dominant banks in India have seen a sharp rise month-on-month. If UPI simply maintains this rate of growth, we could see it taking the pole market share position in 2018 itself. If I were a betting man, I'd bet on this scenario getting realized. Here's why.SourceAfter beta-testing for several months, Whatsapp (FB) finally started rolling out its pay feature to Indian users in February. Whatsapp has 200 million active users in India, and it has acquired these customers without spending a dime on advertising. Indians also spend an incredible amount of time on Whatsapp which is not the case with other core payment apps such as PayTM. Therefore, a success of the payment feature seems near-certain unless Facebook manages to embroil itself in another Cambridge Analytica-like controversy.SourceOn the merchant-side, considering how smooth and inexpensive the interface is, I find it hard to imagine why they may not discourage card payments in favor of the Whatsapp-UPI interface. As seen below, the Whatsapp attach button now features a payment option. After typing the amount to send, users get a message in their window similar to a text, a one-step process. Note that merchants have verified by Whatsapp accounts, a feature similar to Twitter (TWTR).Picture by AuthorIn my previous piece, some readers did comment that they did not find using cards cumbersome. To be honest it isn't. While Whatsapp is more convenient, does it solve a problem that never really existed? The problems do exist on the merchant side in terms of merchant fees paid out to MasterCard and Visa. And once both the firms start competing against these systems, a loss in margins is a given. Therefore, people using DCF models need to at least a discount a decline in margins while valuing both companies.Are you still skeptical of India watching for disruptions in the payment space? Here's why I am not. Fidelity (FIS) released a report recently in which India was the only country with the highest score of 5 for innovation and customer value in the payments space.SourceConsidering that disruptions are getting exported across countries faster than ever before, this could have widespread repercussions on MasterCard and Visa's business model. As I see it they need to build a competitive system before someone else does to be relevant in the next decade and after.If you find the article interesting, kindly follow me to be updated about my latest insights!"
4149888,36431,2018-02-23T05:27:44-05:00,"Visa and Mastercard are often lumped together, and for good reason, due to their perceived similarities.They're both ""tollbooth"" type businesses.An analysis of return on equity reveals differences, however.","I don't think there's much of an argument when Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) are labeled wonderful businesses. They both operate like tollbooths - largely due to their dominant market share, the highly regulated industry they operate in with high barriers of entry, their technological ""know-how"", and their hard-to-reproduce size and scale. These companies are often lumped together in the minds of investors, as they appear to run identical business models, but I think they're different in many ways as well - especially when examining their respective returns on equity.I created the below charts using data from Visa and Mastercard's 2017 10-K forms. I also decided to use the adjusted, non-GAAP numbers (excluding things like charges and one-time items) provided by the management of both companies in their respective 10-Ks.The information I used for adjusted net income (and also to extrapolate pretax income, or EBT, and operating profit, or EBIT, using the adjusted operating margins and adjusted effective tax rates) can be found on page 35 of Visa's annual report and page 37 of Mastercard's. Assets, equity, and revenues were not adjusted for this analysis.Despite nearly identical business models (and similar tax rates and interest burdens), the difference between the two companies can immediately be felt when examining their respective returns on equity. Mastercard's absurdly high ROE of 87.76% initially looks much more attractive than Visa's ROE of only 25.38%, but there's also more to this picture.Visa owns the higher margins, which probably reflect its economies of scale. Mastercard's margins are also attractive, but they're simply lower. Mastercard more than makes up for this, however, with greater efficiency. It's improved its asset turnover ratio sequentially over the past three years - reaching 0.62x in fiscal 2017.This compares to Visa's asset turnover of only 0.28x in its fiscal 2017 - the third straight year of this efficiency ratio declining. Visa's assets have grown faster than its revenues, and its acquisition of Visa Europe probably contributed to this trend.Visa's balance sheet is loaded with a lot more ""air"" - aka goodwill and intangibles - in relation to Mastercard. Neither firm really relies on physical PP&E like say, a railroad, but there's definitely a wide discrepancy between Mastercard's and Visa's balance sheets when filtered through this lens.This could also help partially explain why Mastercard's asset turnover ratio is superior, which is also a major contributing factor to its ability to generate vastly superior ROE in relation to its larger competitor. This also tells me that margin expansion would increase Mastercard's figures much more as well.Besides superior asset turnover, Mastercard also operates with higher financial leverage than Visa. Leverage magnifies ROE, pushing it higher as the leverage increases. It should be noted that both firms have stepped up the leverage sequentially over the past three fiscal years, but Visa's ratio remains much lower.If we were to perform a ""thought experiment"" and set the leverage ratio to 1x for both companies and hold everything else constant, however, Mastercard's ROE would come in at around 24.53% - still almost doubling Visa's at only about 12.63%.Visa is still king of payments when it comes to margins and size and scale. It probably even wins at brand awareness. Mastercard, however, efficiently generates more revenue from its asset base and operates with more leverage, allowing it to achieve enviably high ROE that is vastly superior to Visa's. Even when placing leverage on a ""level playing field,"" Mastercard still appears to be the superior capital allocator.In the end, I think both businesses dominate a duopoly that allows them to generate outsized returns on their overall invested capital. They're both above-average operations and they're also both classic tollbooth businesses - but they're not exactly identical twins, either."

Even after a bit of weakness, MA looks overvalued relative to its own history and its primary competition in the market, Visa (V). With volatility running rampant in the markets alongside a distinct downside momentum as of late, I think taking profits from overvalued positions makes sense. This is especially the case when they don’t do much in the way of contributing to my passive income stream. Market volatility is creating attractive opportunities in a variety of sectors/industries that I follow and I’m beginning to place a much higher value on cash. This is the type of market that gives more active managers the ability to outperform and I think that even conservative, income-oriented investors can use this abnormally high volatility to their benefit. With all of this in mind, on Friday, I trimmed my MA stake, selling the shares I bought in December of 2016 for $102.47 in a tax advantaged account for $175.12, locking in gains of approximately 71%.I’m holding onto the MA shares that I hold in my taxable brokerage account for two reasons. One, I have a cost basis of $74.15 on those shares and I don’t want to pay taxes on the 132% unrealized gains that I’m currently sitting on. Typically, I don’t like letting the tail wag the dog in terms of taxes; however, this leads me to my second reason: Mastercard is undoubtedly a very high quality name and I prefer to trim my exposure, rather than eliminating it altogether, because while I feel strongly that MA is overvalued, which will likely lead to underperformance moving forward, I also acknowledge that I don’t have a crystal ball and the market is oftentimes irrational for very long periods of time. MA could easily continue to expand its multiple due to its relatively reliably double digit growth prospects. What’s more, over the very long term, valuations in the short term may not matter all that much anyway; if MA is able to produce double-digit annual top-line growth for 15-20 years or so, it won’t matter much whether or not the stock is trading for 35x earnings today and the outsized risk that present day investors are facing due to MA’s massive premium will be well worth the rewards.With that last bit in mind, I’m going the other direction with ~50% of my MA stake due to the fact that I’m in a risk-off mode when it comes to the markets. I'm focusing more on my income stream and less on speculative growth, which hasn't boded very well for a handful of my holdings with low yields and high multiples.I’ve felt for a while now that we were likely nearing the end of the current bull market run. However, tax reform changed my tune; I thought that maneuver was an extremely bullish sign for 2018 at least, likely reducing the risk for recession and extending the late cycle environment for another 12-18 months or so. Well, in recent weeks, the roller coaster we’ve seen in Washington D.C. took another unexpected turn with the tariff/trade war talks emanating from the White House.As bullish as I was on tax reform, I’m worried that these anti-free trade measures will counteract many of the positive aspects I expect to see. It’s still very early on in the “trade war” talks and by now we’ve all seen that our current POTUS likes to use outlandish threats to begin the bargaining process before eventually backing down and settling for something closer to the middle. So, in the end, I think the market could be reacting to a whole lot of nothing. However, if a trade war with China escalates, I think there is a decent chance that it gets out of control and goes further than anyone planned for. This is the risk that the market reacted to late last week, selling off 1,100 points during Thursday and Friday. The way I see it, no one wins in a trade war, and as an investor, when there is trouble brewing between the world’s two largest economies, I think it’s correct to adjust risk in the markets.Lowering my equity risk profile is what led me to Mastercard. MA checked a handful of the boxes that I’ve been looking at for potential sale targets. Like I said in the intro, MA is trading at its highest valuation in years. In late 2013, the stock traded up above 30x earnings, but it’s exceeded those levels recently. The only time since the company’s IPO in 2006 that MA shares have been more expensive than they are today is a brief period of time in mid-2008.Back in 2008 when MA touched a 40x multiple, the company was posting bottom line growth above 60%. MA has posted double-digit EPS growth every year since its IPO, but the pace that analysts expect moving forward is nowhere near those 2008 levels. Tax reform is expected to be a massive boon to MA’s bottom line with analysts expecting ~30% growth in 2018; however, after these one-time benefits are factored in, EPS growth is expected to fall back to the 15% annual range. I think that the market has priced in 2018’s expected tax related boon already, but looking further down the road, I think it’s difficult to justify a 35x P/E ratio with ~15% annual growth.When I bought MA, I expected to see ~15% annual growth, but I paid ~23x earnings for shares. This results in a PEG ratio that I’m comfortable with. A PEG above 2.0 is not a fundamental ratio that I want to see. What’s more, while Mastercard has never been known for its dividend yield, but rather its dividend growth, the recent upward trajectory of the share price has driven the yield down to nearly imperceptible, at 0.58%. Not only is MA’s yield very low, but dividend growth has been slowing as of late. MA’s last dividend increase was 13.6%; that figure ought be outstanding for the vast majority of DGI names, but it represents a continued downtrend in annual dividend growth for MA. Now obviously MA couldn’t continue with the 50-100% dividend growth that the company was posting a few years back, and with such strong EPS estimates moving forward, I expect for this downdraft even out in the low double-digit range. But even so, a 10-15% annual dividend growth on a ~0.6% yield still means that investors are going to have to wait decades for meaningful dividend income on a relative basis to the broader market (the S&P 500 yields ~1.9% at the moment).When thinking about selling Mastercard, I obviously looked at the stock’s valuation relative to its primary peer in the market, Visa. MA has outperformed Visa on a relative basis over the last year, up 52.78% compared to Visa’s 31.28% appreciation. When looking at past and future growth, these two companies look relatively similar. In 2016 and 2017 respectively, MA posted 10% and 21% EPS growth. In these same two years, Visa produced 8% and 23% EPS growth. As you can see in the two F.A.S.T. Graphs posted below, the market has assigned an outsized premium to MA relative to V.The fact that Visa’s top-line growth has been better than MA’s in recent years adds to my cynicism regarding this relative premium. Over the past 5 years, Mastercard has grown its revenues from $7.39B to $11.94B, representing a 45.79% overall gain during that period of time. This is great, but over the same 5 years, Visa has grown its top-line from $11.77B to $18.35B, or an overall gain of 55.86%.At the end of the day, while I still believe that both of these companies operate wonderful businesses, I don’t think the outsized premium that the market has assigned to MA is justified. By trimming my position, I’m not condemning MA’s operations in anyway; I hope to buy these shares back, but I won’t do so until their premium has diminished, widening my margin of safety. Right now, Morningstar’s fair value estimate is $156, S&P Capital IQ’s fair value calculation is $155.56. Assuming MA is able to hit its ~$6.00 EPS estimates for 2018, those price targets would represent a 26x forward multiple. MA’s long-term normal P/E ratio is 25.9x. I agree with these fair value estimates and I’d be willing to re-purchase the shares that I sold on Friday in the $155 area (which represents ~11% downside from where I sold). Time will tell if I have that opportunity or not, but in the meantime, I’m happy to increase my cash position."

However, the Fund has returned an average of 8.6% per year since its inception in October 2006, outperforming the MSCI World Index’s annualized gain of 5.8% over the same period.Mastercard (NYSE:MA), the second largest payment system in the U.S., was the top contributor for the quarter. We were pleased with the underlying trends exhibited in Mastercard’s fourth-quarter earnings report. A 13% increase in gross dollar volume translated to revenue growth of 15%, thanks to gains in switched transactions (+17%), cross-border growth (+17%) and acquisitions. For the full-year period, 10% gross dollar volume growth translated to 14% organic revenue growth and to 21% adjusted earnings per share growth. We believe that Mastercard can retain the benefits it gained from the recent U.S. tax reform. Management plans to invest a portion of the savings to boost revenue growth and will then return the remainder to shareholders, which will further enhance per share value growth. In our estimation, Mastercard is a great business with years of secular growth ahead that is trading at a discount to our perception of its underlying value.WPP, a leading global advertising company, was the largest detractor for the quarter. Investors reacted negatively to the company’s fiscal 2017 results, reported in March. Account losses from 2016 had an abnormally high negative effect on growth in 2017. The company also announced weaker guidance for 2018. However, management indicated this is primarily due to the poor performance of legacy businesses rather than problems in the company’s digital or media divisions. Many developed-market multinational companies are cutting their advertising spending to control costs, which has in turn put pressure on global advertising agencies. WPP has admitted they were slow to recognize this trend and subsequently contain costs, but management will be more diligent to such changes going forward. WPP’s media and digital businesses are performing well and have good growth prospects, although the company is facing some short-term pressure. Despite the challenging short-term situation, our investment thesis for WPP is intact, and we used its recent share price weakness to increase our position.Geographically, 48% of the Fund’s holdings were invested in U.S. companies as of March 31, while approximately 52% were allocated to equities in Europe and the U.K.We continue to believe the Swiss franc is overvalued versus the U.S. dollar.

4140472,104081,2018-01-26T12:19:27-05:00,"Mastercard will report Q4 2017 earnings Thursday, February 1, before market open.The payment giant just announced a 14% dividend increase last month, which will bring the annual payment to an even $1 per share.Read below for a recap of holiday spending and activities that will affect the coming earnings report.","Few sectors are benefiting as much as payment/merchant services from the rapid growth of online commerce. As one of the largest payment processing networks, Mastercard (MA) is particularly well positioned to profit from the massive global trend toward online payments and away from cash transactions.As you can see in the chart below, MA has consecutively beat earnings estimates in the previous four quarters:Q4 2016 MA reported a slight beat of the $0.85 EPS estimate resulting in $0.86, Q1 2017 beat the estimate of $0.95 coming in at $1.01, Q2 2017 beat $1.04 by reporting $1.10, and the largest of them all, Q3 2017 with an estimate of $1.23 and actual EPS of $1.34 - resulting in an 8.9% surprise. Yahoo Finance ChartThe consensus EPS forecast for Q4 2017 is $1.12, an approximate 30% increase from the reported EPS for the same quarter previous year. MA's tollbooth business structure yields a steadily increasing stream of high-margin revenue. The company accomplishes this by collecting a fee from each transaction that passes through its network.MA runs an incredibly profitable business. Over the trailing 12 months, the company produced operating and net margins of 54% and 39%, respectively.Mastercard's low overhead business model allows for minimal capital outlay, and it can add new merchants and cardholders to its network at little incremental cost. Thus, the company excels at turning its revenue into bustling free cash flow - some of which is returned to shareholders.During Q3 2017, MA repurchased approximately 6.4 million shares at a cost of $838 million and returned $235 million in dividends.On December 4 2017, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25/share- a 14% increase over the previous dividend of $0.22/share.The Board of Directors also approved a new share repurchase program, authorizing the company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its Class A common stock.The new share repurchase program will become effective at the completion of the company’s previously announced $4 billion share repurchase program. The company has approximately $1.5 billion remaining under the current program authorization.As well as the stock is currently performing, MA already has been downgraded once this year, in 2018. But before you worry about what the particular analyst found, read below as it's not as bad as it initially sounds.On January 4 2018, RBC Capital downgraded MA from ""Top Pick"" to ""Outperform"" citing that the stock had surged 47% in 2017 alone. Although, RBC remains bullish as trends of rising energy prices and favorable forex rates that benefited Mastercard in 2017 will repeat itself in 2018. At the same time as RBC changed its rating, it increasing its price target on the stock to $180.Yahoo Finance GraphOut of the 36 analysts currently covering the stock, 29 of them give either a ""buy"" or ""strong buy"" recommendation on MA. Yahoo Finance ScaleThe majority of ""buy"" ratings equate to a 1.8 score on a 1 to 5 scale. Currently MA stock price of $168.59 is approaching its average price target of $170.39.According to a December 26, 2017, SpendingPulse report, holiday sales increased 4.9 percent this last season, setting a new record for dollars spent. Note: The SpendingPulse report details holiday shopping from November 1 through December 24 and covers retail sales (excluding automotive) across all payment types, including cash and check.The 4.9% sales increase compared to holiday season 2016 is the largest year-over-year increase since 2011. Online shopping also saw large gains of 18.1% compared to 2016 the report noted, boosted by a late season rally.You don't have to be a genius to correlate record holiday season spending having a possible positive result for MA's revenue and margin.This is a good sign considering MA is not shy about spending the bucks either.In a November 30 2017 press release the company announced it will add to its New York State operations through the expansion of its Manhattan technology hub. With a multi-million dollar investment in a new 212,000 square foot location at 150 Fifth Avenue, the project will create 473 new technology-related jobs by 2024.This multi-million dollar investment could affect Q4 2017 earnings depending on how much time and resources the company has already spent in the initial stage of R&D on the new hub.Even after 20-plus years of growth, the integration of e-commerce is still in its early years. Online sales comprise roughly 10% of the global retail entirety, and research firm eMarketer estimates that retail e-commerce sales will increase from $2.3 trillion in 2017 to nearly $4.5 trillion in 2021. With hundreds of millions of new people gaining access to the internet every year, e-commerce appears set to keep growing at a rapid pace for at least another decade. And since online sales are most commonly completed with digital payment methods, Mastercard stands to profit massively.With robust macroeconomic trends positively pushing Mastercard's revenue, profit, cash flow, and dividend growth, investors can reasonably expect the payment giant to deliver even more gains in the coming years.For Q4 2017, I project an earnings beat.If you hold MA stock long term or enjoy reading about long-term investments, I invite you to visit other Seeking Alpha exclusives such as ""Realty Income: The Monthly Dividend Company"" and ""This Unsexy REIT Sector Is A Cash Cow.""

4133276,102173,2017-12-21T11:54:00-05:00,Picking up on a key criticism on my previous piece.Dissecting the credit card architecture to see if it can be replaced.See it to believe it.,"About two days ago, I published an article on a latent threat to Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V). Since the assertions were bold, I was expecting stick of the kind ""Apple fanboys"" dish out when a contributor writes something negative on Apple (AAPL). That did not happen and the discussion was quite civil for the most part. A lot of the counterarguments though were dominated by two key points - the UPI architecture does not obviate the credit card ecosystem, and the questionable importance of India as a market. I intend to counter those arguments here.The assertions made by a few readers are right. India, at the moment, does not constitute a large enough market to move the needle on either companies. The key word though is ""at the moment"". A large portion of any company's valuation is derived from the present value of future cash flows, isn't it?So let's do a bit of math here. In terms of absolute dollars, the private final consumption expenditure in 2016 was $1.3 trillion (graph below). That is around 59% of GDP for a $2.2 trillion economy. Since 5% of the transactions were of the electronic kind, the total digital payment volume in 2016 was (5% * $1.3 trillion) = $65 billion.As stated in my previous article, Mastercard and Visa had revenues of nearly $900 million last year. I will be introducing a variable here. If Mastercard and Visa earned $900 million in revenues, they translated 1.3% of the payment volume into revenues. This isn't entirely accurate as card networks earn revenues on payment volumes as well as transaction volumes. But it's the best I could think of to model the addressable market.Based on Morgan Stanley estimates, India is set to be a $6 trillion economy with digital payments constituting 36% of personal expenditure by the year 2027. Even if the private final consumption expenditure stays constant at 60%, this translates to a payment volume of (36% * 60% * $6 trillion) = $1,296 billion.If there were no threats from disruptors, MA and V would be looking at revenues of $18 billion at the 1.3% conversion rate quoted above. But, as seen below, mobile wallet systems and UPI seem to be encroaching rapidly into their domain. I don't see how a $18 billion market lost to mobile cannot be considered as lost returns for shareholders. Especially when Mastercard's and Visa's TTM revenues stand at $12 billion and $18.3 billion respectively.SourceLet's get to the second criticism about credit cards and I will address it by looking at how the card architecture is being breached.SourceThere are four elements to a credit card transaction: 1. A plastic card and a POS terminal which act as hosts for authentication and authorization; 2. authentication is used to confirm the account number as well as the presence of adequate credit limit in that account; 3. under authorization, the user performs a specific action such as - swiping a credit card/ holding over a reader - to authorize a particular amount to be deducted against his/her account; and 4. motivation to use a credit card because of rewards and offers.In a Card not present transaction, smartphones have already replaced credit cards and POS terminals as hosts and for authorization. The contactless payment systems have now replaced plastic cards while still requiring a reader or a POS terminal. They rely on payment networks only for authentication. So the elimination of the plastic card shouldn't be very hard to imagine.SourceIn a UPI transaction, the UPI takes the place of credit card networks for authentication of the transaction and these are backlinked to all bank accounts using a phone number. Now the thing to remember is that the credit card issuer is still a bank. Mastercard and Visa are simply open source networks that process transactions.Since the account is maintained with a bank, UPI simply has to backlink to a credit account instead of the savings/checking account and the process can continue in line with the debit process. This was the major reason why I did not include American Express (AXP) in this thesis as it is a closed network.I am horrible at doodling, but two smartphones is all you need in a UPI transaction as depicted below.(I apologize for the handwriting but do let me know in the comments if you find it difficult to read).The last element that a lot of the criticism got directed at was the motivation to use a credit card and whether this can be replicated by the UPI. The answer is yes, and that is how it gained traction in its first few months. Card networks have contracts with banks to direct reward points based on several parameters. UPI, devoid of this advantage, started out by offering cashbacks to users who encourage and channel transactions through the UPI route. Already the cashbacks are being segregated by type - utility, food, and ticketing. But this should be pretty straight isn't it? I find it hard to imagine the difficulty in replicating the rewards-based system if you have the technology to process transactions securely. Surely, rewards are not the source of Mastercard's and Visa's economic moat.Lastly, it seems the Indian government might have a model to replace the current credit card architecture already. As recently as the last month, the CEO of the government's policy think tank talked about making card systems obsolete.I think there is a ""see it to believe it"" element to the design of the payment architecture. I was skeptical initially but after completing a transaction through UPI, I was astounded. UPI simply seemed revolutionary. You don't have to believe me though.In a recent interview, Michael Corbat, the chief executive of Citigroup (C), made a few comments that should alarm any Mastercard and Visa investor. I have quoted him below:Corbat with Citi's strong presence in China must have seen and marveled at how even the rare beggars don't accept cash in Beijing. They have QR codes hanging around their neck to accept digital donations. Talk about 21st century begging!Don't want to believe him either? You can hear it directly from the horse's mouth:The critics with the credit card argument are right if one assumes the present as static. But we live in a highly disruptive world, don't we? Such assumptions could therefore be disastrous for your portfolio.Lastly, note that this is a long-term thesis in a market that is fluid with potentially many players. Change happens slowly at first and suddenly after. The effects of these developments won't show up in the next quarter if you are looking to make a quick buck by shorting the stocks. But when it does it might be too late to change course. The key takeaway for investors, therefore, is that creating a position on either companies under current valuations might underestimate the risk element while solely looking for hard-to-come rewards.If you find the article interesting, kindly follow me to be updated about my latest insights."

The Street is bidding the name up to a point where we have a double since our first buy call.We discuss performance relative to our more bullish projections and highlight key trends to be aware of. But we must keep a close watch on expenses weighing down margins.In light of the trajectory we have seen in new card issuance, gross dollar volumes, transaction volume, and tax reform, we offer our continued bullish projections for 2018.","Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is out with earnings and the Street is bidding up the name once again. Make no mistake, the name is priced for continued near-perfect performance of the underlying company. We say this because the Street has essentially baked into share prices continued beats against consensus estimates, growing volumes, well managed expenses and double-digit growth in earnings. This is evidenced by its multiple being well over 40 times trailing earnings. Right now, the stock is at a 52-week high, again, and Mastercard is up about to hit a double from where we recommended it at $90 a share. With the exceptional growth the name is showing, the valuation has been justified. The question is, can this run continue? In this column, we examine trends in sales and earnings and discuss our expectations looking ahead. With tax reform now a reality, we also offer our 2018 projections.The just reported quarter saw another impressive top line, with solid increases in fourth quarter revenues over the past three years:Source: SEC filingsThis figure suggests once again the company delivered a strong report, and revenues were indeed stellar. The results strongly suggest that the company will continue its stable and reliable growth.Net revenue for the quarter came in at $3.3 billion, an 18% increase over Q4 2016. This is a strong result and surpassed our expectations for $3.18 billion. This was primarily due to better than expected performance in gross dollar volume and a large increase in processed transactions. Mastercard saw a 13% jump in gross dollar volume, surpassing our expectations for 10% growth, and saw a 17% increase in transactions to approximately 17.7 billion. The transaction growth really continues to impress: Source: SEC filingsNot only is this growth above our expectations, it is simply impressive for a long-standing company like MasterCard. Further, it helps justify why the Street is bidding up the name. The company is executing to near perfection. So, once again revenues were up nicely on the back of transactions increasing. This is a sigh of strength, but we have to question whether expenses rose in tandem with this increased activity, thereby pressuring marginsIf there is one area of weakness that we can pinpoint it is that operational expenses do continue to rise rather sharply, right in line with rising revenues. Expenses grew year-over-year vs. last year by 17% on a currency neutral basis, continuing a run of higher expenses the last few fourth quarters:Source: SEC filings While we hate to see rising expenses, given that revenues were up almost 17%, it is acceptable. That is, we can absorb the rise in expenses and still see a bump in earnings. It is worth noting that a large chunk of this increase (8%) was from the acquisition activity, most notably, Vocalink.Total operating expenses were $1.8 billion for several reasons including primarily spending related to strategic initiatives, as well as higher promotional spending and of course acquisition-related integration expenses. When we factor in the increase in revenues, as well as the increase in expenses, we still see that it led to operating income increasing 12% as reported. However, we did mention the expenses as a source of weakness. Because they rose, even in what we view as an acceptable amount, operating margins declined to 46% from 49.4%:Source: SEC filingsWhile this margin hit weighs somewhat, earnings per share continues to impress.While expenses continue to rise, they are justified by the pace of revenue growth, which was impressive, even if they weighed a bit on margins. When we factor in the billions of shares repurchased over the years, in addition to the growing top line, we have seen a nice bump in earnings per share: Source: SEC FilingsFor the last three years, the company has been expanding its bottom line. This quarter has a bit of an issue with making provisions for the tax reform change, so on a GAAP basis net income was only $200 million, or $0.20 per share, thanks to an 85% effective tax rate. When we adjust for this and other items, we see that the more comparable adjusted net income came in at $1.2 billion, up 28% from last year's $0.9 billion.That is truly impressive - a 28% gain in net income. But wait, there’s more. While net income was up 28%, earnings per share were 1.14, rising 33% over last year's $0.86. This figure surpassed our estimates of $1.11 per share in earnings, mostly on the back of the higher than expected revenues, but the company also repurchased $1 billion worth of stock (6.9 million shares). With this established growth and the new tax reform law, we expect a strong 2018.Factoring in the trajectory of MasterCard’s performance, and specifically based on the trends in new cards being issued, transaction volume, and gross dollar volumes, we see 2018 revenue coming in at $13.5 billion to $14.1 billion. Assuming expenses come in on par with revenue growth, and considering a lower effective tax rate, we further see earnings approximating $5.50 to $5.75.The company exceeded our expectations once again and we really can't see anything other than a broader market sell-off hitting shares. We now have almost a double since our buy call, so we do think it best to book some profits. But make no mistake, we remain bullish. If our projections are correct, and the multiple is maintained around 35-40 times earnings, shares could then grow to well over $220 per share by this time next year, using the midpoint of our expectations. This of course assumes the bull market continues and the Street assigns a premium rating to shares, which it has done over the last few years. All things considered, we believe MasterCard serves a place in any moderately aggressive growth portfolio.Quad 7 Capital has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012.

4130198,103321,2017-12-06T16:31:46-05:00,MasterCard reported 18% revenue growth and 24% EPS growth year-over-year.The firm continues to enjoy favorable tailwind as the world transitions from cash towards cards and digital transactions.MasterCard just announced a 14% dividend increase with a renewed $4 billion share repurchase plan.The firm's current PE ratio is significantly higher than its 5 year average PE ratio.,"Shares of MasterCard Inc. (MA) have appreciated about 40% year-to-date, and about 200% in the past 5 years. However, its shares have pulled back nearly 7%. Investors may be asking whether this is the right time to add more shares to their portfolio. In this article, I will discuss MasterCard’s latest quarterly result, its future prospects and its valuation to see whether it is a good time to invest.MA data by YChartsIn the third quarter, MasterCard’s revenue grew by 18% to about $3.4 billion. This was much better than its 2016 annual growth rate of 11.4%. MasterCard's revenue growth rate appears to be accelerating. Its net income of $1.4 billion in the third quarter was also impressive increasing by 21% year over year. Its diluted EPS of $1.34 per share was a growth of 24% year over year.Third Quarter Selected Financial Highlights (Source: Company Presentation)There are several trends that I'd like to point out in the third quarter. First, its operating margin declined by 90 basis points to 57.1% due to higher operating expense growth than its revenue growth. This near-term weakness was likely due to its recent VocaLink acquisition (see subsection below), but I will want to continue to keep an eye on it. Second, growth rate in rebates and incentives of about 20% is higher than the total revenue growth of 18% as shown in the chart below. This was due to higher upfront payments from renegotiated partner agreements. Despite the fact that many of these agreements are long-term agreements, we still want to continue to observe this category.Third Quarter Selected Financial Highlights (Source: Company Presentation)Now I'd like to briefly discuss MasterCard’s recent acquisition. The firm acquired VocaLink in April 2017 in order to expand to bank account-based payments. While the acquisition helped open a new door for MasterCard to grow its revenue as a large portion of electronic payment is done through bank-to-bank, the acquisition is expected to be dilutive (about $0.05 to $0.06 per share) in fiscal 2017 as management noted. In its past quarter, VocalLink acquisition contributed about 2.5% to the revenue growth but added 8% to its expense growth.I like MasterCard (and also Visa (V)) because both companies enjoy strong network effects. Together, both companies account for over 80% of the world’s card transactions. MasterCard’s 2.4 billion total cards issued and its millions of merchants create a network that is not easily replicable. As the number of cards issued and participating merchants continue to increase, its moat becomes wider and wider. The network essentially acts as a tollbooth as MasterCard will receive a small portion of revenue from each transaction.Data Source: Company ReportsBesides having a strong network as its moat, MasterCard should continue to benefit from the continual transition from cash transactions towards digital and plastic transactions. At the moment, cash transactions still comprise about 85% of the world’s total transactions. As the trend towards digital/mobile/plastic transactions continue, MasterCard’s top and bottom lines are expected to continue to grow.In its past quarterly dividend payment, MasterCard pays a dividend of $0.22 per share. The firm has just announced that its February 2018 dividend payment will be increased to $0.25 per share, or an increase of 14%. MasterCard’s dividend yield after the increase will be 0.69%. While MasterCard’s yield of 0.69% is not attractive, the firm has a good track record of dividend increases, increasing its dividend by double digits every year since 2012.MA Dividend data by YChartsIn addition to dividend hikes, MasterCard also announced a new share repurchase program of $4 billion. This would be about 27 million shares repurchased if purchased at today’s price of $145.13. If all of the authorized cash is used in the next year, this would reduce MasterCard’s shares outstanding by 2.5%. The buyback would help increase its EPS, and help support its current share price. I continue to see MasterCard’s share repurchases favorably. However, I have also noted that MasterCard’s financial leverage continues to increase.MasterCard currently trades at a PE ratio of 33.4x as shown in the table below. Its current PE ratio is significantly higher than its 5-year PE average ratio of 28.7x. Although significantly higher, MasterCard’s higher PE ratio is warranted if it can continue to accelerate its EPS growth rate. The consensus for MasterCard’s fiscal 2017 and 2018 EPS are $4.57 per share and $5.36 per share respectively. At today’s price of $145.13, the forward PE ratio would be 27.1x, which is 1.6x below its 5-year average PE ratio. Overall, I see MasterCard’s valuation as fair especially after the recent correction.Source: Created by author, MorningStar.ComMasterCard’s share valuation appears to be fair after factoring in its EPS growth next year and the recent share pullback. However, it is not cheap. Given its long-term growth prospect, it may be worth the risks for investors who plan to invest for the long term. However, investors may wish to buy a small position first and average down on any further pullbacks as the market appears to be a little bit more volatile lately. For investors desiring a higher margin of safety, they may want to wait for further pullback of its share price before initiating a position.Note: This is not financial advice and that all financial investments carry risks. Investors are expected to seek financial advice from professionals before making any investment.Thank you for reading.

The modus operandi of India, though, is far more sophisticated than the Chinese, and I doubt if legitimate concerns on competition can be raised regarding its methods at the WTO.The plan wasn't really obvious from the beginning, and it was modified to a large degree but the Indian government moved fast, and it moved smart. Under a financial inclusion scheme which mandated every household have a bank account, the Indian government managed to achieve 307.1 million bank account openings since 2014. (In hindsight, these moves were probably undertaken to get a grip on data for taxation.) But in a subversion of competition, all of these accounts were linked with the government-owned Rupay payments system.Ari Sarker, the co-president of Mastercard in the APAC region had this to say about this move then.- Visa Annual Report 2016 and 2017.Despite a 42% share of cards, Rupay only had a 16% share at the PoS earlier this year. The smaller ticket sizes and fewer number of transactions indicated Rupay was finding it difficult to gain acceptability among the relatively more affluent Indians. Additionally, as Mastercard and Visa sign long-term contracts with banks, they were so far insulated from their existing client base opting for Rupay.Fast forward to 2017 and NPCI, the state-owned firm that made the Rupay cards, has unleashed another trick that has found out card companies for the lack of innovation. The NPCI launched a payment stack called the UPI which is now being called as the world's most advanced payment system. It bypasses financial intermediaries like Visa and eliminates the need for a plastic card, reducing the payments rubric to its barest bones and that too without compromising security.For a detailed read on UPI, readers can check out this blog by Wharton Fintech on Medium. But here, I am going to explain the process of transaction without jargons and with an example.Imagine I have a bank account with Development Bank of Singapore, and I operate an adidas (OTCQX:ADDDF) store in India. To conduct transactions under the UPI framework, I set up a unique identifier - ""siddharthadidas@dbs"". All a customer has to do to transact in my store is to enter the amount and my unique identifier followed by a pin he/she has set on his/her phone. The transaction is completed instantly and the customer can take his/her gear and walk out of the store.Convenience pays and no wonder UPI transactions in India are gaining ground month after month.Convenience is king today and systems that eliminate pain points in a process have and will trounce systems that don't. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Pay is a decent example although it does rely on intermediaries like Amex (AXP), Mastercard, and Visa. The Amazon Pay wallet was launched with the intention of reducing time taken to complete a transaction within the Amazon ecosystem, and it does that quite well.Payments architectureUPI architectureSource: medium.comThe UPI gained acceptability because consumers found that they only needed a unique id to complete a transaction and nothing else. Keying in card details easily takes more time. Now, both Mastercard and Visa are requesting access to this payment architecture which seems absolutely absurd. Imagine Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) requesting access to Amazon's ecosystem. The NPCI is by all means a competitor, and unless the government is either bullied which might be a stretch under the current dispensation, I don't see how the payment giants can pull this one off.- Visa Q2 2017 EarningsAt present, the two companies generate around $900 million in revenues from the country. But a far bigger piece of the pie lies ahead. Only 5% of the nation is cashless and as a key economy going cashless, they stand to lose a lucrative business opportunity. A government official recently stated they see ATMs and cards becoming obsolete once the payment stack percolates to the last man standing. Therefore unless these card giants can find a way to ebb the tide of movement to mobile payment systems, Mastercard and Visa realize they will be toast in India. Lastly, they don't want an example being set to banks in other countries.In a way the Indian experience seems like a replica of the way Alipay (BABA) and WeChat are trouncing and creating pressure on China Union Pay. The UPI architecture although more advanced than QR code based systems used for P2P transactions, is based on the same tenet of eliminating payment processing intermediaries. India may not constitute a major market in terms of revenues today. But banks and merchants world over are trying to reduce costs without compromising security. Due to the globalization of tech ecosystems, any system that calls into question the status of Mastercard and Visa as the tollbooth on financial transaction is likely to be a major source of risk for the long thesis going forward.If you find the article interesting, kindly follow me to be updated about my latest insights."
4148304,65113,2018-02-20T10:21:41-05:00,"Mastercard has continued to see significant growth in gross dollar transaction volumes.This has happened even in spite of new European regulations which threatened to put revenues under pressure.This company has continued to excel in terms of earnings growth.While the stock is expensive, it is still a buy.","My last article on Mastercard (MA) gave a positive verdict on the company based on growth in gross dollar transaction volumes. I predicted that the stock would continue to see further highs, and it has done – up to $175.65 at the time of writing:When I last analysed this company, GDV (or gross dollar volume) for Europe as reported and adjusted for article 8 (an EU regulation which states that a transaction provider cannot charge fees on payments that do not use their own payment brand) grew by 5% and 15% respectively for Q2 2017. Note that gross dollar volume growth in this context refers to fees that are charged by the company on activities that are carried out on its cards. Given that this accounts for over half of the company's total revenues, it is an important metric. Since then, we can see that GDV for Europe as reported saw growth of 16% (17% as adjusted for article 8):Source: Mastercard Incorporated: Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Results Conference CallTherefore, while there was initially concern that European regulations would lower gross dollar transaction volumes, we can clearly see that this is not the case. It is also notable that 4Q17 Gross Dollar Volume growth is up 13% worldwide on an adjusted basis compared with the same period last year:Source: Mastercard Incorporated: Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Results Conference CallMoreover, diluted EPS is up by 33% to $1.14 per share, with a 17% rise in total operating expenses on a non-GAAP basis being outweighed by a 20% increase in net revenue:Source: Mastercard Incorporated: Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Results Conference CallIn this regard, we can clearly see that this company is continuing to perform strongly. Particular drivers of the growth in EPS have included:Now, when we take a look at earnings and free cash flow metrics, Mastercard is clearly expensive. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t buy it.We see that while the P/E ratio for Mastercard has been rising in the past five years, diluted EPS on the whole has also seen a rising trend:Additionally, I previously stated that free cash flow is not necessarily a good metric to value this company by, since investors are buying Mastercard for growth, not income. However, growing levels of free cash flow is always a good thing. Why? Because it means that the company is able to set aside more cash without seeing a decline in growth – it is often the case that many companies have to reinvest all their earnings simply to continue generating growth.As a financial health measure, Mastercard’s growth in free cash flow gives cause for much optimism.From a balance sheet perspective, Mastercard's debt levels have been going up in recent years, which is the one reservation I would have about the company. We see that the company's debt to equity ratio is on the rise, while the company's long-term debt has also been rising:Source: YChartsSource: Mastercard Earnings Release - Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial ResultsA significant reason for the rise in debt has been a higher interest expense related to the company's debt issuance in November 2016. Therefore, I would pay attention to this metric as a rise in debt/equity significantly above competitors such as Visa (V) and PayPal Holdings (PYPL) could lead investors to choose these stocks as alternatives for exposure to this industry. While this is my only reservation on this stock, it is not of particularly great concern at this time.Mastercard continues to be a great company. It is worth buying even at this price, as the stock continues to have great growth prospects. Mastercard may not be cheap but paying a premium for a quality stock is always worth it."
4127477,41961,2017-11-24T10:39:24-05:00,MasterCard is my single largest position in my US growth portfolio.The stock has been on a tear in 2017.I've been resisting the itch to trim this holding a little.,"I have had a great, long-term association with MasterCard (MA), largely since the IPO. While I was in and out of MasterCard over the first few years after the IPO, I've just been steadfastly in, and occasionally nibbling more since early 2012. The result of this is that I've wracked up nice capital gains in MasterCard, to go alongside my modest initial capital investment. The result is that it's my largest individual holding in my ""growth portfolio"" to the tune of almost ~$50k. Likely of little surprise is that my holding in Visa (V) is just a shade behind.Recently, I've been growing a little restless about my MA position. However, my restlessness isn't for any of the reasons that you may think.Credit card networks have huge moats. It's not an easy task to set up a network, what with needing to have banks issue the cards, consumers to use the cards, and merchants to accept the cards. The network effects are significant and not easy to replicate. To be successful in removing incumbents in a payments ecosystem requires immense consumer awareness, significant scale, significant capital and a great deal of sophistication in risk management.There are very few players that can say they have that combination of skills. Sure, there's been a lot of noise about new payment systems, bitcoin, litecoin, other cryptocurrencies. All of these currencies are built on some undeniably good technology, however the dirty secret here is that unless you have a for-profit entity that has a motivation to align a buyer and seller ecosystem, these alternatives will never be real challengers in creating a broad-based, universally accepted payment paradigm.Growth opportunities abound for MasterCard. As a society, we are putting more and more of our spend on credit cards. Cash is marked for extinction. Check usage has largely conceded defeat. In international markets, increasing per capita discretionary income is leading the trend toward increasing spend by users in international markets on credit cards.Credit cards are being accepted by merchants who previously hadn't accepted them. This is thanks to the lower costs of Point of Sale terminals, such as those distributed by Square. The result is that accepting credit card payments is now cheaper for many smaller merchants, all of which will contribute additional payment volume for MasterCard.MasterCard also has been taking steps to introduce new services. The company's efforts in pioneering new tokenization services has been moving at pace. This will be a new set of services marketed toward merchants which should help prevent credit card data theft.A combination of the superior structural and business performance of MasterCard plus a raging bull market in growth stocks has seen MasterCard on a flier in 2017, with the stock up almost 45% in 2017. After having done very little in 2016 MasterCard has made up for a subpar performance, and then some.In my view, this has left the company's valuation a little on the expensive side. MasterCard trades at almost 29x forward earnings. This is not ridiculously overpriced, but it's certainly a hefty premium over the 21-22x forward earnings at which it traded in early 2016.All of this has left me with a bit of an itch to trim some of my MasterCard position. Having run up so far in 2017, it's highly likely there will be some trimming of gains in 2018. While the MasterCard business is in rude health, its valuation isn't. Frankly, it appears a little bloated currently.However this itch to trim my MasterCard position is one that I'm refusing to scratch for now. The previously couple of times where I divested some MasterCard stock while thinking the business had run up too hard ended up costing me thousands of dollars over the long haul. That provides a very powerful disincentive to the psychological desire to take some profits in a stock that is showing some signs of sluggishness.The other issue that's holding me back from any position trimming is a quality problem. I only invest in high quality. And MasterCard is the highest benchmark in my portfolio of high quality names which includes things like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Alibaba (BABA), etc. I just wouldn't be able to redeploy the proceeds in another business of equivalent high quality at a valuation that makes sense.For now, I'm just content to sit on the position that I have in this name, in the vain hope that I get a chance to have another crack at MA in the $115-$120 range, the area at which I last bought MasterCard stock. If there's any sort of correction next year, I'll likely sell some puts to be a willing buyer at this price range. I wouldn't mind increasing my position size by another one third, but likely no more than that.Till that time, I'll just have to ignore the itchy trigger finger hovering over that sell button and pay no heed to the increasingly stretched valuation of this great business."
4120008,21151,2017-11-03T03:34:53-04:00,The movement from cash to card transaction continues to grow.There is a unique opportunity to benefit from this naturally growing business.MasterCard will continue to grow both revenues and earnings with double-digit rates.,"MasterCard (NYSE:MA) is the second-largest processor of transactions in the world, with a 29% market share (Nilson Report) behind its main competitor Visa (V) with 44% of market share. This doesn’t leave much room for competition in such a lucrative market. Think of MA's business like a tollbooth. Everybody uses the highway and they all pay their passage. It’s the same thing with MasterCard and Visa.The beauty of their business model is the strength of their brand and their network. When you pull out your card out of your wallet, you certainly don’t want the cashier giving you the “do-you-think-we-take-this-card-dude?” face. For this reason, you will use either a Visa or a MasterCard… or both!I am looking to add more positions in my pension portfolio while focusing on dividend growth stocks. Will MasterCard make the cut?Source: YChartsMasterCard recently reported revenue growth of 18% for its latest quarter. MA benefits from several growth vectors. I’d say it is lucky to evolve in an environment that will continue growing naturally in the upcoming years. What is better than a company in a growing playground and limited players?For years, consumer staples enjoyed a strong and steady growth coming from emerging markets. Now it’s time for transaction processors to enjoy a similar phenomenon. In general, the whole population is leaving cash transaction to use cards and other means of digital payments. This is also true for emerging markets as the middle class is growing and wants to spend their hard-earned money.MasterCard also focuses on fast and secure automated clearing house (ACH) revenue. ACH services enables merchants to collect customers directly through their bank account for one-time and recurring payments.Source: MA investor presentationSource: YChartsLike revenue growth, EPS is reaching up to the sky. During its latest quarterly report, MA posted EPS growth of 25%. To use my tollbooth analogy, once the highway is in place and the tollbooths are collecting, profit increases naturally as more and more people use this route.When you think of MasterCard, you think of a company focusing on growth and diversification. Management has a strong plan in place and all parts aims at digital payment services. The company expects 17% of transactions will be done online by 2021.Source: MA investor presentationWhen you think of MasterCard, you don’t automatically think about dividend. I can’t blame you; MA yield is merely a non-existent 0.60%. However, the company shows an important distribution growth potential in the upcoming years and it could make a great candidate for the Dividend Achievers list one day.The Dividend Achievers Index refers to all public companies that have successfully increased their dividend payments for at least ten consecutive years. At the time of writing this article, there were 265 companies that achieved this milestone. You can get the complete list of Dividend Achievers with comprehensive metrics here.Source: YChartsMA currently shows 6 consecutive years with a dividend increase. Most importantly, it shows a 49% CAGR over the past 5 years. The dividend grew by 633% and the stock surged by 186% over the same period. This starts to be interesting.Source: YChartsWith a low payout and cash payout ratio, you can expect dividend to continue growing rapidly. I don’t think a 50% raise is possible, but something in the range of 15%-20% for the next decade is totally reasonable. Management knows both its revenue and earnings will grow in the double-digit range for several years. Pressure for additional dividend payments will be made by investors. MA meets my 7 dividend growth investing principles.While both companies (V and MA) are evolving in a growing market, there is always the possibility of having a new competitor entering the transaction playground and reset the rules. Imagine if a company like Amazon (AMZN), which seems to hit all sectors these days, decides to offer its own payment method on its site. In the techno sector, we are always one month away of a new breakout.So far, this possibility doesn’t seem like a material threat. Most potential competitors like PayPal (PYPL) preferred to work with both major card manufacturers than enter in an infinite war with them.MA jumped nearly 40% on the stock market since the beginning of the year (as at November 1st). Is there still room for growth or do you wait for a pullback? We can definitely talk about a case of P/E expansion here:Source: YChartsThe current valuation makes me skeptical about its potential. Let’s take a look at the Dividend Discount Model.Please read the Dividend Discount Model limitations to fully understand my calculations.MasterCard seems like a victim of its success. As the P/E is clearly expanding, the DDM doesn’t find any value at the current price.I wish the valuation section wouldn’t put my idea of purchasing shares of MA on the shelf, but there is not much I can do right now. The company shows a strong business case, but investors are already in the over-hyped wagon. Upon further analysis, I decided to buy Visa on Halloween. Subscribers to Dividend Growth Rocks received my Visa analysis and my trade alert.

4110051,65113,2017-09-27T16:23:24-04:00,"MasterCard continued to increase dollar volumes in Q2.Judging this company based on valuation is erroneous - it is growing significantly and waiting for a ""pullback"" is likely to prove futile.I take a positive view on this company.","Back in July, my verdict on MasterCard (MA) was that while the company is ultimately a good play, the current price might be overly expensive and a target price of $100-110 is more reasonable. In spite of my prediction, we have seen MasterCard continue to climb from $130 to $138.37 at the time of writing:The more I analyse stocks, the more I have come to realise that there are some companies which will never ""trade"" at the right price.If a company is strong and set to grow further, it will always be expensive. MasterCard is certainly one of those companies.My last article used a discounted free cash flow model to determine that, assuming a 10-20% year-on-year growth in free cash flow, MasterCard's target price lies as low as $97 assuming 10% growth, and $151 using 20% growth.Source: Author's CalculationsGoing strictly on this model, one could make the assumption that an investor may be paying too much per dollar for free cash flow per share at this time. However, the majority of readers disagreed with my last article in this regard, and in hindsight I think they have a point.Admittedly, it was erroneous of me to attempt to value this company using free cash flow. Currently, the firm's dividend yield is 0.64%, the payout ratio is 19.9%, and dividends have grown consecutively since 2012.This would hardly meet the definition of a ""dividend aristocrat"" - buyers into this stock are not buying it for its dividends - they are buying it for growth.In fact, too much free cash flow would be a bad thing for this company - ""free"" means that MasterCard would not be investing the extra funds back into the business to facilitate growth.In terms of growth for this company, I had previously expressed a degree of concern that revenue for the first quarter had come in lower than expected, and that European regulations prohibiting charging of transaction fees for payments that do not originate from the MasterCard network could weigh in on volumes.However, when we look at the second quarter, we see that gross dollar volume for the company has risen, both for Europe and worldwide:Source: MasterCard Second-Quarter 2017 Financial Results PresentationMoreover, adjusted earnings per share for Q2 beat analyst expectations at $1.10 compared to a prior expectation of $1.04. This was in spite of adjusted operating expenses increasing by 16% year-on-year to $1.4 billion.In this regard, the second quarter has illustrated that MasterCard is continuing to grow nicely and prior concerns about volume are unwarranted.To conclude, MasterCard is one of those companies that do not apply to a value-oriented mindset. There are times where you want to get your hands on a good stock, you have to pay to play. MasterCard is one of those stocks."
4118725,92586,2017-10-31T14:54:08-04:00,"MasterCard followed suit and delivered a solid quarter, after peers Visa and PayPal had stolen the spotlight in the past couple of weeks.The main operational metrics that fuel the top line looked healthy, and op margin contraction does not worry me.MA is one of the few richly valued stocks that looks like a compelling buy to me, even at current levels.","The payment processing space delivered yet another bullish sign this morning.After PayPal (PYPL) and Visa (V) stole the show with pristine results in the past couple of weeks, it was MasterCard's (MA) turn to shine. The company reported 3Q17 results that topped Street's expectations by a good margin, despite the stock having gained little traction during the trading session today.Revenues of $3.4 billion represented a YOY increase of over +18% that was the highest growth rate as far back as I can track - even after accounting for the 250-bp inorganic boost. The main operational metrics that fuel the top line looked healthy, with GDV (gross dollar volume) up +11% YOY on USD terms on the back of mid-teen growth outside the United States. Transaction volume was up 16%, and both of MasterCard's key indicators topped Visa's (V) already impressive numbers reported last week.Image Credit: pymnts.comIn terms of profitability and unlike peer Visa, MasterCard saw operating margins shrink YOY. Although profitability headwinds were expected as a result of the May 2017 acquisition of VocaLink, a company that carries lower margins, the 380-bp deterioration compared to last quarter's comps caught me a bit by surprise. However, I believe proper management of the expenses absorbed with the acquisition can lead to improved margins in the longer term and eventually drive bottom-line upside from operating leverage. Considering the robust top-line growth and MasterCard's opportunities to further gain scale, my estimated two cents in YOY EPS headwinds caused by deteriorating margins this quarter do not concern me.See summarized P&L below, with the impact to EPS of each major line item.Source: D.M. Martins Research, using data from company reportsElsewhere on the P&L, the lapping of a 2016 impairment charge and a favorable geographic mix that led to better effective tax rate helped to propel EPS up vs. last year. Although these items are generally considered of lower quality in measuring earnings improvement over time, I believe MasterCard's business continues to look very solid in general.My thoughts on Mastercard stockI have recently expressed my appreciation for the payment processing companies, including not only the two largest players but also able incumbents like PayPal. In fact, I even labeled peer V ""better than an ultra-growth stock"" given its high historical returns coupled with low volatility through bear and bull markets (see table below). In my view, MA shares more similarities than differences with its key competitor.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from Yahoo FinanceIn my view, MasterCard is equally exposed to the same macro trends that seem to be lifting all boats in the sector: the transition to plastic and electronic payments, growth in e-commerce, pickup in peer-to-peer and other ""alternative"" transaction forms, resilient economic activity, to name a few.MA PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsWith MA's valuations comparable to V's (the difference between the multiples above can be largely attributed to Visa's reflecting fiscal 2018 estimates), I see both stocks with about equal chances of pleasing long-term investors - and I believe those chances are high. MasterCard is one of the few stocks that, despite valuations sitting above 30x on a forward earnings basis and the share price run of over +40% YTD, looks like a compelling buy to me even at current levels.Note from the author: If you have enjoyed this article and would like to receive real-time alerts on future ones, please follow D.M.

4118752,33291,2017-10-31T15:30:40-04:00,MasterCard is out with earnings this morning and the Street is barely reacting after another beat against consensus opinion.We discuss performance relative to our more bullish projections and highlight key trends to be aware of.We offer our projections for 2017 and 2018.Where the stock could go if our projections are spot on.Our one complaint about the stock is its dividend.,"MasterCard (NYSE:MA) is out with earnings this morning and the Street is barely reacting. This is because the Street has essentially baked into share prices continued beats against consensus estimates, with its multiple approaching 40 times trailing earnings. Right now, the stock is at 52-week high, again, though pulling back as we write. MasterCard is up about 66% from where we recommended it at $90 a share. With the exceptional growth the name is showing, the valuation has been justified. The question is, can this run continue? In this column, we examine trends in sales and earnings and discuss our expectations looking ahead.The just reported quarter saw another impressive top line, with solid increases over the past three years:Figure 1. MasterCard Third Quarter Earnings Over The Last Three Years.Source: SEC FilingsWell, once again the company delivered a strong report, and revenues were stellar. The results indicate that the company will continue its stable and reliable growth. Net revenue for the quarter came in at $3.4 billion, an 18% increase over Q3 2016. This was primarily due to a 10% jump in gross dollar volume and a 17% increase in transactions to approximately 16.9 billion. Transaction growth continues:Figure 2. MasterCard Third Quarter Transactions Over The Last Three Years.Source: SEC FilingsThis growth is pretty sizable for a long-standing company like MasterCard. So, once again revenues were up nicely on the back of transactions increasing. What is most impressive for us is that our expectations were surpassed on the top line. We were looking for $3.3 billion, or a 13.7% gain over last year. Because gross dollar volumes were well above our 7-8% projections, revenues surpassed what we were looking for. This is a sigh of strength, but we have to question whether expenses rose offsetting this positive sign.Operational expenses do continue to rise. Expenses grew year-over-year versus last year by 20%, but if we adjust for a 1% hit from currency related issues, we see that expenses were up 19% on an adjusted basis:Figure 3. MasterCard Third Quarter Currency Neutral Expenses Over The Last Three Years.Source: SEC FilingsWhile we hate to see rising expenses, given that revenues were up almost 18%, it is acceptable. That is, we can absorb the rise in expenses and still see a bump in earnings. It is worth noting that a large chunk of this increase (8%) was from the Vocalink acquisition. Total operating expenses were $1.5 billion for several reasons including primarily spending related to strategic initiatives, as well as higher promotional spending and of course acquisition related integration expenses. All of this led to operating income increasing 14% as reported. Operating margins were a strong 57.1%, while earnings per share continues to impress.While expenses continue to rise, they are justified by the pace of revenue growth, which was impressive. When we factor in the billions of shares repurchased over the years, in addition to the growing top line, we have seen a nice bump in earnings per share:Figure 4. MasterCard Third Quarter Earnings Over The Last Three Years.Source: SEC FilingsFor the last three years, the company has been expanding its bottom line. Net income came in at $1.4 billion, up 20% from last year's $1.2 billion on an adjusted basis. Further, earnings per share were 1.34, rising 24% over last year's $1.08. This figure surpassed our estimates of $1.21 per share in earnings, mostly on the back of the higher than expected revenues, but the company also repurchased $838 million worth of stock (6.4 million shares). With our estimates surpassed, we now expect the entire year to see a boost, barring Q4 catastrophe.Factoring in the year-to-date performance and the better than expected results versus our estimates, we believe revenue will now approximate $12.3 billion to $12.5 billion. This is up from our prior expectations of $12.1 to $12.4 billion. In addition, thanks to continued strong margins and bottom line outperformance, we are raising estimates for the bottom line for 2017. We now see earnings coming in at $4.53 to $$4.70 per share, up from our prior expectations of $4.39-$4.60. We also feel strongly about 2018 being substantially better thanks to continued momentum. At this juncture, based on the trends in new card issuances, transaction volume, and 2017 performance, our initial expectation for 2018 revenue is $13.5 billion to $14.1 billion. We further see earnings approximating $5.15 to $5.50.The company exceeded our expectations in Q3, which were more bullish than most analysts, and this is a major sign of strength. We really can't see anything other than a broader market sell-off hitting shares. However, we have a 66% gain in shares here. It would be prudent to take SOMETHING off the table, and redeploy elsewhere or hold onto some cash, while letting the rest run. If our projections are correct, and the multiple is maintained around 35-40 times earnings, shares could then grow to $180 to $200 per share by this time next year, using the lower end of our 2018 expectations. This of course assumes the bull market continues and the Street assigns a premium rating to shares, which it has done over the last few years.Finally we will always reiterate that our only problem with the company is its weak dividend. The company now pays an $0.88 annual dividend, $0.22 quarterly. This only translates to a 0.59% yield. While a dividend is shareholder-friendly, its low right now, in part due to the growth of the stock, but we do expect this dividend to grow in the coming years. All things considered, we believe MasterCard serves a place in any moderately aggressive growth portfolio.Quad 7 Capital has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012.

4101866,102764,2017-08-25T07:48:58-04:00,Backtested data shows that companies with above-average profitability tend to outperform the market.Measuring a company's profitability levels is not enough. You need to understand the main drivers behind those profitability levels.Competitive advantages and an attractive business model should mean big and even growing profitability for MasterCard in the years ahead.,"At the end of the day, a stock is simply a share in the ownership of a company. The more profitable the company, the more value it can create over time, so companies with above-average profitability tend to deliver superior returns for investors over the long term.However, investing in quality stocks is about much more than buying companies with high profitability ratios. Elevated profitability attracts the competition, if the company is not strong enough to protect its markets and profits, then chances are that profitability levels will be eroded by the competition over time.For this reason, it’s important to understand the main drivers behind the company's profitability levels in order to invest in businesses that can generate big and sustainable profitability over the long term.The following screen using data from Portfolio123 invests in a basket of 25 companies based on a combination of profitability ratios. The system includes indicators based on return on capital, such as return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE), and it also considers profit margins on sales, as expressed by ratios such as operating profit margin and free cash flow margin. Importantly, profitability indicators are not only evaluated on an absolute basis, but also in comparison to industry standards.Over the past ten years, a monthly-rebalanced and equal-weighted portfolio of the 25 best companies based on their profitability levels produced a cumulative total return of 1376.8%, far surpassing the 98.3% return delivered by the S&P 500 in the same period. On an annual return basis, the screener made 15.54% per year versus 3.76% for the S&P 500.As always, the full list of companies currently included in the screener will be exclusively available to subscribers in my research service: The Data Driven Investor.Among the companies included in the list, MasterCard (MA) is particularly interesting candidate to consider. The card processor generates stratospheric profitability levels, and it has delivered spectacular gains for investors over the years.The following chart compares MasterCard versus the average company in the industry based on indicators such as operating margin, net margin, return on assets, and return on equity. All the indicators are clearly pointing in the same direction.Unsurprisingly, this tremendous profitability at the company level has been reflected on impressive returns for investors in MasterCard stock. MasterCard has delivered a cumulative return of 834% in the last decade, downright obliterating the S&P 500 and its cumulative return of 66.7% in the same period.MA data by YChartsSecond only to Visa (V), MasterCard is one of the most powerful and globally recognized brands in the payments industry, a business in which trust is a key strategic advantage. Even better, the network effect means that the company is getting both bigger and stronger over time, which creates a virtuous cycle of growth and increased competitive advantages for MasterCard.Merchants need to accept the debit and credit cards that can bring more customers to the store, and customers want to own the cards that are accepted everywhere. The bigger the size of the network, the more valuable the service to parties on both sides of a transaction, so customers and merchants attract each other to the leading card companies like MasterCard and Visa.The most recent earnings report from MasterCard confirms that the business keeps firing on all cylinders as of the second quarter of 2017, as the company produced both record earnings and profits during the period. Total revenue reached $3.1 billion, growing 13% year-over-year. Earnings per share amounted to $1.1, a vigorous increase of 24% versus the second quarter in 2016.Operating margin during the second quarter of 2017 amounted to 54.1% of revenue, an increase of nearly 2.9% versus the second quarter in 2016. Rising profitability last quarter was by no means a rarity for MasterCard, as the company's business model allows for expanding margins over time.A considerable share of MasterCard’s cost base is related to the infrastructure necessary to process payment transactions, so cost are more stable than revenue, and profit margins tend to rise as revenue increases. When looking for companies with big and sustainable profitability, MasterCard’s business model is exceptionally attractive.The secular growth story in management is barely getting started. According to management, more than 80% of all payment transactions around the world are still being made in cash. This means that MasterCard enjoys abundant room for expansion over the years and even decades ahead.Quality companies with superior profitability tend to generate above-average returns for investors. MasterCard is not only tremendously profitable, but the company has rock-solid competitive advantages and an attractive business, so it’s well positioned to sustain and even increase profitability levels going forward."
4119024,102551,2017-11-01T10:39:12-04:00,"This MasterCard stock analysis is based on Q3 2017 results released October 31, 2017 and the September 7, 2017 Investor Day presentation.MA and V are the two highest convictions stocks amongst the ~50 companies in which my wife/I own shares.MA likely gets overlooked by many investors because of its sub 1% dividend yield and short dividend history.MA has a robust suite of products/services and new offerings are continually being developed/acquired. I foresee continued growth over the long-term.","On July 31, 2017 I wrote that:On October 30th I provided my opinion on V's Q3 results released October 25th. In this post I provide my opinion on MA's Q3 results released October 31st.Of all the companies in which we own shares, MA and V are my two highest convictions stocks.In the event you are not entirely familiar with the full nature of MA's business you may wish to review ""Part 1, Item 1 - Business"" in MA's FY 2016 Form 10-K Annual Report. Pages 6 -16 of the 104 page pdf document provide an excellent overview of MA's strategy, business, industry dynamics, revenue sources, competition, and (of course) the government regulation under which it must operate.The first meaningful page of the presentation reflects the following chart.Source: MA September 7, 2017 Investment Community Meeting PresentationIf this chart sparks any interest whatsoever, I strongly suggest you access the 83 page pdf presentation as I cannot possibly give it justice in this post.In this presentation you will see what MA has identified as current and emerging trends, the magnitude of the growth potential, the extent to which highly sophisticated technological advances are opening new opportunities, an overview of the multiple geographic markets in which it competes, and its financial outlook.MA's October 31, 2017 Q3 Earnings Release can be found here and its Earnings Presentation can be found here.Source: MA October 31, 2017 Q3 Financial Results PresentationMA indicated in its September 7, 2017 Investment Community Presentation that it was revising upward its Net Revenue and EPS Compound Annual Growth Rates.Source: MA September 7, 2017 Investment Community Meeting PresentationThe investment community appears to have received the upward revisions well as MA's stock price has appreciated ~$12 subsequent to the date of this presentation.MA offers a robust suite of products for multiple market segments using various payment technologies. If you are interested in learning about MA's product/service offering you may wish to go here to select the services that are of interest to you.MA has rewarded investors considerably with the following chart showing the magnitude of share repurchases and dividends in recent years.Source: MA September 7, 2017 Investment Community Meeting PresentationMA's dividend history can be found here. The forthcoming November 9th $0.22 quarterly dividend will be the 4th in a row. I anticipate that in December 2017 MA will announce an increase to its quarterly dividend which will take effect with the February 2017 dividend; I envision a ~$0.03/quarterly dividend increase which is consistent with the previous two dividend increases.Countless investors rely solely, or very heavily, on stock screeners to identify potential investments. With a sub 1% dividend yield and a reasonably short dividend history, MA is often automatically excluded from many search results. This highlights the shortcoming of relying exclusively on stock screeners to come up with a list of companies warranting further analysis.Over the past several years, it appears investors have been willing to take on additional risk for the sake of gaining additional yield; it does not take long to find investments with lofty dividends and dividend payout ratios. These are the companies I view as most at risk of a major correction in valuation levels if the Fed and the Bank of Canada increase rates.In the case of MA, investors have little to fear about a potential dividend cut. As previously noted, the dividend yield is sub 1%. Secondly, the dividend payout ratio is in the high teen/low 20 range. Thirdly, Free Cash Flow is strong.Source: MorningstarOn December 6, 2016 MA announced a new $4B Class A common stock share repurchase program.As at December 31, 2016, there was 1.1B Diluted Weighted-Average Shares Outstanding. As at September 30, 2017, 1.075B were outstanding. This compares favorably with ~1.26B in Diluted Weighted-Average Shares Outstanding as at the end of 2012.Another 2 million shares at a cost of $0.286B were purchased October 1 - 26, 2017 thus leaving $2B remaining under the currently authorized repurchase program.While a proposed £14 billion class action lawsuit against MasterCard has been revived, I expect MA intends to rigorously defend itself against all charges. I do not foresee this matter coming to any resolution in the short-term and fully expect MA to announce in early December 2017 a 2018 share repurchase program under similar terms to those announced in December 2016.Using the 2017 and 2018 EPS Consensus Expectations of $4.50 and $5.32 and the October 31, 2017 closing stock price of $148.77 we arrive at a PE and projected PE of 33.06 and 27.97.Source: TD WebBrokerMy sentiments regarding MA's valuation are identical to those mentioned in the valuation section of my recent V post.You will very rarely find MA ""on sale"" (unless a market correction occurs). In my opinion, if you have a long-term investment time horizon, you may want to periodically acquire MA shares. Should the markets implode and MA experiences a dramatic drop in price you should seriously consider ""loading up the truck"".NOTE: Please do not construe the following as tax advice. Your circumstances might be different from our situation and you may reside in a different tax jurisdiction. I am merely sharing our situation with you and suggest that expert advice be sought when determining how best to structure your investments for your specific circumstances.Please give serious consideration to the type of account in which you hold your investments.In our case we hold MA and V in tax advantaged accounts. The advantage of having held these shares in such accounts is that all growth and income has not incurred any tax liability to date. The disadvantage of having held these shares in such accounts is that all growth and income has not incurred any tax liability to date.The dramatic growth in the value of these two holdings has certainly changed the complexion of our tax obligations relative to when these investments were originally made. At a certain stage we will need to convert our tax advantaged accounts from Registered Retirement Savings Plans to Registered Retirement Income Funds.In the 2015 Canadian Federal budget, reductions were made to the minimum amount that must be withdrawn for a holder who is 71 to 94 years old; the new factors by age can be found here under question #3. This means you MUST withdraw funds from your Registered Retirement Income Funds and pay tax on these withdrawals regardless of whether you require the funds or not. In essence, the ability to hold the shares in perpetuity and to defer any capital gains tax is restricted by the Registered Retirement Income Funds rules.We are now in a situation where we must implement a Registered Retirement Saving Plan meltdown strategy otherwise our tax burden is going to be onerous; we need to withdraw MA and V shares ""in kind"" from tax advantaged accounts for deposit into taxable accounts.Let's use an example where $100,000 in MA shares are being transferred from a tax advantaged account to a non-tax advantaged account.Withholding tax would be calculated on a tiered structure. If there is sufficient cash in the tax advantaged account, this cash can be used to cover withholding tax thus allowing us to transfer the full $100,000 in MA shares to non tax advantaged accounts. If insufficient cash is held in the tax advantaged account, we would transfer MA shares ""in kind"" but would need to sell some other investments to ensure we have sufficient cash to cover the withholding tax obligations.I like the business model so much that if, I could, I would own shares in China UnionPay. This company operates China's only national electronic payment network. It serves more than 400 financial institutions across the country and in Europe, Japan, Korea, Singapore, and other countries and regions. Since its formation in 2002, China UnionPay has had more than 2.1 billion cards issued under its brand.Member banks like Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, and Citibank issue their own UnionPay-branded cards and use the company's network to process credit and debit transactions in China.Since China UnionPay is not publicly traded and I want to benefit from the global payment trends, I see owning shares in MA and V as a great way to accomplish this. I am not averse to periodically acquiring additional shares (within reason) in both companies despite their low dividend yield and habitually rich valuation.I hope you enjoyed this post and I wish you much success on your journey to financial freedom.Thanks for reading!Note: I appreciate the time you took to read this article and hope you got something out of it. As always, please leave any feedback and questions you may have and follow me at Financial Freedom is a Journey."
4120012,21151,2017-11-03T05:21:13-04:00,Both companies are leaders in an ever-growing market. Both stocks surged over the past 5 years.But only one is worth your investment today.The reasons why I purchased Visa is discussed in detail within Dividend Growth Rocks. Why don’t you check it out with a free trial?,"If you have been looking for a growing business with solid ground, you should definitely pick the transaction business. Both MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V) not only control the market but make some serious dough out of it. Five years ago, you could have picked either one and you would have gotten the same result:(Source: YCharts)However, now that the easy money is gone, it’s time to get serious and determine which one is worth your money today. I’m telling you upfront - I bought 50 shares of Visa @ $108.66 on Halloween. Don’t be scared to make money. Today I’m telling you why Visa is a better investment than MasterCard.Visa is the world’s largest transaction processor. According to The Nilson Report, V owns 44% of the credit card transaction market share and 65% of the debit card transaction market share. MA is far behind with 29% and 24% respectively (data as of 2015). The whole idea of dealing with a transaction processor is all about the quality and range of its network. The more financial instructions and merchants using a service, the more clients tend to use it. We then enter in a never-ending cycle where merchants and financial institutions will also tend to choose the largest company as more people use it for their transactions. This is how Visa remains, and will remain, the biggest player on this playground for a while.(Source: YCharts)While MA posted stronger revenue growth during its latest quarter (+18% versus +14% for V), it is still far behind to reach V’s magnitude.As both companies invested significant amounts to build a strong brand name, we can say they are battling on equal grounds in terms of reputation. However, by its size and past performance, Visa shows stronger revenue growth potential.(Source: YCharts)On the earnings side, MasterCard seems to show the strongest profile. However, graphs don’t always tell you everything. When I see a discrepancy in results, such as the “drop” of EPS in 2016 for Visa, I always dig further through annual and quarterly statements. The EPS drop is related to a special item for the acquisition of Visa Europe. In Q3 2016, EPS was $0.17 including the special item but $0.69 without the European acquisition.Besides this “pause of growth”, I think it’s fair to claim that both Visa and MasterCard show the same earnings growth potential for years to come.When you look at companies with yield under 1%, many investors discard them as “dividend stocks”. I agree there is no interest for any income-seeking investor. However, if you have a focus on total return as I do, those two companies look like marvels to add to your portfolio.Both management teams understood the interest on the market for dividend-paying stocks and applied a dividend growth policy soon after their IPOs. MA lags a little bit with only five consecutive years, but V is only two years from becoming a Dividend Achiever already.The Dividend Achievers Index refers to all public companies that have successfully increased their dividend payments for at least ten consecutive years. At the time of writing this article, there were 265 companies that achieved this milestone. You can get the complete list of Dividend Achievers with comprehensive metrics here.(Source: YCharts)If the yield is poor, it’s a totally different game when you consider the distribution growth rate. Both companies have pushed on the “shareholder rewards” button, and I would not be surprised to see them become dividend growing stocks with a 2-3% yield in a decade from now. As their business eventually matures, the yield will start rising naturally.(Source: YCharts)If you wonder whether both companies have the potential to sustain their incredible growth rate, I’d say that we are good for a decade of double-digit growth. Both companies show payout and cash payout ratios around 20%. Most importantly, they kept their ratios in line for the past 3 years. Therefore, while the dividend increases like there is no tomorrow, the companies’ ability to pay it is stable. Then again, V and MA are head to head in these dividend competitions, as both meet my 7 dividend growth investing principles.At this stage, while V has a slight advantage, since it is the market leader, both companies look like a strong investment to me. However, the prices you pay often determine if it is a good investment or not. Over the past five years, one company went through a P/E expansion, while the other has seen a contraction:(Source: YCharts)In other words, either MA has a strong growth potential in the future, or V is being penalized for being the leader (and maybe investors think it won’t be able to grow as fast as MA). Still, V trades at a 41 P/E, while MA trades at a 34.5 P/E ratio. At this stage, both look overvalued.I ran a dividend discount model on both companies using an 18% growth rate for the first 10 years and reduced it to 7% afterward. I believe both companies will remain leaders of the transaction business, and as the business matures, additional cash flow will be directed toward shareholders.Upon my calculations, I see that V is trading at fair value right now, while MA is definitely overpriced.MasterCardVisaPlease read the Dividend Discount Model limitations to fully understand my calculations.I’m bullish on both companies, and I think they will both become strong dividend payers in the future. Therefore, I've bought shares of Visa earlier this week, and I believe it is the best play in this industry. The reasons why I’ve purchased V, along with a timely trade alert, were sent to Dividend Growth Rocks subscribers. Why don’t you give it a try for 14 days without any strings attached? Start your trial today and get my next buy shortly.Seriously, if you made it this far, it’s because you liked what you read. Don’t be a stranger; leave a comment and tell me what you think!

4096780,22023,2017-08-09T09:31:56-04:00,"The index has continued to crush the market, and it has hit an all-time high.Oligopolies are always in style.The robber barons understood that, and so should you.However, these companies are too expensive. Wait for a market crash to initiate this portfolio if you are not already in.If you want to hold for tax reasons, because of the massive gains, I am empathetic, but do not add to these positions. Think about selling if the portfolio stops rising strongly. Our non-correlated strategies are far safer right now.","Long's Law states that long-term free cash flow margins (FCF/revenue) in any industry over a multi-decade time frame tend towards the inverse of the number of competitors in that industry.For example, in an industry with three competitors, FCF margins will tend towards 33.33% or 1/3. However, Economic ""Laws"" should best be termed Economic ""Tendencies."" The rule roughly holds across a vast array of industries.Previously, we examined a portfolio of oligopoly businesses. Here is the refined group, combined with a bond allocation. It continues to trounce the market YTD:Visa (NYSE:V)MasterCard (NYSE:MA),ICE (NYSE:ICE),CME (NASDAQ:CME),CBOE (NASDAQ:CBOE),Moody's (NYSE:MCO),S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI)Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)Direxion 20+ Year Treasury Bull 3X (NYSEARCA:TMF)Note that the max drawdown data is calculated on a monthly basis.The portfolio does well on an absolute and a relative basis vs. the S&P 500:This portfolio is very interesting because it provides downside protection in a dropping or sideways market, not only because of the high quality of its holdings, but also because of the allocation to TMF, which gives exposure to 3X leveraged long duration U.S. government bonds. However, the index gives exposure to sharply rising markets as well.The major risk of this index is that, because there are very few truly oligopolistic firms with little competition, the index is extremely non-diversified. This is focus investing on steroids, which I have publicly warned against. This index is a great way to tracking the performance of wide-moat businesses, however. In addition, rising interest rates could dramatically hurt the portfolio.It is worth exploring these wide-moat businesses more thoroughly, especially after a crash in the equity markets. These companies rarely go on sale, but oligopolies plus leveraged long-duration government bonds can give an eye-popping result if their valuations are cheap enough. At 10X earnings, they start to get too tempting to pass up.Network Effect Businesses are the only category of business in which market share reinforces the competitive advantage of the businesses themselves. For instance, most merchants accept Visa and MasterCard, because most customers use Visa and MasterCard. This same logic applies to major futures exchanges such as ICE, CME, and CBOE.Major Credit Rating Agencies are firms that have historically served as the de facto regulators of bond markets. For a variety of reasons too highly complex to go into in this article, this business has historically tended towards oligopoly. Selling opinions for money, especially with few major competitors, is a fine business indeed for McGraw-Hill Financial, which owns Standard & Poor's, and for Moody's.Internet Search is dominated by Alphabet/Google because its algorithms are so advanced that users are served up highly accurate results. I cannot predict if this business will be shaken up by abrupt and discontinuous technological advances in the future. Your risk factor here is a brilliant man or woman in the proverbial garage (a.k.a., what Google started as).Most importantly, this collection of businesses are the modern day toll bridges of electronic payments, futures trading, bond issuance, and information. In each of the diverse industries in which each company operates, the toll that each extracts is so durable that it almost might as well be a tax.Owning toll bridges in economically important industries is incredibly lucrative. Just keep your eye on any brewing competition.Thanks for reading. As always, our cutting-edge strategy indices are only available to subscribers, but I hope that some of the strategy indices presented here will provide inspiration for readers to create their own methods for dealing with an increasingly difficult investment environment. If this post was useful to you, consider giving our service a try.Remember, hope is for people who do not use data. Wise investors plan using evidence-based methods.Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are described below. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown; in fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program. One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk of actual trading. For example, the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points, which can also adversely affect actual trading results.

        Both companies have high operating margin and are able to grow its business at a fast pace every year.
        Both companies are expected to continue to grow as consumers shift from cash towards electronic payment.","Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) are the world’s leaders retail electronic payment network. Both have enjoyed strong network effects with millions of merchants, billions of cards, and thousands of financial institutions. The continual transition from cash to electronic payments will fuel growth to both companies. In this article, we will compare MasterCard and Visa to see which company is a better investment choice.Let us first take a look at MasterCard and Visa’s performance in the past 5 years. As we can see from the chart below, both companies achieved almost identical returns. Their returns are excellent when we compare it to S&P 500 index. A $100 invested in MasterCard of Visa in September 2012 has resulted in about $310 today whereas a $100 invested in S&P500 index would have returned only about $170. In terms of past performance, we have a tie between MasterCard and Visa.Source: Nasdaq.comLet us take a look at both companies’ revenue numbers in the past 10 years as shown in the chart below. As we can see, both companies started with similar revenue back in 2007 with MasterCard having a slightly higher revenue. Both companies benefited from the consumer trend of shifting from cash to card for convenience and their effort towards international expansion. It is clear that since Visa took over the lead in 2008, the company has gradually widened the lead in revenues. In its latest quarter, the company grew its revenue and EPS by 26% driven largely by its acquisition of Visa Europe which was completed in June last year. On the other hand, MasterCard grew its revenue by 13.3%, a healthy double-digit growth.Source: Created by author, company reportsIn terms of operating margin, as we can see from the graph below, both companies enjoy operating margins over 50% in most of the years since 2009. The significant drop in Visa’s operating margin in 2012 was due to a $4.4 settlement related to credit card processing fees. Its lower operating margin in 2016 was related to its Visa Europe acquisition. Overall, Visa usually enjoys a higher operating margin than MasterCard as it has over 58% market share which resulted in better economies of scale.Source: Created by author, company reportsThe last metric we will compare is MasterCard and Visa’s EPS as shown in the graph below. MasterCard is able to consistently increase its EPS while Visa had two bumps along the way due to similar reason as outlined in the previous paragraph. As the graph shows, MasterCard is able to widen its lead in EPS.Source: Created by author, company reportsLet us now take a look at both companies’ financial strength. We have prepared a table with the following metrics. As we can see from the table below, Visa’s long-term debt is significantly higher than MasterCard. This is understandable as Visa operates at a much larger scale and has more than three times of total assets when compared to MasterCard. As a result, Visa has a lower total long-term debt to capitalization ratio than MasterCard.Data Source: Company reportsIn terms of interest coverage in the trailing 12-month, MasterCard has better interest coverage. However, both are considered excellent thanks to the company’s business model that generates healthy EBIT every year. The interest coverage ratio for both companies are nowhere near the warning sign of 2.5x.MasterCard and Visa in its latest dividend payment pays a quarterly dividend of $0.22 and $0.1650 per share respectively. As of Sept. 19, MasterCard’s dividend yield is 0.62% and Visa is 0.63%. There is not much difference between the two.From the graph below, we see both companies are able to increase their dividends consistently over the past 10 years. We especially note that MasterCard has better growth rate than Visa since 2013 due to higher free cash flow growth rate. In their latest dividend increase, MasterCard was able to increase its quarterly dividend by 17.9%, while Visa increased its dividend by 16.7% late last year.Source: Created by author, company reportsOver the past 10 years, MasterCard has gradually reduced its shares outstanding from 1.36 billion shares in 2007 to 1.09 billion in the recent quarter. Likewise, Visa’s share count has also been reduced from 3.08 billion shares in 2008 to 2.41 billion shares. Looking forward, both companies are expected to continue its share buybacks.Looking forward to the future, both Visa and MasterCard have a lot of room to grow as 85% of world sales still involve cash and checks. The transition towards mobile payment may result in some share losses to potential competitors but the overall growth in digital transaction will allow both companies to continue to thrive.Data Source: Company ReportsIn terms of growth strategy, Visa’s strategy is manifold. The company extended their partnership with PayPal (PYPL) to include Europe. The company also announced a strategic investment with Klarna, one of Europe’s leading payment providers. Both partnerships are part of its global effort to open up its ecosystem, and to support a broad range of new partners and to enhance the purchase experience for consumers in mobile environment. Visa also recently filed an application with the People’s Bank of China to be a bank card clearing institution.On the other hand, MasterCard acquired VocaLink in April 2017 in order to expand to bank account-based payments. This acquisition is sound as it opens a new door for MasterCard to grow its revenue as a large portion of electronic payment is done through bank-to-bank. As management stated in it despite its near term dilutive nature (6% increase in operating expense due to VocaLink acquisition in Q2 2017). Like Visa, MasterCard is also aiming growth in China.We like both companies’ strategies but slightly in favor of Visa due to its vast market share globally and its effort to strengthen and expand its ecosystem.The consensus of Visa’s fiscal 2017 EPS is $3.43 while MasterCard is $4.43. At today’s price, Visa and MasterCard’s PE ratio is 30.6x and 32.2x respectively. Visa’s 5 year average PE ratio is 32.4x while MasterCard’s 5 year PE ratio is 27.8x. Given Visa’s higher operating margin and higher market share, we think Visa deserve a higher PE ratio. To provide some margin of safety, we will use 30x and 27x as the PE ratio for Visa and MasterCard to estimate our 12-month target price.Visa and MasterCard’s fiscal 2018 EPS is estimated to be $4 and $5.23 per share respectively among 34 analysts. Using a PE multiple of 31x, we derived Visa and MasterCard’s target price to be $120, and $141.21 respectively. Therefore, Visa and MasterCard’s potential returns are 13.7% and -1.4% respectively. It appears that Visa might have better return in the next 12 months.Both Visa and MasterCard are excellent companies with strong business model that should ensure their business to continue to thrive. We like both companies but if we have to choose, we may have to go with Visa as we like Visa’s strategy to build its ecosystem through global partnerships and that it has better return potential than MasterCard based on our PE ratio assumption.Thank you for reading.

4097724,102764,2017-08-10T18:25:17-04:00,"Visa and MasterCard have delivered extraordinary gains for investors.Both companies offer rock-solid competitive strengths and outstanding profitability.Opportunities for growth in the payments industry are quite abundant over the long term.Valuation, a changing competitive landscape, and regulatory risk are important factors to watch.Nevertheless, both Visa and MasterCard look well positioned to continue crushing the market going forward.","Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) have produced spectacular gains for investors over the last decade, with both companies downright crushing the S&P 500 index over that period. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. However, the main return drivers that produced such gains for investors in Visa and MasterCard remain well in place.According to data from WalletHub, Visa owns nearly 52.8% of the cards in circulation on a global scale, while MasterCard accounts for 31.6% of the market. American Express (AXP) and Discover (DFS) come considerably behind, with 7.5% and 8.1%, respectively. Looking only at debit cards, Visa and MasterCard practically own the whole market globally.A highly concentrated market keeps competitive pressure under control, and this is a major positive in terms of profitability for operators in the sector. In addition, brand power is a key strategic advantage for leading global brands such as Visa and MasterCard, since trust and reliability are crucial considerations for both customers and merchants.Importantly, the network effect creates a virtuous cycle of sustained growth and increasing competitive strength for Visa and MasterCard. In a nutshell, the network effect means that the value of the service increases as it gains more users over time. The telephone and the internet are textbook examples, and the payments industry works under the same dynamic.Merchants need to accept the debit and credit cards that can bring more customers to the stores, and customers want to have a card that is accepted everywhere. This means that customers and merchants attract each other to the main card networks, and this makes the network more valuable over time. Visa and MasterCard are not only getting bigger when they grow in size, they also are getting stronger from a competitive point of view, while also creating more value for customers and merchants.The payments industry still offers massive opportunities for growth in the years ahead. Visa calculates that replacing cash and checks with cards is worth nearly $17 trillion in annual spending around the world.The shift to digital commerce is not only a huge opportunity in terms of revenue growth, but Visa also captures more than double its share of spend in digital commerce versus brick-and-mortar stores. In addition, new segments such as B2B and P2P could open the door to an addressable market worth nearly $30 trillion.Source: Visa."
4092634,102551,2017-07-31T08:01:47-04:00,"This MasterCard stock analysis is based on Q2 2017 results released on July 27, 2017.The company's projected EPS for FY 2017 and FY 2018 from multiple analysts have been revised upward subsequent to my February 1, 2017, post.MasterCard recently received a favorable ruling from the Competition Appeal Tribunal and no longer faces the $18 billion British Class Action Suit filed against it.While the company's dividend yield is currently sub-1%, I expect dividend income and capital gains will yield a high-single digit or a low-double digit return over the long term.MasterCard and Visa are two stocks I will never sell.","On February 1, 2017, I wrote that MasterCard (NYSE:MA) was expensive but worth the price, and on January 12, 2017, I wrote that I would never sell my Visa (NYSE:V) holding. Some readers cautioned me that never is a very long time, and that I should not get ""married"" to a stock. In general, I am in total agreement. In the case of V, and now M, I view these two stocks as being pretty darn close to the ""marrying"" kind. Sure, I strongly suspect both stocks will experience a drop in price from current levels at some stage of the game, but in all likelihood, a drop in price will most likely present a buying opportunity.While MA is certainly not on sale at current levels, I recently decided to acquire shares for the FFJ Portfolio. Ultimately, I would like the investments in the portfolio to be transferred to the next generation. Hopefully I will remain in good health and this transfer will need not occur sooner than 20 years from now.Subsequent to my previous post on MA, the company:Readers are encouraged to review the details of MA's July 27, 2017, Q2 earnings release. Highlights from the analyst conference call are provided below.While Great Britain's decision to leave the European Union has hammered the British pound, MA has benefited in that it has experienced higher transactions in the UK. The weaker currency helped drive customer spending as retail sales grew 5% in the three months ending June 30th; MA's cards account for roughly 28% of all transactions.In Q2, MA and Britain's largest digital bank (TSB Bank plc, which is part of the Banco de Sabadell Spanish banking group as of June 30, 2015) jointly announced a 7-year agreement commencing in 2018, wherein MA will replace Visa (NYSE: V) as TSB's debit card provider. In addition, the bank will continue to issue MA credit cards over the same term. This agreement is significant for MA in that TSB's customers make up about 4% of all debit card users in the UK.On the recent Q2 conference call, management indicated the underlying business fundamentals remain strong, with growth expected to continue to come from a combination of new and renewed agreements as well as its expanded set of service offerings.Progress has been made in the first 6 months of FY2017 in Europe and in Latin America, and the forecast is for this momentum to continue.FX headwinds are expected to subside primarily due to the weakening of the USD.Net revenue for the year is expected to grow at a low-double digit YoY rate on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions.YoY total operating expenses are expected to continue to grow in the high-single digit range excluding acquisition and special items.MA continues to see growth in its commercial business. This growth is driven by a combination of innovation and some new deals.The company recently announced the launch of the MasterCard B2B Hub. This is an innovative solution that enables small and medium-sized businesses in the US to automate their invoice and payment processes.In the US, more than 50% of all B2B payments are still made via cheques. The intent is to integrate this with more than MA's 130 accounting and back office systems and also into inControl, the company's virtual card platform. This solution would help buyers and suppliers become more efficient and would reduce the costs associated with manual payment processes.Prior to retirement, I was employed by a major Canadian financial institution and headed up a Corporate Cash Management sales team. One of the services we sold was Visa Payables Automation, Visa's offering tailored for companies with significant annual spend. Spoken from experience, the volume of transactions and the dollar value processed through this offering is significant. As MA's and V's B2B solutions become more widely accepted by businesses, I foresee a dramatic increase in payment volumes through these networks, which bodes well for both companies' shareholders.MA is expanding its global partnership with Amadeus IT Group SA in the US, with U.S. Bank as Amadeus's exclusive issuer. This is part of MA's strategy to pursue $300 billion+ in annual global payments that travel agencies make to airlines, hotels, and other travel providers; these payments are currently largely made via bank transfers and cheques.MA's dividend history can be found here. On August 8, 2017, the company will distribute its third consecutive $0.22 quarterly dividend. If history is any indication of what can reasonably be expected in the future, I suspect MA will pay another $0.22 dividend in early November 2017, and the February 2018 dividend will probably be increased by $0.03-0.05 per share. Using this projected increase and MA's current stock price of $127.91 would still result in a sub-1% dividend yield.Some investors will shy away from investing in MA because their primary focus is to generate dividend income and the company's dividend yield will not meet their minimum dividend yield requirement. In my case, I am retired and have no intention of starting to collect a government pension for another 14 years. I also have absolutely no intention of ever returning to the workforce, and therefore, I will be relying on dividend and rental income for several years. Despite this, I will not invest exclusively on the basis of dividend yield for the following reasons.I find that a company paying a juicy dividend yield generally carries an unacceptable level of risk. I have invested in a few companies whose stock has a very low dividend yield. Despite this, they have grown their dividends dramatically over the years. The steady dividend increases and dramatic rise in stock price has compensated us nicely for having had the intestinal fortitude not to chase yield but rather to look at the underlying long-term dividend and capital gains growth potential.In a nutshell, a well-structured equities portfolio will consist of investments in companies with both low and moderate dividend yields. My suspicion is that MA will yield a high-single digit or a low-double digit return over my investment time horizon.When I am prepared to sacrifice dividend yield, I look for a strong probability that I will be compensated from a capital gains perspective. I preferably like it when capital gains are generated through extraordinary results achieved through normal business operations. I do not complain, however, when management views its company's shares to be undervalued and makes it a point to significantly and steadily reduce the number of outstanding shares.In MA's case, the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding has dropped considerably subsequent to its May 25, 2006, IPO; the following chart takes into consideration the January 22, 2014, 10 for 1 stock split.I suspect MA may become more aggressive with its stock repurchase program, given the Competition Appeal Tribunal's recent ruling that it would not grant the necessary collective proceedings order for the $18 billion British Class Action Suit against MA to proceed to trial.If an investor has a hard and fast rule that an investment in a company will only be made when a company's shares have a sub-20 P/E ratio, I suspect this investor is highly unlikely to ever own MA shares. Even if we get a long overdue market correction, I suspect MA's P/E may only retrace to a level in the low 20s.In my February 1, 2017, post, I indicated I was prepared to pay up to acquire MA shares. When that post was written, the consensus 2017 EPS expectation from 32 brokers was $4.27, and 30 brokers projected EPS of $4.98 for FY2018. These estimates have subsequently been revised to $4.38 and $5.09, respectively.(Source: TD Bank WebBroker)Using the July 28, 2017, closing price of $127.91 and the projected $4.38 EPS for FY2017, I get a forward P/E of 29.20, which is a shade lower than when I wrote my February 1, 2017, post. MA is certainly not trading at a ""bargain"" level, but if you have a long-term investment time horizon, I think you can do far worse than purchasing the stock at current levels.I want to benefit from the ever-increasing transition from cash to other methods of payment. Secondly, inflation will naturally result in most goods and services trading hands at higher price points, which will benefit MA. Furthermore, I don’t want to miss out when merchants and consumers switch from MA to V or vice versa. This is why it is imperative that I own shares in both companies.Given that MA and V are the two dominant publicly traded companies in their industry, I feel no need to own shares in American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) or Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS). If China UnionPay were publicly traded, however, I would very likely acquire shares in this company, because it is a dominant player in the Far East region of the globe.MA is certainly not on sale at current levels, but I am not concerned. This is why I recently acquired another 400 shares. Unlike the other MA shares we already own, these newly acquired shares will be held in the FFJ Portfolio.Note: I appreciate the time you took to read this article, and hope you got something out of it.

4109794,38631,2017-09-27T09:47:13-04:00,"MasterCard operates in an essential duopoly, which has ample room to grow for decades.The company also benefits from some positive trends.On the other hand, the stock is trading at a remarkably high P/E ratio.","MasterCard (MA) has markedly outperformed S&P (SPY) this year, as it has rallied 35% while the index has gained only 11%. As the stock has run much faster than its growth rate, it is only natural to wonder whether the stock has become overvalued. Therefore, in this article, I will analyze the prospects of the stock and its valuation.First of all, MasterCard has clearly outperformed S&P in almost any time horizon one can check out. To be sure, it has outperformed the benchmark during the last 5 years (201% vs. 75%), the last 2 years (55% vs. 28%) and the last 12 months (40% vs. 17%). This exceptional record results from the exceptional consistency in the growth of the earnings per share [EPS] of the stalwart. According to Buffett, consistent EPS growth is one of the most important features of a stock.In addition, MasterCard possesses another characteristic that is very important to Buffett. More specifically, it needs to spend a very low amount to maintain and expand its business and hence most of its operating cash flows end up in its free cash flows, which are available for generous shareholder distributions. It is impressive that the company has spent less than 10% of its operating cash flows on capital expenses for 9 consecutive years. As a result, the company has spent huge amounts on share repurchases and has thus reduced its share count by 13% during the last 4 years. In fact, the share count would be much lower if the stock did not always trade at a premium.Apart from the obvious benefits of its lean business model, MasterCard currently benefits from some favorable trends. More precisely, the credit card debt in the US has grown 6.2% this year and has surpassed the $1 T threshold, mostly thanks to rising incomes and the near record-low unemployment rate. Moreover, the delinquency rates of consumers are near record-low levels. All these factors certainly provide a tailwind to credit card companies.MasterCard also benefits from the continuous shift of consumers from cash to non-cash payments. To be sure, the global non-cash payments grew by about 10% per year during 2011-2015 and continue to grow at a fast pace in the last two years. Moreover, while the use of cash stands at 59.4% in developed countries, it is still 92.7% in emerging economies. Therefore, there is ample room for credit card companies to continue to grow for decades.Investors should also realize that MasterCard operates in an essential duopoly. As Visa and MasterCard handle 80% of the global card transactions, they essentially constitute a duopoly. That's why the operating margins of both companies have remained above 50% for so many years in a row. To make the long story short, MasterCard has strong pricing power thanks to the duopoly it operates in while its market can grow at the current fast rate for decades. Therefore, one does not need to be a genius to realize how exciting the growth prospects of MasterCard are.Moreover, China opened its doors to foreign card companies two years ago. As China is the second-largest economy in the world and keeps growing at an approximate 7% rate year after year, it represents a unique growth opportunity for MasterCard. As the latter already has a good business relationship with the major local bank, UnionPay, it has an advantage in this new market. Of course, investors should realize that China represents a medium to long-term growth opportunity for MasterCard, as it will take years to the company to reach a significant level in this country to move the needle in its total results. Moreover, the profit margins will certainly not be as high as those in the domestic market. Nevertheless, thanks to the gigantic size of this new market, MasterCard is likely to continue to grow for decades in this market.As if all these factors were not enough to convince investors to purchase the stock, MasterCard has also started to benefit from a weakening dollar. As the dollar remained pronouncedly strong during the last two years, it took its toll on the earnings of the company in its international segments. However, the dollar seems to have recorded a solid top and is likely to remain weak for the foreseeable future. As a result, MasterCard will receive an additional boost in its international earnings this and next year.The only visible potential threat to MasterCard is the wallet payment service of Amazon (AMZN). Bernstein recently stated that the retail giant could leverage its wallet payment service thanks to its gigantic size and thus capture a significant portion of the market share of credit card companies. Indeed this is a potential threat for MasterCard, though it is really unclear at the moment how far Amazon will go in this endeavor. In any case, this seems to be only a long-term concern.And while there is no visible threat in the way of MasterCard at the moment, its shareholders should realize that the stock is already priced for perfection and hence any emerging threat may cause a dramatic deflation of its P/E ratio. More specifically, the stock currently trades at a trailing P/E=35.2. This rich valuation certainly excludes any potential threat from the horizon. Therefore, if the economy or the market sentiment takes a turn for the worse or an unforeseen headwind shows up for MasterCard, the stock is likely to incur a dramatic decrease of its P/E ratio. Such behavior was witnessed in the first minutes of the volatile trading session of 8-24-2015 when S&P opened 5% lower and MasterCard opened 15% lower. While that plunge lasted only for a few minutes, its shareholders should keep in mind that a similar plunge may last much longer now that the stock is so richly valued, if the market sentiment changes.To sum up, MasterCard is an excellent stock to own for the long term. As it essentially operates in a duopoly and its market has plenty of room to grow for decades, it is a rare growth stock. Nevertheless, the market is already too enthusiastic about its promising growth prospects and hence, it has already priced uninterrupted growth for years into the stock. Therefore, if the market becomes more pessimistic about the economy or the company decelerates at some point, its P/E ratio may plunge by almost 50% towards a more reasonable level, around 20. Such a dramatic drop will be traumatic to the shareholders, particularly in the short term. While the company is exceptional in its execution, its stock is currently overvalued."
4091239,33291,2017-07-27T10:08:44-04:00,Still having remorse over failing to buy this one.Q2 earnings are discussed.There is always something you can complain about.,"MasterCard (NYSE:MA) is out with earnings this morning and the Street is reacting with some volatility. Recall that this is a name that I have told you I wish I bought five years ago. In fact, I feel like every three months I am seriously considering the name, but never get in, as I keep waiting for the pullback that never happens. Here we are now up 25% this year alone. In fact you can go back and read where I discussed my remorse over failing to buy this one, and I feel that way again and again. Of course, I can however only own so many names without becoming my own mutual fund, as I always say. But this is one that haunts me. Regardless, this column isn’t about me, it’s about the stock and the company’s performance.Right now, the stock is at 52-week high (shocking, right?). MasterCard is up about 45% from where I recommended it at $90 a share. It definitely is trading at a premium valuation, at 35 times the trailing twelve months’ earnings, but with the exceptional growth the name is showing, the valuation is justified. What do I mean?Well, once again the company delivered a strong report. The results indicate that the company will continue its stable and reliable growth. Net revenue for the quarter came in at $3.05 billion, a 13.4% increase over Q2 2016. This was primarily due to a 9% jump in gross dollar volume and an 17% increase in transactions to approximately 16.0 billion. This growth is pretty sizable growth for a long-standing company like MasterCard. So, once again revenues were up nicely and managed to beat expectations very slightly by $80 million. That is a win for those holding the name.But what about earnings? Well these are driven by revenues and expenses as we all know. We just saw that revenues were solid. That said, expenses grew year over year versus last year by 7%, but if we adjust for the 6% impact from acquisitions and a 4% hit from currency related issues, we see that expenses were up 17% on an adjusted basis. While I hate to see rising expenses, given that revenues were up almost 13%, it is acceptable. That is, we can absorb the rise in expenses and still see a bump in earnings.Total operating expenses were $1.4 billion for several reasons, and when we adjust for special items were just under $1.5 billion on a constant dollar basis. The increase was primarily spending related to strategic initiatives, as well as higher promotional spending and of course acquisition related integration expenses. All of this led to operating income increasing 20% as reported. Operating margins were a strong 54.1%, up from last year's 51.2%. Truly impressive.Factoring in the growth in revenues and the expenses of the company, it reported net income of $1.2 billion, an increase of 20% as reported. Once again, adjusting to a constant currency basis, net income actually was up 12% year-over-year. This translated to earnings per share of $1.10, up from $0.96 last year. Further this beat estimates by a strong $0.06. All in all, it was a strong quarter and the only issues with the quarter was that rise in expenses in my estimation, which really didn't weigh.In addition to solid results the company continues to be shareholder-friendly. During Q2 2017, MasterCard bought back 8 million shares for approximately $931 million. Here in the present Q3 2017, the company has bought back another 1.8 million shares at a cost of approximately $226 million (through 7/24/17). There is still another $2.9 billion remaining under the current repurchase program authorization. Finally, I will always reiterate that my only problem with the company is its weak dividend. The company did make a move to raise its dividend, and now pays an $0.88 annual dividend, $0.22 quarterly. This only translates to a 0.67% yield. You can do better! While a dividend is shareholder-friendly, its low right now, in part due to the growth of the stock, but I do expect this dividend to grow in the coming years. I remain bullish.

4093192,103497,2017-08-01T13:18:22-04:00,MA and V have low volatility and minimal difference between one another.American consumers spent $720 billion dollars on credit cards in the second quarter of 2017.Credit card delinquency is at an all time low.MA and V offer mature stocks' low risk with emerging market growth.,"Over the last couple months, the market has climbed to, and stabilized, at an all-time high. As whenever the market reaches a stabilized period after a new record high, voices in the bearish camp grow louder and speak with more frequency. While investors should consider the arguments from both the bullish and bearish campers, there are two positions the pessimistic and optimistic investor should long: Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE: MA) and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V).A plethora of sources show two things critical to Mastercard and Visa: people are using less cash and cash is still involved in 85% of transactions are moving in their favor. Most investors think of Visa and Mastercard as mature companies and mature stocks; they both pay dividends. I see another side of these two transaction giants. The side is emerging market penetration and saturation. As the developing world transitions from cash transaction to digital transactions, Mastercard and Visa has both the capital and experience to capture that growth.Investors know the advantages and rewards that wait for them in properly targeted growth stocks in developing economies. They also know the risks of backing the wrong horse in an emerging market. Mastercard and Visa offer a rare dichotomy of maturity and advantageous positioning to reap rewards from developing nations.Though, there is a reasonable question to ask; is there any value left at Mastercard and Visa's all-time high share price ?The short answer is yes; but you shouldn’t just listen to me, the economic indicators and math support longing these two powerhouses.The first mathematical approach we can look at is pairs trading, which is basically a modeling approach where we use the closing adjusted price of Mastercard to compute a modeled price for Visa, and vice versa.Pairs trading is a newer, more econometric leaning, evaluation tool for stocks. It uses linear regression to create a numeric system that generates a predictive price based solely on the price of a competitor in the same industry. The premise of this approach is that firms within the same sector should experience changes in similar order. There are certain supporters and detractors of this modeling; the detractors say it doesn’t take into consideration the intangibles of a company: leadership, market share, innovation, and etc. The supporters say that those intangibles are internalized in the price of the stock and don’t necessarily need to be directly factored in. I don’t belong to either camp; pairs trading is a useful tool, but is only one way to look at a stock’s price, and should be weighed with a myriad of other approaches…which is exactly what we’re doing here.Without further ado, here’s the results of the model:As you can see, the models mimis each other, except with some lag effects and sensitivity positioning, which is where its value is; those changes allow us to see the behavior of the share prices is a different lens. The modeling shows that currently, when compared to one another, neither is over or undervalued. This is why either Mastercard or Visa is a good pick to take advantage of the long term opportunities that we discussed earlier. There is no outright advantage, from this pricing model. This model reinforces that an investor cannot go wrong picking between these two.Another, and more traditional, approach to looking at value is the 90 day moving average. It is a primitive, but tried and true, method. One of the advantages of using the 90 day moving average over the pairs trading model is how it shows bearish and bullish breaks of the average. The pairs trading model is too systematic to exposes these consensuses.As the above chart shows, Mastercard and Visa have been in a bullish break of their 90 day moving average for the last 18 months. These similar breaches suggest not only investor confidence, but, coupled with the sheer length of time, real long-term growth. This coincides not just with the pairs trading model, but with the observed increase use of digital transactions.More importantly volatility has been low and close between the two stocks. Mastercard saw a standard deviation of 1.262% over the last 5 years, in regards to their adjusted close price day over day change; Visa’s standard deviation over the same period and circumstances was 1.278%. With such low volatility, and almost no difference between the two companies, investors can’t really negotiate away the inherent risk in either company, and neither offers a significant advantage in terms of stability. The similarities between the pairs trading model, 90 moving average, and volatility show that there is a strong mathematical case for adding a long position in either Mastercard or Visa. As we see more and more digital transaction the value of these firms should increase.All this information is retrospective, it is important, but it is merely the past performance. I’ve always been a big fan of trying to find macroeconomic data series on firms and industries, and using them to define demand.While Mastercard and Visa are themselves not directly involved in the banking aspect of credit card transactions, it still offers a demand proxy. Currently, the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED) shows that Consumer Loans: Credit Cards and Other Revolving Plans, All Commercial Banks have grown 5.8% in the second quarter of this year, when compared to the second quarter of the year before. This growth has been consistent over the last seven quarters, with each quarter posting growth of over 5.5%. This mean people are swiping those cards more and more. In fact, people swiped those cards to a tune of $720 billion in the second quarter of 2017 alone; while all those were not Mastercard or Visa transactions, given their market share; it is safe to say that a fair amount was. This implicit growth indicator helps paint the strong case that Mastercard and Visa have future new demand in their industry.Another indicator that helps frame the upside of a long in these two juggernauts is the historically low period of credit card delinquency that the U.S. consumer is currently in. A reduction in delinquency among credit card accounts means there is currently the capacity to consume more with credit cards. While greater capacity in an industry is usually a sign of a decrease in demand, this is not so with consumption. This is because of the economic phenomenon of marginal propensity of consumption; which is the amount of money a person will spend if you give them a dollar. As you can imagine, it changes by scenario; though we can generally assume it is some point between sixty and ninety cents per dollar. This means increased capacity is likely to drive increased use credit cards, which is, directly, demand for the services Mastercard and Visa provide.Given the mathematical and economic data, investors looking for growth from a mature, dividend yielding, stock should include Mastercard or Visa in their portfolio."

It isn’t known if Adjaoute will continue with MasterCard beyond the transition period after transaction close.Brighterion’s predecessor company was originally located in Europe prior to its founding in the U.S. in 1999. The company had an initial investor, the Sturm Group. MasterCard later invested an undisclosed amount in Brighterion.Below is a brief video about Brighterion’s approach to fraud prevention:(Source: RSA Conference)Notably, Brighterion and MasterCard also have an existing operating relationship, where Brighterion’s technology powers MasterCard’s EMS platform (Electronic Merchant System).Acquisition Terms and RationaleNeither company disclosed the price or terms of the transaction, and there were no ‘whisper’ numbers mentioned in the tech press. MasterCard didn’t file an 8-K, which would have been required had the transaction resulted in a material change in financial condition, so it is likely the acquisition was not material to its results.However, given the high demand for AI- and machine learning-driven security technologies and Brighterion’s existing relationship with MasterCard that has proved its system, I wouldn’t be surprised to learn the amount was between $100 million and $200 million.Brighterion has developed what it calls ‘Smart Agent’ technology that identifies patterns and trends in individual consumer spending. This results in a real-time reduction in fraudulent transactions and a reduction in false positives which can reject transactions despite being authorized by the consumer.By acquiring Brighterion, MasterCard is clearly pleased with the technology and approach, which Dr. Akli has been a long proponent of, even before the current AI and machine learning rage.As MasterCard stated in the deal announcement:As hackers become more sophisticated and receive support from state sponsors, it is imperative that financial networks invest in fraud detection technologies that quickly learn of those threats and respond accordingly without over-responding and creating false positives.MasterCard believes it has acquired Brighterion as a significant step forward in bringing that technology fully in-house.The company also acquired NuData Security in March 2017 for its technology 'that helps businesses prevent online and mobile fraud using session and biometric indicators'.I expect to see further acquisitions and investment in the security and risk spaces by MasterCard and other financial network firms as they battle to stay ahead of ongoing threats to their processing security environments.I write about M&A deals, public companies that invest in technology startups and IPOs.

4075625,102428,2017-05-23T10:05:52-04:00,"I take a closer look at MasterCard in terms of my Garden Portfolio.The dividend yield and growth are essential metrics for me.Using other data, I've developed a reasonable trajectory for future dividend payments.","As I've written about, most recently in Tending the Dividend Garden - March Update, I like to group my stocks into several categories that I relate to crops from my garden. I believe this is an apt analogy because investing and gardening both require similar traits like planning and patience. My groups are defined solely by a stock's dividend yield and dividend growth rate (DGR). The examples of my crop categories are Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) for apple tree, Target (NYSE:TGT) for strawberry, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) for green bean, AT&T (NYSE:T) for watermelon, and Realty Income (NYSE:O) for spinach. These two metrics are by no means the only criteria I measure a stock by when performing my due diligence, but organizing my stocks based on their dividends helps to keep me balanced between the high-yielding, low DGR stocks and the low-yielding, high DGR stocks. In this article, I will explore the dividend of MasterCard (NYSE:MA) a bit deeper and evaluate valuation in terms of the dividend. I'll also analyze future prospects and explain why I believe the stock doesn't suit my needs, despite a dividend that should experience some significant growth.When I planted my apple trees, I knew it would be several years before I started to see any significant harvests. I was perfectly content with this delayed gratification because I knew once the production started, it would grow exponentially. Therefore, the stocks I call apple trees have yields below 2%, but DGRs ideally over 15%. MA has a low yield of 0.75%, but DGRs of 18.8% 1 year, 53.5% 3 year, 66.2% 5 year, and 55.8% 10 year. MA is currently a Dividend Challenger having increased its dividend for 6 consecutive years. The dividend history is weaker than I would like, especially given the 3 year freeze between 2009 and 2011.Another way I'll use DGRs is to compare them to each other to get a sense of recent changes between them. The 5/10 year DGR ratio is 1.19 indicating the 5 year DGR is 19% higher than the 10 year DGR. This is in part to the aforementioned freeze which hurts the 10 year DGR. In this case, I feel it's more helpful to use the 3/5 year DGRs. That ratio is 0.81, meaning there has been a bit of a deceleration. The drop with the 1/5 year DGRs is more pronounced at 0.28. The DGRs were destined to slow from their blistering pace, but the next couple raises will hopefully show a more gradual decline.A method of using the dividend as a way to ascertain valuation is to compare the current yield to the 5 year average yield. For MA, the current yield of 0.75% is significantly higher than its 5 year average yield of 0.50%. I interpret this as a current undervaluation for MA. For the yield to match its 5 year average, the share price would have to rise to $176, or nearly 48% from its current level.The payout ratio for a stock can suggest how much room a dividend has to grow, especially when compared to the 10 year average payout ratio. The current EPS payout ratio for MA is 23.9% with a 10 year average of 9.4%. That kind of rise in the payout ratio could be troubling for some stocks, but seeing as how it started remarkably low, I'm not bothered by the greater than two fold increase. This does bear watching going forwards, however.One additional metric I consider when estimating dividend payments is the debt to equity ratio. MA currently has a D/E of 0.92. A level that high isn't alarming as long as the growth in dividend payments is being financed by earnings growth and not additional debt. All things considered, I believe the dividend could grow at 15% a year over the next 5 years. In that case, the dividend payments would total $6.34 for a 5 year payback of 5.3%. With dividends reinvested, for every 19 shares held today, a ""bonus"" share would be earned by May 2022.MA falls into an apple tree stock within my Garden Portfolio. With its minimal yield, it's very reminiscent of the stick with roots I planted several years ago. Like my tree, I expect it to slowly flourish if given enough patience. At this point MA, looks to be undervalued and forms a near duopoly with Visa (NYSE:V). However, due to its short dividend growth history and recent dividend freezes, I won't be adding any MA at this time. I will revisit the company in the future.

4087982,23452,2017-07-17T04:57:06-04:00,Main Street analysis of the company.Industry analysis going out to 2025.Capital Appreciation through capital preservation.,"Recently I was asked by a client if I had to choose one stock out of the 17,000 stocks that our Friedrich Global Research analyzes (from 36 countries) which one would it be? The answer without a doubt is MasterCard (MA) and the following should explain why.As a long term investor, the first thing you want to concentrate on is in finding companies that have little in the way of competition or what Warren Buffett calls a ""moat"" or ""toll bridge"". The industry that MasterCard operates in has very few players in it (as shown in the illustration below).In 2016 MasterCard and Visa (V) handled 80% of all purchase transactions using global cards and MasterCard's volume grew 12.7% from the year prior. Visa is another stock that I also own in our client portfolios and even though it handled twice the transaction volume of MasterCard, its numbers (from a free cash flow point of view) are not as attractive as MasterCard's are.Free cash flow analysis is the most powerful tool that any investor can use in order to get down to the real story behind what is really happening on Main Street. As a free cash flow analyst, 99% of my work is done on Main Street as Main Street is where MasterCard invests in its own operations. How well Ajaypal S. Banga (CEO of MasterCard) and management do in running those operations determines how profitable the company will be. Wall Street then reacts based on the success or failure of management to meet its goals. Main Street and Wall Street are thus interlinked, but because anyone with a computer, an internet connection and a brokerage account can buy or sell any stock at any time, expertise is not a requirement in order to invest on Wall Street. This results in Wall Street being a very dangerous place to operate in as many investors tend to operate through emotion or tend to follow the herd in and out of stocks. During bull markets, investors feel like they can do no wrong as ""the rising tide lifts all boats."" But when a bear market suddenly shows up, these same investors tend to panic and like lemmings stampede over the cliff. Thus we have the classic case of ""greed vs. panic.""Having noticed this problem some 30 years ago, I spent the last three decades building an algorithm called Friedrich. Our algorithm was designed to assist all investors (both pro and novice alike) and give them the ability to quickly compare a company's Main Street operations, to its Wall Street valuation (overbought or oversold condition). Friedrich can do this on an individual company basis or assist users in analyzing an entire index like the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY), an ETF, mutual fund or individual portfolio.Many years ago, while reading Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.B) (NYSE:BRK.A) 1986 letter to shareholders, I discovered a ratio, which Mr. Buffett called ""owner earnings,"" or what we may consider to be Mr. Buffett's version of ""free cash flow."" To my amazement, in that little footnote, Mr. Buffett explains how to use it and basically states that it is one of the key ratios that he and Charlie Munger used in analyzing stocks. In that article, he defined the term ""owner earnings"" as the cash that is generated by the company's business operations.I have used this free cash flow ratio for decades, using data from the Value Line Investment Survey, whose founder was Arnold Bernhard. Mr. Bernhard was a big fan of free cash flow and probably introduced it sooner than Mr. Buffett did. I know this as I was able to calculate the FCF ratio using old Value Line's sheets for my 60-year backtest of the DJIA from 1950-2009.Having had great success in using Owner earnings, I then created the following ratio in order to make Owner earnings more powerful. FROIC turned out to be the most important ratio I use (out of 66) when analyzing a company on Main Street and this is how it is calculated.Here is MasterCard's real time FROIC calculated for you.FROIC means ""Free Cash Flow Return on Invested Capital""Forward Free Cash Flow = [((Net Income + Depreciation) (1+ % Revenue Growth rate)) + (Capital Spending)]FROIC = (Forward Free Cash Flow)/ (Long-Term Debt + Shareholders' Equity)Net Income per diluted share = $4,181,000,000/1,082,400,000 = $3.86Depreciation per diluted share = $1,292,000,000/1,082,400,000 = $1.19Capital Spending per diluted share = $-242,000,000/1,082,400,000 = $-0.22Revenue Growth Rate TTM = 3%[(($3.86 + $1.19) (1.03%)) + ($-0.22)] =$4.98Long-Term Debt = $5,216,000,000Shareholders Equity = $5,611,000,000Diluted Shares Outstanding = 1,082,400,000FROIC = (Forward Free Cash Flow)/ (Long-Term Debt + Shareholders' Equity)$4.98/$10.00 = 49.8%FROIC = 49.8%What the FROIC ratio does is tell us how much forward free cash flow the company is generating on Main Street relative to how much total capital it has employed. So, if a company invests $100 in total capital on Main Street and generates $20 in forward free cash flow, it therefore has a FROIC of 20%, which we consider excellent.Having said that, how did MasterCard do on the FROIC front?As you can see MasterCard's FROIC is incredible, while here is Visa's:As you can clearly see, from a FROIC point of view, there is no comparison and MasterCard has been the clear winner over the last decade. Now the sharp drop in FROIC in 2016-2017 for Visa has to do with its recent merger with Visa Europe and since Friedrich only uses GAAP data when doing its analysis, those numbers can dramatically change to the upside going forward. Having said that, I don't intend to ever sell Visa as, along with MasterCard, it is a duopoly in one of the fastest growing industries around.Here is our most current Datafile and Friedrich Chart on MasterCard, which will show how well the company is run by its elite management.The slots that are green are considered ideal according to our system (legend) and those in red are not, so Friedrich is telling us that we are looking at fields of green when investing in MasterCard.Though MasterCard is no longer a bargain (very few stocks are these days) it is still selling below its Main Street price (the price per share that a businessperson would value any business on Main Street at) and is still far away from its overbought price.The past ten years for both MasterCard and Visa have been amazing and despite MasterCard having considerably better fundamentals than Visa, both stocks have seen incredible stocks market gains.That is all well and good but, going forward, what does the future look like for both companies? Well, here is an illustration that should impress - and it basically makes both companies permanent foundational holdings for my client portfolios.Going forward, as a long term buy and hold investor, it is my opinion that one cannot do much better that having MasterCard in one's portfolio. The future is so bright in the Asian-Pacific region that it is outright shocking as to how good things look. So even if the current bull market ends soon, as a conservative investor I will continue to sleep well at night knowing that I have a foundation holding like MasterCard in my client portfolios.In conclusion, it is my belief that free cash flow analysis is the ultimate tool when analyzing companies, and my hope is that you may add our FROIC ratio to your own investor tool box in order to help you in your own due diligence.

The primary metric that I used to judge the value of this company was free cash flow.Specifically, I made the argument that based on growing free cash flow levels, it is quite plausible that a target price of $130 (assuming a 15-20% growth in free cash flow levels over the next 5-year period) can be achieved.Since that time, the company has increased from $101 to $127 at the time of writing:In this regard, MasterCard is on track to hit my target price much faster than anticipated.To provide an overview, at the time I had assumed that with a terminal P/FCF ratio of 32.79, along with growth scenarios of 10%, 15%, and 20%, the company’s terminal value could lie as high as $150 in the best-case scenario, and $100 in the worst-case scenario:With the company about to hit the $130 mark, can such growth be sustained?When we look at the company’s P/FCF ratio, along with the overall growth trajectory for free cash flow, while the P/FCF ratio has increased to over 37, growth in free cash flow has actually dropped from the peak seen in 2016.Taking free cash flow metrics in and of themselves, MasterCard is at the risk of overvaluation based on this metric. While I used a terminal ratio of 32.49 as a five-year average (real P/FCF in September 2016 was in fact 28.46), we see that on a broader five-year basis, P/FCF is in fact trading at a five-year high:However, the decrease in free cash flow may have been due to an increase in operating costs through to 2017. For instance, diluted EPS did in fact increase from $0.86 in 1Q 2016 to $1.01 in 1Q 2017, and revenues have continued to increase:Earnings per shareRevenuesSource: 1Q 2017 MasterCard Earnings PresentationOperating CostsSource: 1Q 2017 MasterCard Earnings PresentationWhile MasterCard still continues to be a strongly performing company overall, the growth in revenue has, in fact, come in lower than analyst expectations. Additionally, while digital initiatives such as Masterpass have enabled 80 million consumer accounts, regulatory concerns have weighed in on volumes in the past year – one, in particular, being a European regulation that restricts card providers from charging transaction fees on payments that do not utilise their payment network.In this regard, MasterCard is an expanding company with strong growth prospects. However, the drop in free cash flow and regulatory hurdles when it comes to expansion lead me to take a bullish, but cautious view on MasterCard. While this is a strong company, I see a price range of $100-110 as being more reasonable to initiate a position at this time."
4087789,103104,2017-07-14T13:34:48-04:00,"MasterCard is dramatically outperforming the financial processing sector.The companies share value has increased 39.2% over 12-months, and grown over 50% faster than Visa.MasterCard’s growth appear to be “bubble” free.","By Eric MasonMasterCard Incorporated (NYSE: MA) is experiencing real, bubble free growth.When analyzing a stock's value it is difficult to decipher whether recent past gains are from real valuation increase or from demand bubbles. Demand bubbles are especially problematic when investing in individual companies because the bubbles tend to be able to hide in overall sector growth. The ""hiding"" characteristics of bubbling can make risk averse investors wary of investing in a stock that has seen dramatic recent growth.MasterCard has shown signs that may indicate a bubbling. Steep increase in value over a 12-month period, 39.2% since July of last year, despite MasterCard being almost a decade removed from its IPO, when growth like this would be expected; additionally, MasterCard's main competitor, Visa (NYSE: V), only saw a share value increase of 25.1% over the same time period, a difference of over 50%.In order to test whether MasterCard's sudden growth is a bubble, a multivariate regression was performed. This regressive analysis combines two econometric approaches to investigate if MasterCard's growth is real. By combining Pairs Trading modeling and autoregressive modeling, a statistically significant model is produced.This hybrid model combines the independent evaluation technique offered in Pairs Trading modeling with the modeling memory that is unique to auto-regressive modeling.Pairs Trading is an econometric approach to calculate the value of a stock based on another stock with in the same industry. It creates insights into the behavior of the stock framed within its sector. This framing, using an independent competitor as its base, allows investors to examine valuation as a function of how the company, in this case MasterCard, is faring relative to others in the industry.Autoregressive modeling permits inquiry into how a stock is changing relative to itself overtime. Algorithmic investing relies on autoregressive modeling, in part, to detect mis-valuations. Autoregressive modeling carries the additional benefit of being entirely dependent on the stock itself, meaning firm specific changes are reflected properly in the data.By generating this model through the fusion of Pairs Trading and autoregressive modeling, the benefits of both become apparent in the results. As the graph illustrates, the models fits nearly perfect over the time series of the MasterCard share value. Additionally, the model carries a Significance F value of 0, which indicates a likelihood of this modeling just being chance is 0%. The reason this model holds so much accuracy is the 2,345 data observation that were refined in its development.The end product paints a great picture for any investor holding MasterCard; the growth is real.If MasterCard's growth was merely the result of zealous demand, we would expect that model would become out of sync with the observed share price towards the right side of the graph, but instead we see the model stay right in line with the observed price. If this was simply an autoregressive model, this result would be a noticeable, but analytically weak, finding. By encompassing Visa, its main competitor, into the model a greater accuracy and actionable result is shown.While this model shows that MasterCard's growth is not from an asset bubble, the next question is how it compares to its industry cluster.Industry comparison will convey the other side of the argument that MasterCard is a stock to buy, or at least watch, because while the hybrid model performed allows an investor to conclude that bubbling is not an issue, the modeling fails to provide comparison to other stocks in the industry. Without proper perspective, the conclusion that MasterCard is not in a bubble is only useful to those that hold long positions in the stock and those that may consider shorting the stock.To conclude whether or not MasterCard is a suitable for a buy stance, it is imperative for an investor not to stop at deciphering the evidence of a bubble, but rather the existence of an opportunity.The above graph shows the indexed performance of MasterCard against two time data series. One represents the indexed combined value of Visa, Inc, American Express Company (NYSE: AXP), Discover Financial Services (NYSE: DFS), and MasterCard referred to as ""Financial Transaction Sector Indicator"". The other indexed data series is for the aforementioned firms, excluding MasterCard and is titled ""Financial Transaction Sector (excluding MA)""By showing performance of the index both with MasterCard and without MasterCard, an investor can see how much of the growth within MasterCard's industry sector indicator is from the company itself.While there are certainly more financial transaction processing firms than the ones included in these indicators, these for four firms carry a combined market cap of over $455 billion. These firms also represent the leading players within their industry cluster, these considerations make their use as an indicator relevant.The graph shows in convincing fashion that MasterCard is sustainably outperforming its competitors. Combined with the previous model, the data narrates a conclusion that MasterCard in experiencing significant, sector beating, growth that is the product of real growth, void of any significant price bubbling."
4058110,60561,2017-03-27T09:31:36-04:00,"MasterCard is a Dividend Challenger with 5 consecutive years of dividend growth.What MasterCard lacks in current yield, just 0.79%, it makes up for with growth.Cash flow is critical for any successful company and MasterCard has plenty of it.Growth is a key factor for an investment in MasterCard, but investors can't overlook the power of valuation.","Toll roads. I hate paying the tolls, but they sure do make driving quicker and easier. However, businesses that are built on the toll bridge moat are typically cash cows that generate plenty of excess cash that can be returned to shareholders and make for ideal investments when purchased at sound valuations.MasterCard's (NYSE:MA) business model is simple. Create a payment network. Get a large number of users, card holders, to use your cards. Get businesses to accept your payment network. Rake in profits. It's not quite that simple, but it's not much more complex than that.The global payment processing market is largely a duopoly with Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard taking up the lion's share of all transactions. Around the globe the trend is for more transactions every year to be done without cash or checks. In my own life I can honestly say that I write about 3 checks per year with essentially every other purchase being made with my cards.Dividend HistoryOne of the first places that I go to determine the quality of a company is its dividend history. The dividend history gives quick insight into whether the company is growing as well as generating excess cash to send to shareholders.The majority of the companies that I own have dividend growth streaks that are decades long; however, as a relatively young investor, early 30's, I realize the power of getting in on the early stages of a dividend growth streak. High quality companies that have the ability to continue to grow organically can be a boon to investors if purchased at sound valuations. These companies are still in a high growth stage which means investors can benefit from a rapidly growing dividend through the organic growth of the business as well as a rising payout ratio over time.MasterCard has paid the same or higher dividends to investors every year since initiating a dividend in 2006. They have increased dividends for 5 consecutive years giving them the title of Dividend Challenger.A full screen interactive version of this chart can be found here.*Image Source: Author/Data Source: MasterCard Investor RelationsMasterCard's dividend history is less impressive than I expected with 20 consecutive quarters without an increase. However, since then annual dividend increases have become the norm and quite generous.*Image Source: Author**2017's annual dividend assumes 2 additional payments at $0.22 per share per quarter.Quantitative QualityOf course the dividend history is just a quick screen to identify high quality companies and is far from the only metric that I use. I prefer to examine companies through their cash flow statement since it gives a clearer picture of how the company is performing since it deals with the actual cash that is coming into and going out of the business.*Image Source: Author/Data Source: MasterCard SEC filingsThe shift towards more financial transactions via cards rather than cash or checks has been a boon for MasterCard. From 2007 through 2016 MasterCard's revenue more than doubled growing a total of 165% over that time. That's good for an annualized growth of revenues of 11.4% per year.MasterCard's rapid revenue growth has led to huge growth in operating cash flow. Over the same period cash flow from operations has grown 21.6% per year or 482% cumulatively.The great thing about MasterCard is that the growth doesn't necessitate a large increase in capital expenditures. The marginal cost of processing another transaction is essentially nil which means operating cash flow growth translates directly into free cash flow growth. Over the same period free cash flow has grown 569% or 23.5% annually.*Image Source: Author/Data Source: MasterCard SEC filingsOne way to examine the profitability of a company is to look at the cash flow margins. The cash flow margins show how much real cash the company generates for every dollar of revenue.Since both operating and free cash flow have significantly outpaced revenue growth MasterCard has drastically improved its cash flow margins. MasterCard's operating cash flow margin grew from 18.9% in 2007 up to 41.6% for 2016 and appears to be settling in around the 40% level. Free cash flow margin has subsequently seen a large increase from 15.1% in 2007 to 38.1% for 2016 with the high 30% level being the norm for the last 6 years.I like to see both operating and free cash flow margin above 10% as a sign of a strong and profitable enterprise. MasterCard is well above that mark on both.Another way to view profitability is the free cash flow return on equity and invested capital. This isn't a standard financial ratio; however, I believe it gives insight into a company. It's the excess cash that a company internally generates above and beyond what is needed to maintain and grow the business for every dollar invested in the business. It's also the amount of cash that one could expect to receive if you owned the entire business compared to the amount of capital in the business. Ideally I want to see both of these over 10%.*Image Source: Author/Data Source: MasterCard SEC filingsSimilar to the cash flow margins MasterCard has done an excellent job growing its free cash flow returns. MasterCard's free cash flow return on equity has expanded from 20% in 2007 up over 70% for 2016. That's an impressive run although a deeper look is necessary since the free cash flow return on capital hasn't seen the same kind of growth.Free cash flow return on equity is a good metric for companies that are keeping a relatively consistent capital structure. That hasn't been the case with MasterCard since 2014 as they started to take on debt. In fact the long term debt to equity ratio has increased from 0% in 2013 up to 92% for 2016 or essentially parity with the equity stake. Although the debt is very manageable and could be paid off with about 1.25 years worth of free cash flow this is still something to keep an eye on moving forward.The shifting capital structure led to the divergence between the two free cash flow return metrics. Free cash flow return on capital appears to be steadying around the 40% level up significantly from the 19% MasterCard obtained in 2007.Free cash flow is the life blood for any successful business. It doesn't matter how much revenue or net income you have, rather it's the amount of cash you actually have moving through the business that matters. Free cash flow is the excess cash above and beyond the capital expenses necessary to both operate and expand the business. That surplus cash can then be used to improve the balance sheet, repurchase shares, invest in other lines of business or pay a dividend to owners. In order to understand how MasterCard uses their free cash flow I like to examine 3 variations of the metric.These 3 variations allow me to see how MasterCard allocates its excess cash as well as whether it internally generates enough cash to fund the entire capital allocation process. Ideally companies will maintain positive FCFaDB since that would mean the business organically generates more cash than the company can use.*Image Source: Author/Data Source: MasterCard SEC filingsAs we saw earlier traditional free cash flow has been strong with tremendous growth from 2007 to 2016. Strong free cash flow generation is the foundation of the capital allocation process.MasterCard has maintained a solid FCFaD over time meaning there's ample coverage of the dividend with free cash flow. The FCF payout ratio has averaged just under 13% for the entire period although it has been closer to 20% for the last 3 years. Despite a rapidly growing dividend MasterCard still has over 80% of its free cash flow available to move even further down the capital allocation chain.MasterCard has a spotty history of maintaining a positive FCFaDB with 5 consecutive positive years followed by 3 negative years more recently. Over the entire period MasterCard has a positive $3.8 B FCFaDB.A negative FCFaDB in any given year isn't a cause for concern rather it's the trend that is important. Companies that consistently have negative FCFaDB will be forced to reduce buybacks in the future, barring a major increase in their free cash flow, or have to access the capital markets to make up for the shortfall.Is It A Buy?Identifying quality businesses that are built to last is only part of the investing equation. The other crucial factor is to purchase them when they are trading at a fair valuation or cheaper. One method that I like to use to determine whether an investment is a purchase candidate is the minimum acceptable rate of return analysis. This entails estimating the future earnings and dividends for a company, applying a reasonable future valuation and determining if the return meets your minimum threshold.On average analysts expect MasterCard to earn $4.26 for fiscal year 2017, $4.96 for fiscal year 2018 and to grow at 14.9% per year for the next 5 years combined. I then assumed that earnings growth would decline to 7% per year for the following 5 years. Annual dividend growth is assumed to track earnings growth in order to maintain a constant payout ratio.Assuming no major changes to the underlying business, the valuation should remain in a fairly steady range. As you can see in the following chart the normalized TTM PE ratio has typically been between 23x and 29x. Considering the rapid growth rate that's a reasonable valuation. For the purpose of the MARR analysis I'll use a range of valuations from 17.5x to 27.5x.MA Normalized PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsThe following table shows the potential annualized returns that MasterCard would generate with a purchase on March 27th at the current price of $111.98. Returns are calculated as internal rates of return through the end of calendar 2022 and 2027 and include estimated dividend payments.*Image Source: AuthorAssuming that MasterCard's earnings growth comes in around the levels forecast here the returns look solid. In the case where the future valuation that investors are willing to pay for MasterCard declining all the way to just 17.5x investors could still expect to receive around market average returns.Realistically the lofty 29x valuation won't be sustainable over the long run as growth will naturally slow as MasterCard continues to get larger.ConclusionMasterCard is a truly wonderful company that gushes excess cash flow. MasterCard's business is effectively a toll road and get to charge a fee for their service. Even better is that the business is still growing by leaps and bounds as the push towards less cash transactions is gaining speed both domestically and internationally.There's a lot to like about MasterCard the business; however, MasterCard the investment isn't quite as appealing to me at this time. The problem is that the current valuation is just too high and investors at current prices shouldn't expect to see investment returns match the growth of the underlying business. Eventually growth will slow for MasterCard and the valuation will contract; although my best guess given the strength of the business is still an above market multiple in the future in the area of 20-23x.Another way to think of the valuation is how many years of earnings growth is already baked into the current share price. The current price is trading at 26.3x 2017's estimates, 22.6x 2018's estimates and 19.9x 2019's estimates. With fiscal year 2017 just barely underway that's nearly 3 years of growth that is already priced in at the current price assuming a 20x valuation is reasonable for MasterCard over the long term. Even though MasterCard is growing rapidly I can't justify giving up 3 years of growth because I wasn't patient enough to wait on better valuations.That might seem like wishful thinking; however, MasterCard was valued between 16x-22.5x at several points from 2010 through 2012. Purchases at those valuations have generated excellent returns due to the high growth of the business as well as the expanding valuation. I would look to establish a long position in MasterCard should the share price decline to $100 or below, preferably in the mid-$90's or lower."
4050681,26891,2017-02-28T18:01:38-05:00,"Visa and MasterCard trade at a very high sales-based valuation. However, this metric should not be used to value these stocks.
        While its earnings-based valuation is high by most investors' metrics, it is far more reasonable than a sales-based valuation.
        These stocks should be bought on a pullback, and justify their premium valuation thanks to a strong business, wide margins, iconic brands and improving fundamentals.","Let's get the first part out of the way: Yes, Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) respectively trade at 12.8 and 11 times their past 12 months worth of sales.That puts it up there with Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY), Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) and Twilio (NYSE:TWLO). Now, I'm not here to say which companies are good, which are bad and whether the valuations are justified. But I would argue that when choosing from the seven stocks above, Visa and MasterCard -- hands down -- would be my choices.A number of investors would probably be surprised to learn that Visa and MasterCard trade will a similar sales-based valuation to these stocks. On past Seeking Alpha articles, I've even seen some users suggest they are wildly overvalued based on sales and that they should be avoided as a result.But they couldn't be more wrong.Visa and MasterCard deserve a premium valuation because they are premium companies. Like Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), they are dividend-growing machines and as a result, they have a place in my dividend-growth portfolio, Future Blue Chips.But aside from these stocks' dividend-growing powers, what makes Visa and MasterCard truly attractive is simple: The business model.The companies are like financial toll booths. To get from Point A to Point B - such as when a consumer purchases groceries or an item online - a cut of that sale goes to the middleman when a credit or debit card is used. In this case, Visa and MasterCard are the middlemen.Not only are consumers moving to a more cash-less lifestyle - i.e. credit and debit cards over cash and checks - but their shopping trends are moving online as well. Both trends have been moving in this direction for years and will continue to do so. As a result, Visa and MasterCard will continue to benefit.And unlike some credit and debit card companies, Visa and MasterCard do not lend consumers money. So while they may not make egregious interest from those consumers' balances, they also are not left holding the bag when someone fails to pay.Like we said, these are toll booth stocks.That does not mean there aren't negatives. When consumer spending takes a hit or a recession comes to life, Visa and MasterCard see their results dip as well, as there are less tolls (transactions) to make money on. Even more recently, when oil prices took a big hit, both companies pegged lower gas prices at the pump as one explanation for why they were experiencing weakness. These stocks are not invincible, but they have a strong moat and a great long-term outlook.Now, About That ValuationJust because a company has a great business, doesn't mean its stock is a great value. But in this case, a sales-based valuation should be overlooked. For starters, the company's margins are absolutely to die for:V Operating Margin (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsV Profit Margin (TTM) data by YChartsAs a result of these fat margins, profits aren't just a minute fraction of the companies' sales like a number of other enterprises. Instead, a large portion of Visa and MasterCard's top-line trickles down to their bottom line.In the end, we end up with stocks that trade at more reasonable earnings-based valuations, with Visa and MasterCard trading at 23x and 22x forward expectations, respectfully.Admittedly, these valuations do not scream, ""Buy! Buy! Buy!"" But over the long-term, purchasing these stocks on ordinary pullbacks of 10% to 20% have led to extraordinary gains. Simply put, the valuation will never seem that attractive. But premium companies with a strong brand, wide margins and exceptional growth will never come cheap.Look at MasterCard for example. Earnings are expected to grow 13% this year and 16.4% next year, according to analysts' estimates. EPS is expected to grow at 14.9% annually for the next five years. That's pretty darn impressive.Visa's expected EPS growth numbers - 19.6%, 16.6% and 16.1% for this year, next year and the next five years, respectively - are even more impressive.Add in the fact that both companies have grown their dividends by double-digits in each of the past five years and the question of whether investors should add these stocks to their portfolio is rather obvious.I would love nothing more than a pullback in order to add to these stocks for more long-term gains. While a tad dated, my article from mid-2016 showed illustrated charts of how I like to invest in these two stocks. Some will disagree with this approach, but it's what has worked for me."
4041514,102551,2017-02-01T11:50:29-05:00,"MasterCard reported Q4 and FY 2016 results on January 31, 2017 that fell short of expectations.The business continues to be performing well, but lofty expectations resulted in a small pullback in the stock price.While MA's PE is just shy of 30, I am willing to pay up for high growth and will acquire additional shares.Should MA's stock price experience a significant correction at a later date (not due to the deterioration of the business), I would just buy more shares to lower my average.","IntroductionI recently reviewed Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) in my Visa - I Will Never Sell This Holding post. Secondly, on January 31, 2017, MasterCard Inc. (NYSE:MA) reported its Q1 2017 results. I thought, therefore, now would be an opportune time to review MA's performance and to ascertain whether to increase our exposure to this name.Before I go any further, some readers of my Visa post raised the issue of bitcoin and blockchain bringing V and MA to their knees. To avoid similar comments on this post, I encourage you to read my VISA - Will Bitcoin Or Blockchain Technology Displace It? post. While my comments were focused solely on what V is doing to address this risk, MA is not sitting idly waiting for new technology to disrupt its business. It is also looking into how it can use this technology to grow its business. Business OverviewFor those of us old enough to remember, MasterCard was once called Master Charge. Did you know, however, that the company's history goes back even further than 1969 when the interlocking circles trademark became synonymous with the Master Charge name?MA has clearly evolved over the past 50 years and today it is essentially a technology company in the global payments industry. It operates a global payments processing network which connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments and businesses in more than 210 countries and territories. It also deals in 150 currencies, meaning a strong US dollar constrains revenue and earnings growth.Next to V, MA is the second largest global payment solutions company. It manages a family of payment card brands, including MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus, which it licenses to its customers. It also provides a variety of services in support of the credit, debit and related payment programs of about 22,000 financial institutions and other types of entities.MA's strategy to drive profitable growth is reflected below and was obtained from the September 7, 2016 Investment Community Meeting presentation.MA's business model is three-tiered:Revenue is generated from fees (domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees, transaction processing fees, and other service fees).As with V, MA follows a ""four-party"" payment system, which typically involves:In addition, it charges operation fees to its customers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related services. These include core authorization, clearing and settlement fees, cross-border and currency conversion fees, switch fees, connectivity fees, acceptance development fees, warning bulletins, holograms, fees for compliance programs, and user-pay fees for a variety of transaction enhancement services.Q4 and FY2016 Financial ResultsFull details can be found in MA's January 31, 2017 earnings release. Highlights are provided below.Q4 ResultsMA reported:MA is renaming ""processed transactions"" to ""switched transactions."" The methodology for calculating this metric has not changed and reflects the transaction counts that MA has authorized, cleared or settled.FY2016 Consolidated ResultsStrong FCF continues to be generated which will support share repurchases. $4.7B remains to be repurchased under current repurchase program authorizations.MA recently announced a $0.03 increase in its quarterly dividend from $0.19 to $0.22 effective with the February 9, 2017 payment date.Outlook for Fiscal 2017In the January 31, 2017 conference call, MA indicated that revenue growth in the first half of 2017 is likely to be lower than in the second half due to higher incentives.The strong US dollar, already near a 14-year high against the euro, is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by about 2% and net earnings by about 3%. MA expects further appreciation if the U.S. economy picks up speed and inflation rises under the Trump administration.Low double-digit percentage revenue growth and EPS growth in the mid-teens is expected.Full-year operating expenses are expected to increase by a high single-digit percentage on a currency-neutral basis.ValuationMA's shares are never inexpensive and its current PE is just under 29.50 (current price as I compose this post is roughly $106.33). Personally, this is far greater than I like, but if I had waited for MA to have a sub 20 PE, I would still be sitting on the sidelines.Even though the dividend has been increased to $0.88 for FY2017, the dividend yield is sub 1%. Clearly, the dividend yield on MA will not be the primary metric that will sway your decision to buy the stock.Given the high growth nature of the business, I am prepared to pay up to acquire MA shares. Should a major market correction occur that sends MA's stock price spiraling downward, I would just acquire more shares to lower my average cost.If I use the current mean 2017 EPS estimate of $4.27 which is based on input from 32 brokers and the current PE of 29.50 (approx.), I get a stock price of almost $126; the current price compares favorably with this figure.Source: TD Bank WebBrokerFinal ThoughtsI recognize some readers may view MA as being too rich and would prefer that some major market correction occur before pulling the trigger. No problem. That is your prerogative.I also recognize that MA's minuscule dividend yield (sub 1%) will turn off other investors. For those readers, I encourage you to read my Do Low Or No Dividend Yield Companies Belong In Your Portfolio? post.Despite MA's lofty valuation, I intend to acquire more shares within the next 72 hours.I will most likely do this through one, or more, of our Tax Free Savings Accounts (TFSA) versus our FFJ Portfolio. While I will get hit with a 15% withholding tax on all MA dividends, the dividend is not what is driving this additional purchase. The purchase of MA is primarily for the anticipated future capital gains. By holding MA in TFSA accounts, I will incur no capital gains tax should we ever sell at a later date.

4055727,72015,2017-03-16T09:21:15-04:00,"I developed a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to evaluate shares of MasterCard.35 scenarios were run, using 7 discount rates and 5 long-term growth rates.If you assume a growth rate of 3% or greater, MasterCard shares appear undervalued.However, once the growth rate drops below 3%, the DCF method does not view MasterCard favorably at its current share price.","The DCF (discounted cash flow) method of attempting to place a present value on an investment is often written about by authors on this website, used by research analysts all over Wall Street and taught in every business school in the world.Certainly DCF modeling can be a useful part of one's toolkit when analyzing an investment. However, I find that the results of a DCF analysis can be heavily skewed by making minor changes to its inputs. Specifically, slight modifications to the terminal growth rate or WACC (weighted average cost of capital) can sometimes change the resulting model price by 10-20%.To help solve this problem, I have approached things from a different angle and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) will serve as my first test subject. I developed a fairly simple DCF model that looks back at five years of corporate history to estimate two important ratios:Utilizing analyst consensus revenue estimates for the current calendar year and the upcoming year serves to predict near-term sales growth. The sales growth rate is then estimated to decline in a linear fashion over the next five years (from 2018-2022) until it reaches the long-term growth rate.The interesting part about this model is that it runs 35 scenarios to develop 35 different ""target prices"" for each security. Five long-term growth rates are used (ranging from 2% to 4% in half-percent increments) along with seven discount [WACC] rates (7% to 10%, also in half-percent increments).By using one's own estimate of long-term growth and an appropriate discount rate, each individual investor can come up with their own target price for the security in question.For MasterCard, we can look back at the following data from the past five years (source: Morningstar.com)This allows us to find the average Operating Cash Flow / Revenue (41.83%) and average Capital Expenditures / Revenue (3.43%). Given MasterCard's impressive return on assets (23%) and return on invested capital (41%), it should not be surprising that the firm generates strong levels of cash flow from each dollar of revenue and has fairly minimal cap-ex spending.Using the analyst consensus revenue forecasts for 2017 and 2018 (source: Yahoo! Finance) leads to the following pro-forma free cash flow [FCF] projection (this particular iteration uses a 3% long-term growth rate, but remember, the model was run at 2%, 2.5%, 3%, 3.5% and 4%):These free cash flows (along with a terminal free cash flow estimate) are then discounted back to the present time using the discount rate (8% in this iteration). After adjusting for MasterCard's negative net debt [cash] of over $3 billion and its number of shares outstanding, the model spits out a target price of $112.43 (and while shares closed today at $112, that level of similarity is fairly impressive, but not intentional).So does this result mean that MasterCard shares are currently fairly valued? Maybe - but only if you agree with the assumptions outlined above (specifically the 3% perpetual growth rate and 8% discount rate). What if you think that the long-term growth rate should instead be 3.5% and that 7.5% is a more appropriate discount rate? Those slight modifications raise the target price by nearly $26 to $138!As previously mentioned, small changes to assumptions can lead to significantly higher or lower intrinsic values. Below, I have summarized the results of 35 different simulations of the model using a range of long-term growth estimates and discount rates. The target prices range from $73.58 to $180.62 - those highlighted in red are more than 10% below the current share price, while those highlighted in green are more than 10% above the current share price:I encourage readers of this article to share their opinions of a reasonable long-term growth estimate and WACC for MasterCard in the comments section below. Those currently buying shares of MasterCard are likely expecting long-term growth of at least 3% and believe a discount rate of 8% or lower is reasonable. However, if you assume long-term future growth of less than 3%, the current share price begins to look dangerously overvalued at most discount rates."
4050365,36431,2017-02-28T08:50:54-05:00,MasterCard's fiscal 2016 experienced improvement in capital allocation metrics.Adjusting for currency translation - how much different do things look?Valuations continue to remain elevated.,"MasterCard (NYSE:MA) is my kind of business. It mints money and earns economic profits, operates in a duopolistic industry with high barriers to entry, and has built-in inflation insurance (prices go up, so does the amount swiped on your debit or credit card).Why I love MasterCard...It's one of those rare businesses with a very, very wide moat, and this shows through in the numbers. I built the below ROIC-WACC model in Excel using data from its financial statements to illustrate this concept.We can see that the firm earns wide economic profits when looking at headline return on invested capital, or ROIC, and as long as its main competitor is Visa (NYSE:V) and people still use credit/debit cards (or even just the payment networks set up by V and MA), I don't see this changing. Much of the world still uses cash, so I think there's definitely the potential for a long tail wind of growth going forward as well.One thing I've recently noticed, however, is many companies are receiving a boost in ROIC and return on equity (discussed later) because of shrinking equity. This is apparent even with solid companies like MA that continue to increase retained earnings.MA Shareholders Equity (Annual) data by YChartsIt appears that this phenomenon is driven mostly by two things:1.) buybacks, and...2.) negative currency headwindsWe can slightly adjust for this by excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss, or AOCL, from equity. Some may argue this presents a better picture of economic reality and removes some of the distorting effects that are a result of Forex. For those interested, I created the below chart.This repairs equity somewhat, expanding the overall capital base and thus bringing down ROIC by a few percentage points - but ROIC remains exceptional regardless.The equity slice looks even more impressiveNext I want to analyze return on equity, or ROE, with a five part DuPont analysis.Operating margins increased year-over-year and remain enviably high, despite being stuck below peak margins from 2014. Looking closer at the firm's financial statements sheds some more light on this subject, however.MasterCard apparently gets sued a lot, with provision for litigation expense at $117 million for fiscal 2016 and $61 million for 2015. This took chunks out of EBIT during these years, thus also dragging down EBIT margins. There was no charge in fiscal 2014, explaining the higher margins. While I was tempted to remove these charges as ""non-recurring"", I quickly noticed that they have actually occurred every fiscal year going back 5 years - except in 2014. I'd classify them as recurring, therefore.Asset turnover also improved year-over-year, as the growth in sales (which are usually clipped by currency headwinds) outpaced the growth in assets. Negative currency effects eroding equity also partially explains the firm's higher ROE, due to their contribution to increasing leverage. This leverage distorts ROE by magnifying it, and has jumped significantly higher over the last three years specifically.As mentioned earlier in the article, we can exclude AOCL to get a ballpark figure that might better reflect economic reality. I created an adjusted model specifically for this purpose below.Excluding AOCL and holding everything else constant smoothes both ROE and leverage, and I think underlying ROE remains strong and is likely improving slightly overall. It should also be noted that overall equity continues to shrink, however, which I'd primarily chalk up to buybacks.ConclusionI own Visa, but also want to own MA, as both appear to be above-average operations with a long runway for growth ahead of them. At roughly 26 times expected earnings for this year and a tad over 22 times next year's expected earnings, MA shares are hardly cheap. They are slightly discounted versus Visa shares however, which trade at roughly 26.5 times this year's expected earnings and almost 23 times 2018's estimates.Is that cheap enough? I'm not exactly sure, but a 5% to 10% dip would get me much more interested.If you enjoyed this article and would like to receive further updates and articles in the future, please feel free to hit the ""Follow"" button at the top of the page by the author's name."
4041092,33291,2017-01-31T13:15:03-05:00,"I have had 'didn't buy remorse' on the name for some time.Q4 earnings are out and I discuss the results.With shares appearing like they will head lower today, should you buy?","MasterCard (NYSE:MA) is a name I wish I bought five years ago. I was seriously considering it, but never got in. I recently discussed my remorse over failing to buy this one. Same thing three years ago. And again last year. I can however only own so many names without becoming my own mutual fund. I digress. The stock has pulled back a bit from all-time highs, and this morning it looks to head lower following so-so earnings. MasterCard is up about 20% from where I recommended it at $90 a share even if it pulls back today in the market. Thus, I wanted to check in on the name to see if this is a rare buying opportunity, or if there are legitimate performance concerns that would impact this name going forward.Well, the company just announced its Q4 earnings. Once again, I am impressed because the results indicate that the company will continue its slow but reliable growth. Net revenue for the quarter came in at $2.76 billion, a 9.5% increase over Q4 2015. This was primarily due to a 9% jump in gross dollar volume and an 17% increase in processed transactions to approximately 15.2 billion. I want to point out that the company is not moving away from using the term processed transactions, and will subsequently use the term 'switched transactions.' This growth is pretty sizable growth for a long-standing company like MasterCard. So revenues were up nicely but missed expectations very slightly by $30 million.That said, expenses fell year-over-year versus last year. That is music to my ears as they say. Total operating expenses, as reported, were actually down 1% year-over-year. However, we really have to consider currency changes. When we adjust for changes in currency, we see operating expenses were flat. Total operating expenses were $1.4 billion for several reasons, and when we adjust for special items were in fact down 1% on a constant dollar basis. The decline was primarily due to the ongoing cost management initiatives and strategic initiatives. All of this led to operating income increasing 23% as reported. However, it was still up a whopping 22% when currency adjusted year-over-year. Operating margins were a strong 49.8%, though this is down from the sequential quarter.Factoring in the growth in revenues and the expenses of the company, it reported net income of $933 million, an increase of 5% as reported. Once again, adjusting to a constant currency basis, net income actually was up 4% year-over-year. This translated to earnings per share of $0.86, which beat estimates by a penny. All in all, it was a strong quarter and the only issues with the quarter was lighter than expected revenues.To be clear, these numbers are decent once again. Revenues were up nicely year-over-year and but missed estimates. Earnings delivered a beat thanks to fiscal discipline on the expense side of the equation. On top of it all, the company continues to be shareholder friendly. During Q4 2016, MasterCard bought back 11 million shares for approximately $1.1 billion. Here in the present Q1 2017, the company has bought back another 2.3 million shares at a cost of approximately $247 million (through 1/26/17). There is still another $4.7 billion remaining under the current repurchase program authorization. My only problem with the company is its weak dividend. The company did make a move to raise its dividend, and now pays an $0.88 annual dividend; $0.22 quarterly. This only translates to a 0.81% yield. While a dividend is shareholder friendly, I expect this dividend to grow in the coming years. I remain bullish.Note from the author: Christopher F.

This growth is pretty sizable growth for a long-standing company like MasterCard. So revenues were up nicely and managed to beat expectations very slightly by $70 million. That is a win for those holding the name.But what about earnings? Well these are driven by revenues and expenses as we all know. That said, expenses grew year over year versus last year by 12%, or 11% on an adjusted basis. While I hate to see rising expenses, given that revenues were up almost 12%, it's a wash. That is, we can absorb the rise in expenses and still see a bump in earnings. However, we really have to consider currency changes. When we adjust for changes in currency, we see operating expenses were still up 11%.Total operating expenses were $1.2 billion for several reasons, and when we adjust for special items were just under $1.2 billion on a constant dollar basis. The increase was primarily spending related to strategic initiatives, as well as higher promotional spending. All of this led to operating income increasing 12% as reported. Operating margins were a strong 55.6%, up from last year's 55.1% and up dramatically from the 49% in the sequential quarter.Factoring in the growth in revenues and the expenses of the company, it reported net income of $1.1 billion, an increase of 13% as reported. Once again, adjusting to a constant currency basis, net income actually was up 14% year over year. This translated to earnings per share of $1.01, up from $0.86 last year. Further this beat estimates by a strong $0.06. All in all, it was a strong quarter and the only issues with the quarter was that rise in expenses in my estimation, which really didn't weigh.Revenues were up nicely year over year and beat estimates. Earnings delivered a beat thanks to fiscal discipline and a strong increase in the top line. Further, the company continues to be shareholder-friendly. During Q1 2017, MasterCard bought back 9 million shares for approximately $1.0 billion. Here in the present Q1 2017, the company has bought back another 2.4 million shares at a cost of approximately $272 million (through 4/27/17).There is still another $3.8 billion remaining under the current repurchase program authorization. Finally, if I have to complain about something I will reiterate that my only problem with the company is its weak dividend. The company did make a move to raise its dividend, and now pays an $0.88 annual dividend, $0.22 quarterly. This only translates to a 0.75% yield. While a dividend is shareholder-friendly, I expect this dividend to grow in the coming years. I remain bullish.Note from the author: Quad 7 Capital has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012.

A $30 million miss on revenue of $2.76 Billion comes out to -1.09%.But if we move on from that point and look at the actual results, we will find that the company actually had a very strong report, especially when you consider that it is reporting in US dollars and that the US Dollar Index during the last quarter rocketed upward.Then when you factor in that MasterCard deals in 150 currencies, it becomes mindboggling to think of what management had to go through in order to deal with the incredible volatility that the currency markets endured over the last quarter. As reported by MasterCard, the value of transactions made by card holders outside the home country of the card-issuer, increased 13 percent and that the company processed more than 65,000 transactions every minute. That resulted in its gross dollar volume of transactions going up 9 percent to $1.2 trillion on a local currency basis.MasterCard also reported that it was dealing with a higher tax rate this quarter on a year on year basis, as its PowerPoint below shows.The effective tax rate was 28.7% vs. 13.1% for the same comparable quarter in 2015, turned out to be a serious headwind, which MasterCard was able to overcome.After seeing this slight miss on revenue from MasterCard, investors may now start to worry about the company's main competitor Visa (NYSE:V) and how it may do when it reports on February 2, 2017?In this article, I will present a real-time quantitative analysis of both companies employing a unique ratio that will demonstrate the power of free cash flow in the investment process and then give an opinion on how an investor should act based on my results.When analyzing almost any company, concentrate on its free cash flow generation, as that is where the rubber hits the road when it comes to finding out the truth. Before I show you the long-term Datafile for MasterCard, let us first do a TTM (trailing-twelve month) analysis of its Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow and then compare it to its current price.Here are the two ratios that we will be using in our analysis, and for those new to this type of analysis, one can get a good introduction by reading my analysis of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) by clicking here.Price-to-Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio = Sherlock Debt Divisor/ [(net income per share + depreciation per share) + (capital spending per diluted share)]Sherlock Debt Divisor = Market Price Per Share - [((Working Capital - Long-Term Debt)/Diluted Shares Outstanding)]MasterCardMarket Price Per Share = $109.30Working Capital = Total Current Assets - Total Current LiabilitiesTotal Current Assets = $11,776,000,000Total Current Liabilities = $7,121,000,000Working Capital = $4,655,000,000Long-Term Debt = $3,326,000,000Diluted Shares Outstanding = 1,099,000,000Sherlock Debt Divisor = Market Price Per Share - ((Working Capital - Long-Term Debt)/Diluted Shares Outstanding))Sherlock Debt Divisor = $109.30 - (($4,655,000,000 - $3,326,000,000)/ 1,099,000,000))Sherlock Debt Divisor = $109.30 - $1.21 = $108.09Since MasterCard has less Long-Term Debt vs. Working Capital, we therefore must reward it and use the $108.09 result as the new numerator in all our calculations.Price-to-Bernhard/Buffett Ratio = Sherlock Debt Divisor/ [(net income per share + depreciation per share) + (capital spending per diluted share)]Sherlock Debt Divisor = $108.09Net Income per diluted share = $4,016,000,000/1,099,000,000= $3.65Depreciation per diluted share = $1,207,000,000/1,099,000,000= $1.09Capital Spending per diluted share = $-208,000,000/1,099,000,000 = $-0.19$3.65 + $1.09 + ($-0.19) = $4.55Price-to-Bernhard/Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio = $108.09/$4.55 = 23.76Now if you go to my Friedrich Legend (on what is considered a good or bad result), you will notice that our result of 23.76 is an average result.We last ran our Datafile for MasterCard on January 31, 2017, and our Friedrich Algorithm gave a recommendation to our subscribers to hold it.Here is the chart of our Price-to-Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow ratio results for MasterCard:The Price-to-Bernhard Buffett Ratio considers a stock a bargain when it trades under 15 times and overbought when it trades over 30 times. Therefore, from the current results in the chart above, MasterCard comes in as a ""HOLD"".Let us now compare those results to its main competitor Visa.Here is our Price-to-Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow Analysis for Visa.VisaMarket Price Per Share = $83.70Working Capital = Total Current Assets - Total Current LiabilitiesTotal Current Assets = $14,313,000,000Total Current Liabilities = $8,046,000,000Working Capital = $6,267,000,000Long-Term Debt = $15,882,000,000Diluted Shares Outstanding = 2,414,000,000Sherlock Debt Divisor = Market Price Per Share - ((Working Capital - Long-Term Debt)/Diluted Shares Outstanding)Sherlock Debt Divisor = $83.70 - (($6,270,000,000 - $15,882,000,000)/ 2,414,000,000))Sherlock Debt Divisor = $83.70 - ($-3.98) = $87.68Since Visa has more Long-Term Debt vs. Working Capital, we therefore must punish it and use the $87.68 result as the new numerator in all our calculations.Price-to-Bernhard/Buffett Ratio = Sherlock Debt Divisor/ [(net income per share + depreciation per share) + (capital spending per diluted share)]Sherlock Debt Divisor = $87.68Net Income per diluted share = $5,991,000,000/2,414,000,000= $2.48Depreciation per diluted share = $502,000,000/2,414,000,000= $0.21Capital Spending per diluted share = $-523,000,000/2,414,000,000= $-0.22$2.48 + $0.21 + ($-0.22) = $2.47Price-to-Bernhard/Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio = $87.68/$2.47 =35.5035.50 is considered a poor result for this ratio, but the reason Visa's numbers came in so poorly is because it recently merged with Visa Europe and it had to take special charges due to the merger. Our analysis is done with GAAP results and not Pro Forma, so we do not adjust, but report ""as is"". The deal is a win-win for both companies as the merged company will have the following stats going forward:Thus, an investor in Visa needs to ignore the latest GAAP one-time events and wait to pass judgment once the merged Visa's financial results are presented. Until then the company's results look overvalued, but should dramatically improve, once we get the updated figures from the company.Going forward, I am looking forward to when Visa reports, so I can get the additional data from the newly merged company. MasterCard had an excellent report, when you adjust for the year on year higher tax rate comparison. Each is experiencing legal problems as governments tend to try and fine successful firms, simply because government officials can't seem to believe that MasterCard and Visa can be as successful as each is and thus believe that there must be something wrong somewhere? That is why MasterCard and Visa have an armada of lawyers protecting them from such harassment. Both companies are very long term (if not permanent holdings) in my client portfolios, as I consider both to be Buffett style ""Toll Bridges"" and I love to invest in such companies. The future for both companies is very bright, so I sleep well owning them for my clients.In conclusion, it is my belief that free cash flow analysis is the ultimate tool when analyzing companies, and my hope is that you may add these ratios to your own investor tool box in order to help you in your own due diligence.

4025350,86776,2016-11-22T01:13:42-05:00,,"Fact. Digital commerce has been a reality for more than two decades.Fact. The launch of the iPhone in 2007 and the App Store in 2008 opened everyone’s eyes to the impact that mobile would have on payments and commerce.Fact. Twenty years and hundreds of millions of smartphones later, the digital payments experience is anything but consistent anywhere - online, in-store and in-app.There are lots of reasons for that inconsistency.No one really thought to focus much on “digital” since so much of retail sales still happened in the physical store. Why bother putting money into the 3 percent of sales happening online when 97 percent was still done in physical stores using plastic cards that worked just fine? And until foot traffic started to drop in those stores and categories like books, clothes and sporting goods began to shift significant chunks of those sales online, there seemed to be no real reason to shift focus.At the same time, consumers began to use their mobile devices to discover the things that they wanted to buy but increasingly abandoned those purchases given the frictions encountered along the way.The same frictions that consumers tolerated when transacting on a laptop or desktop - typing in card numbers, shipping and billing addresses - were simply not tolerated when shopping on a mobile device. Merchants lost sales to those online retailers that could make the buying process easy, secure and consistent.A number of digital wallet enablers have emerged, in force, over the last five or so years to take their place alongside the early digital payments pioneers - PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) - with the promise to help merchants seize that opportunity. The chicken-and-egg game of acceptance and adoption has intensified as merchants look for options that help them find incremental sales and customers and consumers look for options to reduce friction in their online shopping experience.Increasingly, consumers and merchants want even more than that. Like the plastic cards snuggled in their wallets today, they want a payments experience that’s largely consistent across all of the shopping channels that they use today and may emerge tomorrow.MasterCard (NYSE:MA) EVP of Digital Channels and Regions Jorn Lambert told me last week that MasterCard believes there’s another reason for this inconsistency: the absence of a framework or a set of principles that everyone in the business of enabling digital payments ascribes to.Lambert told me that diversity of experience and value proposition are only as good as the foundation upon which the digital payments experience is built. He strongly believes that, in a time of great disruption and technological change - as we are experiencing in payments and commerce - a core set of principles that everyone embraces is the only way that we can accelerate our digital payments progress as a connected commerce ecosystem. Without one, he asserts, we’re all left with, more or less, a high-tech Tower of Babel.So, he said, MasterCard decided to do something about it.Today, it’s issuing a digital payments call to action: four principles that Lambert and MasterCard said are aimed at accelerating the movement toward digital payment adoption.I sat down with Lambert to understand why those four principles - accessibility, transparency, security and privacy - will make it easier for consumers and merchants to embrace the digital payments movement.KW: Why does the industry need a digital payments ""call to action,"" and why did MasterCard decide to take on the role of industry convener in that regard?We think that’s great since these new environments will reach new users and enable new technologies to deliver great consumer and merchant experiences.But with that great opportunity comes complexity - and the potential for confusion on the part of merchants and consumers. Each solution - and digital payments enabler - has slightly different objectives and a slightly different emphasis as they move to deploy their solutions. And they may not even have a clear understanding of what other stakeholders in the value chain are looking for. We spent a lot of time talking to stakeholders - consumers, merchants, issuers and new entrants to the payments ecosystem - and have concluded that there is a strong need - and even a strong demand - to rally around a number of common principles.These principles - accessibility, transparency, security and privacy - are essential to reduce the complexity and streamline the ability to scale digital payments in a very safe and secure way. Our goal isn’t to dictate standards but rather provide a consistent framework to simplify how digital payments take shape.KW: We’ve learned over the last two years that there are things that consumers do value and don’t value as part of their digital payments experience. As I look at this call to action and your four principles, they seem to be driven by what is good for the consumer. Was that by design?JL: Yes, it was. Consumers can lose confidence in what we are collectively trying to achieve. Of course, all stakeholders have to be on board when any new technology in payments is being introduced, but consumers need to be convinced that this is good for them or else we will all fail. Similarly, even when there is consumer demand, merchants need to believe that adopting a technology is in their best interests in order for acceptance to expand and the ecosystem to thrive.KW: Accessibility - so critical. We’ve certainly learned the importance of ubiquity, which reduces uncertainty. But what you seem to be implying with “accessibility” is that just having universal acceptance isn’t enough. Having a consistent experience with their digital payment provider across all points of transacting is even more critical. We certainly don’t have that today…JL: I think it’s the predictability that we’re trying to emphasize here. Consumers need to know if it’s going to work - if it doesn’t, they won’t bother. We think that it’s perfectly reasonable for the MasterCard cardholder to expect that the solution will work with all standard MasterCard interfaces. Similarly, merchants should be able to reach as many cardholders as possible when they spend the time and money to integrate with a new technology. So, we think that accessibility is critical for both consumers and merchants.KW: Transparency - your second principle. That’s about consumers seeing an acceptance mark like they do today - in this case, masterpass - and then the issuer’s brand that enables them to complete the transaction. Your hypothesis is that it is the combination of network brand - MasterCard - and issuer brand that increases consumer comfort and stimulates usage and adoption.JL: Yes, it is truly a combination of both. There are a number of benefits - some are delivered by the network, and others are delivered by the issuer. It’s only fair that the consumer, when making their transaction, clearly knows which products they are using, that they will be participating in the rewards that those products offer, etc. We think that it has to be the case that digital wallets not make it difficult for consumers to make that connection.KW: Got it. But as commerce becomes more contextual and connected devices proliferate, transparency gets tricky - Uber (NYSE:UBER) is a great example of that. How does a digital payments player adhere to the principle of transparency in a world in which, sometimes, opaqueness is not intentional, it’s just part of making the process friction-free for the consumer?JL: Certainly, we don’t want to introduce unnecessary steps in the process. But even in these environments, there’s an opportunity to introduce transparency. It’s quite easy, we think, to notify the consumer that they’ve just made a purchase using their MasterCard card. It’s all about the design of the experience and making sure that consumers always understand what they are using to complete their transaction.KW: Security - it’s table stakes for sure. And no one, I hope, argues that security isn’t important in the digital payments world. Why does this need to be called out as a principle?JL: I think consumers are still very nervous, and we have a lot of work to do to reassure them that, even if their credentials are stored in a digital wallet, that these credentials are protected and, even if compromised, useless to fraudsters. So, from our standpoint, it’s about the consistency of the security standard - and that is tokenization.Consumers not only want a sense of security, but they also want to have a sense of control. Consumers can have credentials in many places, some of which they may have even forgotten about. We want consumers to know that, if they have credentials out there in a digital payments account, that they have control over how that information is used. Tokenization can put the consumer back in control.We think that there is a real consumer angle here that, as an industry, we can all rally around and where we also think banks have an inherent advantage. Similarly, tokenization provides many advantages to merchants - tokens provide industry standard security, reduce risk in the system by removing real card numbers and result in higher approval rates.Tokenization is very well-adopted in many banks, but it is still very early days. We want to make sure that, as an industry, we keep moving the tokenization standard forward since it has proven to be a very effective way to secure digital payments. We feel strongly that, as other players enter payments and the digital payments area specifically, we want to be very clear that digital credentials should be tokenized. We will then be better able to build on this secure foundation and innovate in a variety of ways to authenticate consumers more strongly using biometrics, for example. We feel an obligation to protect the integrity of the payments ecosystem so that consumers and merchants continue to feel confident that their transacting environments are secure.KW: Let’s talk about privacy. Why did you decide to make this one of your four principles?JL: Yes - MasterCard builds privacy and data protection into the fabric of our business and has a longstanding commitment to privacy. We value privacy because of its value to people. We believe our customers, cardholders and merchants have a right to understand how their data is handled, and we consider it our responsibility to provide them with the most current and state-of-the-art privacy and security protections available. We, and our partners, use the data only for the purposes for which it was provided.KW: So, we have these four principles. How do you hope the ecosystem will react to seeing them? What is your expectation for putting this out there?JL: I’m hoping that most people will agree and embrace this. We believe that, as a result of making these principles very visible to consumers, that they will know that, when they use their issuer branded MasterCard, they can do so with confidence.For the industry, we hope that embracing this framework will accelerate the path to digital payments adoption, and for merchants, that they can increase conversions, with the knowledge that those transactions are conducted in a secure and private manner. Issuers, we hope, will be better able to connect with their cardholders in a digital manner and deliver richer, more rewarding experiences, and that more consumer adoption of digital will mean more merchants will enable acceptance of digital payments as well.KW: Sounds to me like this is more than just a suggestion that the industry rally around four principles but rather a call to action for the ecosystem of commerce and payments to visibly and vocally get behind them and adapt their digital payments plans accordingly. Am I wrong about that?JL: Not at all. This really did start out as a way for us to think about our own digital payments strategy and roadmap - more or less, evidence of our own commitment to increasing adoption of digital payments. It’s evolved to become a call to action for others to join that commitment based on the many conversations we have had across the ecosystem, globally.We think these principles are essential and that the lack of consistency in how they are interpreted by the many digital payments solutions out there has held all of us back for too long. It’s time to move forward, together, as an ecosystem, for the benefit of the many consumers and merchants who want to embrace a digital future and enjoy all of the promise and potential that it holds."
4028332,87586,2016-12-05T14:49:58-05:00,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on the 9th of November to cease legal tender of the two largest bills in circulation.The two bills form more than 80% of the total bills in circulation.Lack of smaller denomination bills at banks means that payments processing firms like Visa and Mastercard will benefit from consumers substitution effect.Low penetration of cards in circulation and the low adoption of point-of-sales systems in India, however, means that any migration to plastic will be limited in the near term.Current consensus estimates for Visa and Mastercard have not accounted on near-term migration to plastic, upward revision of earnings is a near-term catalyst.","Introduction:In a bid to curb the spread of black money, the 500 and 1,000 Indian rupee notes will cease to be legal tender from the 9th of November in India. The move by Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to recover illegal income and curb tax evasion. In this report, we take an in-depth look at the Indian market and the impact of this move for payments processing firms Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA).Surprise announcement by PM ModiPM Narendra Modi's announced on the 9th of November to wipe out more than 80% of the country's two largest bills in circulation, the 500 ($7.30) and 1,000 Indian rupee notes in an effort to crack down on corruption and tax evasion. This means that those holding large cash holdings of the two bills will be required to declare them to the tax authorities. The move will see Indians who have stockpiled undeclared income come out of the shadows.According to The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the 500 and 1,000 Indian rupee notes form more than 80% of the total bills in circulation. In its place, the Indian administration intends to replace this with the new 500 and 2,000 Indian rupee bills.The surprise move, however, has caught the country by surprise and forced many to scramble to the ATMs. According to a New York Times report, many who had to stand in line outside banks for hours were unable to exchange the bills as the banks had run out of the smaller denomination 100 rupee notes.Benefit to Payment Processing FirmsHow does the above move benefit the payment processing firms?According to estimates, over 98% of transactions in India is done by cash. The surprise move by the Indian administration caught the entire country by shock with a report by Bloomberg citing anonymous government officials admitting that the government is ""…falling short of meeting requirements for 100-rupee notes.""This means that Indians who are unable to exchange for the smaller bills are now struggling to get basic necessities. The other alternative then is to use their debit and/or their credit card to make any purchases, benefiting payment processing firms like V and MA.Regular followers of MA will recall that chief executive officer (CEO) of MA Ajay Banga (an Indian native) has long declared his support for taking cash out of the system. The recent move by the Indian government has already been hailed by MA as a ""critical step in positioning India to be a leader in the global cashless and digital economy movement"".Overview of Indian Payments marketI will now attempt to provide data on the size of the payments market for India.According to data from Bloomberg, real GDP in India expanded by 6.6% and 7.2% in FY14 and FY15, respectively. For FY17 and FY18, consensus estimates are for them to grow at 7.4% and 7.6%, respectively. This remarkable growth rate puts India amongst the world's fastest growing economies.Source: BloombergDespite this, however, India still lags behind the rest of the developing countries like Brazil, Russia, and China. According to RBI, more than 50% of Indian adults held an account with a financial institution compared with nearly 70% of adults in the other BRIC economies. Dormancy rates of these accounts, however, remained high at about 28% as Indian households typically hold their wealth in cash.According to data from RBI, India has about 660 million debit cards in circulation and 23 million credit cards in force compared to their population of 1.3 billion. Whilst the numbers for debit card might seem meaningful, 87% of debit card usage is for cash withdrawals at ATMs. This makes any significant increase in the near-term usage of both the debit and credit cards unlikely.In addition, the high cost of acceptance infrastructure in India also means that the acceptance of debit and credit cards are low in India. According to a study done by Visa, the cost of a point-of-sale (POS) terminal in India ranges from INR 8,000 ($118) to INR 12,000 ($178); countervailing duties and taxes account for 20% of the price. The annual operating cost is INR 3,000 ($44.60) to INR 4,000 ($59) per terminal. The high cost associated with the terminals means that merchants are currently unequipped with the terminals to accept card transactions.ConsiderationsReports of suicides and fights taking place on a daily basis because of the inability to exchange for smaller bills at banks have also emerged, highlighting the problem at hand. The Indian administration will also likely require six more months than previously estimated, this according to Saumitra Chaudhuri, an economist who advised the previous Indian administration. All this will almost certainly benefit payment processing firms like V and MA in the near to mid-term as consumers migrate to plastic because of the limited supply of smaller denomination bills.That said, the low penetration of cards in circulation at the moment and the low adoption of POS terminals in India due to the high cost also means that the near-term effect of such a move will be fairly limited (more on this in Part II). In the longer term, though, after the entire fiasco, India might also revert back to the use of cash as there is little to discourage the underground economy from reverting back to business as usual. There is more that will need to be done to curb the underground economy than ceasing the legal tender of two bills.Final ThoughtsAnalysts currently expect V and MA to report 17% and 14% earnings growth, respectively for FY17, and have not taken into account the latest move by the Indian government.Source: BloombergThe street is currently still looking to estimate the impact of the above move by the Indian government, and any upward revision of its numbers in the upcoming weeks or months will be a catalyst for V and MA, which are currently trading at 21x and 24x of next year's earnings, respectively. V and MA do not give an individual breakdown of revenue from India, but MA derives a greater percentage of its revenue - 61% - from overseas vs. V's 47%.I am currently long both V and MA."
4029969,33291,2016-12-12T13:31:56-05:00,I discuss my previous experience with failing to buy MA.I talk about what I called on the company to do.The company has responded in a manner that indicates why it is a strong buy.,"MasterCard (NYSE:MA) is a company that everyone in America probably knows, and most people in developed nations are likely familiar with. All I can think is 'why didn't I buy this name?' The business model has only improved over the years as consumers have moved away from physical assets and cash for purchases, to more electronic means. MasterCard is up about 20% from where I recommended it at $90 a share. I shared with you a few months ago about how I had ""didn't buy remorse"" over the name. Some of the items I discussed about potential changes I would have liked to have seen from the company have come to fruition.Before delving into those changes let me just first say that when the company announced its Q3 earnings I was once again impressed because the results indicated that the company will continue its slow but reliable growth. Net revenue for the quarter came in at $2.88 billion, a 14% increase over Q3 2015. This was primarily due to an 11% jump in gross dollar volume and an 18% increase in processed transactions to approximately 14.5 billion. That is pretty sizable growth for a long-standing company like MasterCard. Further, global purchasing volumes rose another 9% to over $882 billion year over year. So revenues were up nicely and they beat expectations very slightly by $130 million. Considering expenses, operating margins were a strong 58%.Taken as a whole, the company reported net income of $1.2 billion, a dramatic rise of 21% as reported. Once again, adjusting to a constant currency basis, net income actually declined 2% year over year. This translated to earnings per share of $1.08, which beat estimates by a very strong $0.10. All in all, it was a strong quarter and the only issues with the quarter related to European Union regulatory changes, which hampered growth. To be clear, these numbers were strong once again.Now, in my last piece I said very plainly that the company continues to be shareholder friendly, ""but not as friendly as I would like"". What is more, I went on to tell you that the company pays a $0.76 annual dividend; $0.19 quarterly. I stated:Well my friends, it seems the company is in agreement with me, and with the stock still a few points off its all-time high, I find myself once again with a ""didn't buy remorse"". Why? We just learned two key things regarding share buybacks and dividend. First, the company has just announced a new share repurchase program. This one is authorized at $4 billion dollars. I will point out the current program had just over $1 billion remaining on it. The new share repurchase program will become effective at the completion of the company's previously announced $4 billion share repurchase program. Second, the company boosted the dividend. The company raised the dividend 16% to $0.22 per share quarterly. The first new payout will be February 9th with an ex-dividend date of January 5th. Now, this hike still means the company is yielding under 1%, but it is a major move in the right direction considering how flush with cash the company is.Bottom line? The name is still a strong buy going forward. The company is doing right by shareholders to increase value and up the payout of its dividend. While it could certainly be higher, I am thrilled with this increase.Note from the author: Christopher F. Davis has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012.

4035465,101900,2017-01-10T05:04:57-05:00,"Visa And MasterCard have become the undisputed titans of the financial transaction processing world.
        In the process they have made numerous investors extremely rich.
        However, thanks to major secular trends towards digital purchases, both companies can expect immense long-term growth that make them ""must own, buy and hold forever"" dividend growth stocks.
        That being said, when we compare Visa and MasterCard at a fundamental level, it becomes obvious that MasterCard is the superior company.
        AND given that it's currently trading for a far better valuation, MasterCard represents a far better buy at today's share price.","Both Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) have absolutely crushed it over the past decade, enriching investors to a staggering degree.However, while value oriented investors might worry that this kind of incredible outperformance means that both stocks are now pricing in their amazing future growth potential, the truth is that both Visa and MasterCard remain exceptional long-term dividend growth stocks.That being said, at the present time there are four reasons why MasterCard represents the hands down better investment at this time.Visa: The World's Credit Card KingVisa is the undisputed king of global financial transaction processing (58% global market share) courtesy of its network of 16,800 financial institutions worldwide connecting 44 million global merchants to the 3.1 billion consumer credit and debit cards in circulation. In the past 12 months alone Visa processed $8.2 trillion, taking a small cut of that for itself.This massive scale creates powerful network effects that give Visa a wide moat that helps to generate strong pricing power. And given that 85% of global transactions are still in cash, Visa has a massive growth runway that spans decades. Even with the need to continually update and improve its network and service offerings, Morningstar estimates that Visa will be able to consistently grow its earnings by at least 8% CAGR over the next 20 years.For dividend growth investors, that kind of growth potential, when combined with strong buybacks, and a very low payout ratio, means that Visa represents one of the best long-term dividend growth stocks you can own today.MasterCard: Worthy Challenger To The ThroneMasterCard is the second largest financial transaction processor, with 26% market share courtesy of its network that includes: 40 million merchants, 1.6 billion cards in circulation, and $4.6 trillion in transaction volume in 2015.MasterCard has been aggressively attempting to differentiate its service offerings in recent years, to help stave off the long-term threats of regulators and fintech. Part of this has been a move towards additional services that help financial institutions and merchants extract more value from its relationship with MasterCard (more on this later).This helps to not just diversify the company's cash flow but also cement relationships between MasterCard and other major financial providers as the world moves towards a more mobile based, ""digital wallet"" financial system.Profitability: MasterCard Has Superior Returns On CapitalThanks to the fact that both Visa and MasterCard's transaction processing businesses effectively operate as toll roads in the world of digital payments, both companies are massively profitable free cash flow generating machines.That being said, thanks to MasterCard's aggressive investments into ancillary services, such as advanced AI based fraud protection, loyalty card program management, and data analytics, MasterCard has a slighter stickier ecosystem that allows it to command very strong pricing power and generate far superior returns on shareholder capital.Better yet, the revenue from those services, though currently MasterCard's smallest revenue stream, is the fastest growing. In fact in the most recent quarter this division reported 23% year-over-year growth.Now in fairness to Visa part of the reason that its returns on capital are lower than MasterCards' is because of the recent acquisition of Visa Europe, whose operating margins are much lower, 26% compared to its 65%. The recent nature of this acquisition, and the debt and shares it took to close the deal, means that it will take some time for Visa to achieve significant cost synergies in the European business, and bring its returns on capital up.That being said, MasterCard clearly has superior operational performance due to its world class management team, led by CEO Ajay Banga. Banga has set MasterCard on brilliant strategic path to diversify and growth its business into areas that most credit card companies don't typically tread, such as greater business relations with governments and a growing portfolio of services that help to only boost its brand equity and widen its moat.Balance Sheet: Both Strong But MasterCard's Is A FortressDon't get me wrong, neither Visa or MasterCard has a lot of debt, especially given their strong free cash flow margins. However, as you can see Visa's leverage ratio, (Debt/EBITDA) and interest coverage ratio (EBITDA/Interest) is far lower than MasterCard's, indicating less future ability to continue borrowing at recent rates.Of course to be fair to Visa we have to acknowledge that the recent spike in debt was due to the company's $23 billion acquisition of Visa Europe, which has the potential to boost the company's growth for many years to come, including EPS growth of over 30% in 2017.However it will reduce Visa's financial flexibility somewhat in the future, at least until the acquisition's cash flows become accretive to both the bottom line and balance sheet.That matters because both Visa and MasterCard have historically been aggressive with returning capital to shareholders, especially in the form of buybacks.However, thanks to the more aggressive buybacks by Visa, including $7.2 billion worth over just the past 12 months, Visa's total capital return FCF payout ratio (buybacks + dividends) is an unsustainable 168%, compared to MasterCard's more conservative 96%.With interest rates likely to keep rising for several years, MasterCard's more disciplined approach to debt, buybacks, (which help reduce the payout ratio and allow faster, longer dividend growth), once again gives it an edge as a long-term dividend growth stock.Dividend Profile: Close Call But MasterCard Likely To Grow Dividends FasterAt the end of the day the most important thing that matters to me is a strong dividend profile which consists of: current yield, dividend security, (balance sheet and payout ratio), and long-term growth prospects.We've already seen that both companies have very strong balance sheets, (though I consider MasterCard the stronger of the two). Similarly from a payout ratio point of view both are low enough to make the dividends bullet proof. However MasterCard's slightly lower ratio means that it is slightly more likely to reach the reasonable long-term dividend growth expectations analysts currently have for it and that my own models say are reasonable expectations of future payout growth. That's especially true given the company's better long-term payout growth record, which is superior to Visa's. And since long-term market studies show us that total returns generally track yield + dividend growth, based on the equal yield of both companies, MasterCard is likely to generate slightly better total returns over the next 10 years.Of course given that the market's historical total return has been 9.1% CAGR, both Visa and MasterCard are still worth owning, since both are likely to continue generating far superior returns in the coming years.Valuation: MasterCard Wins EasilyAs you can see neither Visa or MasterCard are trading cheap right now, especially in comparison to the S&P 500's PE of 26.1; which is itself at historic highs.However, from both an absolute perspective MasterCard's lower PE makes it appear the better buy today. That's especially true given that MasterCard is trading at less of a historic premium to its median PE.Of course as a dividend growth investor the valuation metric I care most about is yield. Comparing each company's yield to its historic median value is generally how I determine whether or not a stock is cheap enough to open a position in, (the lower bar to clear compared to adding to one's existing position).In this case I'd be willing to open a position in Visa, (and have done so) though I'd recommend that investors looking to add wait for a significant dip.That's especially true given that a discounted cash flow or DCF analysis shows that Wall Street is currently pricing is higher growth for Visa than what the company is likely to deliver over the next decade.In contrast MasterCard appears to be trading around 10% beneath its fair value, and is pricing in more realistic growth expecations. This means that today represents both a decent chance to open, as well as add to one's position.Risks To ConsiderThere are three major risks to consider before investing in Visa or MasterCard.First, like all multi-national corporations, international diversification creates negative currency risk should the dollar remain strong or strengthen further. That could indeed prove to be the case if US economic growth improves thanks to the effects of the Trump stimulus and US interest rates rise steadily over the years.However the two biggest concerns are specific to each company and derive from the very sky-high profitability both enjoy. Those margins represent money out of other people's pockets, and this exposes both Visa and MasterCard to political and regulatory risk.For example in 2010 The Dodd-Frank law capped US debit card interchange fees, and Europe is also considering similar regulatory limits to each company's fee structure.However the biggest risk is in the potential for rival payment services, specifically cheaper, mobile based alternatives to change the game by creating a lower cost paradigm to financial transactions.Companies such as Square (NYSE:SQ), and Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL), or even a yet unknown firm using disruptive tech such as blockchain, could end up destroying their wide moats and forcing both to participate in a future price war that could decimate margins.Bottom Line: Both Are Must Own Stocks BUT MasterCard Is The Better Buy Right NowDon't get me wrong, I consider both Visa and MasterCard to be ""must own, buy and hold forever"" dividend growth stocks courtesy of their cash rich business models, decades long growth runway, and impressive dividend growth records. In fact I own both for my own diversified dividend growth portfolio.That being said, with: superior profitability, a stronger balance sheet, lower payout ratio, and slightly better valuation, I have no qualms about declaring MasterCard the superior credit card giant to buy at this time.That's not to say that you shouldn't necessarily buy Visa if you don't own it, but I'd recommend waiting for a pullback before adding to one's position given the current lofty valuation.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Are you ready to supercharge your investing success in 2017 and beyond?

4023468,99846,2016-11-15T07:00:23-05:00,"The tax cuts proposed by Trump may benefit MasterCard and help it repatriate the billions of dollars it has overseas.But if Trump gets tough on China, we fear China may retaliate.This could result in the Chinese government closing the door or making it harder for MasterCard to operate in its lucrative card payment market.As we feel a lot of future growth is baked into the share price, this could result in under-forecast growth and put the share price at risk.","The surprising election victory for Donald Trump in the race to the White House and his election promise of ""getting tough"" on China could cause serious long-term headaches for some U.S based businesses. Especially for those which have pinned a percentage of their future growth on the Chinese market. It may turn out that ""making America great again"" could come at a cost for some heavy hitters. Although there are likely to be a number of benefits for U.S. businesses from a Trump victory, we feel it does have the potential to be bittersweet for shareholders of MasterCard (NYSE:MA).Last week CNBC reported that Cornell University trade policy professor Eswar Prasad expects that getting tough on China could result in retaliation. Mr Prasad stated that: ""Almost certainly we would see an aggressive and strident reaction from China (if Trump were to carry out on his election promises). Possibly reducing access to Chinese markets for U.S. businesses and putting a crimp on U.S. companies operating in China.""There are of course many American companies that both manufacture and retail at least some of their products in China. The likes of Nike (NYSE:NKE), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and General Motor (NYSE:GM) all have significant ties with China and could be affected by this announcement. But MasterCard is one in particular which stands out as being a company that would be impacted.The promise of lower tax rates in the United States and incentives to repatriate billions of dollars is a major positive, but that is a one-time event. If China retaliates by closing off its lucrative payment market, MasterCard could struggle to find growth that justifies the current share price.At 29x earnings MasterCard has significant future growth baked into its share price right now. We believe that some of this derives from China and its $8 trillion a year card payment market. Both MasterCard and Visa (NYSE:V) have been trying to gain access to China for at least a decade. And just when the door was starting to open, we fear the President-elect and his policies could potentially cause the door to close and limit the future growth of the two card payment giants.Back in July it was revealed that MasterCard hoped to become a payment service provider in China as quickly as possible. The company advised that it was looking into whether the best strategy was to apply alone or to do so with a partner, noting that strict rules are in place for foreign operators. These rigid rules could become even stricter should the Chinese government so desire, possibly making it near impossible for foreign payment providers to operate successfully in the country.This may well explain the sell off of both MasterCard and Visa on Thursday of last week. Both sets of shares underperformed the S&P 500 significantly towards the end of last week, at a time when the market was busy figuring out the winners and losers from a Trump administration.Whilst we wouldn't suggest investors rush to their brokers and instruct them to sell their MasterCard shares just yet, we believe it is prudent for investors to be aware of what may lie in wait for them further down the line. Both MasterCard and Visa have been hungry to breach the Chinese market for more than a decade. This is hardly a surprise when you consider that it is pinned to be the world biggest by 2020. But if they cannot break into this market as predicted it could prove detrimental to their projected growth.Analysts currently expect MasterCard to grow earnings by 15.5 percent per annum for the next five years and Visa at the higher rate of 16.4 percent according to data provided by NASDAQ. We feel quite sure that a fair portion of this growth would have been relying on the penetration of the Chinese market. If this is the case then we feel it's likely that analysts will be looking on nervously at how the President-elect deals with China. If the door to China shuts or rules tighten as a result of retaliation, then we could see these forecasts revised and the share price rerated.But of course there is always a chance that Trump will retract or tone down this particular policy. We have already seen him backtrack from a number of questionable policies after winning the election race, as well as tone down the rhetoric. But one thing is for sure, he's proving to be quite unpredictable.If the door to China remains open then we believe that 25x earnings will remain a fair multiple for MasterCard's shares to trade at. Based on that and our forecast for earnings per share of $4.30 next year, we have a price target of $107.50. This puts its shares at about fair value now, so for this reason we would class them as a hold."
4012133,96536,2016-10-14T10:17:36-04:00,MasterCard Inc. is one of the world's largest payment processors with a unique business and strong brand.Shares of MA are trading near all-time highs and valuation appears to be stretched.This article examines whether trends in underlying operating results support this performance.,"MasterCard Inc. (NYSE:MA) is one of the world's largest payment processing companies. They have a global presence, a household brand, and serve governments, consumers and merchants around the world.MA operates in a highly regulated and specialized field with a couple of big competitors, namely Visa (NYSE:V). I previously wrote an analysis of V. And given the strong competitive position they seemed to enjoy, I wanted to see if MA experiences similar benefits from their mutual duopoly. It's my suspicion the competitive position is similar, and I'm doubtful this global payment juggernaut is about to get disrupted in the near future.However, instead of assuming this hypothesis is true, I want to try and get an answer from the data. Personally, I always like to work long-term financial metrics into my analysis. This way, I can get look at trends, which may help indicate the durability of the company's competitive advantage. If it turns out to be robust, I'll expect to see key operating metrics hitting all time highs. After all, that's what share price is doing.MA Business Overview:MA was first established in 1966, when a group of banks banded together to create the Interbank Card Association. The MasterCard name came around in 1979. For the next 3 decades, the company grew through acquisition, large-scale advertising campaigns and international expansion. In 2006, following a corporate reorganization, MA began trading on the NYSE. It's now a publicly listed company with a market capitalization around $110B.MA reports its operating activities under a single segment: Payment Solutions. However, while the company only has one segment, they are very diversified in their customers. No client makes up more than 10% of revenue, so there is limited concentration risk of a big client leaving. Additionally, MA has some geographic diversification, with about one third of revenues coming from outside the US.Additionally, under the umbrella of Payment Solutions, MA offers a variety of branded solutions. The largest contributors, in terms of gross dollar volume, are Debit and Prepaid cards, with volumes of $2,112B and $2,077B respectively. Commercial credit contributes an additional $374M in dollar volume (source).In terms of growth potential, I think there are a couple of tailwinds adding fuel to the fire. As money becomes more electronic, transaction processors like MA benefit. Additionally, because MA is operating at such a large scale, they are well positioned to grow organically and at relatively low cost, through strategic partnerships, acquisitions and up-selling existing customers.I don't think these growth drivers are likely to be disrupted because MA has also done a good job adding value by offering both security and convenience. For instance, tapping to pay is the fastest and easiest way to make small purchases. At the same time, your credit card number provides an easy way to shop online. These are but a few examples of the ways that MA strives to add value for their clients. And I'm curious to see how it shows up in their financial statements.MA Financial History:To try and get a handle on the supposedly strong competitive posture of MA, I plan to look for trends in long-term operating and financial results. I find that by examining these numbers over a longer time period, I can spot trends that help quantify the qualitative competitive strengths of the business. It also provides helpful context for headline numbers. I'm particularly interested in finding reliable results that can be more consistently forecasted into the future.In order to get underway, I always like to look at the top line. Using historical data available from Morningstar (source) we can plot results over the last 10 years and trailing-twelve months.The reason I like to start with revenue is because it provides an unobstructed look at demand from customers. Companies that can keep growing sales year-over-year have the wind in their sales. And it certainly speaks to the quality of the business model.In the case of MA, you can see that the revenue trend is quite consistent. It goes to show the company is consistently executing their growth plans, with no signs of slowing down. And given the mature business of MA, I expect that sales are coming in at a healthy profit. However, to verify how efficiently MA is running their business, let's take a look at operating margins.After a brief hiccup during the great recession, you can see operating margins have been consistently high. Intuitively, this makes some sense. MA operates in an oligopoly with a powerful brand name and valuable service. So it seems logical that they should be able to charge a premium for their services.However, it's encouraging to actually see this consistently show up in the margin numbers. Based on the steadiness of these results, I'm optimistic the trend in earnings per share will also be heading in the right direction.As you can see, both the earnings and free cash flow results have pretty consistent, especially lately. I'm always happy to see these results align, as it helps rule out accounting gimmicks that might mask low-quality earnings. But to my eye, so far MA has a lot of the characteristics of being a high quality business that throws off cash for owners.One way shareholders have benefited recently is with the increasing dividend. While MA has had a dividend for years, only more recently has it begun to be raised. I'm curious to see to what degree this trend continues in the years to come. The current yield is under 1%, but the growth potential may make MA of interest to dividend growth investors.Additionally, I'm keeping my eye on book value per share for another gauge of shareholder returns. Historically, MA has done a pretty good job compounding capital, as represented in growth in equity per share. And personally, I always like to own stocks for the long term that are growing my ownership in the company. It's another margin of safety that makes the investment more attractive. So how does it look for MA today?Overall, this trend is pretty good. But unfortunately, book value per share has taken a bit of a slump the last couple years. This isn't something I like to see. So what's the cause?The primary reason for this decline in equity value is because of a corresponding increase in long-term debt. Luckily, the costs to carry this debt are quite low so using the proceeds to buy back shares and pursue growth isn't necessarily a bad thing. However, I'll be watching this trend going forward and become more critical if MA continues to lever up.But that's not the only risk to consider.Potential Risks to Investing in MA:So far, it looks like MA has a lot going for it as far as investment potential. But as with any prospective investment, there's always risk. In the case of MA, it's important to consider the downside of their strengths. For instance, while operating in an oligopoly comes with benefits, there are limitations. MA needs to be careful to provide value and not squeeze clients too much, lest regulators intervene.And not only does MA need to be aware of evolving regulations in markets across the world, but there are also significant compliance costs and potentially liability for any shortcomings. Of course, all of this is risk in addition to that of a general economic slowdown. In that case, MA could face delinquencies on credit facilities, and a drop in transaction volumes. This could be a one-two punch that would really hurt shareholder returns.However, the biggest risk of all for potential investors in MA might be the price tag. As far as I can tell, at over 25 times cash flow, shares of MA are pretty pricey. While this might be the cost of quality, shares are definitely expensive. This chart from Morningstar helps put this into context.Per the graph above, shares of MA have been persistently trading at a premium when compared to the S&P 500 index. One mitigating factor for valuation is the internal brand-value of MasterCard. That's hard to quantify though and makes valuing this payment processor a little more challenging. Nonetheless, I believe shares are priced on the high side.Conclusion: Waiting for an Entry in MAI believe that shares of MA are pretty expensive, so right now, I don't happen to own any. That said, I'm eager to get exposure to this company and will be sure to keep it on my watch list. I believe it has a lot of the characteristics of a long-term capital compounder. I'll also be keeping a close eye on the book value per share results and will likely get even more enthusiastic if those numbers can start trending back up. But what do you think? Is MA worth a spot in your portfolio?"
4008263,65113,2016-09-25T02:22:15-04:00,"MasterCard Incorporated (MA) has continued to grow free cash flow as transaction volumes have continued to increase.
        On the basis of this metric, I see it as very plausible that a target price of $130 is achievable for the company.
        I take a bullish view on MasterCard Incorporated.","MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is a company that has continued to go from strength to strength. When I had previously covered the company, I had originally predicted that given an expected growth of 15 percent per year in earnings, the company would be on track to reach a target price of $124-144.Since the time of writing at the end of 2014, we see that price is up by roughly 20 percent from $85 to $101.66 at the time of writing.In terms of earnings, I had predicted on the basis of 15 percent growth, that the company would be on track to reach $3.97 in earnings per share for 2016.While earnings for this year look to be set to come in at the $3.40-3.50 range, this is not of great concern to me, and I still see significant potential for my target price range to be reached. On a free cash flow basis, we see that while this metric had taken somewhat of a small hit by the end of 2014, free cash flow continues to reach five-year highs while the price to free cash flow remains at similar levels to 2014, suggesting that MasterCard could be undervalued on this metric.In fact, when we assume a 7% discount rate again, and use a price to free cash flow ratio in lieu of a P/E ratio, and free cash flow per share instead of EPS per share, we yield the following target prices:From the above, we see that we yield an eventual target price of $98-151. Moreover, at a 15 percent growth rate, the expected FCF per share of $3.44 for Year 2 (this year) now stands at $3.572. On this basis, a target price either side of $130 is not at all unreasonable for MasterCard.While it is true that MasterCard still needs to show growth at around the 15 percent mark in order to keep growing, the company remains in a strong competitive position and I foresee them being able to achieve this. For instance, transaction volume for 2016 remains strong at 13 percent, and Q2 earnings were strong due to a rise of 11 percent in global dollar volumes on a constant basis - the US dollar playing a part in this rise. More significantly, international payment volumes rose by 13 percent compared to 8 percent rise in payment volumes in the United States. In addition, I am also very excited by MasterCard's partnership with PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), which aims to concurrently raise the usage of MasterCard while increasing PayPal's presence in physical stores. In return, MasterCard will receive a higher presence online, being a default payment method and increasing the company's footprint in the e-commerce industry, which has continually been growing:Source: US Department of CommerceTo sum up, I continue to be excited about MasterCard's prospects and see further upside from here, even as the stock continues to climb to new highs."

However, there are a few companies out there that should do well no matter what happens to the economy. MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V) are some of these companies. They both benefit from the declining use of cash. As users buy more online, and payments become electronic, both these companies will benefit. We are still at the early stages of this growth as 83.7% of transactions globally are still cash.Source: MasterCard investor daySource: MasterCard investor dayWith an outlook like that, it's no surprise that these companies have outperformed the market.Source: MasterCard investor dayDecisive has a long position in Visa and has no position in MasterCard.

4006841,22742,2016-09-17T23:55:50-04:00,There is a difference between being a successful investor and just wanting to be one: understanding value.There are several ways to value a company. Each investor should determine which one makes sense for each company.Here are the methods I use to value a company and what my current estimated valuation is for MasterCard.My Point/Counterpoint section links to other well-conceived and informative articles about MasterCard for the purpose of gaining additional perspective.,"Are you a successful investor?This is more than just a rhetorical question. It is what defines how comfortably one will be able to retire or if s/he will be able to retire at all. As we all know, it starts with saving. But what to do with those accumulated savings? Results are what defines success as an investor; not just short-term gains, but those long-term compounded annual returns over a period of five years or more. Many money managers occasionally outperform the market indices like the Dow Jones Industrial average (DJI), the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY), or the Nasdaq (NASDAQ:QQQ), but very few can do so consistently, year after year. Fortunately for me, I have found a tool that helps me with that conundrum. I will share more about that later in the article.When the market becomes overvalued, I hedge and accumulate more cash. I find that one of the keys to investing success is to limit losses, and another is having the patience to wait for a good valuation. When the value of a portfolio falls by 50 percent, one must double the remaining amount just to get back to even. When the market becomes undervalued, I buy stocks of quality companies that have a consistent history of rising dividends, revenue growth and strong cash flows.Valuation models to considerThere are plenty of valuation models to choose from, ranging from simple to highly complex. Generally speaking, the simple models have as few as one or two assumptions that the investor/analyst must decide upon (in reality, this is called guessing) to reflect future outcomes from the company and thus derive an estimate of fair value. The more complex models can require many assumptions, which can also lead to either a much higher degree of accuracy or create far more opportunities for human error. As you might guess, I prefer the simpler models, but also use some moderately more complex models for validation.As I have mentioned in the past, I like the DDM (dividend discount model) and the DCF (discounted cash flows) models. I also like to use the average historical P/E (price-to-earnings ratio) as a check. This would be a value based upon an earnings multiple approach. It can be argued, and rightfully so, that investors are paying now for the future earnings of a company. But the definition of ""earnings"" is getting harder to pin down, as more than 90 percent of large-capitalization companies now report non-GAAP EPS (earnings per share) instead of GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) EPS. When I look up historical EPS for the S&P 500 by year, I find tables from several different sources, all with different numbers for each year. In aggregate, GAAP EPS are much lower than non-GAAP earnings, and the gap between the two is rising. Therefore, I do not rely on any valuation that requires an input value for future earnings. Estimating the net present value of future free cash flow provides what I believe to be a much more reliable valuation for a company. Management and analysts can work magic with EPS, but free cash flow is hard to manipulate.A little background on MasterCard (NYSE:MA)MA has a great business model, consistently increasing revenues by adding partners and merchants, processing a growing number of payments and keeping the lion's share of the transaction fee. As I explained in greater detail in my valuation article on Visa (NYSE:V), electronic payments are growing globally, governments want to move much of (if not all) payments to electronic while eliminating cash (to lower costs and gain greater access to more transactional data), and credit is still in the early stages of acceptance in much of the world. There is tremendous long-term growth potential!I like to use charts to illustrate historical results and trends, since, as the saying goes, ""a picture is worth a thousand words."" Looking at the annual revenue of MA, we see that the trend is sloping nicely upward, and that there has not been a down year over the last ten-year period, not even during the financial crisis. Nice! There are few companies that can make that claim. But the rate of growth is exposed when we look at the percent change year over year on the chart. I believe that, contrary to many of the headlines we read, global consumption is slowing faster than it is in the U.S., and it is not all that good even here. I found an interesting article that makes some rather interesting claims on this issue using statistical analysis of employment data and consumption growth (among others) to project a recession and market correction coming within the next nine months. I do not know about the timing or whether the reason is as valid as it appears convincing, but I do believe that somewhere on our horizon there will be a significant slowdown resulting in some better buying opportunities. In any event, MA is one of those stocks more likely to fall less and to bounce back up faster than the broad market when the time comes, due primarily to its ability to continue growing the top line regardless of the economic environment.Chart by Mark Bern, CFA data source: Old School ValueGAAP earnings have also trending strongly higher over the last ten years, with only one down year (2008) at the beginning of the financial crisis. It is highly unlikely that MA will experience another year of loss again, unless some disruptive new technology comes along to replace its electronic transaction processing platform. Block chain technology is potentially a disrupter in this area, but will more likely be adopted (through acquisition or licensing) by MA and its major competitors. In that scenario, the most probable outcome, in my humble opinion, will be a reduction of costs, with the savings being split by the processors, merchants and disrupters. Everybody wins, and MA profits will get a boost rather than a cut.Chart by Mark Bern, CFA data source: Old School ValueNow we come to the dividend, which shows us a strong upward trend since the worst of the Great Recession disappeared in the rear-view mirror and the European sovereign debt debacle became less threatening, or at least it appeared to be over. Who knows what the future will bring? I am not sure I want to know. I like my sleep. But as we will see in the next slide, the dividends are well covered by a rising FCF (free cash flow).Chart by Mark Bern, CFA data source: Old School ValueFor my money, FCF is the single most important gauge of the health of a company. It is what is remaining of the cash produced by operations (after all expenses) less capital expenditures to maintain the business and foster growth. It needs to be consistently positive and preferably trending higher over time. MA had a terrific year in 2013 from an FCF perspective. Outside of a downtick in 2014, the trend remains sloping in the right direction. The rate of growth has slowed, but that is not really a great concern. When a company is investing in future growth, FCF will not always rise every year. It just needs to stay in positive territory. FCF, after all, is what is left over that the company did NOT need to continue its growth. The average annual compounded rate of FCF growth over the last six year has been a very healthy 19.6 percent. That is amazing!Chart by Mark Bern, CFA data source: Old School ValueSo, what has MA been doing with its excess cash? It has been raising the dividend and buying back shares. No surprise there. It seems that almost all companies are doing the same with interest rates so cheap. At least MA has been able to fund the majority of those activities from its operations.Chart by Mark Bern, CFA data source: Old School ValueNow I want to compare FCF to the amounts paid for dividends and buybacks. Only in the last two years did the outflow of funds from such activities exceed the available FCF. With interest rates at historical lows, it is hard to blame management for borrowing as long as it does not negatively impact the company's credit rating in a meaningful way. At the rates accessible to companies like MA today, it is difficult to resist using debt to improve per share results. But with such a low yield on the common stock, it is difficult to justify borrowing too much unless the company expect to significantly increase the dividend in the future. With a payout ratio of only 21.4 percent, MA has a lot of flexibility to do so in the future. But the company must not get ahead of its competition too far or it will give up some of that flexibility in its capital structure.Chart by Mark Bern, CFA data source: Old School ValueMA has been relatively consistent in buying back shares over the last six years. I expect that trend to continue, although the rate of decline may slow as long as interest rates remain extremely low. That will tend to help support the share price.Chart by Mark Bern, CFA data source: Old School ValueThe debt-to-equity ratio is higher than that of Visa, but not yet at a troubling level. The company could change course and begin using FCF to pay down debt in the future as interest rates rise, if management determines the need to do so. In the previous paragraph, I mentioned that the rate of decline in shares outstanding could slow, and that is because at some point the addition of debt will raise concerns at the credit bureaus. We are not there yet, but it may not be far off.Chart by Mark Bern, CFA data source: Old School ValueAs I try to make sense of what was reviewed here and consider what might be a reasonable expectation for the next five or ten years, I look at both the historic growth rates and the rate at which the trend is slowing. The compounded growth rate of the dividend over the past five years has been over 60 percent, but the rate of growth has slowed in the last year to 18.8 percent. My expectation is for the future rate of growth to be about 14.5 percent. And from here I move to my valuation models.How I value MasterCardI will start with my DDM valuation. My assumption for dividends five years out is that MA will be paying $1.26 per share in 2021. That works out to an average compound annual growth rate of 14.5 percent. Then, I used my required rate of return of fifteen percent to discount the future dividends. Why do I require such a high rate of return on such a great company? The simple answer is that it sports a very high TTM P/E multiple, averaging about 24 over the last ten years and sits at about 29.1 currently. If I am going to pay so much for each dollar of future earnings or cash flow, I want to be rewarded in kind with a higher total return. Using these inputs, my present value comes out to be $130.24 per share.I use the average expect P/E multiple as a check. Here I use the P/E of 24 that I feel fits the price activity over the past five years and multiplied that by my expected 2017 fiscal year GAAP EPS of $4.10, and the result came out to be $98.40 per share. That is lower than my DDM and is even a little lower than the current price of $99.36, but not by much. This is more of a ballpark figure, but it lets me know if my other valuations seem reasonable. I do not rely on a P/E multiple valuation for investing decisions. At the same time, I do want to know if the stock appears overvalued or undervalued by a significant amount.I use OSV (Old School Value) primarily for historical data and as a way to check my valuations. OSV serves up three different valuation models: DCF, Graham's Formula (best used for cyclicals, companies with volatile cash flows and growth stocks) and EBIT multiples (a form of earnings multiple valuation). In the case of MA, the DCF model is most appropriate. OSV values MA at $86.63, which is moving even further in the wrong direction from my DDM valuation that did the P/E multiple check. So now I want to see if any of the other models will support my lofty expectations coming from the DDM.My favorite stock tool is Friedrich, partly because I spent so much time understanding its model, and because it gives me a look back at ten years' worth of valuations and ratios all in one screen shot. It also is usually the most conservative of any stock tool that I have come across. It also uses a DCF model to value stocks and presents the output in two forms. The first is a table and the other is a chart. The table provides a quick look at ratios, valuations and trends over the last ten years. Here is the table for MA. Notice the current value for MA is described as ""Main Street Value"" and stands at $131.90 as of the last update on August 28th. Finally, a number that is close to my own DDM value. Of course, that does not mean the DDM is fully validated. It does mean that the algorithm likes the company's long-term prospects as much as I do. But that is all.Source: Ask FriedrichThe Friedrich Chart below provides a quick look at how the algorithm has valued the company at the end of each year for the last ten years and recently. The market price (called the Wall Street Price) at the time of the valuation was $96.47, while the fair value (called the Main Street Price) was $131.90. The recommended sell price (in red) is 66 percent above the Main Street Price, and the recommended buy at price (in green and labeled as the Bargain Price) is 33 percent below the Main Street Price. The chart provides a quick look at the progression and relationships of the market price to the value, buy and sell prices over the years. I like to see companies that tend to have the intrinsic value (Main Street Price) above the market price consistently, year after year. It tells me that the market is underestimating the true value of the company. That condition tends to right itself over time.Source: Ask FriedrichPoint/CounterpointBelow are articles by other Seeking Alpha contributors. I like to offer readers points of view other than my own when considering an investment. The first article linked supports the current market price as a fair valuation and is about on par regarding growth prospects with my own expectation. I included the second link because even though the author is a high-conviction owner of MA, the article provides some good information about the outstanding litigation against the company and the likely course it will take. The last article linked is a negative piece for added perspective.SummaryThis is not a recommendation to buy shares of MA at this time. I would like to see a greater consistency in the various valuation models before I make that recommendation. There is also the near-term risk of a rate increase that could set off a market correction in the next week or so. Once that hurdle is passed, I would reconsider MA as a potential candidate for long-term investors interested in strong appreciation potential and a decent future yield on original investment from the dividend.I believe the market in general to be overvalued by a significant margin, which means that buying most stocks at current levels comes with far greater risk than under normal economic circumstances. You may be able to squeeze another five to ten percent out of a stock like MA before the next economic downturn. Each investor needs to make such decisions on their own. I prefer to hold fewer positions in stocks when valuations are so rich. I do not believe the potential reward warrants the level of risk I perceive to be attached to equity investing presently. There are very few companies that I can find that offer good value and appreciation potential over the next five years. As economic conditions and valuations evolve and become more favorable, I will write about what I am buying and why. Right now, I will remain on the sidelines regarding MA, but will continue to watch for a better entry point, because it is one of the quality companies with a lot of potential for appreciation.I also intend to write about how those investors who need current income can buy and hold a low-yielding stock like MA and use strategies around that holding to enhance the income stream. I have such an article about Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the works presently and will be submitting it over the next day or two for publication.There is the argument that low interest rates and low inflation justify the higher valuations. That is true for the moment. But those conditions are temporary and will not continue forever. I am a long-term investor. That means I want to buy and hold for more than five years. I expect a transition to a less accommodative economic reality over the coming five years and, for that reason, am holding fewer stocks than I have in a long time. I generally do not sell unless a stock price becomes overvalued by what I estimate to be 50 percent or more. Patience is a key to successful investing. It all comes back to the old adage of ""Buy low and sell high."" I will be buying sparingly over the next year or until the bargains I like become available again. When you get to be as old as I am, you know those opportunities will come along again. It only takes patience. It is easier said than done, I know, especially for the younger investors. I have been there, too. I wish I had had more patience in my youth; I would have accumulated far more wealth if I had.There is also the old adage that ""Cash is Trash."" But do not be fooled by that one. I hold most of my idle cash in the Vanguard GNMA Fund Inv (MUTF:VFIIX), which yields 2.34 percent currently. In 2008, VFIIX provided a total return over seven percent while equities tumbled. When the market bottoms again and begins to turn higher, I will have plenty of dry powder for shooting those bargain fish in the proverbial barrel.For those interested in my valuation articles on other companies, you may consider becoming a follower of mine.

4017173,33291,2016-10-31T11:16:39-04:00,"MasterCard is simply a global enterprise and I regularly do business with them.The stock is at all-time highs and I find myself once again thinking 'why didn't I buy this name?'Q3 earnings are out, and I discuss the key data leading to the rise in shares.","MasterCard (NYSE:MA) is a company that everyone in America probably knows, and most people in developed nations are likely familiar with. All I can think is 'why didn't I buy this name?' Five years ago, I was seriously considering it, but never got in. Same thing three years ago. And again last year. Here we are now at all-time highs. It is simply a global enterprise, and I regularly do business with them. The business model has only improved over the years as consumers have moved away from physical assets and cash for purchases, to more electronic means. MasterCard is up about 20% from where I recommended it at $90 a share. Thus, I wanted to check in on the name to see if this is a rare buying opportunity, or if there are performance concerns.Well, the company just announced its Q3 earnings. Once again, I am impressed because the results indicate that the company will continue its slow but reliable growth. It really is just a powerhouse. Net revenue for the quarter came in at $2.88 billion, a 14% increase over Q3 2015. This was primarily due to an 11% jump in gross dollar volume and an 18% increase in processed transactions to approximately 14.5 billion. That is pretty sizable growth for a long-standing company like MasterCard. Further, global purchasing volumes rose another 9% to over $882 billion year over year. So revenues were up nicely and they beat expectations very slightly by $130 million.That said, expenses were higher year over year versus last year. Total operating expenses, as reported, were actually up 4% year over year. However, we really have to consider currency changes. When we adjust for changes in currency, we see operating expenses were up almost 5%. This rise led to total operating expenses that were $1.2 billion for several reasons. The increase was primarily due to the ongoing cost management initiatives, foreign exchange activity and higher data processing expenses. All of this led to operating income increasing 22% as reported. However, it was up a whopping 17% currency adjusted year over year. Operating margins were a strong 58%.Factoring in the growth in revenues and the expenses of the company, it reported net income of $1.2 billion, a dramatic rise of 21% as reported. Once again, adjusting to a constant currency basis, net income actually declined 2% year over year. This translated to earnings per share of $1.08, which beat estimates by a very strong $0.10. All in all, it was a strong quarter and the only issues with the quarter related to European Union regulatory changes, which hampered growth.To be clear, these numbers are strong once again. Revenues were up massively year over year and beat estimates. That is a win. On top of it all, the company continues to be shareholder friendly, but not as friendly as I would like. During Q3 2016, MasterCard bought back 6 million shares for approximately $591 million. Here in the present Q4 2016, the company has bought back another 2.6 million shares at a cost of approximately $263 million (through 10/26/16). There is still another $1.8 billion remaining under the current repurchase program authorization. My only problem with the company is its weak dividend. The company now pays a $0.76 annual dividend; $0.19 quarterly. This only translates to a 0.7% yield. While a dividend is shareholder friendly, I expect this dividend to grow in the coming years. With the earnings this company posts, shareholders deserve a higher payout, especially after it exhausts its buyback program. At another all-time high, I find myself once again with a ""didn't buy"" remorse.Note from the author: Christopher F. Davis has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012.

4006413,102172,2016-09-15T10:29:37-04:00,"MasterCard is a truly world-class business based on all the tenets Mr. Buffett has prescribed over the years.Quality is rarely ever cheap based on traditional metrics but Matsercard needs to be viewed with a ""quality at a reasonable price"" lens.MasterCard in my opinion is the perfect embodiment of Mr. Buffett's concept of durable Economic Goodwill.Join me in constructing a portfolio of the ""world's best businesses"", one stock at a time.","I have embarked on a long, arduous yet joyous venture, a venture to discover the world's best businesses, starting with the U.S., where in fact the bulk of them reside in any case. What is my definition of the ""best businesses"" I hear you wondering. Well, as the article suggests, the quest is inspired by Mr. Buffett's teachings over the years, which have shaped and influenced my own investment philosophy almost in its entirety.The first step in this journey was an article I wrote on Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) a few days ago which encapsulates the qualities I seek in my quest for discovering the best businesses from a long term investor's standpoint. For any of the readers who may be interested, I would suggest reading the Starbucks article to better understand the criteria that I screen for.However, please do bear in mind that the strategy, as a condition of success, necessitates a predisposition on behalf of the investor to seek long term alpha as opposed to short term speculative returns.Essentially what I am looking for are companies that some would describe as ""permanent compounders"". These are businesses that by virtue of their superior business model, brand excellence and capable management, possess a demonstrable and durable competitive position allowing them to compound earnings and cash flow per share at an extraordinary rate today and far into the future. A tall order indeed!Perhaps the most important piece of the puzzle is of course the price. Companies that fulfill the above criteria are a rare breed and are unsurprisingly seldom priced cheap - unless of course we are lucky enough to find them as a result of Mr. Market's occasional, momentary lapse of reason.So how does one reconcile the price versus value conundrum for these world class businesses? While recognizing that investing at unwarranted high valuations are likely to lead to returns a fair bit below the fundamental performance of the underlying business, especially in the short term, one also has to accept that quality does not come cheap.Consequently, I subscribe to a mantra that I call ""quality at a reasonable price"" (more on this below).Moving on to the subject at hand let's have a look at how MasterCard (NYSE:MA) tallies on our scorecard.Brief BackgroundMasterCard Incorporated, a technology company, provides transaction processing and other payment related products and services in the United States and internationally. It facilitates the processing of payment transactions, including authorization, clearing, and settlement, as well as delivers related products and services. The company also offers value-added services, such as loyalty and reward programs, and information and consulting services. The company offers payment solutions and services under the MasterCard, Maestro, and Cirrus brands. MasterCard Incorporated was founded in 1966 and is headquartered in Purchase, New York. The company listed on the NYSE in 2006 under the ticker symbol MA.All financial data used in the article is sourced either from the company's SEC filings or from Gurufocus website. All ratios, growth rates and other financial metrics are based on my own calculations unless otherwise specified.Headline Numbers (ttm: trailing 12 months)And now without any further ado let's dive into the criteria listed above to see how well MA stacks up against each.A high quality, easy to understand business, with a leadership position in its industry:Buffett has taught us to look for certain characteristics in identifying high quality businesses including absence of a viable substitute, a product or service that constitutes a need and not a want, and those that are able to sustainably generate high returns on capital. I believe MasterCard qualifies on all counts as I will endeavor to demonstrate in this article.MasterCard is the second largest transactions and payments processing technology company in the world, behind leader Visa (NYSE:V). The company makes transactions happen without taking on any credit risk since it does not issue the cards itself. It generates revenue by charging fees to issuers (the banks) and merchants for providing payments processing services on its network based on the gross dollar volume of transactions. The company has remained at the cutting edge of innovation in the payments processing space ever since inception.In 2016 the company was ranked 8th on the list of Official Top Business Superbrands by the Centre for Brand Analysis, and 18th on the list of the World's Most Respected Companies by Barrons.A business that is likely to be around ten or fifteen years from now and not particularly exposed to obsolescence risk:A global move towards a cashless society is a reality, one that should provide companies like MasterCard sustainable, secular growth opportunities for decades to come. Moreover an increased adoption of online transactions is likely to escalate the conversion trend from cash to electronic payments processed on networks operated by companies like MasterCard.A business that has a sizeable moat or sustainable competitive advantages (significant barriers to entry, hard to replicate, great franchise value, high customer switching cost, low cost position, proprietary intellectual property etc.) and an ethos that seeks to enhance that advantage over time:While there have been attempts in the past to create competitive threats for the industry leaders in the payments processing arena, it is no secret that such attempts have not been particularly successful. Most notable was the creation in 2012 of the Merchant Customer Exchange or MCX, a syndicate of dozens of U.S. retailers and brands including Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), Target (NYSE:TGT), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI), Sears Holdings (SHLD) and CVS (NYSE:CVS).The rather grand aim of the consortium was to create an alternative to the existing payment networks operated by the likes of MasterCard and Visa, but in doing so they were obliging their customers to stop using the incumbent networks (networks that customers have grown to trust over decades), and forcing them to adopt a new unfamiliar payments system, which as a matter of fact had been plagued with technical glitches from the word go.As of last May MCX has all but thrown in the towel by announcing that they were shutting down the roll-out of its electronic wallet app and laying off staff.Other potential threats emerged in 2014 with the introduction of new electronic wallets like Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay. But recognizing not only the inherent shortfall in MCX's strategy of attempting to restrict customers' choice, but also the dominant intrinsic franchise value of the incumbents these new entrants decided to partner with MasterCard and Visa rather than trying to compete with them.PayPal which was seen as another credible potential alternative to the incumbents has also decided not to go head to head with MasterCard and Visa, choosing to partner with them instead.While there will surely be renewed attempts to dislodge the leaders in the future I believe MasterCard can successfully sustain its formidable competitive position and franchise value for years to come.Let's have a quick look at the historic revenue trends for the company. For the ten years between 2005 and 2015 MasterCard more than trebled its top-line growing at a compounded annual growth rate or CAGR of 12.6%.A business that depicts margins that are not only better than the average American business but are also stable and/or improving:I believe one of the best ways to gauge whether a company enjoys a sustainable competitive advantage in its industry is by analyzing its margin metrics over a reasonably long time frame, say ten years.MasterCard while enjoying a 100% gross margin from the outset, quadrupled its operating margin from a respectable 13% in 2005 to a spectacular 52.5% in 2015. This is almost six times the current annual ttm operating margin (8.8%) for the S&P 500*.MasterCard improved its net margin from 9.1% in 2005 to a remarkable 39.4% in 2015. This is particularly impressive in the context of the historical average net margin of 7% and current annual net margin of 2.8% for the S&P 500 constituents*.A business that demonstrates a consistent track record of generating high returns on equity and invested capital:Return on equity measures how much profit a business generates for every dollar invested by its shareholders. A levered business or one that takes on increasing amounts of debt can usually amplify its return on equity, but will do so while simultaneously magnifying the inherent risk in the capital structure.As Charlie Munger says: Let's see how MasterCard scores on this front:MasterCard improved the return on equity it generates from a commendable 25% in 2005 to a spectacular 60% in 2015 and 64% during the 12 months to June 2016. What makes this even more special is the fact that the company has managed this with no net leverage i.e. it has net cash on its balance sheet.For context let's compare this with the same metrics for Visa, MasterCard's closest competitor and an extremely well run global organization in its own right. Visa generated a return on equity of 18%, less than a third of what MasterCard generated, despite employing considerable leverage - net debt to equity for Visa stands at 0.22.Return on Invested Capital measures the return earned on capital provided by shareholders and debt providers. In other words it measures how good a company is at turning capital into profits. RoIC for MasterCard came out at an incredible 174% for the year ended December 2015 - for comparison ROIC for Visa was less than 20% during the same period.A business that exhibits sustained operating leverage as well as durable economic goodwill:Operating leverage is defined as a measure of how revenue growth translates into growth in operating income. As can be seen from the numbers below, revenue for the ten year period (2005 to 2015) increased 229% from $2.9b to $9.7b. However operating income for the same period increased by 1192% or almost 12 times. Operating leverage consequently works out at 5.2x meaning that the company was able to grow its operating income 5.2 times faster than its revenue.Measuring operating leverage using earnings per share or EPS instead of operating income the numbers paint an even more inspiring picture. For the ten year period between 2005 and 2015 the company was able to grow its EPS 7 times faster than its revenue. And over the last 5 years (between 2010 and 2015) MasterCard grew its EPS 1.9x faster than its top-line.These are truly amazing numbers that signify the company's superior business model and entrenched franchise value.Economic goodwill: Economic goodwill is a measure of how capital efficient a business is. While operating leverage is a given for any successful and prosperous business venture, it is the concept of economic goodwill as defined by Warren Buffett himself, that I firmly believe is the unwritten secret to long term alpha generation. It also therefore constitutes the cornerstone of my stock screening and selection process. Please allow me to explain.In order to fully appreciate this concept I would encourage anyone who may be interested to go to the ultimate source of this timeless wisdom i.e. Warren Buffett's letter to shareholders all the way back in 1983, and in particular the appendix to the letter.So what is Buffett teaching us and how does that relate to MasterCard and our mission to build a portfolio of the ""world's best businesses""? Well, he is essentially instructing us to seek out companies that a) generate an abnormally high return on net tangible assets, and b) where those returns do not require substantial ongoing capital expenditure.Let's look at how MasterCard fares in this regard. First thing to consider is the fact that (as of last reported quarter) the ratio of tangible net assets to net assets is 0.56 - in other words only 56% of MasterCard's net assets are tangible. Secondly (based on ttm numbers) MasterCard spent only 4% of EBITDA and 10% of free cash flow on capital expenditure.Magical as it may sound, MasterCard generated a whopping 114% return on net tangible assets as of y/e December 2015. This is three times the 38% return on net tangible assets it generated in 2005, an impressive number in its own right.The following data exemplifies the point further. For the ten year period from 2005 to 2015, while CAPEX spend increased by a CAGR of 15.4%, EPS and FCF per share increased by a CAGR of 33% and 37% respectively.Total CAPEX spend during the ten years was $2.1b while the total net income and free cash flow for the same period was $19.4b and $20b respectively - both numbers almost ten times larger than the CAPEX spend.This is the power of economic goodwill at work and the hallmark of a capital efficient business one where profits and cash flows increase disproportionately relative to capital expenditure. Why is this important you ask? It is important because the disproportionate increase in cash-flow that is available to return to and reward shareholders with grows both nominally and as a percentage of sales. The following numbers will clarify the point:As you can see while CAPEX grew at a CAGR of 15% in nominal terms over the years, it did not increase as a percentage of sales. In contrast free cash flow not only grew much faster nominally (CAGR of 35%), it increased substantially as a percentage of sales from 7% in 2005 to over 38% in 2015.A business that produces copious free cash flow:Please see above.A business that possesses a strong balance sheet:Once again MasterCard easily makes the grade on this count. With total debt, both short and long term combined, of around $3.3 billion and cash and short term securities of around $6.5 billion, the company has a net cash balance of around $3.2 billion - an extremely conservative capital structure and a fortress of a balance sheet.A business that is preferably owner operated or at the very least run by shareholder friendly management team with demonstrable capital allocation talent:While Ajay Banga, the CEO of MasterCard does not own what I would describe as a meaningful stake in this context. MasterCard Foundation, on the other hand, which was established in 2006 through a gift of shares from MasterCard Worldwide at the time of its IPO, owns more than a 10% stake in the company.Is management shareholder friendly with a good capital allocation track record? There are several metrics I like to look at in this regard including dividend and dividend growth, share repurchases, acquisition history, executive compensation framework and ""retained earnings to market value.""Current annualized dividend of $0.76 equates to a 0.8% dividend yield, which admittedly is meager yet safe. The company has a benign payout ratio of 22% based on earnings and 21% based on free cash flow. The more interesting aspect in this regard is the rate at which the dividend has grown since 2011. The following data shows that from 2011 to 2016 the dividend has grown at a CAGR of over 66%- truly a dividend growth monster.Share repurchases: MasterCard regularly repurchases stock - on a ttm basis it spent over $3.5 billion on buying back shares, while the average 12 month spend on share buybacks for trailing 36 months i.e. last 3 years is $3.3 billion. On a ttm basis the share repurchase spend equates to 3.2% of the current market cap and resulted in a net share count reduction of 3.5% from 12 months earlier. If one adds the dividend yield of 0.8% and the 3.5% share count reduction, the shareholder yield equates to 4.3% which is meaningful.Comparing trailing three year averages for both share repurchase spend and free cash flows, we can see that the company, on average, spent 89% of annualized free cash flow to buy back shares. It is quite evident that the company likes to reward shareholders with both increasing dividends as well as share repurchases. Given the unleveraged balance sheet the company should have no trouble sustaining this level of buybacks for some time to come.Acquisitions: While the company has made a few acquisitions since its founding, the targets have been modest in size. Just this past July the company announced its biggest acquisition to date, London based VocaLink, for $920 million. VocaLink operates key payments technology platforms for U.K. payment schemes, including BACS, the automated clearing house enabling direct credit and direct debit payments between bank accounts. The company had revenues of £182M last year, and processed more than 11B transactions.Executive compensation is reasonable and broadly based on revenue and earnings growth.Retained earnings to market value: This is another yardstick prescribed by Mr. Buffett that I like to use to see if management has done a good job of creating market value relative to profits it chooses to retain. Here is what Mr. Buffett has said on the subject (quote in italics, emphasis mine):So how does MasterCard score on this count? Analysis shows that for the 10 year period between 2005 and 2015 MasterCard created over $6 in market value for every dollar the company retained in profits - certainly an impressive feat.A business that has a strong likelihood of continued growth:MasterCard has an excellent track record of growing its business, be it based on revenue, earnings, or free cash flows. For the ten years between 2005 and 2015, the company grew its revenue, earnings and free cash flows at a CAGR of 13%, 31%, and 35% respectively. Moreover the company even managed to grow during the great recession of 2008/2009, increasing revenues during both years.Given the growth opportunities currently on the horizon for MasterCard, I see no reason to believe that growth cannot continue. Please consider the following:Valuation: With that we arrive at the final piece of the puzzle which is whether we can establish if the current valuation represents an attractive investment opportunity. As I opined at the outset high quality is rarely ever cheap.Looking at traditional valuation metrics like price to earnings, both trailing (29x compared with 20x for the S&P 500) and forward (24x compared with 17x for the S&P 500), and EV (enterprise value) to free cash flow (26x), MasterCard may not appear to be a screaming bargain, however viewing the business with a Buffett inspired lens the valuation appears to be more reasonable given the business model excellence and quality of earnings and cash flows for MasterCard.S&P 500 data is from Factset.Keeping in mind what Mr. Buffett has taught us, specifically that he would be happy paying 20x earnings or more for a business generating a 25% return on net tangible assets (please refer to the section on economic goodwill above), in my humble opinion paying 24x (forward) earnings for MasterCard, a business with operating margins north of 50%, FCF margins of 40%, a return on equity of 60%, and a magical 114% return on net tangible assets (as of December 2015, the last full year reported financials), certainly does not sound expensive to me.The stock, currently just shy of $100, has in the last 12 months traded in a seemingly capped range with the $100 mark acting as solid resistance.Who else owns it? It should come as no surprise of course that Warren Buffett owns almost 5 million shares in MasterCard (around 0.5% of the company) based on 13F filings for Q2 2016 (data from Gurufocus). Other investors include luminaries from the investing world such as Tom Russo, Andreas Halvorsen, Bill Nygren, Jim Simons, Steve Mandel, Steve Cohen, Mario Gabelli, Ken Fisher and Tweedy Browne.RisksRecent Performance as per Q2 2016 financials:The company reported as follows:ConclusionBeing an investor with a long term orientation, seeking long term alpha as opposed to short term speculative returns, here is why I believe MasterCard deserves a prominent slot in the construction of my ""best businesses of the world"" portfolio:Disclosure: I intend to buy MasterCard stock in the next 3 days.

4004184,41961,2016-09-05T15:12:53-04:00,"MasterCard reported another strong result in Q2.MasterCard's stock price has been largely flat over the last 12 months.Events in the payments ecosystem suggest this share price lull is temporary, and MasterCard will continue to rise.","I own shares of MasterCard (NYSE:MA) for my Project $1M growth portfolio. It's the highest conviction purchase of the portfolio, and has the highest weighting of all positions.I like businesses that have some degree of unique franchise value and lack of penetrability. MasterCard has built a two-sided network for payment acceptance. The business has been successful in working with issuer partners to get payment cards in the hands of consumers. This in turn has afforded it ubiquitous acceptance across merchants globally.MasterCard's stock price has barely budged over the last 12 months. However, this lack of share price movement belies continued good growth in the business.In Q2 2016, MasterCard saw an increase in revenue of some 13%. This was largely driven by an increase in processed transaction volume of 14%. The result was a beat on both revenue and earnings per share expectations. Excluding a one-off of provisions for litigation charges, MasterCard saw earnings per share increase almost 14% on a currency neutral basis.For a company with double-digit growth in its underlying transaction drivers and profitability, MasterCard trades at what I consider to be a fair valuation of 23x forward earnings. Yet, the stock price hasn't shown many signs of forward movement in the last year. I would submit that MasterCard is being held back primarily on concerns of merchant litigation activity, rather than valuation concerns or slowing growth.Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard shares were hit hard on the news of the overturning of a legal settlement that was negotiated between MasterCard, Visa and over 7,000 merchants for alleged antitrust violations. Visa and MasterCard settled these allegations at a cost of almost $7.25B in 2013. Share prices of both businesses dropped some 5% on the initial news several months ago.Separately, consumers in the UK launched a $24B lawsuit against MasterCard for improper cross-border transaction fees, alleging that MasterCard levied cross-border fees at a rate that restricted competition.The fact of the matter is that the credit card processors and the merchants share an uneasy alliance. Merchants would love nothing better than to dispense with the credit card giants, who have a lot of transaction data on their businesses, and impose a virtual tax every time a consumer swipes one of their cards through a machine.The reality is that merchants have tried and failed to come up with alternatives to displace Visa and MasterCard. MCX was supposed to be the answer, but constant delays and struggles have beset the business and led to layoffs and other challenges with MCX rolling out a product. The reality is that merchants have no choice but to accept the Visa and MasterCard paradigm, no matter how much they don't want to.Litigating MasterCard and Visa out of existence is likely to hurt the merchants as much as the consumers who have become beholden to credit and debit cards from the networks to simplify the payments process. The reality is that merchants are now significantly dependent on the payment networks for frictionless commerce.I'd argue that for merchants, the primary objective is more about seeing if they can extract a larger share of rebates from Visa and MasterCard and reduce the toll that they are paying on purchases made via the payment networks.Part of the pressure that they can exert on MasterCard comes from the legal pressure that they can exert on the credit card networks. However, equally important is that major networks need to make Visa and MasterCard believe that they have a credible alternative to present to the networks for payment.MCX has imploded as a result of a failure to solve any real pain point, apart from merchants' desire to have an alternative to Visa and MasterCard.The great hope for merchants was the viability of PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) to transition into a mechanism to support bank account-linked payments, steering volumes away from Visa and MasterCard networks to the ACH network. With 188M users worldwide, PayPal was seen as a compelling alternative to Visa and MasterCard, with a credible, large user base to make a meaningful impact on Visa's and MasterCard's volumes.In a blow to merchants hopes to be free of the large payment networks. PayPal struck a deal with Visa where it gets better access to leverage Visa's in-store network, in exchange for agreeing not to steer its customers to link their PayPal accounts to bank accounts.While PayPal benefits from better in-store network access and acceptance riding on Visa's network, its ability to act as a credible alternative to the payment networks has now been crushed. It is expected that MasterCard will likely follow with a similar deal in due course.The fact that the largest independent payments entity has now thrown its hand in with the incumbent payment networks speaks not only to the dominance of Visa and MasterCard, but also the difficulty in competing with these businesses. While alternative payment approaches may exist around the presentation layer or user experience to the customer, it appears clear that emerging innovation will continue to ride Visa's and MasterCard's payment rails.For merchants, that means that the only compelling way they have to push back at Visa and MasterCard is to drive an increasing volume of litigation to get the payment networks to buckle. The threat of an alternate payments regime to the status quo has largely been neutered in the medium term.For these reasons, I believe that the lull in MasterCard's stock price is likely to prove temporary. Merchant litigation will be drawn out, and in the absence of a compelling competitive alternative, the networks will be in no great hurry to strike a deal that erodes their long-term franchise dominance.In the meantime, the drivers that have been propelling MasterCard's transaction growth, including a cash to credit shift, greater acceptance mechanisms (including mobile point of sale) and increasing growth internationally will all continue to drive MasterCard's profitability higher."
4006317,24491,2016-09-15T04:54:43-04:00,"MasterCard has some strong secular trends supporting ongoing growth opportunities, including the number of transactions still completed using cash around the world.MasterCard is also working to expand its capabilities into the person-to-person payment market, where more than 95% of the money that changes hands does so via cash or check.There's no reason why MasterCard can't double or triple its dividend from current levels.Let's take a look at the firm's investment considerations as we walk through the valuation process and derive a fair value estimate for shares.","By The Valuentum TeamMasterCard's (NYSE:MA) stated growth strategy consists of three main points we are used to seeing: grow the core business, diversify customers and geographies, and build new businesses. However, MasterCard also stands to benefit from strong secular growth opportunity. As of 2014, nearly 84% of transactions in all markets around the globe were in cash. This number climbs to more than 91% in emerging markets, and is still a solid 58% in developed markets.MasterCard is also working to expand its capabilities into the person-to-person payment market, where more than 95% of the money that changes hands does so via cash or check. While the firm will benefit from the ongoing movement towards electronic payments and the demand for adjacent services, risks and concerns exist in the payment space in the form of rapidly evolving technology that will force it to constantly innovate as well as in pressures from growing competition and differentiated new entrants. Cybersecurity and privacy concerns will be forced to be an area of focus, as will navigating the ever-growing regulatory environment and increased sense of nationalism throughout the world.We have a high level of confidence that MasterCard will be able to continue appropriately allocating its capital to grow its business, but we also would like to see some of that capital allocated towards paying a more competitive dividend. MasterCard's cash-rich business model drives its outstanding Dividend Cushion ratio, which is one of the best in our coverage universe. The fact that it does not take on credit risk like Discover (NYSE:DFS) or American Express (NYSE:AXP) shields it from credit quality concerns. We like MasterCard's solid capital planning priorities of maintaining a strong balance sheet, liquidity, and credit ratings as these lead to stronger dividend potential. The company will continue returning excess cash to shareholders, though existing plans are considerably biased toward share repurchases. Its current payout has an extremely long runway of safe growth potential ahead of it, should management choose to ramp up its dividend policy.There's no reason why MasterCard can't double or triple its dividend from current levels. The only real weakness we can see in MasterCard's dividend at this point is the lack of willingness of management to significantly increase the payout. Shares yield a measly ~0.8% at current levels.MasterCard's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• MasterCard is a payments industry leader. Every day, the firm's network makes payments happen. It doesn't issue cards, set interest rates or establish annual fees. MasterCard generates revenue by charging fees to issuers and acquirers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related services based on the gross dollar volume of activity.• Though uncertainty persists in the global economy in 2016, the fundamentals of MasterCard's business and its approach remain unchanged. The firm's digital wallet MasterPass will continue to be a focus of the firm as it moves into an increasingly digital world.• Investors should expect MasterCard's revenue to grow at a low-to-mid teens annual pace through 2016. The biggest drivers behind that expectation rest in 5 percentage points of personal consumption expenditure expansion, 5 percentage points of secular electronic payment penetration, and a few points from strategic investments.• MasterCard benefits from one of the strongest competitive advantages out there - the network effect. As more consumers use credit/debit cards, more merchants accept them, thereby creating a virtuous cycle.• When it comes to the credit-card processing space, we generally prefer Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard, which do not take on credit risk like Discover or American Express. This shields it from credit quality concerns.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisIn our opinion, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. MasterCard's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 111.5%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.6%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT.In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. MasterCard's free cash flow margin has averaged about 30.5% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG.The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At MasterCard, cash flow from operations decreased about 39% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 14% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisWe think MasterCard is worth $99 per share with a fair value range of $79-$119.The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is derived from an evaluation of the historical volatility of key valuation drivers and a future assessment of them. Our near-term operating forecasts, including revenue and earnings, do not differ much from consensus estimates or management guidance. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 11.4% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 9.4%.Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 57.7%, which is above MasterCard's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 6.1% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For MasterCard, we use a 10.6% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $99 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future were known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for MasterCard. We think the firm is attractive below $79 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $119 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate MasterCard's fair value at this point in time to be about $99 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the firm's current share price with the path of MasterCard's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate.The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change.The expected fair value of $132 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $99 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.This article or report and any links within are for information purposes only and should not be considered a solicitation to buy or sell any security.

4012063,100806,2016-10-14T02:40:56-04:00,MasterCard is facing a number of significant risks.It is likely to lose the case in the UK.The case is a harbinger for leaner times ahead for the credit card business.,"MasterCard: An Enigma MachineMasterCard (NYSE:MA) is indeed an enigmatic company. On the one hand, on the surface, it seems to be doing the right things, but I and others have begun to notice that all is not well in this company, and we could be in for a negative surprise.It is my contention in this article to assert that the current litigation in the UK poses a bigger risk than many investors are thinking it is, and it is indeed a harbinger or a sign of leaner times to come.In the book of Genesis in the Bible, there is a story about the seven-year long famine in Egypt. In this story, God showed the Pharaoh a dream where he saw seven fat cows swallowed by seven thin cows, but afterwards, the thin cows remained just as thin as they were before.He also saw seven healthy ears of corn and seven withered ears of corn, and the same process applied in that the seven withered ears of corn consumed the seven healthy ears of corn, but remained just as withered as they were before.The Bible records that Joseph was brought out of the prison and he interpreted the dream correctly that it represents a seven-year time of plenty followed by a seven-year time of a grievous famine, and he had the idea to store grain during the years of plenty, so that there will be enough to sustain everyone during the seven years of famine.This story highlights a very important principle of business, and life in general, and that is, we experience life in cycles. The financial markets are cyclical, businesses are cyclical, and economies experience cyclicality, which is necessary for the removal of excesses, so that the economies can bounce back fitter and stronger.This is why the global economy is still sluggish because there has been a lot of indigestion in the financial system that governments and central banks have simply not allowed to be released, and thus the whole system is sick and bloated.All of these also affect MasterCard in various ways. The business model of the payment industry is at its heart a simple one, whereby the payment provider processes a payment and in return takes a small fee per transaction.In MasterCard's case, it also holds receivables in the form of its customer credit card debt, from which it earns either directly or through the creation of credit card asset-backed securities.The keys to success in the MasterCard, and indeed the whole credit cards and payments industry, are volume and margin. Volume in relation to both volume of transactions and volume of customers.Both of these sources of earnings are experiencing shocks because, in many respects, the time of plenty is over, but MasterCard did not take the necessary steps to adjust its business model to prepare it for the inevitable down cycle, and thus, it is exposed from the risks outlined below.Litigation RisksThe case against MasterCard in the British court is almost likely to result in a loss for MasterCard and force it to pay at least £14b, which represents an estimate of the actual amounts that was lost by clients. It is restitutionary in nature, but does not include any further compensation that the trial judge may also award for loss suffered as a result of the actions by MasterCard.MasterCard will face an uphill battle to win the case because the European Court of Justice have already concluded that its fees were unlawful, and all that customers have to prove is the actions or omissions of MasterCard resulted in their suffering loss.Industry Risks (Newer and More Agile Fintech Companies)While MasterCard can shake off a large fine of at least £14b, it is unlikely that it will shake off the reputational damage it will incur, as more and more revelations come out during the trial. This is especially damaging in an environment where customers have more choice of very low cost payment providers.These newer players in the market will gradually begin to eat away the market share of MasterCard, and thus reducing its volume, and subsequently its earnings year on year.Regulatory Risk - Basel III and Basel IVOne of the reasons why MasterCard cannot compete with newer fintech companies is its business structure. It has a symbiotic relationship with the banks, and with Basel III and IV being implemented whereby banks have to hold more capital for their RWA (risk weighted assets) amongst others, it will have a direct impact on MasterCard and other large payment companies.It will have an impact because under Basel III, banks will need to hold more equity of having a large credit loans book on its balance sheet; in many cases, it will be between 5-10% more capital.Even if the profits on the credit card business does not fall over the next few years, which is unlikely, it will be deemed increasingly unprofitable for the banks causing them to shrink their credit card exposure considerably and focus on higher return on equity ventures.Economic risksThe global economy plays a major part in the profitability of credit card companies because it drives spending, and globally, we are seeing reduced spending, especially in developed markets, and also reduced velocity of money, which suggests two things; firstly, people are saving more because they are more concerned about their economic future, and secondly, people do not have more money as their current debt obligations are already too high.Whichever one is correct, it will place considerable pressure on earnings in the credit card business, and as if these were not enough, there is one more significant risk to consider and that is investment risk.MasterCard and other credit card companies make substantial use of securitization where they take a pool of credit card loans paying a certain amount of interest per year, put them together, and create a credit card asset-backed security (ABS), which is then sold off in the market particularly to institutional investors.We are seeing more and more that there is less of an appetite for these types of securities as most institutional investors are already significantly overweight on debt instruments, leaving them very exposed to interest rate fluctuations.This will greatly affect MasterCard because it will reduce its ability to fund its operations, and will gradually need to downsize in order to stay in business.In conclusion, this is why I started by saying MasterCard is an enigma because we have seen strong growth in its share price this year, but when one looks deeper at its business model and also that of its rivals like Visa (NYSE:V) and American Express (NYSE:AXP), we begin to see a huge change and disruption in the heart of the industry with significant headwinds creating a perfect storm from which we will see a totally different industry by 2019.MasterCard has benefitted a lot from the low interest rates it has been paying for buying its money, as the graph below clearly shows.We can also see this chart from the revenues angle (sign-in required) because in 2006, it was $3.326 billion, in 2007, it was $4.068 billion, in 2008, it was $4.992 billion and so on until 2015 when it was $9.667 billion and estimated to be $13.218 billion in 2018.At the same time throughout this decade, SG&A have averaged at about $3 billion while margins have increased from 1.5% in 2006 to 39.4% in 2015.Looking at its balance sheet, it does not look like the company has invested more or streamlined operations to earn the huge returns that it has enjoyed over the last decade because spending has remained flat.There is an expression that says that 'not all growth is good', it is undeniable that MasterCard has benefitted immensely from the actions of the Fed and other central banks around the world.We now have a situation at the moment where the Fed finds itself between a rock and a hard place because with interest persisting this low, the banks will struggle with profitability issues, and when this is combined with Basel III and IV, it will also seriously affect MasterCard's operating margin.On the other hand, a voluntary increase in interest rate is unlikely because the Fed is afraid of various unintended circumstances, which could result in another financial crisis.Nevertheless, it is my firm belief that while the Fed and other central banks continue to hesitate, circumstances will appear most likely within the European banking sector or Asia that will force their hand to move interest rates higher.It is very likely that MasterCard will be caught in the crossfire in relation to what I have said above.With regards to the case in the UK courts, we should see a verdict in 2019, but as I said above, the verdict is almost a side matter, but the damage from the litigation will be the label as the brand that steals money from its customers.This is why I believe that the price of its shares will fall from 102 where it is right now to between 22-30, which I believe is where the company needs to be when one considers the fundamentals and prevailing sentiments. Anything above this is market froth.It is also interesting to note that short interest is also beginning to pick up. It is currently 0.5% of the total shares outstanding; while it is not a lot per se, it is a sign that the smart money is beginning to position themselves to short this company.There is no such thing as a sure bet in the investment game, as market watchers, speculators, traders and so on, our job is as much the same as a judge presiding over a case.We need to listen and read, then stack what is at best circumstantial evidence, meaning that it is evidence that relies on an inference to connect it to a conclusion of facts.We must then assess the evidence in both ways, and at this point, a pattern will begin to emerge, and this pattern will tell us that on the balance of probabilities, there is a 60% or an 80% chance of this event taking place.At this point, we must now test our hypothesis with a small fraction of our funds, and then if we see that it is moving in the direction of our belief, then we add a little bit more, but if we see that our hypothesis was wrong, then we cut our losses.This is what I advise investors to do with MasterCard. For those who are already in, I suggest you begin to cut your holdings gradually because it is very likely that we are at the top, and you want to sell while there are still buyers in the market who believe that it will keep going higher.In conclusion, I believe this is a stock that should be shorted, but one must pivot carefully because the buy momentum is still very strong and one must tread carefully but surely in the shorting or selling direction."
3996194,23899,2016-08-05T01:28:51-04:00,There is a disconnect between market malaise and a booming global payments processing industry.Cashless transactions are on the rise and have room to grow.Mastercard is a growth story in the industry and has recently acquired VocaLink at a discount after Brexit.,"By Joseph HogueEverywhere you look there seems to be malaise about global economic growth and the outlook for markets. Forecasts for economic growth are continuously downgraded, and more than a third of global bonds carry a negative yield as investors rush to safety.However, digging deeper in the data uncovers a market disconnect between this wall of worry and a booming global payments processing industry.Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) beat expectations to report a 10% increase in global payment volume and a ""remarkably steadfast consumer in the face of significant global instability.""Here in my office in Colombia, I'm watching the shift to a cashless society happen first hand as people get tired of carrying large stacks of bills and instead opt for credit and debit cards. This shift in emerging markets could carry global payment growth, with Boston Consulting Group (BCG) forecasting as much as $900 billion in transaction-based revenue growth up for grabs through 2024.One market leader is taking advantage of the Brexit shakeup to snap up a competitor at a 12% discount, expanding its global footprint. Even better, its board just authorized a massive share buyback, and earnings this year could be well over expectations.Consumers Seem Unaffected By Global Economic MalaiseEvery time the market reaches new highs, investors are reminded of sluggish economic growth and central bank policy that may be tapped out. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has once again cut its outlook on 2016 growth, forecasting the global economy to improve by just 3.1% this year and 3.4% in 2017 as Brexit uncertainties weigh.As the market fights off disappointing earnings reports and economists lament about the outlook for the rest of the year, it seems that consumers haven't gotten the message that they should be worried.Using the Atlanta Fed's GDP growth model, second quarter consumer spending is expected to jump 4.5%, its strongest pace since Q1 2006. Recovering income growth, low gas prices and greater use of debt could all propel spending this year.BCG reported growth in every geographic region in its 2015 Global Payments Report, and forecast that global payment processing could grow 6.2% annually to $1.99 trillion by 2024. That would mean $900 billion in payment and transaction business revenue growth up for grabs over the ten-year forecast period.Growth in emerging markets is leading the pack as consumers continue the shift to credit-driven economies. Asia-Pacific and Middle East/Africa are expected to post 10% annual growth, followed closely by Latin America with 7% and even 5% annual growth in North America.Retail transactions are expected to remain the dominant form of global payments, accounting for 78% of total payments revenue in 2014. Within retail transactions, credit and debit card transactions are expected to account for 61% of total revenue growth through 2024. That could mean almost $550 billion in revenue growth for credit card companies.MasterCard Pounces On A Brexit DiscountMastercard Inc. (NYSE:MA) is riding the wave of international growth as payment processing becomes a larger share of purchases and people move away from cash transactions. Gross dollar volume in the international segments grew between 14% and 16% last year on a currency-neutral basis, while even the more mature U.S. market volume grew 7% on the year.The company recently announced its acquisition of VocaLink, a UK-based company that processed more than 11 billion transactions last year, totaling ₤182 million ($139 million). Priced at $920 million, the deal would have cost MasterCard $1.04 billion before the Brexit vote. The acquisition helps MasterCard beef up its business-to-business and peer-to-peer business lines and to increase its global footprint. While the sales from VocaLink are relatively small, transaction volume is very high on its large network and could add meaningfully to MasterCard.Shares of MasterCard trade for 26.0 times expected fiscal 2017 earnings of $3.55 per share, which are seen just 3.2% higher from last year on revenue growth of 8.2% to $10.5 billion. While the 26-multiple is right at the five-year average on trailing earnings, shares traded as high as 28.9 times trailing in April after the company beat first quarter earnings.The major headwind to earnings expectations continues to be dollar strength, as foreign currency translation led to a 7% negative impact in 2015 on an 8.3% increase in the dollar against a basket of currencies. There's reason to believe this year could be the turnaround for dollar earnings pain. After all the events that should have led to the greenback surging, from terrorist attacks overseas to Brexit and negative yield government bonds, the USD is down 1.8% so far this year.Taking advantage of weak sentiment around earnings growth, MasterCard's board authorized a share repurchase program of up to $4 billion that became effective in February. The buyback amounts to 4% of shares outstanding and could help to boost earnings per share.My own estimate of $3.75 per share in 2016 earnings is based on the buyback, slightly higher sales on a stronger consumer and a turn to neutral effect on currency translation. There's a chance for even higher earnings on a weaker dollar and stronger profitability. A multiple of 28-times earnings puts my one-year target at just under $105 per share for a 10% gain on the current trade.Risks To Consider: Shares are already valued around their historic multiple and could be susceptible to a selloff in the general market.Take advantage of near-term undervalued Mastercard to go long on the potential for a longer-term boost as it takes advantage of a weak British pound to add to its network.This article originally appeared on StreetAuthority.com."

So long as they meet new rules, the likes of Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA), and American Express (NYSE:AXP) are free to compete in China's lucrative electronic payments industry. Foreign companies have lobbied regulators for years to get access to this market, and MasterCard plans to apply this year to become a licensed payment service provider. However the company is still working on a strategy, and MA is yet to decide whether it will partner with another firm or go it alone. China's credit card market is a massive opportunity, but MA will have trouble establishing a footprint. However, due to the sheer size of the market, MA may not have to in order to materially benefit from its expansion into China.China is a massive opportunity for credit card companies. It is the world's most populous country and its credit card market is projected to become the world's biggest by 2020. The value of consumer credit card transactions totaled 55 trillion yuan in 2015 (equal to 48% of consumer spending), and credit card transactions as a percentage of total spending should increase thanks to increased mobile use and deeper e-commerce penetration, which drives demand for electronic payment processing services. It really is a secular growth industry. China is rebalancing its economy away from an investment and manufacturing driven model to one based on consumption, and regulators are implementing policies to accelerate this shift, for instance by cutting interest rates and binging on debt to prop up growth. Consumption accounted for 38% of China's GDP in 2014, but this fraction is expected to reach 50% by 2030, driven by the rising middle class and urbanization.It is no wonder that companies have been so desperate to get into China, but things will not be easy for MasterCard and its peers. MA must meet China's national security and cyber security standards, which are different from those in America, and must also hold 1 billion yuan in a local company. MA is still working on understanding the rules, which is part of the reason why it has taken so long to devise a business plan. But the biggest challenge will be taking market share from state-owned China UnionPay, who essentially has a monopoly over the credit card market. Its processing network is used by 80% of debit cards, and the company accounted for 72% of total transaction value in 2014. Thanks to network effects, China UnionPay has a wide moat that will make it difficult for new entrants to compete. The company's payment system is used by the most merchants and the most cardholders, which attracts more merchants and cardholders. This makes it hard for companies operating on smaller scales to catch up. Chinese banks do issue Visa, MasterCard, and American Express cards but very few Chinese merchants accept them and they are mostly used for foreign travel. MA is essentially starting from scratch, and it will take a lot of time and resources to build up an infrastructure that has a chance of competing.But MA would not have to take much share in order to see a big financial benefit. China's card market is on pace to reach $9 trillion next year, and if MA can get just 0.1% share it would lead to 9 billion in incremental revenue, which alone amounts to more than 75% of MA's forecasted revenues for 2017 ($11.63 billion).Conclusion:China is a huge opportunity for MasterCard, but it will be very difficult to grow share. That being said, MasterCard does not have to take much share in order to make its expansion into China worthwhile. China will drive global credit card industry growth over the next decade, and by investing in infrastructure now, MA can position itself for long-term growth."

As usual, investors need to check the underlying facts on the thesis and not rely solely on high-level concepts.During this time period, the stock has made several attempts at breaking above $97.50 with no luck. At the same time, MasterCard has traded on several occasions below $87.50. The Q2 results again highlight the reasons for this struggle that might surprise most investors.The payments network provider continues to see solid growth in volumes and transactions, but a lot of the under the radar issues are holding back the key growth metrics.A prime example is in the incentives given to partners to utilize MasterCard over Visa (NYSE:V) or another competitor. The recent deal with American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) was very rewarding to the airline. For Q2, the rebates and incentives again held back growth with a 21% increase to $1.1 billion. These numbers are listed as a reduction to revenues as opposed to an expense.Source: MasterCard Q216 presentationMasterCard does an incredible job of keeping operating expenses under control which is a prime reason that MasterCard has a market cap of $106 billion on sales of only slightly above $10.5 billion this year. The whole fundamental story is built on incredible margins.Source: MasterCard Q216 earnings releaseFor the 1H of the year, MasterCard saw a reduction in the operating margins from 56.3% last year to 55.2% this year. The operating margins are incredible and part of the reason that new credit card deals with the likes of American Airlines include significantly more incentives.Sometimes what a company does with capital returns tells a crucial story. In the case of MasterCard, the company commits to capital returns that includes both dividends and stock buybacks.The amounts though accumulate to very little actual capital returned to shareholders. The current dividend is one of the few in the market that fall below 1% and MasterCard only returned $462 million to shareholders via buybacks during Q2. The below chart shows a picture of stalling money spent on buybacks.Instead of spending big on buybacks during Q2, MasterCard bought VocaLink for up to $1.1 billion in a very dilutive transaction. The company estimates a roughly $0.05 hit to both 2017 and 2018 earnings while leaving money on the table for a share repurchase plan that contributed $0.03 to Q2 earnings.The key investors takeaway is that the investment thesis for MasterCard is not all that it seems. Sure the global payments company provides access to the consumer shift away from using cash for payments, but the global payments community increasing wants to share in the profits that have already provided investors with a market value in excess of $100 billion.The stock isn't likely to go anywhere fast at his valuation."

        The stumbling block for many investors relates the valuation and the low starting yield.
        This article addresses how you can get paid to buy shares of the company at a lower valuation.","In a recent article I detailed the exceptional business and investment history of MasterCard (NYSE:MA). The company grew revenues north of 10% per year and earnings-per-share increased by about 20% per annum. The dividend and share price grew even faster as longer-term shareholders saw annual returns on the magnitude of 30% from 2008 through 2015. Moreover, a robust pace of growth is anticipated to continue.Of course not all is always rosy. Aside from potential business concerns (upcoming lawsuits, sustainability of exceptional margins, etc.) there are two basic ""issues"" with the security that an investor must also consider: the valuation and the low starting yield.The second part is not an issue for a good deal of investors - focusing instead on business performance and trusting this will eventually be reflected in the price. However, for your average income investor a dividend yield starting under 1% is a big stumbling block. As such, in that previous article I demonstrated how you could both own shares of MasterCard and significantly increase the yield that you receive by using call options.For instance, you could agree to sell at $115 between now and September of next year and collect an extra ~$100 for doing so. If the option is not exercised your cash flow yield is above 2%. If the option is exercised, you're looking at a 30%+ gain in just over a year. There are numerous such possibilities to slightly or significantly boost what appears to be a low starting yield with call options.The valuation piece was more or less glazed over. Analysts are anticipating 15%+ intermediate-term growth, so a higher valuation multiple appears warranted. Yet it's conceivable that you'd like to own a piece of MasterCard but only at a lower price or better valuation. In this article, let's explore how you could express that sentiment and get paid for doing so.This table highlights some available put options for the September 2017 expiration date. Note that I have no affinity for this date (many prefer much shorter time horizons) but it makes annual comparisons a bit easier.The first column illustrates the strike price of the put option or the price at which you'd be agreeing to buy 100 shares of MasterCard. If you don't believe in the company, naturally much lower prices would not be attractive to you. Alternatively, if you want to own shares but just at a lower price, the above table provides an overview of some possibilities.The second column shows the ""net"" premium that you would receive for making this agreement. It uses the most recent bid less $0.20 per share for frictional expenses. The third column shows the upfront cash flow yield that this would represent based on the funds required to ""cash secure"" the option.The fourth column demonstrates the discount that this strike price would represent (including the premium received) as compared to the current share price quotation near $88.Finally, the last column presents an ""implied P/E ratio"" which uses the cost basis for each strike price against next year's projected earnings. The current multiple is around 25 times earnings, so you can see the lower valuations that are represented in addition to the discount column.Selling a put option is quite like selling insurance. You're collecting a premium today and agreeing to do something in the future under ""adverse"" circumstances. Actually, in my view, selling put options can be better than selling insurance.If you sell a homeowner's policy, you collect the premiums and root for that house to never have any damage. Your goal is for the homeowner to never need you to do anything. On the other hand, if you'd like to eventually own shares of MasterCard anyway, it's not as crucial that the share price remain where it is or go higher. For a trader that might be the goal, but a long-term investor has a different set of ambitions.If you're happy to own shares, the consolidation prize is generating a bit of extra income and not seeing the put option exercised. The real benefit for the long-term investor would be owning shares in a great company at a lower valuation.Anyway, the reason that you might consider selling a put option as part of a long-term portfolio is to get paid to agree to buy at a lower price.MasterCard's historical average earnings multiple has been in the mid-20 range over the last decade or so; quite near where it sits today. Of course the growth rate of the company is expected to slow a bit and the valuation has previously reached a multiple in the mid-teens. So you might demand a lower valuation - say something closer to 20 times earnings for the security. Let's see how this could work in practice.Next year MasterCard is expected to earn $3.60 or so per share. At 20 times earnings, that equates to a share price of about $72. You could set a limit order at this price and see what happens in the year to come. Alternatively, you could get paid to express this willingness to buy.For instance, the September 2017 put option with a $75 strike price has current ""net"" bid of about $4.30. Let's see what this could mean.If MasterCard's share price remains above $75 it would be unlikely that the option would be exercised (why sell to you at $75 when you could sell in the market for $75+?). If you had a limit order, nothing would happen. Your price was not hit, you collect no income and have no shares.Alternatively, if you sold the put option, you would immediately collect ~$430 in option premium, representing a 5.7% yield that can instantly be redeployed or utilized as you see fit. (Note this premium could be taxed differently than qualified dividends or long-term gains.) You still don't own shares of MasterCard, but you do have an extra $430 to work with by expressing the willingness to buy at that price. Depending on your alternatives to allocate capital, that's not the worst of consolation prizes.If MasterCard's share price does go below $75, the option could be exercised - forcing you to buy 100 shares of the company. In this case your cost basis would be closer to $71; representing a 20% discount from today's price and equating to an implied earnings multiple of just under 20. Mission accomplished: you bought shares in an excellent business at a lower valuation.Some might point out that this does not prevent against a loss, which is true. Should the share price drop to $60, you'd be stuck buying at $75. That's why it's important to be content with both sides of the agreement. All too often options get a bad reputation as a trading tool, but you can get paid to make an agreement with a long-term view as well.In short, MasterCard has thus far proven to be an exceptional business and investment over the years, with solid growth prospects expected to continue. The problem that many investors have with the security is the valuation and the low starting yield. We've previously addressed the low starting yield and this article demonstrates how you can earn additional income by agreeing to buy at a lower price."
3986358,61281,2016-07-05T14:07:21-04:00,After Apple and AmEx now MasterCard is linked to a PayPal deal.Such a deal will create a significant financial player with incredible online/offline services package.Deal size and financing are expected to be major roadblocks to pass.I remain bullish on PayPal with an acquisition scenario being my secondary catalyst and TPV growth my primary catalyst.,"In recent years, the e-payment market which used to be dominated by PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been getting more and more crowded with many new players joining the market. The shift toward online shopping around the world and the increase in the GMV (""Gross Merchandise Value"") amount most retailers and e-commerce companies present each quarter made the e-payments market attractive and convinced many companies to launch an e-payment service. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and more had introduced their e-payment service in the last couple of years when the market boomed.As the market is getting bigger, more companies are looking to penetrate it while existing companies are seeking to expand their market share to generate substantial revenues. These two processes add enormous pressure on PayPal to remain competitive and not lose market share while industry giants are eyeing the payments company as a way to take over the e-payments market quickly. Beyond its brand, extensive network and incredible business, PayPal also has some very lucrative assets like Venmo, Xoom and Braintree that dominate specific niches of the market and are precious to many competitors.One of the companies that was previously mentioned as a potential buyer is Apple, which will attempt to boost its services segment revenue quickly by using its enormous reserve of unused cash. That deal would have made sense some time ago. However, with accelerated global expansion, new web capabilities, and the Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) partnership, it seems that Apple has gone in a different direction. And it is set to compete directly with PayPal for market dominance. In my opinion, an Apple-PayPal deal is not off the table.After the Apple rumor faded, American Express (NYSE:AXP) reportedly offered to acquire PayPal for $47 per share and planned to use PayPal CEO Dan Schulman's history in AmEx to enable the company to penetrate the e-payments market. While Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard control most of the payment processing in the e-payments market, American Express is hardly a significant player in that market, and such a deal would have unlocked incredible benefits for both companies. A merged AmEx-PayPal company could have improved PayPal's transaction costs (and margin), allowed AmEx to attract new businesses to its network by offering a comprehensive payment solution, offered white-label e-payments services to third parties, and more. However, the valuation of the deal together with AmEx valuation meant that AmEx needed to raise an incredible amount of funds that was almost impossible to pull off.The AmEx deal faded away a few months ago, and now a PayPal-MasterCard deal surfaces. Unlike the deal with AmEx, the benefits from the MasterCard deal are tremendous. MasterCard (together with Visa) processes most of the transactions in the e-payment market and benefits as long as the total GMV in e-commerce transactions keeps growing (assuming most of them work with both Visa and MasterCard). The merged company could push PayPal as the digital payments arm into a new market, sectors and niches to expand the availability of digital payments worldwide. Of course, PayPal will improve its transaction margin by lowering the transaction costs that PayPal traditionally transfer to MasterCard and Visa.PayPal and MasterCard could create a financial giant that could offer a comprehensive financial package for online and offline customers that could enjoy a one-stop-shop for all their transaction needs that relates to credit/debit cards transactions, in-store/in-app/online transactions, credit line, invoicing and other online services and much more. The merged company could issue a credit card that charges the PayPal account directly that will enable more customers to use their PayPal account as a bank account (PayPal already has a banking license).The new potential company could benefit from both sides of the e-commerce business - it will collect the transaction fees that PayPal collects, and it will collect the processing fees that MasterCard collects - that way, the PayPal-MasterCard company will receive fees from the buyer and the seller and actually benefit from most transactions made using a digital payment method.If this deal takes place and PayPal and MasterCard agree on the terms, there will be significant roadblocks to its completion. The size of this potential deal is expected to be massive, as PayPal is currently valued at $44B. Assuming that MasterCard will prefer a stock and cash deal to lower the amount of debt to raise, the credit card giant will still need to raise a substantial amount of debt to potentially finance the transaction. However, as we just witnessed in the EMC-Dell case, MasterCard will have to sell some assets alongside with raising debt to fund the entire deal, and that might take time and depend on regulatory approvals.It is clear that the benefits are enormous, but it is not clear how Visa will react to such a deal. I believe that a PayPal-MasterCard deal will awaken Visa and shake the status-quo in the digital payment market between MasterCard and Visa. Visa has three likely options to react that seems equally possible at this stage:To acquire a leading e-payments vendor like Square (NYSE:SQ), Stripe or Dwolla to mimic PayPal transaction and fight back with the PayPal-MasterCard merged company in every segment. To exclusively partner with Apple Pay, Samsung Pay or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Messenger Payments to become their sole payment processor. Launch a Visa-owned digital payment service to compete with PayPal.I don't have the details behind the scenes whether MasterCard submitted a bid for PayPal or engaged the company to start a negotiation for a deal - but I believe that PayPal will not remain an independent company for a long time. I see great business opportunities for a credit card company to acquire PayPal as I presented above. However, the price might be too high to execute a deal in the current state of the markets. I remain bullish on PayPal as a long-term play in the FinTech sector. I cannot ignore the frequent rumors about a deal, and I consider a potential buyout as a secondary catalyst to my thesis when the primary catalyst is a TPV (""Total Payment Volume"") growth driven by China, Venmo, and Xoom."

Our focus is to do in-depth research on strong, durable franchises. We strive to buy great companies at reasonable prices. Our core belief is that value is driven by time, not timing. The process seeks to identify growth businesses with key attributes. Adhering to these investment traits leads to positive stock selection and outperformance.The Characteristics We Look ForClassificationsWhen we mention these traits to investors, we often hear ""of course""! Most investors look for these same desirable characteristics.The S&P 500 can be segmented or broken down into 10 different sectors: Healthcare, Technology, Financials, Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, Staples, Energy, Utilities, Materials and Real Estate. We try to avoid these strict definitions and industry classifications. Instead, our investment philosophy looks for wonderful businesses and attractive valuations regardless of sector. It just so happens that many of the companies we identify during our process tend to be in the financial sector or in technology-based businesses.What We Look For In ""Technology"" CompaniesWithin technology, we tend to prefer companies with little risk of obsolescence. Once again, we are attracted to companies generating sustainable and recurring revenue. The secular growth of digital payments, for instance, should provide years, if not decades, of predictable growth.Advice From BuffettLegendary investor Warren Buffett writes very readable and compelling annual letters to his Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) shareholders. In his 1991 annual report, Buffett had a great perspective on identifying the value of a franchise. He believes there are two kinds of enterprises. One is a business, and the other is a franchise. If you have the right product, investors are comfortable paying for this positive mental association. He argues that most successful franchises have characteristics like: no close substitute, a product or service that is needed or desired, and not being subject to price regulation. Lastly, Buffett believes that a franchise can price its products aggressively and still earn high rates of return on capital. Once it is possible to identify franchise value, the real trick is to properly frame how resilient it is. Buffett describes a franchise like a ""moat around your economic castle"". How big is it and how durable is that franchise?Example #1: Payment NetworksBack in 2012, Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) were both under pressure from a new competitive threat. A consortium of 70 major brands and 40 big box retailers were joining forces to create the Merchant Customer Exchange, or MCX. Companies like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Target (NYSE:TGT), Lowe's (NYSE:LOW), CVS (NYSE:CVS), Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD), Shell (NYSE:RDS.A) (NYSE:RDS.B), Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and others formed MCX to create a merchant owned mobile commerce network. MCX had a noble goal. It wanted to create a free app to let customers save time by centralizing loyalty, rewards, coupons and promotions at participating retailers' checkout counters. The unstated but real goal was to lower their cost of accepting card transactions (called the Merchant Discount Rate, or MDR, in the payment industry). MCX was going to create the latest in must-have payment apps. The app was called CurrentC after its original name - ISIS - became an obvious liability.The Street was worried that these retailers were powerful enough, with their 110,000 locations, to end the dominant position of the two largest payment networks. In terms of market share dominance (according to The Nilson Report), Visa and MasterCard represent roughly 75% and 91% of all global credit and debit purchase transactions. The companies generate operating margins in the 50% to 60% range. This kind of profitability and market share dominance is always going to attract competition.Keep It SimpleIn our opinion, the beauty of these franchises is their simplicity. We are not saying it is simple to authorize, clear, process and settle global credit and debit cards transactions. In fact, it is a terribly complex transaction that often occurs in just a few seconds. The simplicity of their business model is that customers can transact easily and make payment however they wish to transact. MCX and its CurrentC app were attempting to force customers to make payment via the Automated Clearing House, or ACH, network. By using ACH and not traditional funding sources (i.e.: credit or debit cards), participating merchants would be able to lower their operating costs. Forcing customers to utilize a different payment methodology rather than one they are already very comfortable using was not smart.Last month, MCX postponed and then shut down its roll-out of its merchant controlled mobile wallet. However, no sooner did this happen then Wal-Mart announced the launch of its new payment app called Wal-Mart Pay.A Different Type Of CompetitionMeanwhile, there was another potential payment threat in the works by 2014. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay was being launched with the new iPhone 6. Android (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Pay and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) Pay were also going to be released, and many feared that these mobile wallets were going to threaten Visa's and MasterCard's market dominance. The market assumed that Apple, with its beautifully designed phones and fully integrated operating system, would look to create and capture the payment market share. It was common thinking that the world's largest company would use its ample resources to invest in a business that generates 50% to 60% operating margins.As these new apps came to market, it was clear that these entities understood what their value add was to the consumer equation. None came out with an app that required some elaborate sign-up process or one that did not utilize traditional debit or credit cards. Instead, these phone and mobile operators recognized that Visa and MasterCard provide a valuable service, and have a wonderful franchise with a dominant and wide moat. These potential competitors decided it was a better choice to partner with rather than fight the established payment players.Looking ForwardWe do not know which mobile wallet will ultimately grow and become the latest must-have app. One might have allegiance to the Apple iPhone while others believe the Samsung phone is the latest and greatest device. We do not need to go too far back in history to remember how dominant BlackBerries were in the hardware segment. It is our belief that providing customers with choice is a better alternative. All successful payment apps or newly created mobile wallets should allow bank issued credit and debit cards to act as a funding source. Behind the scenes, we expect both Visa and MasterCard to be the dominant payment networks executing these purchase transactions. This should provide years of future growth.GrowthThe secular growth of digital payment networks will come from a steady conversion from cash and check to card-based payments, and higher penetration of online purchase transactions, which need to occur electronically. In addition, there are emerging markets that are slowly embracing digital payments. For example, China is estimated to be an $8.4 trillion market opportunity. The Chinese market should continue to grow in the double-digit range and it currently represents over half of the 9.5 billion cards issued globally.However, despite its large card-issued market share, China UnionPay (CUP) only represents roughly 10% of global purchase transactions. The card market in China is protected by the People's Bank of China, which limits the ability of foreign competitors to enter. Over the next one to two years, we believe these official rules will be opened up for players like Visa and MasterCard to begin to capture some of this growing market. Visa is partnering with China UnionPay and MasterCard has relationships with Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Tenpay. It is this type of open-ended growth and opportunity that leads great franchises to garner a high weighting in our portfolios.ConclusionOnce again, this growth will be predictable, sustainable and recurring in nature. That is our definition of a formidable franchise with significant competitive advantages. These two companies clearly meet all of the characteristics we mentioned earlier."
3989494,64913,2016-07-19T12:57:31-04:00,,"MasterCard (NYSE:MA) is the latest contender to jump into the ever escalating payment app wars.The credit and debit card giant is now offering MasterPass a digital wallet similar to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay. A press release claims that MasterPass will be available at five million merchants in 77 countries or 33 markets. If that is true, MasterPass is the most widely available payment App in the world.The MasterPass website states that instore is coming soon and does not list any US brick and mortar retailers that take the app. That conflicts with a MasterCard press release that states Office Depot (NASDAQ:ODP) and BJ’s Wholesale Club will take the app.MasterPass will also be available through a number of retailers’ apps; including Lord and Taylor, Jet Blue, Saks Fifth Avenue, Subway and the Cheesecake Factory (NASDAQ:CAKE). The website does not say when the solution will be available in the brick and mortar stores. Bass Pro Shops, Avis Budget Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:CAR), Gilt, Broadway.com, Burger King, Neiman Marcus, CheapoAir, Golfsmith, Newegg, Major League Baseball, and 1-800 Flowers (NASDAQ:FLWS) are mentioned at the MasterPass website.The contactless payment solution will be first rolled out on Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Android in the US, then made available in other nations. According a press release more than 80 million MasterCard accounts will be automatically enabled for the solution. The press release did not say when MasterPass for Apple will be available.Supported by the Big BanksMasterPass is supported by the following banks: Aly Bank, Associated Bank, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Bank of the West, Capital One (NYSE:COF), BMO Harris Bank (NYSE:BMO), Citi (NYSE:C), Fifth Third Bank (NASDAQ:FITB), Central Bank, First Hawaiian Bank, First Tech Federal Credit Union, KeyBank, People’s United Bank, Security Services Federal Credit Union, Sun Trust and Virginia Credit Union.MasterPass looks like a serious contender in the payment wars that has a few advantages over Apple Pay. A big one is the existing MasterCard payment network. One critical step the company has done is to get the big monster banks including BOA and Citi (C) onboard. Notably missing is Chase (NYSE:JPM) which is pushing its own Chase Pay solution.A next step will be to integrate the app with other solutions like Walmart Pay, PayPal and Chase Pay. One interesting development will be to see if it will work with PayPal’s popular credit cards. Another interesting aspect to this is to see if Masterpass will ever be accepted by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). That might be critical to its success in today’s world.The appearance of Masterpass will certainly put pressure on competitors like Visa (NYSE:V) and American Express (NYSE:AXP) to roll out payment apps of their own. It’ll also help existing solutions like Android Pay and Apple Pay, by giving merchants more incentive to accept them.There are some initial advantages to MasterPass including the ability to rent cars with it, something that is not available with Apple Pay. There are some notable absences including no gas stations or vending machines which I think will be some of the biggest markets for payment apps.Another fascinating question is whether users will be able to get cash from Bank of America ATMs with Masterpass; Android Pay users in San Francisco now that have capability. A more interesting question is whether Masterpass will work with Bitcoin.The advent of MasterPass proves how quickly the worlds of finance and technology are coming together. Fintech organizations like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) are slowly evolving into payment processors, meanwhile payment processors like MasterCard and banks like JPMorgan Chase are gradually becoming Fintech organizations. Even some retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) are slowly taking on the attributes of both Fintech and payment processing companies.One has to wonder how long before every credit company and bank is offering its own payment app. The day is coming when brick and mortar banking will be a quaint memory."
3987124,36431,2016-07-08T10:17:12-04:00,Mastercard's ROE is superior to Visa's.Looking to leverage (and other components of ROE) for an explanation.Who's the cash flow king?,"I like Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) as investments because of their tollbooth nature and hard-to-replicate size-and-scale. A lawsuit from 2013 recently sprang back from the dead, causing both companies' share prices to sell off. MasterCard took a bigger hit than Visa.V data by YChartsI was initially a little puzzled by the difference in sell-off magnitude, especially because of MasterCard's higher return on equity. Going back in time a full year, the price performance discrepancy is even wider, with MA shares down a little over 7.50%. Shares of V are actually 9.15% higher from this time last year.Breaking down return on equityTo gain some insight into where both firms stand in relation to ROE, I grabbed some numbers from their annual reports and created the below Dupont analysis.Right off the bat, we can see that despite Visa's superior operating margins (EBIT/revenues), it fails to earn even half of MasterCard's ROE. Adjusting for leverage (which magnifies return on equity) - even with MasterCard's assets to equity ratio of 2.46 - Visa's ROE would still be inferior at roughly 39.59%.The biggest difference between the two firms' return on equity, besides leverage, seems to revolve around their asset turnover ratios. This difference deserves more attention.Asset turnover: Where the income statement and balance sheet collideMasterCard's asset turnover dipped slightly in fiscal 2015, but despite Visa's sequential improvements in the same ratio over the last three years, it still hasn't come even close to catching up. It appears MasterCard is more efficient at utilizing its assets, and I think I've found a possible explanation.V Goodwill and Intangibles (% of Annual Assets) data by YChartsVisa's balance sheet carries more ""airy"" assets - or intangibles and goodwill. This appears to be the main culprit responsible for shaving off percentage points from Visa's ROE, as bloated assets drag down the asset turnover ratio. Just for arguments sake, if we applied MasterCard's % of goodwill and intangibles to Visa's balance sheet and held sales constant, Visa would come out with an asset turnover in the 0.42x ballpark. Its leverage ratio would also drop to around 1.15x, however - deflating ROE back down closer to where it was before the adjustment.Free cash flow capabilities are also keyI created the below charts to compare the free cash flow generating abilities of both Visa and MasterCard.Starting with MasterCard first, it's clear that the benefits of being a tollbooth business in a duopolistic industry pays off handsomely in the form of massive free cash flow. It's hard to go wrong when there's that much cash spinning off the business, and guess what? Visa is drowning in even more cash.Visa clearly wins this round, and some might argue this is more important than ROE - especially dividend growth investors who are looking for sustainable and abnormally-high dividend increases. This is likely a function of size-and-scale. Visa is king of the payments market, and while MasterCard also dominates, it's a distant second.Source: Visa 2015 annual reportMasterCard's free cash flow has also been slightly more constrained than Visa's, with capex more than tripling since the beginning of the decade, while Visa's hovers within a relatively flat range in comparison. If MasterCard's capex eventually levels out (stabilizing like Visa's), along with operating cash continuing to march higher, it could end up converting even more free cash flow from its sales in the future. Time is the friend of the tollbooth business with low capital expenditures, especially when all it does is take an automatically inflation-adjusted fee every time you swipe your debit and/or credit card.Conclusion: MasterCard is king of capital allocation, Visa wins the free cash flow fightVisa's return on equity isn't even half that of MasterCard's, and it can't blame this discrepancy on lower leverage, either. MasterCard is able to generate more sales from its existing asset base (which isn't filled up with nearly as much goodwill). Despite lower margins than Visa, it makes up for this deficiency with better asset efficiency. Visa's ROE is nothing to sneeze at, either, and after adding some debt in 2016 to its previously debt-free balance sheet, there could be a tick-up in leverage going forward, magnifying its ROE in the process.While MasterCard is clearly the ROE leader, Visa tends to turn more of its sales right into free cash flow. I think MasterCard can catch up as time goes on, however, and it's not like its cash-starved anyways. I think both businesses earn economic profits and both of them mint above-average amounts of money.Barriers to entry are extremely high now, and assuming there isn't some unforeseen technological disruption lurking around the corner - it's probably pretty hard to go wrong owning both in the long-run. I know I plan to do so.One thing I'm personally watching, however, is merchant disputes, and their attempts to find ways to bypass the tollbooth completely. So far it's probably not a major threat, but it could eventually evolve into a bigger one further down the road. As of now, I know if a store told me that it didn't accept my Visa or MasterCard, I probably wouldn't shop there. I think that Visa especially (as the largest domestic debit card brand) carries the bigger bargaining power stick compared to the retailers who complain about its fees.While MasterCard took a bigger tumble than Visa in the sell-off, both MA and V shares now trade for slightly more than the overall market multiple and between 21-22 times forward earnings - which is probably a pretty fair price for both of these superior businesses.If you enjoyed this article and would like to receive further updates and articles in the future, please feel free to hit the ""Follow"" button at the top of the page next to the author's name."
3980500,26891,2016-06-07T14:25:54-04:00,"There could be some short-term pain in V and MA, but that should be considered a buying opportunity.Long-term business trends remain favorable for both companies.V and MA are great cornerstones in a portfolio, especially for investors looking for growth today and capital return tomorrow.","Last week, I questioned whether Visa (NYSE:V) deserved to be near its highs. Perhaps I did a poor job explaining why I felt the stock may have some downside, but I don't think readers came away with the takeaway that I was trying to convey.Simply put, CEO Charlie Scharf told us that Q3 wasn't going to be very good and that full-year guidance now needed to be lowered. However, in 2017, investors can look forward to the business getting back on track.As a long-term investor, one to two quarters of struggle isn't necessarily a bad thing. In fact, for the optimistic, it can be viewed as good, because it may give us a buying opportunity. However, with the stock just off its all-time highs, that buying opportunity isn't as good as I thought it would be.This is where, I believe, I didn't get my point across to some readers. I am/was not calling to sell Visa or short it, nor do I doubt the company. It's just that when the CEO says this quarter will be bad, I'm not exactly lining up to buy the stock $2 off its all-time high.With all that being said, I'm quite bullish on both Visa and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) in the long term, and that's what I want to look at in this article.Both stocks are a part of my Future Blue Chip holdings. These are stocks that have long-term revenue and earnings growth, have shown a willingness to return capital to shareholders and are what I believe will become dividend-paying titans. As a result, I am looking to have a low cost basis in the distant future, as I cement these stocks as cornerstones in my portfolio.That's why, if there is short-term pain, I will have no issues with it, as I will use that opportunity to gobble up shares. At this rate, it doesn't look like short-term pain is in the picture, as V and MA both look like they could go on to make new highs.However, if the quarter is truly that disappointing, we may get our buying opportunity, as both stocks tend to trade in similar fashion.BusinessMany investors will argue about the valuation for these companies. Personally, I don't really have a problem with the valuation because of the companies' control of the market and the secular shift toward a cashless society.As we continue forward, more and more transactions are being conducted online or with plastic. Less consumers are using cash and check, and that bodes well for Visa and MasterCard. The companies merely serve as the ""middleman"" in these transactions, receiving a fee from merchants as customers continue to move towards credit and debit payments.This turnstile business model leads to outstanding margins, with both companies boasting operating margins in excess of 50% - an impressive mark for two stocks over the $100 billion mark in terms of market cap.So what we have here are two companies with dominating market share across the world, in a market that continues to expand, with incredibly strong margins. Why wouldn't you pay a premium for that?Both companies also boast strong revenue and earnings growth.For Those That Miss BoatsYou can't win 'em all. While also serving as a true-life statement, the saying is quite relevant in the investing world too. I've missed my fair share of good investment opportunities, but have been lucky enough to latch onto V and MA some years ago.For those that haven't done so, but want to own them, here's how I approach V and MA. I wait for my Future Blue Chip stocks to decline 10% from the highs, then I begin to buy more. I buy even more on a 15% decline, and on a 20% decline, I add to my position heavily.Perhaps this is a poor approach for some, but it's what works for me. Given the high quality nature of these companies, 10% pullbacks are rare, while 15% drops are generally short-lived. You may have to be patient, but these drops will eventually come.These charts aren't to highlight failure, but rather, highlight opportunity. Had investors bought on any of these noted dips, their positions would be in the green. It just goes to show that there are opportunities to buy these stocks when they're not at the highs.My crystal ball is out of commission right now, so I can't say if V and MA will or will not experience a 10% drop before making new highs. I also can't say these stocks won't rally to the point where a 10% drop in the future is still above current levels today. That's the risk in waiting, but I believe it's noteworthy to point these pullbacks out.V and MA are great companies with great long-term prospects. Buying now will almost surely lead to gains at some point in the future."
3986099,59401,2016-07-04T08:05:16-04:00,"MasterCard's share price is recently impacted by unresolved settlements and litigations.Is the current price undervalued, fairly valued or overvalued?MasterCard's biggest risks and headwinds will always be regulatory changes and litigations against the company.MasterCard is still an excellent long-term buy considering both the company's headwinds and business prospects.","MasterCard (NYSE:MA), the second largest payment network company in the world, has enjoyed enormous growth over the past decade. Between 2006 and 2015, the company achieved a 10-year average revenue growth of 12.65% each year and a 10-year average earnings-per-share growth of 28.80% each year (source: Morningstar). In the same period, the stock largely outperformed the S&P 500 (see the image below).However, due to a number of unresolved litigations, the stock is at one of the lowest points compared with its price over the past 12 months (see the image below). You may ask: is this the right time to invest in MasterCard?Considering both the company's current headwinds/risks and its business prospects (which I will explain later), I believe that MasterCard is an excellent long-term buy - even at its current price - if you are planning to invest in the company for at least 5 years. *Note that it is important to diversify, to invest for the long term, to invest in quality companies, and to invest in additional shares when the share price is lower to have a better margin of safety.Current Headwinds and RisksThe biggest headwinds and risks for MasterCard have always been regulatory changes/limitations and litigations against the company. Similar to Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard is subject to strong scrutiny from the U.S. and other countries' central banks, consumer protection agencies, and other government agencies that seek to protect consumers and merchants from overpaying interchange fees (aka swipe fees) that are set by MasterCard and Visa.Here is a diagram that shows how MasterCard earns its revenues and which stakeholder earns the biggest chunk of the swipe fees in a typical transaction (Source: GAO report):In a typical credit card transaction in the U.S., the merchant pays around 2% of swipe fees to the merchant's bank (acquirer). Then, the majority of the swipe fees (revenues for the banks) would go to the purchaser's bank (issuer) that issued the credit card. However, in a debit card transaction, the swipe fees are much lower at around 0.79% because of The Durbin Amendment that went into effect in 2011.MasterCard does not earn its revenues directly from swipe fees. It earns its revenues primarily from assessment fees charged to its customers (the banks, aka the acquirers and the issuers) on the ""gross dollar volume"" and the ""number of transactions"" that are processed through its payment network. This means that the more people use MasterCard, the more revenues MasterCard would earn from issuing banks and acquiring banks.Now, going back to the swipe fees that are paid by the merchants, many of the merchants (especially the largest players that have a low profit margin such as Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT)and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)) still argue that swipe fees are unreasonably high even though the fees have dropped significantly since the enactment of The Durbin Amendment. Many merchants advocate that they are losing much of their profits due to swipe fees. They believe that MasterCard and Visa's current practices are anti-competitive that discourage ""lower-cost payment network alternatives.""The current payment network industry is an oligopoly in which MasterCard and Visa own the majority of market share. In 2015, in terms of purchase transactions, MasterCard had a market share of 26%, Visa had 56%, and Union Pay of China had 13% (see image below from Nilson Report). Many of the antitrust and swipe fees litigations against MasterCard and Visa in the U.S., Europe and other countries have been ongoing for many years.The biggest headwinds and risks that could impact MasterCard's future business prospects are litigations and regulatory changes. Last week, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Visa, MasterCard, card-issuing banks' $7.25 billion settlement with millions of merchants (source: Reuters). The card-issuing banks (issuers) are responsible for paying the majority of the settlement fees since they are the ones who charge the highest portion of the swipe fees.In other countries, there are many similar cases in which merchants are filling class actions against MasterCard, Visa and issuing banks for setting interchange fees unreasonably high and for preventing merchants from directing customers to use cheaper payment methods. As a result, MasterCard had accrued a litigation liability of $710 million on its balance sheet as of March 31, 2016 (source: Q1 2016 10-Q Report).I cannot predict the outcome of the antitrust and interchange fees class actions against MasterCard and how much the litigations would impact the company's business prospects. But I believe that the litigation liability on MasterCard's balance sheet will continue to increase over the years. I also believe that there will always be a compromise between the payment networks (MasterCard and Visa), issuing banks and merchants.The merchants will always want the cheapest payment networks with the lowest interchange fees while payment network companies and issuing banks will always want to set the highest interchange fees.At the end of the day, merchants need MasterCard and Visa's payment networks in order to attract more sales from consumers (more and more customers are using payment cards instead of cash). MasterCard, Visa and issuing banks will need to be more reasonable in their interchange fees in order to keep the central banks and other regulatory agencies off their back.In the future, if more regulations are imposed to limit interchange fees, MasterCard's banking partners (the issuing banks) would be impacted the most as they would lose billions of revenues (which had already happened when interchange fees in the U.S. were reduced in 2011). To recuperate the losses, the issuing-banks would likely increase their banking fees and/or reduce rewards given to their customers. MasterCard's revenues could be impacted if the banks decide to negotiate for lower assessment fees. However, I believe that the impacts on MasterCard will be minimum because banks tend to offset the lower revenues from interchange fees to consumers by increasing the banking fees.Tailwinds and Business ProspectsOn the positive side, MasterCard will continue to benefit from consumers' increasing use of payment cards and digital payment methods (e.g. Apple Pay) instead of cash or cheques. As more buyers are using payment cards and spending more money, MasterCard would generate higher revenues from assessment fees charged to its customers, the issuing and acquiring banks. The increasing use of payment cards and the increasing gross dollar volume have always been the main revenue drivers for MasterCard since the company's inception.Here is a look at MasterCard's revenue and income growth for the past 10 years (source: Morningstar):In addition, more than half of MasterCard's revenue comes from countries outside of the U.S. According to 2015 10-K report, ""revenue generated in the U.S. was approximately 39% of net revenue in 2015, 2014 and 2013."" Most consumers in the developing countries are still using cash and cheques. It is likely that many of them will switch to payment cards as payment networks become more established in their countries.Another positive aspect of MasterCard is that it is the second largest player in the industry (the largest player is Visa). An oligopoly industry usually means that the ""largest players take all revenues."" Both MasterCard and Visa have created the most well-known brands in the payment network industry and have the largest global presence. It is extremely hard for other companies or organizations to create the same network that is as successful as MasterCard's and Visa's when both companies already dominate the industry.Valuation and ConclusionAt the time of writing, MasterCard is traded at a P/E of 26.8 (its 5-year average P/E is 25.9) vs. the S&P 500's P/E of 19.4. MasterCard's earnings yield is 3.7% vs. the S&P 500's 5.1% vs. the 30-year T-Bond Yield's 2.2%. The stock is likely fairly valued or slightly overvalued, considering the current P/E is above the 5-year average P/E by a small margin.In conclusion, I believe that MasterCard is an excellent long-term buy even though the company will continue to be impacted by antitrust and interchange fees litigations in many countries. On the positive side, it is almost impossible for other companies to create their payment networks that can compete with MasterCard and Visa (with the exception of Union Pay in China) because the two brands are already well established and accepted by most merchants and consumers in most countries. Moreover, MasterCard should continue to benefit from consumers' increasing use of payment cards and digital payment methods (e.g. smartphones) instead of cash and cheques.Disclaimer: I have a long position in MasterCard and Visa and will not change my position for the next 48 hours."
3984881,24276,2016-06-28T10:14:54-04:00,Card networks want merchants to keep accepting signatures on chip cards.Merchants know fraud is higher that way and want to move to all-PIN transactions.This is made more urgent by the liability shift. I'll explain.,"Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Kroger (NYSE:KR) and Canada's Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) are now fighting Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) over how chip cards are being implemented, just as Visa celebrates its big win in bringing Costco (NASDAQ:COST) to the fold.What's going on?The fight, of course, is over money, both money to be made by the card networks and money that could be lost by the merchants to fraud. Networks want stores to implement both chip-and-PIN, making credit cards work like debit cards, as well as chip-and-signature, in which chip cards work like mag-stripe cards did.The difference in price between the two methods is substantial. You can see it by analyzing debit cards. On a PIN-debit purchase of $100, a big merchant may pay just 25 cents while they would pay 72 cents on a signature debit purchase.The reason is that there is greater risk of fraud with a signature. Merchants don't look at signatures. But machines do look at PINs. If someone steals your debit card and can't get the PIN, they can't use it. But they can steal with it using a signature. I know. A college student stole my debit card a few years ago and did just that. He didn't use my PIN because he didn't get it - I keep that in my head.Now, what happens when chip-and-PIN is applied to credit cards? That's a transition that will take time because, quick, what's the PIN on your most-used credit card? OK, on your bank card? Exactly. You have memorized the bank PIN, but not the credit card one. This is something that will take time to turn into a habit.Visa and MasterCard want to retain the old habits of using the card the way you used a mag stripe and then signing off on it. They know this will increase fraud rates, which were estimated at 3.72 for every 10,000 mag-stripe and signature transactions in 2013. Fraud on ATM cards, by contrast, was less than 1 in every 10,000. And that was before the changeover to chips. Chip-and-PIN will not eliminate fraud, but it could cut it by two-thirds.Criminals are having to resort to fancy skimmers in order to steal both the data on the card and the PIN. This is transforming card fraud, from a crime of opportunity into one done by organized criminal gangs. It is still relatively small when compared with the vast number of transactions. But merchants pay for it in the fees to networks, and that is what is at stake here.There is another, bigger issue at stake, and another reason for big merchants to fight. That is the ""liability shift"" that occurred once chip cards were issued. Back in the mag-stripe era, losses on your card were the liability of your bank. In the chip era, they will be the responsibility of the merchant's bank. So long as merchants are supporting chip-and-signature, they are liable to losses from this type of fraud, something that is not a risk at, say, a bank ATM, which only uses chip-and-PIN.Merchants want to go to chip-and-PIN only because transaction costs are lower, and so are fraud rates. Banks, backed by Visa and MasterCard, argue that consumers are accustomed to using signatures, and that the security is in the chip card.But it isn't. As my own example shows, a lost card can still be used to steal from any merchant through a fake signature, which offers no real security to the merchant. Fraud rates are lower with PINs, and it's not really that hard to memorize one.This dispute is going to hit Visa and MasterCard in their top lines and in the costs of defending an indefensible argument in court until consumers are taught to memorize credit card PINs. Avoid these stocks until the networks cave."
3969165,22148,2016-04-28T16:23:24-04:00,MasterCard reported mixed Q1 results on surging costs.The stock continues struggling to trade above $100 as surging incentives stall earnings growth.The risk remains to the downside though the history is that investors are willing to overpay for the sector.,"Before the open, MasterCard (NYSE:MA) reported that Q1 earnings declined from last year but beat analyst estimates. The reason to like the company remains intact, but the reason to own the stock is still questionable.The stock initially surged to a high of $100, but the rally quickly faded during the trading day. My predictions over the last six months have repeatedly (here and here) focused on the key resistance at triple digits and the struggles for justifying a higher price. The chart even looks like a dreaded head and shoulders at this point.The quarterly numbers were unnecessarily messy due to some one-time costs and reversals of tax benefits from last year. The stock initially popped on the tax benefits last year and now the numbers look worse as the reported earnings show a YoY decline.The story with MasterCard remains one of two stories. First and foremost on investor minds is the growth in transactions and the global shift away from cash payments. Second, the maxed out margins is an issue mostly ignored by investors willing to pay high valuation multiples for the stock.The quarterly revenue slide from the investor presentation embraces the two issues perfectly. All of the revenue items show solid growth in a consistent manner that makes investors flock to the stock. The one big fly in the positive story is the surging hidden costs. The payment processors classify rebates and incentives as a reduction to revenues, but in reality this category is a cost. For Q1, incentives grew 22% on a currency-neutral basis.The rebates and incentive costs grew much faster than the main revenue categories of domestic assessments and transaction processing fees. The end result is that net revenues grew slower than volumes.The above method of reporting net revenues helps skew the reported operating margins, but MasterCard still generated a margin of 55% in the quarter. My investment thesis still sees these high margins as a risk to the downside with limited upside potential.This brings the valuation discussion front and center. MasterCard and Visa (NYSE:V) are continuously valued based on the concept of payment transactions shifting away from cash while ignoring the long-term risk to the margins. In that manner, investors pay multiples far above the actual growth rates of the associated companies.Due to quirky reporting of unadjusted numbers, MasterCard is only forecasted to grow earnings roughly $0.10 this year. Looking at the 2-year growth rate, the EPS is forecast to reach $4.13 in 2017 for a total increase of $0.70. In essence, the forecast is for 20% total growth over that period for an annual growth rate below 10%. The stock though trades above 23x those 2017 estimates.The MasterCard forward PE multiple at 21.3x analyst estimates is lower than Visa though both stocks are nearly equally expensive.The key investor takeaway is that MasterCard is a solid company and would be an appealing stock if trading at 15x EPS estimates. The stock though needs to trade down to $65 before value exists. For this reason, MasterCard will struggle trading above $100 in the short term.Nothing stops the stock from surpassing this price as investors have shown a willingness to overpay for the payment processors. The recommendation though is to avoid MasterCard at prices close to $100."
3969143,33291,2016-04-28T15:49:49-04:00,Everyone knows MasterCard.Shares are up about 10% from my initial buy call.Q1 earnings are out and I discuss the key metrics and tell you the one major issue I have with the company.,"MasterCard (NYSE:MA) is a company that everyone in America probably knows, and most people in developed nations are likely familiar with. It is simply a global enterprise and I regularly do business with them. The business model has only improved over the years as consumers have moved away from physical assets and cash for purchases, to more electronic means. Today MasterCard is up about 10% from where I recommended it at $90 a share. Thus, I wanted to check in on the name to see if this is a rare buying opportunity, or if there are performance concerns.Just this morning the company announced its Q1 2016 results. Once again, I am impressed because the results indicate that the company will continue its slow but reliable growth. It really is just a powerhouse. Net revenue for the quarter came in at $2.45 billion, a 10% increase over Q1 2015. However, due to currency changes and a stronger dollar, it may not be directly comparable of course. Thus if we control for currency and look at things on a constant dollar basis, the company actually saw a 14% increase in revenues. This was primarily due to a 13% jump in gross dollar volume and a 14% increase in processed transactions to approximately 12.6 billion. That is pretty sizable growth for a long-standing company like MasterCard. Further, global purchasing volumes rose another 12% to over $838 billion year-over-year. My problem with the company isn't volumes or revenues.So revenues were up nicely and they beat expectations very slightly by $70 million. That said, expenses were higher year-over-year versus last year. Total operating expenses as reported were actually up 25% year-over-year. However, as I did above for revenues, we really have to consider currency changes. When we adjust for changes in currency, we see operating expenses were up almost 29%. This rise led to total operating expenses that were $1.1 billion for several reasons. The increase was primarily due to the difference between foreign exchange gains related to currency hedging and balance sheet re-measurement which occurred in Q1 2015 versus foreign exchange losses on currency hedging in Q1 2016. This was of course offset by ongoing cost management initiatives. All of this led to operating income increasing 9% as reported. However, it was up a whopping 17% currency adjusted year-over-year. Operating margins were a strong 55.1% and operating income was up 4% on a constant dollar basis. While expenses were up, these are not my major issue.Factoring in the growth in revenues and the expenses of the company, the company reported net income of $959 million, a decrease of 6% as reported. Once again, adjusting to a constant currency basis, net income actually declined 2% year-over-year. This translated to earnings per share of $0.86 which beat estimates by a penny. All in all it was a strong quarter and net income only dipped due to the expense issue and the problems in Venezuela. Earnings are however not my problem.To be clear, these numbers are strong once again, even if some people were expecting better revenue and earnings growth. Revenues were up 10% year-over-year and beat estimates. That is a win. On top of it all, the company continues to be shareholder friendly, but not as friendly as I would like. During Q1 2016, MasterCard bought back 15 million shares for approximately $1.4 billion. Here in the present Q2 2016, the company has bought back another 3.0 million shares at a cost of approximately $288 million (through 4/21/16). There is still another $2.9 billion remaining under the current repurchase program authorization. So what is the problem? The company now pays a $0.76 annual dividend; $0.19 quarterly. This only translates to a 0.8% yield. While a dividend is shareholder friendly, I expect this dividend to grow in the coming years. With the earnings this company posts, shareholders deserve a higher payout, especially after it exhausts its buyback program. Shares have risen nicely, but if you can get them on a good pullback I would do some long-term buying.Note from the author: Christopher F.

3965838,97176,2016-04-18T04:10:27-04:00,"We think MasterCard's stock is cheap, and could climb if Visa's results are positive this week.67% of cards in the US are EMV. We believe this will cause an increase in transactions as consumers make smaller payments through PayPass instead of cash.Strong employment figures in the US and a weaker USD should be a big benefit to the company's growth.Management expects earnings to grow at a CAGR in the mid-teens through to 2018.","Although the share price has climbed over 7% in the last 30 days, we still believe that now is a great time to pick up shares in MasterCard (NYSE:MA). Year-to-date the global payments behemoth is still in negative territory and trading at what we believe to be a discount to rival Visa (NYSE:V). We expect both shares to provide good shareholder returns this year, but MasterCard might just be the pick of the two.Well, earnings season is here and next week sees Visa report their much-anticipated second quarter results. Visa's stock has underperformed this year, but a recent rally has now taken it into positive territory at long last. We are very bullish on its second quarter results and it appears the market is also, judging by the rally.We are already long Visa, but until recently had not taken a position in MasterCard. But this changed last week, as we do believe MasterCard's stock is undervalued at present and a good second quarter result from Visa could be the catalyst to taking MasterCard higher ahead of its own results a week or so later.Despite the fact that it has climbed recently, MasterCard is still trading at one of the lowest forward PE ratios in around 18 months. As well as this, the gap between the two stocks' ratio has widened somewhat and we feel any positive news could help boost MasterCard's share price and close the gap. This positive news could well come from Visa's results this week if its management team paint a positive picture of the industry and its outlook.As we said at the beginning, we are invested in Visa as well, but right now we are expecting MasterCard to deliver a better return on our investment than Visa. We plan on holding Visa for the long-term, so we are not about to sell any time soon. But given the choice, we would be buying MasterCard ahead of Visa.The transition to its EMV cards has been very pleasing and has now reached 67% of all US cards. Not only does the chip technology in the cards reduce levels of fraud, it also encourages card usage in our opinion. There are 1.2 million merchant locations in the US that are able to accept the cards, which is growing by the month. As PayPass reduces costs per transaction due to cash handling, security, and transportation costs, merchants are embracing the technology. This can only be good news for MasterCard and Visa.We believe PayPass encourages higher levels of transactions on cards because low-value transactions are accepted. Because of this, we feel the technology is conditioning consumers into leaving cash at home and using their cards at every opportunity. So much so we seldom, if ever, carry cash around with us anymore. MasterCard may only earn a fraction on these smaller transactions, but they soon build up and should support the fantastic transaction growth we have been seeing. Transactions were up 12% in Q4 FY15.On a macro level, things also look very positive. The growth in the US workforce should be a boost to Visa and MasterCard. More employed persons should mean more consumption and more transactions being handled by the two companies. The recent weakening of the US dollar will be a relief as well. In the fourth quarter of FY15 the company's net revenue increased by a solid 4%. But without the FX headwinds it would have grown by 9% YoY. If the Fed only raise interest rates once this year then the US dollar may not strengthen a great deal, giving MasterCard's top line a step up.Due to the shares being reasonably cheaper than Visa, we see significant upside ahead if the company beats on earnings. The expectations are certainly lower due to rebates and incentives. Analysts have forecast earnings per share to be 85 cents, compared to 89 cents a year previous. We would not be surprised to see this get hit out of the park, although it may be the second quarter where things really start to kick off.For the full year we forecast MasterCard to deliver earnings ahead of the consensus forecast of $3.53, as long as the US dollar remains relatively weak. If this is the case then we expect earnings in the region of $3.60 per share. At 29x earnings this gives us a target price of $104.40, providing investors a return of around 8%.Whilst an 8% return might not be enough to get readers excited about, it is worth considering the future earnings growth that is likely to take the share price much higher. CEO Ajay Banga has stated on the most recent analyst call that the company is intent on growing its earnings at a CAGR in the mid-teens from FY2016 through to FY2018.Furthermore, the opening up the Chinese market is a mouth-watering prospect. We believe it is best to lower expectations on it. There will be a long road ahead and UnionPay have a real hold on the market. But even a small market share could prove very lucrative and is worthy of the investment.We feel MasterCard and Visa represent two companies which are more than worth holding onto for the long-term. Shareholders have been rewarded for doing so in the past, and we expect they will be again in the future."
3986922,25228,2016-07-07T12:11:32-04:00,"MasterCard has proven itself to be an exceptional business with strong growth prospects.
        The problem for many income investors is the low starting yield.
        This article details how you can significantly increase the cash flow that you receive from owning the security.","MasterCard (NYSE:MA) has demonstrated itself to be an exceptional business and investment over the years. On the company side revenues grew by 10% annually from 2008 through 2015, while company-wide earnings grew by about 18% per annum. The profit margin is approaching 40% and the amount of capital required to feed the business is minimal.Perhaps equally impressive have been the returns generated for longer-term shareholders. Earnings-per-share growth eclipsed 20% per year during that time due to share repurchases, while share price growth and dividend growth was significantly higher. All told, investors saw total returns compounding at over 30% annually during that seven-year stretch.To be sure exceptional growth is still anticipated, with analyst estimates for intermediate-term growth easily in the double-digits. Aside from working with more prudent growth anticipations, there are two knocks against MasterCard as a potential investment.The first relates to valuation. When you're used to an average multiple being around 15 times earnings, or you see that Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) is sitting in plain sight at 11 or 12 times earnings, it can be hard to react favorably to a company with an earnings multiple in the 20's. Still, an investor could still stand to benefit even with a higher P/E ratio, should above average growth formulate.The second thing that keeps many investors at bay is the low dividend yield. Based on a $0.19 quarterly dividend and a share price near $87, MasterCard has a ""current"" yield of about 0.9%; not exactly the sort of passive income stream that's easy to live off.In addressing this ""issue"" I like to underscore two points. First, if your goal is to generate an above average and ""hands off"" income stream, MasterCard may not be for you - despite how much admiration you might have for the business. That's a perfectly rational stance to take as there are tons of investment alternatives out there. Of course if you're not looking for a strong starting income component, the economics of the business and propensity for earnings and dividend growth may look more attractive.The second thing to note is that if you're willing to take a more ""hands on"" approach, there is a middle ground. You can both own shares of MasterCard and generate substantially more than 1% per year. Let's explore some possibilities by looking at a few available call options:The above table uses the September of 2017 call option bids as of the time of this writing. Note that I have no affinity for this expiration date (many prefer much shorter timeframes) but it does give you a longer-term sampling of what is out there. We think about dividends on an annual basis, so looking at cash flow in the same light is an easy comparison.The first column details the strike price, or the price that you would be willing to sell 100 shares of MasterCard. If you never want to sell, naturally none of these arrangements would be attractive to you. Alternatively, if you're thinking about selling or would like to own the company with a higher yield, these sorts of option possibilities could be interesting.The second column highlights the ""net"" premium, which uses the most recent bid less $0.20 for frictional expenses. The third column details the upfront cash flow yield that making this agreement would provide (which could be taxed differently than qualified dividends). Finally, the last column shows how the agreement potentially ""caps"" your upside.With option agreements it's all about being content with either side of the arrangement. I'll go through an example to demonstrate what I mean.Perhaps you are content to hold shares of MasterCard at today's valuation, but you'd be happier if you could collect a cash flow yield north of 2%. The dividend component might add $0.80 per share or so in the next year, leaving a little over $1 per share required to meet your target.In looking at the table above, you could think about owning shares of MasterCard and selling the $115 call option expiring in September of 2017. Immediately you would receive proceeds of ~$105, that could then be redeployed or spent as you see fit.With this agreement there are two basic outcomes: either the option is exercised or it is not. Let's explore both.You start with 100 shares that have a current liquidity bid (if you wanted to sell today) of about $8,700. If the option is not exercised, you have the $105 in beginning option premium to go along with dividend payments perhaps totaling $80 or so. Your income for MasterCard would be in the $180 to $200 range, resulting in a cash flow yield north of 2%.Some will point out that selling the option will not prevent against a loss, which is true. However, it should be evident that this scenario would be preferable to simply owning shares alone. If you're happy to hold for the long-term (regardless or a reasonably higher or lower price) the only difference if the option is not exercised is that you have an extra $100. You're always going to be ahead by the amount of the option premium in this scenario.A second possibility is that the option is exercised. In this case you would still receive the $105 in upfront option premium to go along with $11,500 (less frictional expenses) in sale proceeds. Whether or not you also collect dividends along the way depends on the timing of the option assignment.The risk here is that shares could go to $120 or $140 and you're stuck selling at $115. That's a real risk and something you need to be cognizant of. However, this agreement would also translate to a total gain of over 33% in just over 14 months' time. Give me that return consistently and I'll show you an exceptional place to grow wealth.Of course you're not limited to agreeing to sell at a single strike price or expiration (or at all). If you're looking for a higher cash flow component you could agree to sell your shares of MasterCard at say $95 or $100, generating a 4% to 6% ""bonus"" cash flow yield for the period. It's true that your upside is further ""capped"" but you'd still be looking at the prospect of generating significantly higher cash flow yields or else selling with 15% to 20% gains during the timeframe.In short, MasterCard has proven itself to be an exceptional business with strong growth prospects. It's hard for many to own because of the relative valuation and low dividend yield. In both aspects you need to be comfortable and understand the dynamics. However, depending on your appetite to potentially sell your stake along with your required returns, you can do something about the lower starting income stream. There are a plenty of agreements out there that offer both a reasonable ""maximum"" gain for the period to go along with a significantly higher cash flow component."

3961848,22148,2016-03-30T01:04:21-04:00,"MasterCard continues to face margin pressures and competitive threats.Earnings expectations continue to collapse though the market mostly ignores the facts based on misunderstood market growth.The stock likely heads higher, but the recommendation is for investors to hop off the stock at the previous highs.","After predicting last November that MasterCard (NYSE:MA) would struggle when the stock was around $100, the current price action suggests the market is now more bullish regarding the payments network. The question though is whether the negative earnings trend has improved enough to warrant a bullish view.At $92 and change, MasterCard trades near the levels of last year. If anything, the trends are even worse now. The market focuses on the shift towards digital payments, but some underlying pressures on the business model need more attention. The stock might go higher in the short term, but are the trends improving enough for a break above $100?Attracting Negative AttentionThe biggest problem with MasterCard long term that is generally ignored by the market is that the large margins of the industry are continuously attracting negative attention. If you are in retail, the financial sector, or in Silicon Valley, one of the biggest opportunities in the market is to capture a share of the expanding and profitable payments market.The CEO made the perfect statement regarding the issue at the recent Barclays Payments Forum Broker Conference:While the CEO is smart to realize the competitive landscape, MasterCard is still talking about 50% operating margins. The difference between capping them at this level or attempting to push them higher is probably marginal to the competitive landscape.The bigger issue is that digital currencies and alternative payment methods continue exploring ways to take away business from Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard, while merchants are continuously becoming payments network brand agnostic in a pursuit of the best deal.Negative Earnings TrendWhen a stock trades over $92 and only expects earnings to reach around $3.50 this year, one would expect an upward trend. In reality though, expectations for 2016 and 2017 continue to collapse.My previous article highlighted how EPS expectations for 2016 had already declined from around $4.15 to only $3.91 in early November. Now the EPS expectation for this year is already down to $3.53.Source: Yahoo FinanceThe amazing part is that the company actually expects strong EPS growth year from the pro forma EPS of $3.12 earned last year. When excluding the positive tax settlements from last year and other one-time charges, MasterCard only produced the much smaller number than the ones reported by the media.With higher rebates and incentives and a competitive environment for new co-brand deals, the targeted EPS growth of 13% seems awfully high. Even at that growth, the stock trades at 2x the growth rate.TakeawayThe global trend from cash to electronic payment methods is a powerful one. At this point and based on the margins and size of MasterCard, the better option is to find a company that is better positioned to benefit from the growth opportunity. The stock likely heads higher in the short term, but the numbers don't suggest the stock breaks out to new highs."
3848246,33291,2016-01-29T14:19:54-05:00,"I have been waiting for a pullback in MasterCard even from when I recommended it at $90.Thanks to a tough market the name has dropped 15 points in the last few weeks, but are there performance concerns?Q4 earnings are out this morning and I discuss the key metrics you need to be aware of.","MasterCard (NYSE:MA) is a company that everyone in America probably knows, and most people in developed nations are likely familiar with. It is a simply a global enterprise. I regularly use a MasterCard. The business model has been absolutely stellar and has only improved over the years as consumers have moved away from physical assets and cash for purchases, to more electronic means. It's a simple model really. Charge retailers a fee for every transaction, charge interest on purchases for the consumer. Offer rewards programs to lure in customers and keep them using the card. Of course on a larger scale the model is dependent on consumer activity. And one thing is certain; consumers continue to spend. I will also add that even if the economy is weak, families will continue to routinely pay bills electronically, shop for necessities, etc. Today MasterCard is trading at 25 times earnings is down 5 points from where I recommended it at $90 a share. Thus, I wanted to check in on the name to see if this is a rare buying opportunity, or if there are performance concerns.Source: Thinkstock.comThe best way to do this is to examine the key metrics of the company and just this morning the company announced its Q4 2015 results. Once again, I am impressed because the results indicate that the company will continue its slow but reliable growth. Net revenue for the quarter came in at $2.5 billion, a 4% increase over Q4 2014. However, due to currency changes, and a stronger dollar, it may not be directly comparable of course. Thus if we control for currency and look at things on a constant dollar basis, the company actually saw a 9% increase in revenues. This was primarily due to a 12% jump in gross dollar volume and a 12% increase in processed transactions to approximately 13.0 billion. Wow. Further, global purchasing volumes rose another 12% to over $880 billion year-over-year.While revenues were up they missed expectations very slightly by $90 million. That said, expenses were higher year-over-year versus last year. Total operating expenses as reported were actually up 1% year-over-year. However, as I did above for revenues, we really have to consider currency changes. When we adjust for changes in currency, we see operating expenses were up almost 4%. This rise led to total operating expenses that were $1.4 billion for several reasons. The increase was a result of the company making continued investments to support strategic initiatives, such as international expansion, as well as the impact of acquisitions, which contributed 4 percentage points of the constant currency growth. This was of course offset by ongoing cost management initiatives. All of this led to operating income increasing 9% as reported. However it was up a whopping 17% currency adjusted year-over-year. Operating margins however disappointed me. When I last covered the name they were around 60%. In this quarter, operating margin was only 44%. That is respectable, but disappointing to see it that much lower. For the whole year, it was 52.5%, which is lower than 2014's 54.1%.Factoring in revenues and expenses, the company reported net income of $890 million, an increase of 11% as reported. Once again, adjusting to a constant currency basis, net income actually jumped 18%. This translated to earnings per share of $0.79. These earnings were up 22% adjusted for currency compared to Q4 2014. That continues to be strong growth. I will point out that it would have been even higher except that the acquisitions made by the company led to a $0.03 dilutive impact on earnings.To be clear, these numbers are strong once again, even if some people were expecting better revenue growth. It was up 3.5% year-over-year, but missed estimates. On top of it all, the company continues to be shareholder friendly. During Q4 2015, MasterCard bought back 8 million shares for approximately $793 million. Here in Q1 2016, the company has bought back another 3.1 million shares at a cost of approximately $283 million (through 1/22/15). There is still another $4.2 billion remaining under the current repurchase program authorization. The company also recently raised its dividend. The company now pays a $0.76 annual dividend; $0.19 quarterly. This only translates to a 0.9% yield. While a dividend is shareholder friendly, I expect this dividend to grow in the coming years. With the earnings this company posts, shareholders deserve a higher payout, especially after it exhausts its buyback program. I have said it before and will reiterate. With fewer shares on the market, which should be the purpose of a buyback, fewer dividends would have to be paid. Thus, done effectively, there is room to create more shareholder value. All that said, even with the company trading at 25 times earnings, it commands a premium thanks to its stellar performance and history of strong earnings growth. I think this is a buying opportunity and provided the market doesn't shake again, this name will be back over $90 quite soon.Note from the author: Christopher F.

3961467,24491,2016-03-28T15:38:23-04:00,"Though uncertainty persists in the global economy in 2016, the fundamentals of MasterCard's business and its approach remain unchanged.Mastercard benefits from one of the strongest competitive advantages out there – the network effect. As more consumers use credit/debit cards, more merchants accept them, thereby creating a virtuous cycle.When it comes to the credit-card processing space, we generally prefer Visa and MasterCard, which do not take on credit risk like Discover or American Express.Let's take a look at the firm's investment considerations as we walk through the valuation process and derive a fair value estimate for shares.","By The Valuentum TeamMastercard's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsBusiness QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisIn our view, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital.The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Mastercard's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 129.8%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.7%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT.In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Companies that have strong economic profit spreads are often also solid free cash flow generators, which also lends itself to dividend strength. Mastercard's Dividend Cushion ratio, a forward-looking measure that takes into account our projections for future free cash flows along with net cash on the balance sheet and dividends expected to be paid, is an impressive 4 (anything above 1 is considered strong).Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Mastercard's free cash flow margin has averaged about 40.1% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG.The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Mastercard, cash flow from operations increased about 16% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 82% over the same time period.In 2015, Mastercard reported cash from operations of just over $4 billion and capital expenditures of ~$175 million, resulting in free cash flow of ~$3.9 billion. This represents a nearly 20% increase from 2014.Valuation AnalysisThis is the most important portion of our analysis. Below we outline our valuation assumptions and derive a fair value estimate for shares.We think Mastercard is worth $91 per share with a fair value range of $73-$109. Shares are currently trading at ~$92, just above our fair value estimate. This indicate that we feel there is a similar amount of downside risk and upside potential associated with shares at this time.The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is derived from an evaluation of the historical volatility of key valuation drivers and a future assessment of them. Our near-term operating forecasts, including revenue and earnings, do not differ much from consensus estimates or management guidance.Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 8.9% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 12.2%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 58.7%, which is above Mastercard's trailing 3-year average.Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 6.2% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Mastercard, we use a 10.7% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $91 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future were known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for Mastercard. We think the firm is attractive below $73 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $109 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Mastercard's fair value at this point in time to be about $91 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the firm's current share price with the path of Mastercard's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate.The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change.The expected fair value of $121 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $91 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Wrapping Things UpPerhaps the most compelling aspect of Mastercard's business is the network effect from which it benefits. As more customers continue to use credit and debit cards, more merchants accept them, and a virtuous cycle is created. Despite the level of uncertainty surrounding the global economy, the fundamentals of Mastercard's business and its approach remain unchanged. It will continue to innovate as the world becomes increasingly more digital, a recent example being its digital wallet MasterPass.Mastercard's cash-rich business model drives its outstanding Dividend Cushion ratio, which is one of the best in our coverage universe. The fact that it does not take on credit risk like Discover or American Express shields it from credit quality concerns. We like Mastercard's solid capital planning priorities of maintaining a strong balance sheet, liquidity, and credit ratings as these lead to stronger dividend potential. Its current payout has an extremely long runway of strong growth potential ahead of it, should management choose to ramp up its dividend policy.All things considered, however, we're waiting patiently for a better entry point in Mastercard. We would like to see improvements in its technical indicators and relative valuation, as well as see shares trading at a discount to our fair value estimate before considering a position in the company.

3860446,65113,2016-02-03T10:56:36-05:00,MasterCard Incorporated has continued to perform strongly in light of my previous analysis.I forecast a price target of $109 for the company.I expect that growth in the Chinese market and Masterpass technology will continue to increase transaction volumes.,"With earnings data just having been released for MasterCard (NYSE:MA), the company's Q4 earnings of $0.79 beat the consensus analyst estimate of $0.69, representing a 14 percent surprise to the upside.Towards the end of 2014, I had written an article on MasterCard forecasting price targets using the Dividend Discount Model, forecasting 10%, 15% and 20% growth in dividends and earnings in per share terms.Given the latest earnings release, this article focuses on MasterCard's performance on the above metrics in light of the latest data, and I also wish to detail why I continue to be optimistic about this company.On the basis of my predictions for 2015, I forecasted that given a 10%, 15% and 20% earnings growth for MasterCard, the company should yield an earnings figure of $3.16, $3.45, and $3.76 respectively. With earnings coming in at $3.43 in 2015, the company appears to be growing earnings at an average of 15% on this basis. Moreover, with DPS having grown by 45% through to 2015, the company is well on track to meet DPS estimates.All in all, should the current rate of growth continue over a three-year period, I forecast that MasterCard, given a P/E ratio of 25.56 at the time of writing, should yield a terminal value of $95 in two years time (P/E ratio*estimated 2018 EPS of 3.74), plus dividends of $13.10 (assuming held by investor before the 10-1 stock split) which would yield a target price of $109, a 27% upside from the current price of $85.52.My prior forecast for the company had been in a range of $124-144; this is primarily due to the fact that given a relatively higher P/E ratio of 32.44 at the end of 2013, investor sentiment would have bid prices higher.However, on the basis of past trends I do not see MasterCard's P/E ratio falling below 25 and see a price target ranging from $109-120 as being quite reasonable; we have already seen that MasterCard has grown dividends at a higher rate than expected and this would push the price target up further.I continue to be optimistic on MasterCard in light of the company's performance over the past year. In my previous article, I had pointed out that MasterCard had two major factors going for it; 1) its growth in the China region, and 2) its rollout of electronic payment mechanisms under the ""A World Beyond Cash"" initiative.In both regards, the company has continued to perform impressively. For instance, MasterCard is expected to see double-digit annual growth in credit card transaction volumes in China after the government had opened up its $7 trillion bank card market to foreign entities. Moreover, the company's MasterPass (which facilitates payments via mobile) is increasingly being adopted by major companies such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU). This technology is likely to facilitate a significant increase in transaction volumes due to ease of payment, and I anticipate that revenue growth could increase significantly as a result.To conclude, I see significant growth ahead for MasterCard and see the company continuing to grow dividends and earnings at a rate of 15% or greater over the next two to three years."
3966483,98056,2016-04-20T05:02:52-04:00,"Visa and MasterCard operate in an intensely competitive industry.Yet, both companies have managed to stay on top of the payment card business and gain a combined market share of nearly 85%.What are the factors that make this an ideal long-term investment, and why should you DRIP/DCA your investments and then forget about them for the next five to ten years?","Source: NielsenVisa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) sit at the top of the payment card industry. Both have global reach and, together, have become the dominant duopoly in this space with nearly 85% market share.The CompetitionThis is not to say the competition is sparse. There are several other companies vying for attention in the space, with American Express (NYSE:AXP), Diners/Discover (NYSE:DFS) and JCB leading the field of competition. However, none of them have come even close to being able to compete on the scale of Visa or even MasterCard.Online transactions are on the rise and could pose a threat to the dominance that these two companies hold, but for now, these payment portals still pretty much depend on credit card companies to get the job done.Other threats come in the form of alternate payment options, such as the Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX), which is a mobile payment system created jointly by Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Target (NYSE:TGT), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Best Buy (NYSE:BBY). However, Visa and MasterCard jointly have a huge merchant moat in that only certain locations accept payments through MCX. For such an exchange to grow and compete with the world's largest credit card companies will take a very long time, if at all it happens.As of now, there is no technology disruptive enough to oust the use of plastic as a form of payment. Consider biometric payments, for example, which use your fingerprint or a retina scan to confirm your identity and process a financial transaction from your bank account. These technologies exist in the form of Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Venmo, but are they any more secure than a card with a CVV number or a PIN? More to the point, are they viable competitors to Visa, MasterCard and even the relatively smaller card payment system companies?That's highly debatable to begin with, but the sheer investment in rolling out the hardware and supporting software to millions of merchants around the globe is going to ensure that the credit card moat is maintained for some time. And as for emerging technologies around this, I'm fairly sure both V and MA are going to swoop down like hawks on a rabbit if they sense that a technology could potentially eat their market share.And that's what makes Visa and MasterCard such great investment opportunities. It's not the dividends or even eventual capital gains that makes these stocks attractive - it is the solid moat of omnipresence that will keep them going for years.Of course, you also have to consider their financial strength and other factors, and this is what I'm going to analyze for both companies. Once you see where they stand on those, you can make a more educated decision on whether to invest or not.First, let's look at the least attractive part of their businesses.Current Dividend YieldsSource: Dividend.comSource: Dividend.comFrom a dividend yield perspective, neither company looks attractive at the moment. But that's a matter of interpretation, I think. If you select companies with high ""stayability"" for your dividend portfolio, then it allows you to sit on your investment for a much longer period than if you invested in businesses with not-as-strong moats.And in the case of V and MA, their stayability gives you the benefit of seeing your unrealized gains grow fatter and fatter each year. Additionally, the 20% level of payout ratios means the dividends can only go up from here - slow and steady - while the stock keeps climbing higher and higher.The Business ModelThe beauty of the companies' businesses is that they are high-margin, with low capital requirements - no wonder they both found space in Warren Buffett's bag.Both these companies have an operating margin in excess of 50%, and it has been growing as they have gotten bigger, suggesting that scale has started to help their bottom lines. That widens the moat even further for the competition.V Operating Margin (TTM) data by YChartsVisa's free cash flow has grown from $435 million in 2006 to $6.3 billion in 2015, while MasterCard moved from $556 million to $3.7 billion.They are among only a handful of companies that showed revenue increase during the Great Recession of our times, showing the resilience of their business because of our dependence on credit.The other important factor that we need to notice is the capital a company needs to re-invest to stay in the business. On this front, both these companies win hands down - their total Capex requirement has been less than $600 million per year. Not very often will you find companies that are spending less than 3.5% of revenues on capital expenses. And this puts Visa and MasterCard's respective free cash flows at healthy levels as well.V Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YChartsFrom a viewpoint of dividend stock selection, the state of the balance sheet is another key factor I would look into.Balance SheetThe companies' financial strength is the icing on the cake. Visa has total liabilities of $10.3 billion with $3.5 billion in cash, while MasterCard has $5.7 billion cash and total liabilities of $10.2 billion - and neither has found use for long-term debt.From a forward-looking perspective, I don't see the need for them to dip into debt to keep the engines running and revving. They're going to try and keep it the way it is - unless, for instance, they need to spend on a major acquisition to protect their collective moat.Investor-speak: DRIP/DCA It And Forget ItAny investment in this duopoly should be the last to be liquidated, if it ever comes to that. Under the Dividend Re-Investment Plan or a dollar-cost averaging approach, it should ideally run on autopilot, with you checking in every once in a while to see if the key metrics I covered are still on course.I believe the stayability of these two companies should offset any concerns you may have about low dividend yields. Steady Capex, increasing free cash flow, market leadership positions, low payout ratios and strong balance sheets should be enough to tempt even the most skeptic dividend investor.But it depends on the timeline within which you operate. Don't expect dividends to make you money in a few years' time frame. V and MA investments should be reckoned in half-decade increments at least, if not greater.Thank you for reading.

3725776,87586,2015-12-01T20:22:41-05:00,"A senior executive from MasterCard revealed flattish sales over the U.S. Black Friday weekend, but online sales beat expectations.Overall revenue growth for the full year is expected to grow by about 2.5%; free cash flow, however, is a more accurate indicator.Underpenetration of bank cards in emerging countries in Asia and Latin America will continue to lead growth for MasterCard internationally.The company will benefit from the continued tide towards cashless payments - the question is whether management can continue to deliver post its partner USAA's switchover.","IntroductionAccording to Sarah Quinlah, senior vice president at MasterCard (NYSE:MA), department stores and electronics came in flat over the U.S. Black Friday weekend, even though online sales growth in the double digits surpassed the company's own expectations. The announcement caps off a challenging 2015 for the company, which most recently saw its long-time partner, USAA, switch over to Visa (NYSE:V). For the full year, MA is also expected to report its slowest growth in five years. The result is that MA is now down about 2% since its latest results announcement. I think for the most part, the effects of some of these challenges were exaggerated. I maintain my Buy rating.Flattish sales on U.S. Black Friday, but online sales a bright spotAhead of the upcoming spending report by the company, Sarah Quinlah provided a sneak preview of sales over the U.S. Black Friday weekend. There was little to cheer about, as spending remained sluggish.The only bright spot, however, came from the online segment, which came in at double digits, beating the company's own expectations of an 8% expansion.Full-year 2015MA now expects December spending to be relatively flat. For the full year 2015, it is also expected to report top line expansion by 6.3%, which translates into 2.5% year-on-year (yoy) growth. This will mark the slowest growth in five years for the company. A commenter on Seeking Alpha recently noted the slower growth the company is seeing, arguing that the trend is going against MA. With all due respect, I disagree.Source: Bloomberg and Enceladus ResearchThe slower growth is more the result of an accounting adjustment than a challenging outlook. For the full-year 2014, Europe, which is its largest revenue contributor, accounted for 30.1% of MA's total sales. The U.S. and Asia Pacific accounted for about 29% each, with Latin America and Canada making for about 11% of revenue.When MA guided for 2015's revenue, the company applied an exchange rate of 1.13 EUR to $1 during its initial forecast in January this year. According to management, at this rate, the top line would reduce by 4-6 percentage points. The euro is now trading at around 1.06, which is more than six percentage points lower than management's forecast. Most of the foreign currencies, however, are hedged by MA, which means the lower reported figures are really an accounting adjustment. Consider the company's third-quarter results, for instance, where revenue expanded by 1.6% on a yoy basis, or 8% excluding currency impacts.Free Cash Flow a more accurate indicatorBecause of the accounting adjustment above, I prefer to look at the free cash flow of MA, which is a more accurate indicator, in my view.Source: Company data and Enceladus Research (Chart in millions)Referring to the chart above, MA has been able to grow FCF by more than 18% CAGR from 2010 to 2014. For full-year 2015, the company is expected to grow FCF by a staggering 20.4% from 2014, which is a positive for MA holders as the company undertakes shareholder-friendly actions like increasing its dividend payout, which was only 20% of earnings in 2014.Outlook for 2016 and beyondAccording to a study by McKinsey, the electronic payments volume is expected to grow at a 7% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2014 to 2018. They also estimate the payment processing services ecosystem to be at $900 billion. MasterCard has a market capitalization of about $110 billion.Source: McKinseyMoving forward, continued growth will be driven by international expansion coming from Asia Pacific, Latin America and Europe. Referring to the chart below, the purchase volume growth for Latin America and Asia Pacific will continue to drive spending as bank card penetration increases in countries in these regions.Source: Company reports, Euromonitor; Chart by Enceladus ResearchThe chart above show the purchase volume growth for MasterCard in 2014, with Latin America showing the fastest growth at 18.7% and Asia Pacific close behind at 16.7%. According to estimates by Euromonitor, the penetration of bankcard purchase volume growth in Asia Pacific is less than 15%, versus developed nations' 45-50%. In my view, this represents an underdeveloped market where cash transactions still make up the bulk (about 85%) of overall spending purchases.ValuationsBased on MA's last closing price on the 1st of December, the company is trading at 28.3x earnings, or 31.7x free cash flow. I think the question to ask is: Can management continue to deliver after losing the long-term partnership with USAA?Source: BloombergAt this point, I prefer to put my faith in the long-term track record of management and their execution to put things right again. But they will have to act quickly now in order to restore the confidence of investors. I maintain my Buy rating on MA.ConclusionI think the recent setbacks should jolt company management to action and to seize the largely underpenetrated opportunities internationally. A potential catalyst from the full access to China's domestic transactions will be a huge boost for the company. It remains to be seen whether MA can seize these opportunities. Only time will tell."
3717616,97426,2015-11-28T11:27:31-05:00,"Advancements in non-cash payment technologies allow consumers to use payment cards more easily.MasterCard's presence abroad is increasing, with Europe and China serving as high growth areas.Transaction volume continues to see double-digit growth worldwide.","MasterCard (NYSE: MA) operates the second largest payment processing network in the world, serving consumers and businesses in 210 countries.Catalyst: Foreign GrowthThe catalyst that will drive MasterCard is growth abroad with a large portion coming from China. As of right now, MasterCard accounts for 48% of card circulation outside of the United States. 31% of MasterCard's revenue comes from transaction processing fees, which is a fee charged every time a card is used. The company continues to expand their presence by actively engaging in deals with domestic and foreign banks and other customers, which allows them to issue MasterCard's to their account holders. By banks making these deals, MasterCard is increasing the number of cards that are in the market place. More activity with MasterCard's ultimately means more fees being processed and revenue for MasterCard. MasterCard currently has about 40% market share in Europe, which we believe will continue to grow by pushing their rewards and incentive programs that are included when an account holder receives a card. Growth in Europe for FQ2 2015 was 16%, and forward growth is projected to stay on this track. The company will see more revenue in the coming years out of Europe. (Source: MasterCard Investor Relations)With regards to China, there is currently a $6 trillion untapped market. Before this year, China did not allow foreign transaction companies to process payments domestically. All transactions were processed through the monopoly, UnionPay, which is run by the government. Earlier this year, however, the government announced the opening of this market which will allow foreign companies, like MasterCard and Visa, to process payments in China.(Source: The Nilson Report)We believe that MasterCard has the capability to capture 10% of this untapped market, which could potentially add $1B annually to their revenues. The purchase volume for UnionPay transactions in the Asian-Pacific region grew 25% Y-Y, and UnionPay currently accounts for 73% of the market share. Now that MasterCard is able to access this market, they should be able to make deals with banks for distribution to their clients. As of Q1 2015, The United States accounted for 32% of MA revenue, 31% from Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and Africa, and 27% from Europe. We believe that the number of people utilizing non-cash payment options in China will continue to increase as the country continues to move towards more modern technologies.Financial OutlookThe most recent quarter, Q2 2015, showed strong growth in the foreign markets, specifically Europe. The volume of transactions worldwide grew 13.6% Y<Y between 2014 and 13, and the total number of MasterCard branded cards being used is up 8% year over year. For comparison, Visa grew 10.1% Y<Y and American Express just 7.7%. Most of this can be attributed to a new deal in the United Kingdom with Virgin Money, as well as TD Bank. A few retailers such as Barnes and Noble, and Brooks Brothers also resigned deals to keep their cards MasterCard.  After adjusting for currency fluctuations, EPS grew 15% year over year, and net income grew 12%. Visa on the other hand had EPS growth of 8% and net income growth of 8%. This again shows that transaction volume is increasing, as well as the number of cards being issued.Competitive AdvantageMasterCard, Visa, and American Express are all very similar to each other when comparing credit card companies. Each of them offers different benefits, such as fraud protection, rental car insurance, and other perks. Essentially, it comes down to personal preference as they all offer very similar perks. Visa also offers a digital wallet called Visa Checkout, which is similar to MasterPass. American Express is the only one of the three to not offer a digital wallet program. MasterCard continues to increase its presence abroad, with China and Europe as potential large revenue veins.ValuationWhen valuing MasterCard, the following assumptions were made in our DCF model:• Revenue growing at 15%  • Terminal Growth Rate: 3%  • Risk Free Rate: 3%  • Revenue Growth: 15% per annum• Market Return: 10.5%• WACC: 8.9%• CAPM: 9%With revenue growing at 15% per year, and the above assumptions, a target price of $128 was reached, which yields a 22% discount from intrinsic value. The company operates with just 1.4% debt, funding all of its activities from cash. Depreciation and capital expenditures going forward were calculated as a margin of the previous year's revenue figure. As of December 2014, the company initiated a $3.75B share buyback program, which is near completion.Porters Five ForcesSupplier Power:Due to the nature of MasterCard's business, they do not rely on any suppliers for their product. The company sells rights to use their card, which does not involve a physical product.Buyer Power:In this market, the buyers hold all of the power when it comes to product demand. Banks and other credit card issuers can choose different card companies, like Visa or American Express. MasterCard must remain competitive with these companies by offering incentives and cheaper rate to their customers in order to retain business.Competitive Rivalry:Within the non-cash payment industry, there are three other key players. Visa, American Express, and Discover. MasterCard's main competitor is Visa, holds 48.9% market share for cards in circulation, compared to 30.7% for MasterCard. This is a very competitive industry, where the different players all try to win new business as it presents itself.Threat of Substitution:MasterCard's direct customers, banks and other financial institutions which offer cards to their customers, control which issuer they choose. Whether it be MasterCard, Visa, or similar companies, they are all offering relatively the same product.Another potential substitution is PayPal. This allows consumers to pay directly through their bank account safely and efficiently online. Although they are limited to online only, they are still a viable threat to the growing space of online payment transactions.Threat of New Entry:With regards to just credit cards, the barriers to new entry are relatively high. Vast amounts of capital are required to front the initial transaction costs processed through cards, as well as gaining market presence. One notable which broke into this market more recently is Synchrony financial, a subsidiary of GE Capital. This credit card company is gaining market share by providing private label credit cards for companies such as Amazon, Lowes, and Walmart to name a few.Risk• Any deals made by Visa or American Express abroad will take away a large amount of the potential market share available.• Existing deals that are set to expire could be taken by competition with the attractiveness of lower rates, and or more incentives for the customers and account holders.• A decline in the economy could potentially lower the number of posted transactions, or the value of each transaction. This decline in numbers will decrease the amount of revenue generated for the company, since all of their revenue is sourced from fees associated with card activity."

As more consumers use credit/debit cards, more merchants accept them, thereby creating a virtuous cycle.Mastercard's cash-rich business model drives its outstanding Dividend Cushion ratio, which is one of the best in our coverage universe.Mastercard's capital planning priorities give it outstanding dividend potential, but its management has not made increasing its dividend payout a major priority.Let's walk through some of Mastercard's investment considerations and uncover the drivers behind its strong Dividend Cushion ratio.","Mastercard (NYSE:MA) has a cash-rich business model and benefits from a powerful network effect.Key Investment ConsiderationsNote: Mastercard's dividend yield is below average, offering a 0.6% annual yield at recent price levels. We prefer yields above 3%, and generally don't include firm's with yields below 2% in our dividend growth portfolio.Dividend StrengthsMastercard's cash-rich business model drives its outstanding Dividend Cushion ratio, which is one of the best in our coverage universe. The fact that it does not take on credit risk like Discover or American Express shields it from credit quality concerns. We like Mastercard's solid capital planning priorities of maintaining a strong balance sheet, liquidity, and credit ratings as these lead to stronger dividend potential. The company will continue returning excess cash to shareholders, though existing plans are considerably biased toward share repurchases. Its current payout has an extremely long runway of safe growth potential ahead of it, should management choose to ramp up its dividend policy.Dividend WeaknessesMastercard's capital planning priorities give it outstanding dividend potential, but its management has not made increasing its dividend payout a major priority. The company's capital allocation has been geared toward investing for growth via organic investments, capital expenditures, and mergers and acquisitions, as well as share repurchases. Though it does mention returning excess cash to shareholders, management states its bias is toward share repurchases. The only real weakness we can see in Mastercard's dividend at this point is the lack of willingness of management to significantly increase the payout.From the Comments Section: How to Interpret the Dividend Cushion Ratio? -- A Ranking of RiskAs for how to interpret the Dividend Cushion ratio, itself, it is a measure of financial risk to the dividend, much like a credit rating is a measure of the default risk of the entity. Said differently, a poor Dividend Cushion ratio of below 1 or negative doesn't imply the company will cut the dividend tomorrow, no more than a junk credit rating implies a company will default tomorrow. That said, the Dividend Cushion ratio does punish companies for outsize debt loads because in times of adverse conditions, entities often need to shore up cash, and that means the dividend becomes increasingly more risky.We think investors should look at a variety of different metrics in assessing the sustainability of the dividend. Because the Dividend Cushion ratio is systematically applied across our coverage, it can be used to compare entities on an apples-to-apples basis. Dividend payers with significant free cash flow generation and substantial net cash on the balance sheet often register the highest Dividend Cushion ratios, as they should. These companies have substantial financial flexibility to keep raising the dividend.Dividend SafetyWe think the safety of Mastercard's dividend is excellent. Please let us explain.First, we measure the safety of the dividend in a unique but very straightforward fashion. As many know, earnings can fluctuate, so using the payout ratio in any given year has some limitations. Plus, companies can often encounter unforeseen charges, which makes earnings an even less-than-predictable measure of the safety of the dividend. We know that companies won't cut the dividend just because earnings have declined or they had a restructuring charge that put them in the red for the quarter (year). As such, we think that assessing the cash flows of a business allows us to determine whether it has the capacity to continue paying dividends well into the future.That has led us to develop the forward-looking Dividend Cushion™ ratio, which we make available on our website. The measure is a ratio that sums the existing net cash a company has on hand (on its balance sheet) plus its expected future free cash flows (cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) over the next five years and divides that sum by future expected cash dividends over the same time period. Basically, if the score is above 1, the company has the capacity to pay out its expected future dividends and the expected growth in them.As income investors, however, we'd like to see a ratio much larger than 1 for a couple of reasons: 1) the higher the ratio, the more ""cushion"" the company has against unexpected earnings shortfalls, and 2) the higher the ratio, the greater capacity a dividend-payer has in boosting the dividend in the future. For Mastercard, this ratio is 5, revealing that on its current path the firm should be able to cover its future dividends and growth in them with net cash on hand and future free cash flow.Dividend Cushion Ratio Cash Flow BridgeThe Dividend Cushion Cash Flow Bridge, shown in the graph below, illustrates the components of the Dividend Cushion ratio and highlights in detail the many drivers behind it. Mastercard's Dividend Cushion Cash Flow Bridge reveals that the sum of the company's 5-year cumulative free cash flow generation, as measured by cash flow from operations less all capital spending, plus its net cash/debt position on the balance sheet, as of the last fiscal year, is greater than the sum of the next 5 years of expected cash dividends paid.Because the Dividend Cushion ratio is forward-looking and captures the trajectory of the company's free cash flow generation and dividend growth, it reveals whether there will be a cash surplus or a cash shortfall at the end of the 5-year period, taking into consideration the leverage on the balance sheet, a key source of risk. On a fundamental basis, we believe companies that have a strong net cash position on the balance sheet and are generating a significant amount of free cash flow are better able to pay and grow their dividend over time.Firms that are buried under a mountain of debt and do not sufficiently cover their dividend with free cash flow are more at risk of a dividend cut or a suspension of growth, all else equal, in our opinion. Generally speaking, the greater the 'blue bar' to the right is in the positive, the more durable a company's dividend, and the greater the 'blue bar' to the right is in the negative, the less durable a company's dividend.Dividend Cushion Ratio DeconstructionThe Dividend Cushion Ratio Deconstruction, shown in the graph below, reveals the numerator and denominator of the Dividend Cushion ratio. At the core, the larger the numerator, or the healthier a company's balance sheet and future free cash flow generation, relative to the denominator, or a company's cash dividend obligations, the more durable the dividend. In the context of the Dividend Cushion ratio, Mastercard's numerator is larger than its denominator suggesting strong dividend coverage in the future. The Dividend Cushion Ratio Deconstruction image puts sources of free cash in the context of financial obligations next to expected cash dividend payments over the next 5 years on a side-by-side comparison. Because the Dividend Cushion ratio and many of its components are forward-looking, our dividend evaluation may change upon subsequent updates as future forecasts are altered to reflect new information.Please note that to arrive at the Dividend Cushion ratio, divide the numerator by the denominator in the graph below. The difference between the numerator and denominator is the firm's ""total cumulative 5-year forecasted distributable excess cash after dividends paid, ex buybacks.""Dividend GrowthNow on to the potential growth of Mastercard's dividend. As we mentioned above, we think the larger the ""cushion"" the larger capacity the company has to raise the dividend. However, such dividend growth analysis is not complete until after considering management's willingness to increase the dividend. To do so, we evaluate the company's historical dividend track record. If there have been no dividend cuts in the past 10 years, the company has a nice dividend growth rate, and a solid Dividend Cushion ratio, we characterize its future potential dividend growth as excellent, which is the case for Mastercard.Because capital preservation is also an important consideration to any income strategy, we use our estimate of the company's fair value range to assess the risk associated with the potential for capital loss. In Mastercard's case, we currently think shares are fairly valued, meaning the share price falls within our estimate of the fair value range, so the risk of capital loss is medium (our valuation analysis can be found by downloading the 16-page report on our website). If we thought the shares were undervalued, the risk of capital loss would be low. Please view our website for information regarding our valuation assumptions of Mastercard.Wrapping Things UpAll in, Mastercard has a fantastic business model and strong dividend growth potential. We love its cash-rich business model and the fact that the company benefits from a powerful network effect; there is a long runway of growth available for Mastercard's operations. Its dividend prospects benefit from reduced credit risk relative to other peers. We see no reason why Mastercard can't double or triple its dividend from current levels. Management's lack of willingness seems to be the only weakness in the company's dividend growth potential, but that could change. When it does, MasterCard's dividend payout could surge.Breakpoints: Dividend Safety. We measure the safety of a firm's dividend by adding its net cash to our forecast of its future cash flows and divide that sum by our forecast of its future dividend payments. This process results in a ratio called the Dividend Cushion. Scale: Above 2.75 = EXCELLENT; Between 1.25 and 2.75 = GOOD; Between 0.5 and 1.25 = POOR; Below 0.5 = VERY POOR.This article or report and any links within are for information purposes only and should not be considered a solicitation to buy or sell any security.

3840046,72475,2016-01-27T16:45:39-05:00,"Mastercard will be releasing earnings this Friday.The stock is as cheap as it has been in quite some time.If the report contains no red flags, particularly as far as the level of rebates to customers is concerned, ease yourself into the stock.","Mastercard (NYSE: MA) will be releasing earnings this Friday before the market opens and the average analyst estimate is that the company will record earnings of 68 cents per share for the quarter.The stock has been dragged down with the market lately and is off circa 15% from its all time highs. I am not a fan of taking positions in high growth stocks just ahead of earnings, but unless the company severely disappoints this is the best moment to buy the stock in quite some time. The stock is trading at just under 20x forward earnings which is pretty cheap for a stock with a rock solid competitive position and expected to grow earnings around 18% per annum over the next five years.When scrutinizing the earnings release, investors should pay particular attention to the issue of rebates to customers which have been marching higher in recent quarters. If the tendency accelerates, it could be a sign of a weakening competitive position which may limit the stock's potential long term. Other than that, there are plenty of reasons to love this stock.The move to a cashless society is still in its infancy, particularly in the developing world. The growth potential is huge and, in this regard, Mastercard is more favorably positioned than Visa (NYSE:V) because of its greater exposure to emerging markets.Second, the payment processing networks business is an oligopolistic market with limited competition, which is exactly where you want to be as an investor. There is no use in being in a high growth market if the benefits of such growth accrue to others. The network effects in this business are very strong which means that, failing dramatic business disruption, the company's competitive position tends to grow stronger over time as it adds more and more users.On the issue of business disruption, some investors have been worrying about the impact of online and mobile payments on Mastercard's business. Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has entered this segment in a big way and neither Mastercard nor Visa have thus far managed to stem the former's advances. These concerns are, however, probably misguided and, if anything, the development of mobile payments will only increase the transaction volume processed by Mastercard and Visa. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), for example, has opted to co-operate with networks and others will likely follow suit considering the difficulty for a newcomer to navigate the highly regulated market for payments.Finally, investors are currently concerned about the slowdown in China and its repercussions on any business which has exposure to the country. In this regard, it should be noted that not only Mastercard's current presence in China is incipient, but also that that is not about to significantly change anytime soon in spite of the progressive opening of the market. Thus, even if the worst fears regarding China materialize - and there is no undisputed evidence of that so far - that would not make a material dent in the enormous growth prospects for the company globally. Significant spill-over effects from China's condition to neighboring countries in Asia would be a different story, but at this point such possibility is no more than mere speculation.The market has lately been the rockiest in the last few years. The Fed has probably been too late in raising rates and has finally done so precisely at a time when global growth may be slowing. I am in the camp of those who think that QE4 is more likely than having four rate rises in 2016, but that question will not be settled shortly. On the other hand, the situation in the oil market will likely get worse before it gets better and we may have to test $20 before going up to a more sustainable $50-60 level. Thus, 2016 has every chance of being the most volatile year in the stock market since 2011 when the debt ceiling debate and the unfolding of the Euro crisis led to a bear market on the S&P.But as Warren Buffett famously said, there is always something to worry about in the market. Times are dangerous and you may not want to go all in. Wait for the earnings release on Friday and if you see no red flags in the report, particularly as far as rebates are concerned, ease your way into this wonderful stock over the next few weeks and months. Mastercard is one of those stocks that could appreciate tenfold or more over the next twenty years and you will want to be one of those happy holders.Supporting Documents"
3636616,39011,2015-11-03T07:17:03-05:00,MA posted terrific earnings again last week as the company's long term story remains intact.The strong dollar is the only real headwind for MA as the business is impeccable.And the Visa Europe purchase may drive some rotation out of V and into MA.,"Back in May I posted a favorable article on payments giant MasterCard (NYSE:MA) when the stock was trading for about $93. At the time I called out MA's stellar growth and consistent results as catalysts for continued moves higher despite the fact that it trades for a premium valuation. Since that time we've seen MA break down and move higher in a big way as it is now flirting with all-time highs once more. The company's Q3 earnings were sort of a non-event as investors took the report in stride but I think an important catalyst has emerged that could drive some outperformance for MA going forward.To begin, MA continues to absolutely crush it in terms of growth. Total revenue was up only 1.2% during the quarter but all other metrics impressed. Gross dollar volume was up 13%, processed transactions were up 12% and worldwide purchase volume was up 12%. In other words, regardless of which metric you choose, MA continues to post tremendous growth considering the sheer size and scale of its operations. This story isn't new, of course, but it is worth pointing out that the story continues. And with the continued migration of payments away from physical mediums like cash to digital methods MA is certainly poised to continue to take advantage and see tremendous growth. The other thing about MA is that it is infinitely scalable. This is something I've called out before on MA and it is worth repeating; there is no ceiling on MA's growth the way a retailer or restaurant chain can hit a footprint cap. MA can continue to grow forever as long as payment volumes keep rising.One problem MA has, like many other multinationals, is that it is subject to the whims of the forex markets. I mentioned MA's reported revenue was only up 1.2% but if we remove the impact of currency swings, revenue was up 8%. That's an enormous penalty and it crimped EPS by 6% to 8% depending on whether you remove special items from the calculation or not. Regardless, the point is that the strong dollar is a problem for MA and given that we know the Fed is anxious to begin removing its accommodative policies into next year, this problem is likely to get worse before it gets better. This is the only real headwind for MA's growth going forward as its fundamentals are impeccable. The problem is that the currency issue is a huge one and will likely keep a lid on top line growth at least into 2016.MA continues to buy back stock at an annual run rate of about 4% of the float, although that number fluctuates based upon the current price of the stock and management's willingness to pull the trigger. Still, with MA remaining flush with cash and the business as strong as ever, I expect we'll see another 3% to 5% repurchased annually until further notice. That will help mitigate some of the impact of the strong dollar on EPS (it won't help revenue) so hopefully into next year the buyback can remove up to half of the negative currency fluctuation impact.If we look at the chart, MA is just beautiful. The stock is making new all-time highs and has cleared the resistance of its old all-time high from back in August. We see that MA fell off a cliff in late August along with virtually every other stock in the universe but it has rebounded in a big way and, like many other tech names, has soared in the time since the bottom was made. I do see the momentum indicators slowing down at these levels which would indicate that a short term top is probably in but a consolidation or small pullback would be healthy here. No stock can go up in a straight line forever and we want to see some kind of pullback here to consolidate gains. That would provide a base for a new rally higher so I'm actually hoping for it. Even if MA falls through the support at its old all-time high from August it still has both the 50DMA and 200DMA below - both of which are rising - so MA has lots of support below. This thing is still in a very well defined uptrend and the chart says being long is certainly the right move.I mentioned a catalyst in the open and I think it is an interesting one that may give MA some additional buying interest when the dust settles from the recent rally. Visa (NYSE:V) announced before the market opened this week that it was buying Visa Europe. Nobody is surprised V bought the Europe business because it has been telegraphed for a long time but it seems the price caught investors off guard. V shares traded down 3% on very heavy volume yesterday after the news came out so investors were not particularly amused with the deal.I believe this will serve as an important catalyst for MA over the short term because investors that like V ostensibly like MA as the businesses are very similar. That means that if some marginal investors in V don't like the Europe purchase, they very well may rotate into MA to remain exposed to the sector without the undue risk of the gigantic acquisition. This incremental buying pressure should help MA continue to outperform over the short term at least until the Europe deal is digested for V shareholders.Last time I wrote about MA it was trading at a discount to rival V in terms of forward PE but with Visa languishing due to the Europe deal and MA making new all-time highs, we have seen role reversal. MA now trades at a sizable premium to Visa and that will likely be the case until the Europe acquisition closes for V and we get a clear picture of what the long term outlook for the consolidated company is. That sets up well for MA going forward despite the fact that it is now trading in excess of 25 times forward earnings. The only real negative right now for MA is the strong dollar; otherwise, the company's fundamentals are a screaming buy. The buyback should help mitigate the impact of the dollar but if we were to get the Fed to back off of its hawkish stance from the most recent meeting and the dollar moves down, multinationals like MA would benefit greatly. Either way, I still love MA and the dollar headwind is just a part of the deal; MA is going higher."

The company's revenue increased only 2% versus the same period last year (net revenue increased 8% adjusted for currency). The top-line gain was a result of an increase in cross-border volumes (16%), increases in dollar volume (13%), and increases in processed transactions (12%). These were offset by rebate and incentive increases for new and renewed agreements and increased volumes.The company continues to see double-digit growth in volume and transactions in their regions around the world. They are becoming increasingly excited with innovations and investment in MasterPass, EMV, and Biometrics, which will help redefine how people pay around the world. They still have $1.2 billion remaining in their current repurchase program.One look at MasterCard's social media outlook on TickerTags shows that, while the stock price increased significantly, the amount of mentions on Twitter has leveled-off since a spike in chatter in late April after earnings.Could this decrease in chatter be a sign of pent up demand for the stock? Or does it show investor appetite dissipating? Time will tell on this one.Regardless, it seems like the company blasts through all-time highs on a daily basis. Is it time to jump on board before we miss the train?Leading payment processor network:MasterCard operates the second largest payment network that connects, bank, consumers, and merchants in over 210 countries. They have over 2.2 billion active cards, 51 billion purchase transactions, and $4.5 trillion in gross dollar volume. Operating margins are well over 50% and the company generates excess free cash flow.There is little doubt that a secular growth opportunity remains from paper to plastic (digital). ~85% of transactions today are done using cash and checks. MasterCard is at the forefront of this movement.Their strategic focus remains unchanged as they try to increase electronic payment usage and grow their current share of the market. We have little doubt that MasterCard will continue to perform well as a leader in the growing payments industry, regardless of the volatile economies worldwide and currency fluctuations. The loss of USAA was not a great sign, but new deals with TD Bank (NYSE:TD) should help with other deals down the line.Main competitors include American Express (APX), Visa (NYSE:V), PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), and VeriFone (NYSE:PAY).Long Runway for Global Growth:International operations are helping MasterCard to grow at an outsized pace. Volumes generated outside of North America represent the vast majority of total revenues. The U.S. is still growing at 7.6% respectively, but international markets are growing at 14.00-17.80%. MasterCard still has work to do in penetrating the Latin American market, but the opportunity still exists.MasterCard cards have attained a high penetration rate in North America and Europe. However, cash and checks are still used in many countries. This trend in international markets to increasingly use electronic payments for commerce will help MasterCard in its growth internationally (and in North America).The paperless payment space continues to remain attractive across the globe. Secular trends are causing a shift from cash and checks to credit and debit cards. Card payment companies are seeing opportunities in this expansion through U.S. and international consumers, small business, Corporate, International, Network and Merchant partners, and New Businesses. They believe future earnings of the business will be driven through their simple and low-cost financial model for all parties.And let's not forget the potential market for payments via your mobile phone (ApplePay). This has the potential to be a real game changer in how consumers pay across the globe. It's a simpler, faster way to pay for goods and services, and promotes a higher average spend in store.MasterCard's ""open-loop"" model and disruptive payment systems could be a concern:MasterCard's open-loop model is a benefit, as well as a potential curse. It's a blessing because it makes the business model incredibly capital light. It's a potential curse because the open-loop model relies on third-party card issuers and merchant acquirers. Visa uses this same model as it relied on banks to make credit and debit decisions to sign up merchants. American Express uses a ""closed-loop"" model, which gives them more revenue and control. However, it also opens them up to credit risks and non-payment. The closed-loop system may be more valuable because of the control aspect.In addition, technological innovation in the digital payment transactions space is starting to heat up and could cause potential disruptions. Even PayPal is coming out with a new credit card. However, we don't see this as a huge issue. PayPal is using MasterCard for their transactions and MasterCard continues to invest in technology and make acquisitions in this space.Regulation is always an issue with card transactions. Recently, the U.S. government handed down a judgment against American Express which allowed merchants to tell their customers to use other, low cost (Visa, MasterCard) cards at the point of sale. Under their contract, Merchants are not allowed to do this or impede on the buyers right to choose their payment choices. The case is currently being appealed by American Express. MasterCard and Visa are low-cost cards right now, but what happens if lower cost cards start to hit the market.Strong Network Effect and Brand Provides a Sustainable Competitive Advantage:MasterCard is a global leader in credit / debit card transactions. Based on credit/debit cards in circulation, dollar volume, and transaction, MasterCard has the second largest electronic payments platform. 50% of all transaction are debit card related and this number is expected to grow.Barriers to entry can be tough as competitors need multiple things to compete adequately: brand recognition, stringent fraud systems in place, and merchant/customer acceptance (just to name a few).MasterCard's relationship with financial institutions and merchants allows them not to extend credit to consumers, which in turn, allows them to assume no credit risk. In addition, MasterCard's main revenue model provides built-in inflation protection because its fees are based on the percentage of the total purchase. As the cost of goods go up over time, the percentage fee stays the same.The company spends almost $1 billion on advertising and marketing --- not many companies can compete with that number.Strong Capital Structure:MasterCard has a fortress balance sheet with $5.10 billion in cash and very little debt. This allows them plenty of opportunity and flexibility to take advantage of strategic acquisitions, organic growth, and repurchasing of shares in the years to come. It will be very difficult to kill this company.Management team led by CEO, Ajay Banga, is motivated and shareholder friendly:CEO, Ajay Banga, said in the most recent quarter, ""We are pleased with the results we delivered this quarter, in spite of the ongoing uncertainty in the global economy. We continue to see double-digit growth in both volume and transactions in most of our regions around the world…As the world becomes more digitally driven, our innovations and investments in things such as MasterPass, EMV and biometrics are helping to redefine the way people shop and pay with convenience and security.""Management has proven to be incredibly shareholder friendly with share repurchases and dividends. We expect this to continue. They still have $1.2 billion remaining in their current repurchase program.*** Side Note: At a 3% FCF yield, we'd like to see management find other ways to invest their excess cash. I'm sure management could find a better use for shareholder money than at 30x+ FCF. We doubt that will keep them from repurchasing shares.BOTTOM LINE~85% of transactions today are done using cash and checks. As you can imagine, this presents an enormous opportunity for MasterCard. MasterCard should be able to compound investor capital over a very long period. There is always a ""tug of war"" between high-quality businesses like MasterCard, and paying too high a price for that quality. However, it's difficult to ignore the high margin, free cash generation power of the business model. We feel the market is accurately reflecting the intrinsic value of the business at current levels with e FCF yield of ~3%. We don't have much of an edge here at current levels, but we are watching it very closely. If/when the stock falls out of favor on Wall Street, we would be big buyers of the company.Shares appear to be relatively overvalued using various metrics. However, the long wave of growth for this company is tremendous based off of increased personal consumption and the shift from paper to electronic-based transactions. This is a company to keep on your watch list and wait for the right opportunity. Obviously, we like the company at lower levels (and with less ""rosiness"" priced into the stock). With that said, we believe investors could do little wrong investing in MasterCard at current levels at a slow and steady pace over time (and hopefully at lower levels).Cheers!Notable Shareholders:Steve Mandel | Tom Russo | Andreas Halvorsen | Chase Coleman |Ruane Cunniff | Berkshire | Bill Nygren | Chuck Akre | Tweedy BrownePlease share your thoughts in the comments section below as I learn just as much from you as you do from me.

3633026,88786,2015-11-02T11:28:22-05:00,"MasterCard recently announced its third-quarter earnings. Overall, there was a mix of opinion about how the company is performing.Due to foreign currency headwinds, revenue and net income are taking a hit and growth might be threatened in the short term.Expenses were carefully managed and lowered. Going forward, this would give MasterCard a huge advantage as it scales the business further.Competition within and outside of the industry isn't a huge threat for the company yet.Growth will resume when macroeconomic issues are resolved. Investors should add this solid compounding machine into their portfolios today.","IntroductionMany investors perceive MasterCard (NYSE: MA) as a company that operates within the financial industry rather than one in the technology space. However, the cash flow that it generates comes directly from its matchmaking service between the merchant and consumer. MasterCard's business is truly priceless. Along with Visa (NYSE: V), it enjoys a virtual duopoly in payment transaction processing. MasterCard doesn't make loans (it only started to take on debt recently). Instead, it acts as a digital tollbooth operator that takes a small fee on every credit or debit card transaction that goes through its network. That's true of cards bearing the MasterCard, Maestro, or Cirrus brands.The graphic below shows how the money flows on a typical transaction and where MasterCard fits into the process.Going into its third-quarter earnings, MasterCard posted results which reflected a better outlook as compared to the previous quarter. As spending levels increased during the quarter, MasterCard was able to deliver a decent third quarter to meet Wall Street's expectation. Let's take a deeper look at the numbers to find out if investors should be worried about any hiccups that may come along the way.Business OverviewRevenue for the third quarter came in at $2.53 billion, which is up only a modest 1.6% as compared to Q3 2014. GAAP net income fell by almost 4% to $977 million after a $50 million pension-related charge. After accounting for the one-off event, net income and earnings per share rose to $1.027 billion and $0.91, respectively.The main culprit to blame here for the fall in net income was the strong dollar. Like every other company that derives a portion of their revenue from international markets, MasterCard was badly affected as well. Revenue dipped by 10 percentage points while earnings per share would have been roughly 11% higher after accounting for foreign currency headwinds. Cross-border volumes increased by an impressive 16%, with gross dollar volume going up by 13% in local-currency terms to $1.2 trillion. Total processed transactions rose by 12% to reach 12.3 billion and worldwide purchase volume increased by 12% to land at $852 billion after accounting for foreign exchange headwinds.From these figures shown, I think investors can say that most of the figures show signs of growth for the company.Overall, MasterCard fared pretty well after accounting for the various geographical segments which it operates in. The company experienced growth in gross dollar volume and purchase volume of within the range of 14% to 19% across the world. Currency impacts had the biggest effect on Latin America, where the majority of gross dollar volume dropped by 15%. In areas such as Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Africa, gross dollar volume growth improved modestly by 3% despite the strong dollar. Once again, like the previous quarter, the U.S. market posted weaker results as compared to the company's international business. The good news here is that gross dollar volume and purchase volume both climbed by 7.5% and 8% higher than the previous quarter.Taking a look at the income statement, the company's operating expenses have been increasing faster than revenue can grow. General and administrative expenses soared by almost 13% from Q3 2014. The company recorded a one-off pension charge while it managed to reduce advertising and marketing costs by roughly 10%.The company's management seemed to be pleased with the results this quarter. CEO Ajay Bang pointed out that the rise of digital transaction volume will continue to be a long-term driver of the company's growth. From here, let's look at how MasterCard will fuel its growth going forward.Picking Speed on GrowthMasterCard has spotted various avenues for growth in the technology space.Firstly, MasterPass digital wallet is designed to integrate digital payments in a much more seamless way, especially during the checkout process of the transaction. With the advent of Apple Pay (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Google Wallet (NASDAQ: GOOG, GOOGL), it will be much more convenient for consumers to make transactions from their mobile devices. Secondly, EMV chips and biometrics have been used to improve the security which has become a big issue recently. As rivals like PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) move forward with alternatives such as the controversial Bitcoin currency, MasterCard will have to think of other ways to fend off competition from start-ups and the various medium which they use to disrupt the payments industry. At this point, PayPal isn't a threat to MasterCard yet. Even PayPal promotes the use of a credit card.In terms of competition within the space which MasterCard operates, the only other threat would be from its larger rival, Visa. Investors are keeping an eye on Visa as they are expecting revenue to increase by 10% and a more than 15% growth in earnings for the next fiscal year. Needless to say, MasterCard hasn't been able to outpace Visa in terms of growth, although analysts remain hopeful that it would be able to speed it up once macroeconomic conditions become more favorable.To sum things up, investors seemed to be quite content with the company's earnings, as the stock only dipped slightly after the announcement was made. For investors with a long-term horizon, it would be wise to add this tremendous compounding machine into their portfolios."
3606946,41961,2015-10-27T09:09:19-04:00,"MasterCard has strong barriers to entry and deep network advantages which generate strong returns on equity.The company's growth drivers going forward are positive, and it remains one of my favorite growth stocks.I see little in the way of competitive threats that will derail MasterCard's long-term growth trajectory.","I've owned MasterCard (NYSE:MA) stock on and off over the years. Fortunately, in 2012, I convinced myself that this is a long-term hold and not something to move in and out of. MasterCard is now the single largest position in my portfolio.The company is a toll taker for the credit economy. Each time a credit card or debit card transaction is processed on its network, MasterCard charges the merchants who put through that transaction an assessment fee. This is basically a small percentage of the total transaction value.MasterCard's total return performance since the IPO has been exceptional. An investor who invested $10,000 in the stock in 2006 would have received returns close to $200,000, which is substantially better than the performance of the S&P 500 over a similar duration. A $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 would have returned $20,000 over a similar time frame.Key Growth DriversCash/Check to Credit - While the level of cash-based purchases has been steadily declining in developed economies, MasterCard cites a global credit card penetration of just 15%. There are likely years of growth to come in addressing the 85% of global transaction volume that is still cash-based.Offline to Online commerce - Online commerce is steadily accelerating in developed economies. It is a trend that has barely scratched the surface in developing economies. Online commerce lends itself to card-based settlement. Even in developed economies, e-commerce is just touching double-digit percentages in terms of total transaction volume.International and Emerging economies - With the steady growth in disposable income and GDP per capita in emerging economies, MasterCard is particularly well placed to benefit. Non-US GDV forms almost 65% of MasterCard's business, and reflects a company that is international in nature.With the key growth drivers for the business seemingly well in place, and with MasterCard the dominant part of a credit network oligopoly along with Visa (NYSE:V), the key question becomes: What are the potential threats to the long-term growth story?Apple and Alphabet - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet's (Google's parent company) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) payment products represent offerings that can be targeted to an installed base of millions of users. At present, the payment products of both companies work to drive cards issued by the payment networks and the issuers, rather than something competitive. Implicitly, these companies are actually further entrenching Visa and MasterCard as the status quo for payment.The question is whether Apple and Alphabet attempt to insert their own closed loop currency at some point to disintermediate the networks and capture some upside. While both may try to do so, I don't think this will ultimately be successful.To be successful at orchestrating change in a payments ecosystem, it's imperative that there be coordination and control of the experience. That requires concerted partnership with merchants, a strong user base, and consistency of user experience.Apple would be the best placed to try and effect such an outcome, given the nature of the closed system that it operates. However, it is a premium product, and internationally, the share of iOS compared to Android is insignificant, and is falling further every day. Estimates put global iOS share at just 15% of total smartphone devices. As that market share falls, it will become increasingly difficult for Apple to capture broad merchant interest to support that base. And even if it is successful, the company can potentially only convert at most 15% or so of total payment volume away from traditional card networks.This even presupposes that it is interested in doing so. For Apple, getting into the weeds of payment routing and processing doesn't improve the user experience, and doesn't help the company sell more devices. It also seems a relatively small potential revenue stream for so much effort and coordination on the part of the company.Visa and MasterCard's combined revenues are less than 10% of that of Apple. With its relatively small global iOS share, there appears little way that the company would capture even 20% of Visa and MasterCard's total revenue base, assuming a closed loop payment product that was adopted by all iOS users.In the case of Alphabet, Android Pay theoretically has a much better chance of making more significant inroads into the market share of MasterCard and Visa, given Android's global penetration stands at close to 80%.However, Android really represents a mix of many different OEMs and operating system versions. While Alphabet has launched Android Pay, it will have to go up against the payment instruments of the various OEMs themselves. It is clear that certain OEM manufacturers, such as Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have their own designs on how they attack payments. The openness of the Android ecosystem will ultimately lead to a level of fragmentation amongst the Android ecosystem that will make it difficult for Alphabet to coordinate a payment strategy to give it any real chance of destabilizing the payment networks.The point also needs to be made that the more time lapses with Alphabet and Apple supporting the traditional payment schemes of Visa and MasterCard, the more difficult it will be to ultimately unseat them, as the network effect of the payment schemes increases with additional merchant and user adoption.Digital currencies: While digital currencies, from BitCoin to LiteCoin, have been heralded as long-term threats to MasterCard and Visa, the point that is missed with all of these currencies is that they are completely open source. That means that the potential of these schemes is largely dependent on what individual users can make of them.Without a focused, concerted effort to create a new payment schema, and the necessary effort to coordinate merchants and evangelize consumers, these open source currencies which offer the promise of interchange free commerce will not have the scale that is needed to be a meaningful alternative. Rather, it is likely that they will just emerge to solve niche use cases and be used for P2P payments.Merchant collaboration: MCX has been held up as a shining example of what could be possible, but given the consortium's singular failure to do anything of substance (aside from issue numerous press releases indicating their intention to things), I don't hold out any fear that these merchant collaborations will be meaningful challengers to the dominance of the payment networks. Merchant collaborations tend to be afflicted by numerous dueling interests, not to mention the tough hurdle of trying to solve a problem that is their own and not a consumer one (i.e., interchange payable on purchases). Consumers don't have a problem paying with credit cards today. It isn't clear what value merchants will provide.Regulation: The biggest challenge that I foresee to the dominance of MasterCard and Visa is the risk of regulation that is posed by their incredible success and dominance. Global inquires into the rates of interchange increase the risk of action to curb fees in the interest of facilitating commerce. Such inquiries have already been held in Canada, Australia and parts of Europe.MasterCard: A long-term ""Buy and Hold""The strong growth drivers that exist for MasterCard and the relative lack of material disruptive forces make this a long-term buy-and-accumulate stock at current prices, in my opinion. MasterCard trades at a forward P/E ratio of 25x earnings.While this appears expensive, given the long-term growth trajectory ahead of the business and the relative lack of competitors, I believe that this is a fair price to pay for a high-quality business. An investor in the stock today will likely see strong long-term rates of growth that will make current prices seem attractive in hindsight."
3781636,98366,2015-12-29T14:47:06-05:00,I would like to see MasterCard trading at 27 times earnings moving forward.The three-year gains at 27 times earnings are still a fantastic 24.42%.Mid-teen earnings growth guidance offered by management appears more than achievable.Entry to the Chinese market within three years could cause guidance to increase.,"MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is a great company offering, in my opinion, payment solutions on par with its arch rival Visa (NYSE:V). Right now trading at 30.32 times trailing earnings, it is looking a little expensive to me, but for those that are in it for the long run I am sure it will still be a great investment even if buying in at this level.But is it actually expensive?This is the big question. Like most companies, MasterCard would be affected somewhat by an economic downturn, but as long as consumers are still purchasing things with their credit or debit cards, it doesn't really matter what they purchase as long as they do in fact continue to make purchases.I think both MasterCard and Visa offer great defensive qualities that make them attractive investments. With both exhibiting near zero credit risk, I can see why investors would be willing to pay a premium to invest in them.So whilst I think they are trading at a slight premium, and would love to see them down at 27 times trailing earnings, I can fully understand why they may continue to trade at a premium for the foreseeable future.Source: YchartsGrowing and growingThere is no escaping from the fact that Visa, which less than ten years ago lagged behind MasterCard, has grown its revenue at a more impressive rate. But a contrarian view on this might be that MasterCard has a bounty of growth still ahead of it for shareholders to capitalize on. Both have exciting opportunities ahead in the Chinese market, and depending on what sort of foothold they can get there, revenue growth could be set to continue its rapid growth or even accelerate further from this point.Source: YchartsI am impressed with the year-over-year growth the company made despite the strong US dollar causing those annoying headwinds and slowing down the revenue plane. According to management, FX reduced earnings per share growth by 6% in Q3 2015.As shown below, the company grew transactions by 12% for Q3 2015 year over year and had 8% more cards in circulation. I think we should be encouraged by the fact that transactions growth has outpaced cards growth.Source: Company PresentationInto ChinaUnionPay is the undisputed payment processing boss in China, but following a complaint by the US to the World Trade Organization back in 2012, it has begrudgingly opened up its card clearing market to foreign companies. It's not going to be easy by any means, though, as Datamonitor writes that industry experts are saying that foreign players will face big challenges in trying to win market share from UnionPay, which is used by 80 percent of debit cards and accounts for 72 percent of total transaction value in 2014.The size of the market is truly remarkable. UnionPay is estimated to have handled more than $6.7 trillion worth of transactions in 2014 and I have no doubt that 2015 will have seen a notable increase on that. If MasterCard can take a small bite of the overall cake then the company's top line will be given a huge lift.We have to understand though that this will take time, investment, and patience. As exciting an opportunity as it really is, I feel investors should not expect fireworks just yet, and look at this as a long-term opportunity.It is worth noting that it's not just China that MasterCard can look to for growth. There are huge opportunities for MasterCard in Indonesia and India with their growing middle classes, as well as a number of emerging Asian economies.The emergence of contactless technologies is a huge step forward in my eyes too. It is actually easier and quicker now to use PayPass for small purchases than it is using coins or notes.Bitcoin ThreatThere will always be concerns that Bitcoin or an equivalent will allow retailers to circumvent payment handlers. The rise of the smartphone does make this a plausible scenario moving forward, but I believe the security, fraud prevention, and privacy provided by MasterCard and Visa will ultimately make retailers view that using them is more beneficial than a small percentage saving per transaction.Free Cash Flow And BuybacksThe company has been generating high levels of free cash flow. This bodes well for the expansion into China I believe. Considerable investment may be required and I'm positive that the company will only do so if they see a suitably high internal rate of return.Source: YchartsThe company continues to buy back its stock. As you can see on the chart below, it has spent billions of dollars returning cash back to shareholders and reducing the number of shares outstanding.Source: YchartsMoving ForwardThe loss of the USAA contract proves just what a cutthroat and tough market MasterCard works in. USAA had been loyal to MasterCard for many, many years, but recently switched over to Visa. An estimated $28 billion of USAA transactions that went through MasterCard's payment network will now be going through Visa.The company has offered three-year guidance of earnings CAGR in the mid-teens. Whilst this is a little drop from the previous guidance offered, I still believe the company is well positioned to surprise. During the Q3 earnings call, Martina Hund-Mejean, Chief Financial Officer, was quizzed about what assumptions were made in offering this guidance. I was pleased with her response:As I have said previously, the road to China is going to be a long one, but by not factoring the China potential into the guidance, I feel even more confident in the company moving forward. It also could be the catalyst to further earnings and share price growth if they get a foothold in China within the next three years.ValuationAt the beginning, I stated that I would be more comfortable with the stock trading at 27 times earnings and although I stick by this statement, sometimes you have to acknowledge that you must pay a premium for quality stocks.But to justify paying a premium, I'm going to need to see a return that compensates me for this perceived extra element of risk.For my conservative scenario, I see the next three years playing out like this. (Please note: I don't expect the stock to lose 8%, but rather that would be my conservative fair value for the stock heading into full year earnings.)On the bullish side, anticipating no drop in price to earnings ratio, I see the next three years playing out this way:ConclusionBoth scenarios make MasterCard an appealing option for investors looking to hold for the long term. I believe that due to emerging markets and their growing middle classes there is a strong chance of earnings surprise during the next three years, which could elevate the stock even higher.I urge investors to hold tight to those MasterCard shares for the next three years at the very least."
3493386,22018,2015-09-07T05:16:14-04:00,"Although MasterCard's stock is not very cheap right now, I consider it an excellent long-term investment.I see high growth prospects for the company. Key drivers of growth are the world's transition to electronic payments from cash and mobile payment development.The company has recorded substantial growth in the last few years, and the estimated EPS growth for the next five years is very high.The average target price of the top analysts is at $108, up 19.3% from its September 4 close price, which appears reasonable, in my opinion.","Although MasterCard's (NYSE:MA) stock is not very cheap right now, I consider it an excellent long-term investment. MasterCard, the world's second-largest electronic payments network, has been successful in the last few years, and its stock has outperformed the market. Year-to-date, the stock is up 5.1%, while the S&P 500 Index has dropped 6.7% and the Nasdaq Composite Index has lost 1.1%. Moreover, since the beginning of 2012, it has risen an impressive 142.8%. In this period, the S&P 500 Index has increased 52.8% and the Nasdaq Composite Index has risen 79.8%. However, considering its robust business and high growth prospects, the shares could go higher. According to TipRanks, the average target price of the top analysts is at $108, up 19.3% from MA's September 4 closing price, which appears reasonable, in my opinion.MA Daily ChartMA Weekly Chart(Charts: TradeStation Group, Inc.)On July 29, MasterCard reported its second-quarter 2015 financial results, which met EPS expectations. Last quarter's in-line results came after three quarters in a row of beating analysts' estimates, as shown in the table below.(Data: Yahoo Finance)Excluding a special item, the company reported net income of $965 million, up 4%, or 12% after adjusting for currency, and earnings per diluted share of $0.85, up 6%, or 15% after adjusting for currency, versus the year-ago period. Net revenue for the second quarter of 2015 was $2.4 billion, a 1% increase versus the same period in 2014. Adjusted for currency, net revenue increased 7%.MasterCard demonstrated significant growth in all factors. However, those factors were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives, primarily due to new and renewed agreements and increased volumes. Its net revenue growth was driven by the impact of the following:Worldwide purchase volume during the quarter was up 12% from the second quarter of 2014 to $841 billion, on a local currency basis. As of June 30, 2015, the company's customers had issued 2.2 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.I see high growth prospects for the company. Key drivers of growth are the world's transition to electronic payments from cash and mobile payment development. Also, MasterCard has great potential to gain market share, and it can expand internationally. Furthermore, a stronger global economic recovery could lead to an acceleration of spending and further revenue growth. The market for cashless payment solutions is growing at a rapid rate, especially in emerging economies. Card transactions have experienced strong growth in the Asia-Pacific region, now representing over 25% of global card volume. I believe that this growth will continue as more people and merchants adopt credit and debit cards, for convenience and security, and for the opportunity to take advantage of rewards programs. Mobile payments have been growing at an impressive rate, and it is expected to continue as mobile payment solutions become more secure and more consumers use smartphones. This trend will benefit the company, since MasterCard offers special payment solutions to enable the payment of bills from mobile phones. The company's digital payment platform, MasterPass, was launched in 2013 and is gaining widespread acceptance. MasterCard has also tied up with Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung Pay (OTC:SSNLF), which will increase its part in the mobile payment segment.In a Fortune interview with MasterCard's chief emerging payments officer, Ed McLaughlin, he was asked about the consumer adoption of Apple and Android Pay. McLaughlin explained:ValuationMA's stock is not very cheap right now; its trailing P/E is at 27.77, the forward P/E is at 22.32, and the Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio is at 18.16. However, the company has recorded substantial growth in the last few years. Its annual average sales growth over the last five years was at 13.2%, and the average EPS growth was very high at 22.5%. The estimated EPS growth for the next year is very high at 20%, and the average annual estimated EPS growth for the next five years is also very high at 17.5%. Also, although MA's annual dividend yield is only 0.71%, it has grown at an average annual rate of 52.2% in the last five years.In addition, MA's Margins and Return on Capital parameters have been much better than its industry median, its sector median and the S&P 500 median, as shown in the tables below.(Source: Portfolio123)During the second quarter of 2015, MasterCard repurchased approximately 9 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of approximately $849 million. Quarter-to-date through July 22nd, the company repurchased an additional 1.9 million shares at a cost of approximately $182 million, with $2.0 billion remaining under the current repurchase program authorization.In January 2015, MasterCard raised its quarterly dividend to $0.16 per share from $0.11. The forward annual dividend yield is at 0.71%, and the payout ratio is only 18%. The annual rate of dividend growth over the past five years was very high at 52.2%.SummaryAlthough the stock is not very cheap right now, I consider it an excellent long-term investment. I see high growth prospects for the company. Key drivers of growth are the world's transition to electronic payments from cash and mobile payment development. Also, MasterCard has great potential to gain market share, and it can expand internationally. Mobile payment solutions become more secure, and more consumers use smartphones. This trend will benefit MasterCard, since it offers special payment solutions to enable the payment of bills from mobile phones. The company has recorded substantial growth in the last few years, and the estimated EPS growth for the next five years is very high. Furthermore, MasterCard is generating strong cash flows, and returns value to its shareholders by way of stock buybacks and by increasing its modest dividend payments. The average target price of the top analysts is at $108, up 19.3% from its September 4 close price, which appears reasonable, in my opinion."
3560966,38631,2015-10-08T19:14:40-04:00,"MasterCard has pronouncedly outperformed S&P in any time horizon one can test.The big question is whether the stock is likely to keep outperforming the market by such a wide margin in the future.Thanks to its great prospects for double-digit growth for at least another decade, MA is likely to keep outperforming the market.","MasterCard (NYSE:MA) has pronouncedly outperformed S&P (NYSEARCA:SPY) in any time horizon one can test. To be sure, it has greatly outperformed S&P during the last 5 years (294% vs. 69%), the last 2 years (40% vs. 20%) and the last 12 months (28% vs. 3%). Nevertheless, the big question is whether the stock is likely to keep outperforming the market by such a wide margin in the future or it has become somewhat risky, particularly given its premium valuation.First of all, MasterCard possesses one of the most important attributes that Buffett looks for in a stock. It has minimal capital expenses to maintain its business and hence it exhibits enormous free cash flows. In other words, its full profit is available for distribution to the shareholders while the company keeps growing without issuing any debt. Thus, the company maintains maximum financial flexibility and optionality while its shareholders get full advantage of the earnings of the business, as opposed to other companies (car producers, energy producers, etc.) which are forced to invest most of their earnings just to keep their sales constant.The other great part of this stock is its exceptional growth potential, as it is likely to keep growing at double digits for at least another decade. To be sure, an increasing number of consumers switch from cash to cards every year, as the cards are more convenient while they also reward their users. It is important to realize that the fees charged to the sellers of products by the card companies and the rewards of the cards are ultimately passed to the consumers. Thus, the consumers who prefer to pay in cash essentially pay for the fees of the card companies and the rewards earned by the card users.As more and more people realize this, it is only natural that the trend of switching from cash to cards is here to stay for decades. The cash usage has declined to 59.4% in developed markets while it is still 92.7% in emerging markets. Therefore, there is tremendous growth potential in emerging markets, while there is still ample room for growth even in developed markets. This is evident in the last earnings report of MasterCard, which reported 7% growth in its gross dollar volume in US and 16% growth in the rest of the world.Moreover, the growth of MasterCard is further assisted by the population growth every year (average 1.1%) and the global GDP growth every year, which has averaged 3.5% in the last decade. Furthermore, as the company allocates most of its earnings on share repurchases, it reduces its share count by 2-3% every year, thus further enhancing its EPS. As all the above growth rates are compounded every year, it is not hard to understand why the company has doubled its EPS in the last 3 years and is expected to keep growing it by an additional 15% per year for the foreseeable future.As if there was not enough growth potential for the company, China cleared the way for foreign card companies to start operations in the country this year. As China is the second-largest economy in the world, with a GDP that comprises 15% of the global GDP and millions of citizens eager to adopt the western lifestyle every year, it is easy to realize the potential benefit for MA. So far the market of card payments has been dominated by state-backed UnionPay. It is worth noting that MasterCard has some ties with UnionPay, which may prove very beneficial in the efforts to gain market share in China. Thus, MA seems to have a slight edge over Visa (NYSE:V) in the Chinese market. Of course, the operating margins in China will not be as high as in other countries, but the potential for volume expansion is immense. All in all, the above-mentioned multiple growth factors render MasterCard a quintessential growth stock.It is also important to realize that MasterCard is expected to grow its EPS by only 9% this year, mainly due to the strong dollar, which has hurt all the multinational companies. However, the hikes of the interest rates have already been remarkably postponed and are expected to be put off much further. Moreover, as the US trade deficit has approached record-high levels due to the strong dollar, I believe that the dollar does not have much room to appreciate. Instead, it is likely to start depreciating at some point in the next few months in order to reduce the US trade deficit and also catch up with the reality of much slower hikes of the interest rates. Therefore, while forex has been a headwind for MA this year, it will probably become a tailwind in the near future, which will provide an additional boost to the stock.The only problem with this stock is that it almost always trades at a very high premium. To be sure, the stock is now trading at a forward P/E = 23.5, which deters many investors from purchasing the stock. However, if the company keeps growing its EPS by 15% per year in the next 5 years, it will have EPS around $7.0 in 2020. To be somewhat conservative, if we assume a trailing P/E of about 20 in 2020 (vs. the current P/E = 28.0), the stock will be around $140 in 2020 and hence it will have returned about 50% in the next 5 years (8.4% annualized). Of course, as the company will still have ample room for future growth after 5 years, it will have probably maintained its elevated P/E, so its stock price will be much higher, in the range $180-200. Nevertheless, it is best to be conservative in order to minimize the effect of negative surprises.To sum up, thanks to its great growth potential and perfect execution, MasterCard is likely to keep providing excellent returns to its shareholders and keep outperforming the market despite its current rich valuation. A sustained high growth rate is almost always sufficient to outweigh the disadvantage of an initially rich valuation. Nevertheless, due to the premium valuation, the stock is vulnerable to a steep correction whenever it faces a headwind, such as negative macro news or company-specific issues. To be sure, the stock initially plunged 18% in the flash crash of August 24th. Therefore, only the investors with a strong stomach, patience and a long-term perspective should consider purchasing the stock. If one runs the risk of panic-selling at the first significant bump, then they should stay away from this stock."
3371485,70385,2015-07-29T16:50:27-04:00,"MasterCard is a high-performing stock and has the hallmarks of a successful business.Return on equity and return on invested capital are regularly over 40%.It develops its own financial technology like mobile payment cards and apps, and is included in Apple Pay.Earnings growth is expected to be in the high teens annually for a number of years ahead.","Credit card company MasterCard (NYSE:MA) is a high-performance stock that has produced very strong returns over the past 5 years. In addition to having a highly recognized name brand, the company has many of the hallmarks of business success that investors look for when stock picking.Looking first at the business, you'll see this credit card and payments service provider has some attractive returns in the past. MasterCard stays on the leading edge of technology innovation to maintain its market leadership, and so far it has paid off with a return on equity that had been regularly in the low 40s, yet in fiscal 2014 topped 50%.That was partly due the company taking on $1.5 billion in long-term debt (in previous years, it had zero), so you also want to look at the return on invested capital to get the full story on operating performance. ROIC stood at 42%, in line with earlier years. Normal companies might be in the low teens, so you can appreciate what a wide gap that is.Another reason I like MasterCard is the high net profit margins. The company just gets so much more bang for its buck than the average listed stock. When a business can consistently achieve margins in the mid- to high-30% range, you know you have a winner.Source: Data from gurufocus.comHigh income margins are great, but a sturdy ship also needs solid earnings growth to fill its sails for maximum speed. In the past five years, net earnings have more than doubled from about $1.5 billion in 2009 to $3.6 billion in 2014, outpacing revenue growth, thanks to rising net income margins.During that time, the company's shareholders saw a fantastic 288% share price return. MA doesn't pay a high yield, but dividends have risen quickly from 12 cents a share to 49 cents in the last three years. Perhaps you can't expect the company to keep up that pace every year, but it does indicate the company wants to establish a habit of above-average dividend growth. That's great for both yield and growth investors.We've looked at the annual figures of this strong market performer, so next is to look at recent results. The credit card company processed 12% more transactions in the first quarter, and saw 8% more MasterCard cards in use. Purchasing volumes were also up 12% on a constant-currency basis. Once adjusted for forex translation, net revenue rose in the high-single digits.Quarterly diluted EPS was 89 cents - a full 9 cents above market estimates, and about 22% higher than the 73 cents a share in the year-ago period. That quarterly growth is in line with the average annual EPS growth over the past four years, so MasterCard is sticking with the earnings trend.The credit card company, second only to Visa (NYSE:V) in transaction volumes, keeps its business edge by developing financial services tech for online payments. In addition to creating its own mobile payment platform called PayPass, it also is one of the major credit card companies that is in the Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL) mobile payment system. That gives MasterCard wide availability and strong appeal to users. The company is taking it one step further by developing a mobile app that can make a payment using only a selfie photo to verify the customer. Staying strong in business means staying ahead in technology to keep up with what the consumer is doing.MasterCard's stock hit an all-time high of $97.76 in July and in general is continuing on with its uptrend after trading sideways for most of 2014. For a company that regularly grows earnings on average close to 19%-20% annually, the current forward PE of 23 means current share prices are reasonable for the expected growth.For long-term investors, the combination of the strong brand name, the high ROE and net income margins, the expected high-teens earnings growth and high technological capabilities makes owning MasterCard's stock a good business sense."
3370405,33291,2015-07-29T14:06:06-04:00,"MasterCard is a true global powerhouse.In Q2, growth slowed a bit but it remains reliable and I discuss the key metrics.Once the impact of acquisitions and buybacks run their course I would look for a dividend hike.","MasterCard (NYSE:MA) is a company that everyone in American probably knows, and most people in developed nations are likely familiar with. It is a true global powerhouse. I regularly use a MasterCard and I know they are certainly taking a cut from all of my transactions. The business model has been absolutely stellar and has only improved over the years as consumers have moved away from physical assets and cash for purchases, to more electronic means. Consumers continue to spend. Families routinely pay bills electronically. Some, myself included, use their cards to rack up rewards points. That actually catches people sometimes and leads to interest rate charges. Holiday shopping continues to grow annually. All of these things benefit major card companies. Today MasterCard, whose stock trading at 29 times earnings and continues to trade near highs, is out with its second quarter earnings and as such I feel it is time to review the name that I recommended at $90 a share.Once again, I am impressed. The company continued its slow but reliable growth. Net revenue for the quarter came in at $2.4 billion, a 1% increase over Q2 2014. However, due to currency changes, and a stronger dollar, it may not be directly comparable of course. Thus if we control for currency and look at things on a constant dollar basis, the company actually saw a 7% increase in revenues. This was primarily due to a 17% jump in international volumes and a 13% increase in processed transactions to approximately 12.0 billion. Wow. The numbers are rather striking and seem to suggest a rather robust global economy, although as I said before, it is tough to know the degree to which folks have moved primarily to using their cards versus other payment methods year-over-year. That said, global purchasing volumes rose another 12% to over $840 billion year-over-year.While revenues were up they were in-line with expectations. That said, expenses were much higher year-over-year versus last quarter. Total operating expenses as reported were actually up 9% year-over-year. However, as I did above for revenues, we really have to consider currency changes. When we adjust for changes in currency, we see operating expenses were up almost 14%. This rise in my opinion was alarming, but the total operating expenses were $1.1 billion for several reasons. Acquisitions contributed 10% of the rise, with the remainder primarily due to higher data processing and advertising & marketing expenses. Including special items total operating expenses increased 15% as reported, or 21% on a constant dollar basis. All of this led to operating income decreasing 5% as reported. However it was up 2% currency adjusted year-over-year. Operating margins were a strong 54.9%, but this is not nearly as strong as last quarter's 60.6%.Factoring in revenues and expenses, the company reported net income of $965 million, an increase of 4% as reported. Once again, adjusting to a constant currency basis, net income actually jumped 12%. This translated to earnings per share of $0.85. These earnings were up 15% adjusted for currency compared to Q2 2014. That continues to be strong growth. I will point out that it would have been even higher except that the acquisitions made by the company led to a $0.03 dilutive impact on earnings.To be clear, these numbers are strong once again, even if some people were expecting better revenue growth. On top of it all, the company continues to be shareholder friendly. During Q2 2015, MasterCard bought back 9 million shares for approximately $849 million. Here in Q3, the company has bought back another 1.9 million shares at a cost of approximately $192 million (through 7/22/15). There is still another $2.0 billion remaining under the current repurchase program authorization. The company also pays its $0.64 annual dividend; $0.16 quarterly. This only translates to a 0.70% yield. While a dividend is shareholder friendly, I expect this dividend to grow in the coming years. With the earnings this company posts, shareholders deserve a higher payout, especially after it exhausts its buyback program. I have said it before and will reiterate. With fewer shares on the market, which should be the purpose of a buyback, fewer dividends would have to be paid. Thus, done effectively, there is room to create more shareholder value. All that said, even with the company trading at 29 times earnings, it commands a premium thanks to its stellar performance and history of strong earnings growth. The company has not faltered, and for now, I think it will take a large market pullback to bring this name down. Stay long."
3529006,36431,2015-09-23T12:36:22-04:00,"Visa is much larger than MasterCard, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a better business.MasterCard's profitability metrics are better.Healthy free cash flow growth should continue for MA.Valuations are expensive, but probably not too extreme given growth prospects.","Many investors see Visa (NYSE:V) as the premier player in the electronic payments space, and it's easy to see why when factoring in size and scale.Source: 2014 Visa annual reportIt's clear that MasterCard (NYSE:MA) is a distant second to Visa when it comes to the amount of cards out there, as well as payments volume and total transactions, but is bigger always better?Profitability is more important than sizeI created the below table using ttm data from Morningstar.While it's clear Visa is an incredible business in its own right, MasterCard's profitability ratios blow it out of the water.I also included financial leverage, or the equity multiplier, to add some more insight into the ROE numbers. The more financial leverage, the more magnified and distorted return on equity becomes. If we dropped MasterCard's equity multiplier to match Visa's, its ROE would still be solid at around 34.74%, however.If you're wondering why Visa's ROE and ROIC numbers are the same, it's not a typo. The reason the figures match is because Visa has no debt. MasterCard does, however, which might lead some investors to believe that the former has a stronger balance sheet than the latter, but judging by its latest results, MasterCard is still a pillar of financial strength.As of the six months ended June 30th, MasterCard carried more current assets than total liabilities, so picking Visa over it based on balance sheets would seem a little silly.A free cash flow machineBoth Visa and MasterCard are cash flow machines, and require very little capital expenditure to maintain operations in relation to the operating cash they bring in. Take MasterCard for an example:Data from Morningstar, compiled by Joseph HarryWe can see that even though free cash flow dropped in 2014, both CFO and FCF still far outpaced capex over the last decade. I think this trend will continue as well. Operating cash came in at $1,732 (in millions) for the first half of this year, which was an increase of about 33.5% from last year.Earnings quality should also improve in 2015Fiscal 2014 saw a decrease in MasterCard's quality ratios, as net income surpassed free cash flow.Data from Morningstar, compiled by Joseph HarryDigging into the company's cash flow statement for FY2014, however, we can gain some more clarity as to why free cash flow dropped, while EBIT remained relatively steady in relation to net income.Source: MasterCard 2014 annual reportIt seems operating cash was constrained by significant changes in things like prepaid expenses, but as noted previously in the article, this year's operating cash seems to have recovered fully. If this trend continues, free cash flow should follow suit, as capex probably won't shoot up overnight.ConclusionMasterCard is a cash flow machine, one that requires little capital spending in relation to the amount of cash it takes in. It's a premium franchise, and seems to be an even better capital allocator than its bigger brother, Visa. I still think that Visa is a fine company, and will continue to clutch my existing shares for some time, but after evaluating MasterCard I also think I may have to make room for both companies in my portfolio one day.The only downside I can find with either company is their current valuations. Both companies come at a lofty price, and both trade at around 28-29 times ttm earnings. Visa looks a little cheaper in relation to free cash flow at roughly 28 times ttm FCF, versus MA shares that trade at a multiple of around 30, but I think MasterCard's free cash flow situation will look much better by year end as well.If I had to choose to buy one or the other right now, I'd pick MasterCard. If a broad market sell-off occurs, I might find myself buying new shares in both. These companies are both wide-moat, elite franchises, and I think they will continue to generate excess returns for decades to come.They have the technological prowess, size and scale, and established payments networks that make barriers very high for new entrants. Throw in the fact that the majority of the world still uses plain old cash, and the runway for growth going forward becomes much easier to envision.If this runway allows both companies to take off as planned (and they're not disrupted by new technologies or competitors that can erode away their abilities to consistently generate excess returns over time), then I think today's price tag is probably a fair one for the long run, especially if you don't require a large margin of safety in the short term."
3634756,22148,2015-11-02T17:55:05-05:00,MasterCard continues to produce meager growth numbers despite the markets willingness to own the stock.The payments network lost a key customer for 2016.The industry trend continues to suggest that investors lighten up on MasterCard as the stock rides higher.,"While MasterCard (NYSE:MA) trades near all-time highs, the earnings trend is heading in the wrong direction. The global payments company faces an industry where the customers are shopping around deals due to the high margins in the industry.The market justifies paying top dollar for the industry leaders due to the long-term growth potential as consumers around the world shift to plastic and mobile payments from paper currencies. The problem for new investors is that the stock has a stretched valuation based on that knowledge and the growth rates don't actually match the predicted growth.For the last quarter, MasterCard reported some meager growth metrics whether viewing the currency adjusted numbers or not. For starters, Q3 revenue only grew 2% to $2.5 billion while net income was a meager $12 million higher over the total from last year. Sure the numbers were improved when adjusted for currency, but the growth is far below the transactions volumes for several key reasons.The market likes to value MasterCard based on the transactions volumes that grew 12% or the gross dollar volumes on a local currency basis that grew 13%. These numbers are crucial to validating the investment theme of the global market shifting to using payment networks. The problem with the general focus on these numbers is that the payments network is increasingly having to offer rebates and incentives to keep customers.The first big sign of this new trend was the switch of Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) from American Express (NYSE:AXP) to Visa (NYSE:V). Sure the move by Costco didn't directly impact MasterCard, but it did signal a more aggressive customer base leading up to the recent loss of a large customer.Roughly a week ago, USAA switched its business to Visa from MasterCard. MasterCard provided the payments network to USAA for over 30 years and according to a report is the largest debit-card issuer for MasterCard with over $26 billion in annual purchases on its cards last year.The prime reason mentioned for the switch was no surprise related to reducing fees. USAA made the following statement:The statement mirrors the theory behind the movement of Costco away from American Express. In both cases, the card issuers held the leverage over the payment networks. The card issuers are the ones holding the connection with the consumer and the payment networks are so well established that the only competition is based now on lowering fees.In the case of Q3, MasterCard managed to produce an operating margin of an astounding 57.2%. It is no doubt that card issuers like USAA know for a fact that MasterCard and Visa have such incredibly profitable businesses that the companies can stand to compete more on price.This very theory is why MasterCard continues to see revenues and net income growth on a constant currency basis trail volumes on the payments network. The loss of pricing power is causing analysts to dial back on the EPS estimates for 2016. In the last 6 months alone, 2016 EPS estimates are down to $3.91 from $4.15.MA EPS Estimates for Next Fiscal Year data by YChartsMaybe a more telling stat is that Visa has seen no EPS bump from winning these two large deals. Both American Express and MasterCard have seen estimates for 2016 drop by over 5%. A clear sign that the payment networks are now competing on price to attract and keep customers.MA EPS Estimates for Next Fiscal Year data by YChartsThe key takeaway remains that the trend the market is missing is not friendly to investors. While MasterCard strangely sits near all-time highs with a market cap of $112 billion, the prospects for the company and industry are lower than previous expectations.With the momentum trade still on, shareholders can continue riding the stock higher. The key is to understanding that the trend is set to end and position the portfolio to act accordingly when it happens."
3379415,39551,2015-07-30T19:11:44-04:00,"MA is well positioned to capture the secular growth in transaction volumes;
        The current valuations reflect a return to higher top-line growth;
        Both China and Europe remain interesting opportunities for MA.","It's not surprising that MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) held up well following its largely average quarterly results. I think this is more due to the increasingly positive investor sentiment in payments and also because most of the headwinds the company is facing should be limited to 2015. I believe in the financial technology space, investors should focus on long-term secular driven stories that provide solid organic growth with opportunities for margin expansion. MasterCard is one of these stories.MA is well positioned to capture the secular growth in transaction volumes as cash payments transition to plastic, mobile, and e-commerce payments. While I agree mobile payments are immaterial in the near-term, the company is well positioned to benefit in the future from its joint ventures in developing both e-commerce and mobile payments domestically and internationally.The Valuation DebateA large part of the debate surrounding card networks remains on valuations. Some argue that over the past several years, multiples have expanded without any significant improvement in overall payment volumes. But such an argument ignores many positive events of the past few years, including the launch of Apple Pay and many other mobile payment schemes, news that China will finally open its market to competition, and resolution of several regulatory and legal overhangs. MA is trading at a forward P/E of 24.0. I believe valuations are reflecting a return to higher top-line growth as the necessary standards underpinning mobile payments have taken shape, increasing the prospects for further displacement of cash as a payment medium.I believe with increased clarity on regulation and litigation, secular growth outside the U.S., efforts to take market share in the U.S., and ability to surgically increase prices, MA's forward multiple should be able to hold at current levels. International card usage remains low compared to the U.S. usage; and over the intermediate term international volume growth should continue to outpace domestic card spending.And Growth OpportunitiesDespite macro concerns, MA's European volumes have held up well. Europe represents approximately 40% of MA's international volume and about one-quarter of total purchase volume. Both China and Europe remain interesting opportunities for MA; however, the increased run rate for expenses reflects MA beginning to invest more into China to position for issuer, acceptance, and processing opportunities after the recently introduced regulations. The distributed platform should position MA well for on-soil requirements.Acquisitions have also played a larger role in MA's strategy more recently, particularly in the data analytics and cyber security sectors. The company's recent acquisitions provide unique payment and digital opportunities. The transactions are contributing approximately 2 percentage points to revenue growth in 2015 but are $0.11-$0.13 dilutive to EPS. Excluding the dilution and FX, MA would reach the current 20% EPS three-year CAGR target.In order to expand its business as well as existing products, MasterCard plans to continue to pursue acquisitions that make strategic sense. The company has about $2 billion remaining on its existing share repurchase authorizations. Given the high free cash flow generation of the business, MA can be flexible in returning capital as well as pursuing any acquisition opportunities that may develop.Largely Encouraging ResultsMA reported 2Q15 adjusted EPS of $0.85, in-line with consensus estimates of $0.85. While results were in line with management's expectations, rebates, operating expenses, and FX weighed on the quarterly results. The headline results were adjusted for $44 million of after-tax expense related to the U.K merchant litigation. Lower than expected revenues due to weaker gross domestic and cross-border volumes were offset by slightly lower core expenses. Excluding the negative impact from FX, fundamentals remained strong, with transaction growth of 13% and Y/Y GDV growth of 13%.Cross-border volume growth of 17% Y/Y remains strong but decelerated from 19% growth in 1Q15. As I said earlier, despite the challenging environment, operating trends during the quarter were very encouraging. It is important to mention here that 2015 is largely a transition year for MA as the company grapples with a number of items such as deconversions, front-loaded rebates and incentives, FX headwinds as well as lower gas prices that are impacting net revenue growth.ConclusionWhile I believe a mixed global consumer spending backdrop and near-term headwinds will weigh on shares in the near-term, I believe in the long-term MA's defensive model is aided by favorable secular trends and operating leverage. In the midst of challenges, the company continues to register strong transaction growth. MA's strong growth and returns warrant a substantial valuation premium to the financial technology group and the broader market and screen well against other high growth/high return/ models. Long MA."

MasterCard is a technology company in the payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments and businesses, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks. On April 29, 2015, the company reported first-quarter earnings of $0.89 per share, which beat the consensus of analysts' estimates by $0.09. In the past year, the company's stock is up 25.94% and is beating the S&P 500, which has gained 6.71% in the same time frame.The European Union recently filed antitrust charges against the company, and it was this bit of news that made me want to evaluate the stock on a fundamental, financial and technical basis to see if it's worth adding shares of the stock right now for my portfolio.FundamentalsThe company currently trades at a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 29.38, which is fairly priced, but I mainly like to purchase a stock based on where the company is going in the future as opposed to what it has done in the past. On that note, the 1-year forward-looking P/E ratio of 23.33 is currently fairly priced for the future in terms of the right here, right now. The 1-year PEG ratio (1.55), which measures the ratio of the price you're currently paying for the trailing 12-month earnings on the stock while dividing it by the earnings growth of the company for a specified amount of time (I like looking at a 1-year horizon), tells me that the company is fairly priced based on a 1-year EPS growth rate of 18.91%. The company has great near-term future earnings growth potential with a projected EPS growth rate of 18.91%. In addition, MA has great long-term future earnings growth potential with a projected EPS growth rate of 17.45%.FinancialsOn a financial basis, the things I look for are the dividend payouts, return on assets, equity and investment. The company pays a dividend of 0.67% with a payout ratio of 20% of trailing 12-month earnings while sporting return on assets, equity and investment values of 25.5%, 58.3%, and 44%, respectively, which are all respectable values. Because I believe the market may get a bit choppy here and would like a safety play, I don't believe the 0.67% yield of this company alone is good enough alone for me to take shelter in for the time being. The company has been increasing its dividends for the past four years.The really high return on assets value (25.5%) is important because it is a measure of how profitable the company is relative to its assets, telling us how efficient a management team is at using its assets to generate earnings (for comparison purposes, MasterCard has the second highest ROA in the credit services industry, out of 47 companies).The really high return on equity value (58.3%) is an important financial metric for purposes of comparing the profitability, which is generated with the money shareholders have invested in the company to that of other companies in the same industry (for comparison purposes, MasterCard has the fourth highest ROE in the credit services industry, out of 47 companies).The really high return on investment value (44%) is an important financial metric because it evaluates the efficiency of an investment that a company makes, and if an investment doesn't have a positive ROI, then the investment should not be made (for comparison purposes, MasterCard has the highest ROI in the credit services industry, out of 47 companies).TechnicalsLooking first at the relative strength index chart [RSI] at the top, I see the stock is in middle-ground territory with a current value of 58.52. I will look at the moving average convergence-divergence [MACD] chart next. I see that the black line is about to cross above the red line with the divergence bars increasing in height, which tells me bullish momentum is about to start mounting in the name. As for the stock price itself ($95.50), I'm looking at $98.54 to act as resistance and the 50-day simple moving average (currently $93.20) to act as support for a risk/reward ratio which plays out to be -2.41% to 3.18%.Wrap UpFundamentally, I believe the company to be fairly valued now on next year's earnings estimates and on earnings growth potential with great near- and long-term earnings growth expectations. Financially, the company pays a tiny dividend and has phenomenal financial efficiency ratios all around. On a technical basis, the risk/reward ratio shows me there is more reward than risk right now.Though there appears to be a bit more upside on technical basis, I don't believe that it is a good time to be adding more shares to my portfolio. The shares are already in ascension mode, and I'm just going to let my current position ride. But if a pullback happens down to the $82.98 level, I'll be a buyer. I've selected that level because it is the midway point of the 52-week range and is the level that I believe shares will be pricing in value.My Take: HoldDisclaimer: This article is in no way a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned. This article is meant to serve as a journal for myself as to the rationale of why I bought/sold this stock when I look back on it in the future.

(NYSE:MA) may intrigue many investors due to its healthy earnings growth over the last several years. In addition, several qualitative factors make the company interesting. For example, Valuentum recently wrote about the company's opportunities for growth, particularly in the Chinese market. This is a great issue to consider, but one must first look at a quantitative analysis of the company.In fact, Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to determine a potential investment's merits. Here's an updated look at how the company fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.This model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.MA data by YChartsDefensive Investor - Must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 3/7Enterprising Investor - Must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests tobe suitable for a Defensive Investor: Score = 5/5Valuation SummaryKey DataBalance Sheet - March 2015Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryMA Dividend data by YChartsCompetitive ComparisonMasterCard is not quite as attractive when compared to some other companies in the credit card industry. For example, a ModernGraham valuation of Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) indicates that company is suitable for the Enterprising Investor and significantly undervalued at the present time. On the other hand, Visa (NYSE:V) was similarly rated as fairly valued and suitable for Enterprising Investors in its most recent ModernGraham valuation.ConclusionMasterCard is suitable for the Enterprising Investor but not the more conservative Defensive Investor. The Defensive Investor is concerned by the low current ratio, insufficient earnings stability over the last ten years, and the high PEmg and PB ratios, while the Enterprising Investor has no initial concerns. Therefore, all Enterprising Investors should feel very comfortable proceeding with the next stage of the analysis, which is a determination of an estimate of intrinsic value.From a valuation side of things, the company has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $1.12 in 2011 to an estimated $2.84 for 2015. This level of demonstrated growth is in line with the market's implied estimate for earnings growth of 12.39% over the next 7-10 years.The company's recent earnings history shows an average annual growth in EPSmg of around 30%. The ModernGraham valuation model reduces such a rate to a more conservative figure, assuming some slowdown will occur, but still returns an estimate of intrinsic value falling within a margin of safety relative to the current price, indicating MasterCard is fairly valued at the present time."
3286855,24491,2015-06-26T14:29:49-04:00,"China has opened itself up to foreign companies. MasterCard will look to take advantage of a potential long-term needle mover.Masterful free cash flow generation has taken place at MasterCard, and we point to that as one of its best qualities.We love that MasterCard doesn't take on the credit risks like Discover and American Express do.Let’s evaluate MasterCard’s recent business moves and derive our fair value estimate for shares.","By Paul TaitMasterCard (NYSE:MA) has been a staple in many investors' portfolios for some time now, and with good reason. The company continues to be innovative and competitive across all aspects of its business.In recent news, MasterCard has become the first credit card processor to provide tokenization, a new service in data security, with store-branded credit card issuers in a digital wallet. The service will allow retailers such as J.C. Penney (JCP) and Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) to allow secure mobile payments for their credit card holders.Tokenization support is done through the MasterCard Digital Enablement Service, which allows a connected device to securely use its digital wallet for every day shopping or payments. Users can pay when, where, and how they want, and now on the mobile device of their choice. As of fall 2014, there are more than 195 million open retail credit card accounts, representing a large base for the growth of MasterCard's new service.In a separate development, China has opened its bankcard processing industry to foreign companies. In the past, bankcard processing was monopolized by China UnionPay. The industry handles over $73 trillion annually. China's recent move allows MasterCard and competitors such as Visa (NYSE:V) to begin new competition in the country, therefore creating better service for customers. The sky may very well be the limit for MasterCard.These two developments are difficult to quantify in any valuation context, but let's give it a try. A walk through of MasterCard's investment considerations and how we derive our fair value estimate for shares is par for the course in this article.MasterCard's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• MasterCard is a payments industry leader. Every day, the firm's network makes payments happen. It doesn't issue cards, set interest rates or establish annual fees. MasterCard generates revenue by charging fees to issuers and acquirers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related services based on the gross dollar volume of activity.• MasterCard's business quality ranks among the best of the firms in our coverage universe. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders with relatively stable operating results for the past few years, a combination we view very positively.• Investors should expect MasterCard's revenue to grow at a low-to-mid teens annual pace through 2016. The biggest drivers behind that expectation rest in 5 percentage points of personal consumption expenditure expansion, 5 percentage points of secular electronic payment penetration, and a few points from strategic investments.• MasterCard benefits from one of the strongest competitive advantages out there - the network effect. As more consumers use credit/debit cards, more merchants accept them, thereby creating a virtuous cycle. Amazingly, 85% of the world's transactions are still completed by cash and check. This provides a long runway for future growth.• When it comes to the credit-card processing space, we generally prefer Visa and MasterCard, which do not take on credit risk like Discover (NYSE:DFS) or American Express (NYSE:AXP). This shields it from credit quality concerns.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisFrom our point of view, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. MasterCard's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 123.6%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.7%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT.In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate. MasterCard is a solid economic profit creator.Cash Flow AnalysisMasterful free cash flow generation has taken place at MasterCard. Firms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. MasterCard's free cash flow margin has averaged about 40.1% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG.The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At MasterCard, cash flow from operations increased about 16% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 82% over the same time period.In the first quarter of 2015, MasterCard reported $911 million in cash from operations and $31 million in capital expenditures, resulting in free cash flow of $880 million for the quarter.Valuation AnalysisHere we outline our valuation assumptions and derive our fair value estimate of the company. Let's roll up our sleeves and dig in.Our discounted cash flow model indicates that MasterCard's shares are worth between $78-$116 each. Shares are currently trading at $95 and change, just below our fair value estimate. We feel there is slightly more upside potential than downside risk associated with shares at this price.The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's LOW ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $97 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 31.4 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 19.8 times last year's EBITDA.Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 11.1% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 12.2%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 60.7%, which is above MasterCard's trailing 3-year average.Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 6.2% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For MasterCard, we use a 10.7% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisEach fair value estimate we provide comes with a margin of safety, within which we feel a company is fairly valued. Our discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $97 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for MasterCard. We think the firm is attractive below $78 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $116 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate MasterCard's fair value at this point in time to be about $97 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the firm's current share price with the path of MasterCard's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate.The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change.The expected fair value of $130 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $97 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Wrapping Things UpWe think there is a lot to like about MasterCard. The payments industry leader has a cash-rich business and benefits from a powerful network effect. Strong top line growth can be expected through 2016, and if the firm is able to establish itself in China, that growth may be sustained for an extended period of time. Growth prospects otherwise remain plentiful, and its business model generates oodles of free cash flow. Like Visa, MasterCard does not take on credit risk, thus shielding itself from credit quality concerns.With that said, it takes more than a well-run company to warrant investment consideration from us. We would like to see a greater price-to-fair value discount before considering a position in the firm. We've ridden the secular trend towards a cashless society on the steady upward march of Visa's shares, but MasterCard's business model is solid, too. It's hard to go wrong with either one. MasterCard currently registers a 6 on the Valuentum Buying Index. Visa is included in the Best Ideas Newsletter portfolio.PerformanceIn the spirit of transparency, we reveal the performance of the Valuentum Buying Index, our stock selection methodology, in a case study of the ratings spanning September 2013 through September 2014. Higher-rated entities (6-10) have been shown to outperform lower-rated entities (1-5). Past results are not a guarantee of future performance. Thank you for reading!"
3293145,88976,2015-06-30T08:00:53-04:00,"Visa and MasterCard have outperformed the market and created high investor expectations, which they may be unable to meet.The two payment processors are vulnerable to an appreciating U.S. dollar and global economic uncertainty, especially in high-growth emerging markets.While the U.S. economy is improving, consumer spending growth is not fast enough for each payment processor to sustain their high domestic growth rates.Despite its long-term potential, China will not yield tangible results for either company in the near future.Missing investor expectations could lead investors to take profits and catalyze a short-term pullback for each company.","It has been no secret that payment processing firms have taken off since the financial crisis, especially the ""pure"" payment processors Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA). Both of these companies have seen sustained double-digit top and bottom line growth, which has translated to high trading metrics and above-market returns for investors. At a quick glance, both of these companies are well positioned to continue their growth by capturing market share in both emerging and developed markets in the future.I would like to clarify the purpose of my article. I am not disputing the idea that both Visa and MasterCard represent excellent long ideas for those with a long-term time frame; in fact, I believe that both companies have excellent growth catalysts in terms of their financial performance and investor returns. For example, the majority of global payments, and even as high as 40% of payment in the U.S., are currently completed using cash. At the same time, the sheer international size and scope of both companies raises significant barriers to entry, and effectively wards off any challengers. Additionally, since both companies have few capital expenditures and no long-term debt, they are able to return significant portions of their cash flows to shareholders.However, contrary to popular opinion, I believe that the short-run prospects for both companies (meaning the next 1-2 years) are somewhat murkier compared to their long-term prospects. I know that many analysts and professionals regard both companies very highly, and I would not advise anyone to sell their position by any means. Rather, I hope to provide another perspective for those considering initiating or expanding their positions, or for those who have recently initiated a position, in either company.Investor ExpectationsAs you can see in the chart below, both Visa and MasterCard have delivered excellent returns with minimal downside, especially compared to the broader index over the same time period.The financial and market success of both companies has also led them to trade at high metrics in anticipation of future growth and potential capital returns. Their forward P/E ratios of ~27 and EV/EBITDA rations of ~17.5 both exceed the S&P 500 metrics by a wide margin.These metrics for both companies indicate the high expectations that investors have for then. They have continuously beat earnings, while exhibiting double-digit growth, and investors have become used to such performance. Both have become quintessential growth stocks over the last few years, as they have outperformed the market, while exhibiting little downside volatility. Analysts have predicted high-single digit revenue and double-digit EPS growth for both companies as well, supporting these valuation levels.Perhaps no factor is more evident of the expectations for either company than its two spikes in valuation in the last year, both catalyzed by China's decision to open its market up to foreign payment processors. The decision has not yet come into effect yet, and the potential revenue gains are highly uncertain at this point. Yet, for investors, the multi-trillion dollar market offers an ocean of untapped potential upon which both companies can capitalize.However, I believe that these high expectations have opened the door for a short-term pullback if either company should fail to live up to expectations. Because investors have so much confidence in both companies, a shortfall in performance - whether in terms of earnings or potential market expansion - would cause a much more swift and drastic reaction than if there had been low expectations in the first place. Consider the expectations as akin to filling a balloon with air; as the expectations increase, the balloon becomes more filled with air. If someone were to let air out of the balloon (representation failure to meet expectations), the air would escape more quickly from a filled balloon versus an empty one.In fact, consider the divergence between Visa and MasterCard's metrics using TTM compared to estimated data. The metrics seem more reasonable using the forward-looking estimates, which has led many investors to conclude that both companies can be acquired at a reasonable price, while still offering high growth prospects. I agree with this logic, but the argument presupposes that Visa and MasterCard will continue to grow their earnings and capital returns. Compared to low-growth companies with stable earnings and cash flows, this future-based valuation leaves them more vulnerable, because investors could not justify the price of either company without continued high growth.There are two points I would like to clarify here. First, I am not suggesting DCFs and other valuation techniques which utilize future results are flawed. Rather, I am saying that in the case of Visa and MasterCard, investors have used bullish projections to arrive at their valuation, which the companies may not be able to sustain in the short-run for reasons I will explain shortly. Second, I am not intimating that based upon future earnings Visa and MasterCard are valued to the same extent as tech startups like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), whose short-term metrics are far more stretched than either payment processor. Instead, I am staying that Visa and MasterCard follow the same trend as other high-growth tech companies of using potential growth to justify valuation.Short-term HeadwindsOf course, arguing that investor expectations create short-term downside for Visa and MasterCard is meaningless without the possibility that they will indeed miss expectation. As I said earlier, I am not arguing that the companies will definitively miss top and bottom line estimates in the near future. However, I believe that both companies have the potential to disappoint based upon the following headwinds, which threaten market share and earnings expectations.In fact, I believe the most concerning aspect of the headwinds I will mention is that they are exogenous, market-based factors. In other words, there is not much that either company can do to mitigate, control, or overcome most of the headwinds, because they must take market inputs like consumer spending and foreign exchange rates as given. In this regard, though both companies are well-managed and prepared, they may not be able to prevent an investor pullback or disappointment, despite their best efforts.ForexOne of the primary headwinds to both top and bottom line growth for payment processors is the continued appreciation of the U.S. dollar. As international payment networks, both Visa and MasterCard are particularly prone to currency fluctuations, because they process payments in local currency before converting their fees to U.S. dollars. However, neither company assumes direct currency risk, because they convert payments immediately from one currency to another while processing, and are not responsible for covering any currency changes from billing.Though investors have been expecting a stronger U.S. dollar for a few quarters now, forex represents an inevitable and continually unpredictable force which both companies will have to contend with. For example, Visa lowered its initial guidance for revenue growth from 10% down to 8% due to effects of forex. However, in the most recent quarter, the strength of the U.S. dollar lowered Visa's revenue by 4 percentage points and MasterCard's by 5 percentage points. Invariably, these lower top line numbers will translate to reduced profits and less free cash flow.While the payment processors reported top and bottom line numbers adjusted on a currency-neutral basis, I do not believe that this adjustment has much value, because the trend of a strengthening U.S. dollar will only continue, if not accelerate, in the next few years. The two main catalysts behind the dollar's rise has been America's improving economy and the end of QE/rising rates. So far this year, we have already seen the dollar appreciate each time that investors believe that a rate increase is coming, and this trend should become more apparent when the Fed finally hikes its benchmark. At the same time, many of the world's leading economies on which Visa and MasterCard are dependent, including the eurozone, Japan, Australia, and England, are either continuing stimulus program or holding rates at record lows.The impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar is most evident in the payment volume processed by each company, which is the source of all their revenue. In the first quarter of 2015, Visa's payment growth in nominal U.S. dollars was a mere 1.3%, compared to 9.6% on a currency-neutral basis (measuring growth in local currencies). MasterCard's payment volume similarly grew 1.8% in U.S. dollars, as compared to 12.1% on a currency-neutral basis. In fiscal years 2012 and 2013, the difference was at most 2-3 percentage points for each company. Since both companies collect revenue as a percentage of payment processed, it is impossible for these trends not to be reflected in their top line growth numbers.While Visa and MasterCard can claim that their payment volume and revenue increased 4-5 more percentage points on a currency-neutral basis, for example, I question the meaning of this metric. To cite this adjustment for an exogenous macroeconomic change implies that this change is temporary or an aberration. But according to most projections, the U.S. dollar is slated to increase even more rapidly with rising rates and global economic uncertainty. This means that the increases in payment volume are going to continue to be worth less when translated into dollars, and so far, the difference has far exceeded forecasts by the company or by investors. For this reason, I believe that more subdued mid-high single digit revenue growth will represent a ""new normal"" for Visa and MasterCard in the next few years, which will be quite a disappointment for investors who had forecast and expected low-double digit growth.International GrowthAs I mentioned earlier, both Visa and MasterCard earned at least half their revenue from fees for processing transactions originating outside the United States, making international revenue a critical component in their success. Moreover, payment volume, and hence revenue, have been increasing much more quickly in international markets compared to the U.S. market. Thus, international markets have been the drivers of both companies' extraordinary growth in the last few years.Why am I so concerned about the percentage of international revenue from both companies? While part of it is because of forex, a larger facet is because many of the world's economies are suffering from stagnant and/or contracting growth and consumer spending. Europe's economic problems and low consumer spending growth have been well documented (and the region now faces increased uncertainty, with Greece on the verge of default); Japan seems to perpetually be teetering on the brink of recession (despite massive central bank stimulus); China is facing its lowest GDP growth in a decade, as its central bank is cutting rates to stimulate growth (which strongly impacts the economies of other Asia-Pacific countries, where both companies are strong).In addition to slow consumer spending growth, these countries have largely been facing disinflation or deflationary pressures from lower fuel and commodity prices, which is contributing to lower nominal spending growth numbers in their economies.The reason that these developments are so concerning is that Visa and MasterCard's earn revenue as a proportion of the aggregate value of the transactions they process. This means that at the end of the day, both companies need to either:a) Expand the number of cards in circulation (assuming constant average dollar value/card); orb) Have each card holder charge more money to their existing cardsHistorically, the card growth rate of both companies has trailed their revenue growth rates, meaning that their growth has been driven by growth in average dollars spent per card. For example, Visa's cards in circulation increased by 8%, while its payment processed value increased 12% in the company's fiscal 2nd quarter.Yet, with stagnant consumer spending, this growth has (and will continue to) come under pressure, because consumers in these emerging markets are simply not spending as much in the aggregate. Though consumers globally have been shifting transactions from cash to card, this transition will not sufficiently make up for stagnant spending growth. Not to mention low inflation, especially on food and fuel, for which consumer typically use Visa cards, meaning that the nominal dollar growth of gross dollar value/card is likely to stagnate even in local currency measurements. The process has already started: in first-quarter 2015, MasterCard's international growth in payment dollar value/card measured in local currency declined to 14.9% from 16.2% year-over-year.In particular, the Asia-Pacific region is key to both companies because it is largest region (by payment volume) after the U.S., and it has been the fastest-growing. However, from a consumer spending standpoint, the region has disappointed, trailing global GDP growth by 50 bps in 2014. The reason that Visa and MasterCard have seen such explosive growth is that they have been expanding their network in a largely cash-based economy; however, this will harder to sustain, because many of those who can afford to have already purchased Visa or MasterCards. In fact, MasterCard's Asia-Pacific payment dollar value growth rate fell from 19% to 15% YoY, and on the backdrop of economic weakness, this trend could erode both companies' impressive international growth rates. Without sustained rapid increases in consumer spending, it is hard to imagine both companies sustaining such large top line growth rates as the market penetration opportunities become less numerous.Why would this contribute to a pullback in both companies? For one, investors are highly optimistic and are not expecting slowing growth in the most attractive international market. Moreover, many long-term bulls' thesis revolves around the fact that most of the world's transactions, especially in high-growth regions, still occurs in cash (which presents unlimited upside for Visa and MasterCard). Yet, slowing growth in these same economies, like the Asia-Pacific region, would likely cause some questioning of this thesis and open the door for investors to take profits in the short term.The U.S. FactorWhile international markets may be the driver of high growth rates for both payment processors, their financial results are still strongly tied to their performance in the U.S. A big reason for this is that both companies earn about 50% of revenue in the United States, and their margins are higher, thus directly impacting both top and bottom line numbers for the company. Due to this exposure, a small change in their U.S. performance will have a disproportionate impact on their earnings relative to other regions.At this point, I'm sure you are wondering why I believe that both companies U.S. performance may lag, especially in light of an improving U.S. economy, higher job growth, and low inflation and fuel costs. There are two points I would like to make; first, while the U.S. is stronger economically than most developed nations, its growth in this recovery has been frankly putrid compared to its historical record. In each of the last two years, the economy has contracted YoY in the first quarter, and the Fed has again revised GDP growth downward to 1.8-2%, below its long-run average of ~3% (and below the average 5% growth during recoveries). For reference, the chart below show U.S. growth during the recovery.US Real GDP Growth data by YChartsSecond, both companies are more dependent upon payment volume growth in the U.S. than other countries. The card market is more highly saturated, and there fewer opportunities for market penetration in terms of Visa and MasterCard stealing transactions from those previously completed in cash. For example, MasterCard's card volume grew just 1.4% YoY in Q1 2015, which was slower than every other region besides Canada.Therefore, in order to meet the same growth target, both companies actually need the amount charged per card to increase more rapidly each period. Consider a hypothetical revenue growth rate of 5% in the U.S.; if the number of card in circulation increases 1.4%, than the amount charged/card in the same period has to increase by a value greater than 5%. However, because of the law of large numbers, even if the card growth rate were constant, the nominal increase of payment volume/card would have to increase even more each year than before. Effectively, this means that Visa and MasterCard need to continue growing payment volume by rates 5-7 times consumer spending to sustain their U.S. payment volume growth from last year.I feel that this is a tall order for U.S. consumers, especially because consumer spending has been volatile at times, and largely underwhelming. Many pundits and economists have postulated that lower fuel costs would be a boost to consumer spending, but this largely has not yet occurred. Moreover, though consumer spending has increased more quickly in the last year, much of that has been due to higher auto sales, for which consumers would not pay focusing their cards. A better proxy for payment volume on both companies' networks is retail sales, whose anemic growth has trailed consumer spending, as shown below:US Personal Consumption Expenditures data by YChartsIs it possible to sustain the May spending increase? Perhaps, but as the chart shows, consumers have not typically sustained one-month spikes, meaning that the U.S. could be in for slower consumer spending growth than many expect. And even though the economy is improving, 59% of voters feel that the economy is in ""bad shape."" Yes, consumer confidence is near a record level, but even when it hit a record in January 2015, consumer spending and retail sales remained at their previous levels. Consumer comfort has also fallen for 6 straight months now, indicating that additional purchasing power and income do not correspond to higher consumption.This trend has not been lost on Visa and MasterCard, as their U.S. payment volume growth has slowed for three straight years, even with consumption marginally improving. YoY, the growth of MasterCard's payment volume fell from 7.5% to 6.6%, and Visa's likewise declined from 9.3% to 8.3%. Now, investors are expecting these companies to increase their payment volume growth in the U.S., even though they have failed to do so as consumption has risen. With inconsistent consumption results from this year, I fail to see how both companies can ever meet investor expectations, and unexpected declines in retail sales like in the winter this year hold the prospect of severely disappointing investors.ImpactSo how would the combination of these events impact Visa and MasterCard? It is hard to say for certain because neither company has missed earnings in the last few years, which has contributed to building up expectations. At this point, the two companies are victims of their own success, because investors have set the bar so high, based on future growth prospects. Yet, in the short run, these trends all threaten the very growth that has led the companies to outperform since the recession.Though both companies have beaten the market by a wide margin in the last year, I think it is key to examine two spikes in their valuation: one in October 2014, and the other in April 2015. These spikes occurred because of news that China would open its doors to foreign payment processors, which boosts the long-run prospects of both companies significantly. However, if you exclude each of these jumps and focus specifically on the companies' performance based on their existing business, they have only marginally outperformed the market, even with their high growth. Just examine the 6-month chart below and remove about a 4-5% gain from the China news.V data by YChartsSince it is confirmed that both companies have started processing payments in China, they are unlikely to see any more spikes in valuation in the near future. However, if they were essentially market performers with high growth, there is certainly a possibility of them underperforming in the short run under lower growth conditions.ChinaI know many of you are probably asking why I have not really addressed the 800-lb gorilla in the room as it pertains to these two companies: China. Do not misunderstand me, I believe China is an incredible long-term catalyst and will drive these companies to incredible highs in the future. However, for the next year or two, I do not believe it will offer significant returns to either company.Prior to their entry, China's UnionPay had a near-complete monopoly on all transactions processed in the country, processing 80% of all cards in China and 72% of gross payment value. All of the payments routed through China's national bank and 85 state-owned banks had to be funneled through UnionPay.Now, Visa and MasterCard are allowed to compete, but they have to start from square one in combating a behemoth. The companies have no infrastructure to process payments in China, electronic or personnel-wise. They have few relationships with Chinese companies that do not operate outside of the country. They have no member banks and no opportunity to cultivate these relationships in a highly regulated economy. They are foreign players in a market where the government ""encourages"" companies to avoid choosing foreign partners wherever possible.Can these two companies overcome these headwinds in the long run? Absolutely. However, anyone expecting the results to come pouring back from China in the near future is mistaken. The start-up investment required to overcome these headwinds is massive, and they have no existing revenue base from which to start. In my view, this means that any gains from transactions in China will largely by cancelled out by the investment costs of entering the market for the next couple years.ConclusionWhile I firmly believe that Visa and MasterCard are positioned for long-term success, I see them as vulnerable to a short-run pullback, because investors have set the bar unrealistically high. For companies with that have perpetually missed earnings, missing again would not cause as much of a reaction, since expectations were low anyhow.Conversely, since Visa and MasterCard have become the darlings of hedge funds as quintessential growth stocks, a short-term miss would likely cause investors to pause and potentially take profits. In the long term, this pullback may merely be a blip in the radar, but for those with a high cost basis for either company, be mindful that the road may be bumpy and bear less fruit in the near future."

Initiate with Buy.,"Introduction:Visa (NYSE:V) has had a dominant position in the industry for a long time. According to research by The Nielsen Report, V grabbed the lion's share of purchase transactions worldwide at 58% over MasterCard's (NYSE:MA) 26%. MA has turned the heat on V with notable wins over their closest rival. The Nielsen Report found that whilst V grew by 10.1% in 2014, MA grew at a slightly faster pace, at 13.6%. MA also added more cards last year versus V.Nonetheless, I think the move by the Chinese authorities gives both V and MA a slice of the lucrative Chinese market, which should reward shareholders. Between the two however, I think MA has an edge over V. MA is set to announce their results on Wednesday before the market open. I have accumulated and will be accumulating more of MA post-results. I initiate with a Buy.Body:For a sector analysis, read my report on Visa as well. I dwelt at length in the Visa report about how China's opening up will generally lift the tide for players like Visa and MasterCard who can now compete in China after they announced plans to allow for competition.I think some of the risks of operating in China are unjustifiably holding back the stock. Since the announcement by the Chinese authorities to allow for credit card players to compete in China, they still have not released details on the operation in China. Some investors have remained on the sidelines awaiting more details from the Chinese authorities. I think such worries are unjustified given the announcement by the authorities and I think the delay is expected given the Chinese authorities' general caution in such matters.MA steals a march over V through closer ties to China UnionPay. Whilst the Chinese opening up should see both V and MA riding the Chinese tide, MA's closer relationship with China UnionPay means they will benefit more than V. I think it remains to be seen how both will pan out, but having covered the Asian markets, I've seen that nothing is more important than what the Chinese call ""Guanxi"" in China, which stands for relationships. This is of crucial importance for any business venture going into China.MA turns the heat up with notable wins over V. According to company filings and reports from Bloomberg, MA managed to win over Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Target (NYSE:TGT) and BJ's wholesale amongst notable wins.In addition, MA also issued more cards than V last year. In FY14, MA added a total of 52 million US debit and credit cards vs. the 35 million from V. MA's aim to shake up the scene has started to gather fruit and should continue in the future. I am positive on management's efforts.Transactions AnalysisThis is not to say however that MA is much more superior vs. V. According to both company's filings, V's purchase transactions is 59.2% more than MA, even though MA's transaction growth rates outpace that of V, 14% vs. 11%.Rebates and IncentivesSimilar to my article on V, I dwelt at length on the common focus by investors on the rebates and incentives given by both MA and V.Source: Company filingsAs seen above, MA is able to increase their card volume growth faster than that of the rebates and incentives given which should give investors comfort. I think investors should continue to monitor this development closely as they begin expansion into China.Company's Strengths:FinancialsMA's revenue has been growing strongly from FY12 to FY14, up 13.2% CAGR. From FY14 to FY16, they are forecasted to grow more conservatively at a Bloomberg forecasted 7.9% CAGR, which represents fairly low hanging fruit in my opinion, and should see them easily beat consensus estimates.Source: BloombergStrong Recurring Free Cash FlowAnother key strength of the company is their strong recurring free cash flow (FCF). From FY10 to FY14, FCF grew by 18.6% CAGR. Similar to V, I think investors can look forward to higher dividend payouts in the longer term but this is unlikely in the near term.Source: BloombergThe expansion into China carries with it certain risks and management is right to be prudent and cautious about their cash utilization. The strong monopoly power that China UnionPay has established in China means that the competition to enter the Chinese consumer's wallet is likely to require substantial cash burn.ValuationsBased on last Friday, 24th July 2015 close, MA will not come cheap to new investors. At 28x-29x trailing P/E, investors are pricing MA and V close together. However, as I have established above, I think MA deserves a slight premium over V given recent developments.Source: BloombergMA is also trading at a relatively undemanding 23-24x P/E for forward FY16. I reiterate my Buy call.Conclusion:Consensus estimates for the results due later is for MA to report earnings of $0.85/share on revenue of $2.41 billion. I am expecting MA to beat earnings expectations. I reiterate my Buy call on MA."
3128516,22148,2015-05-02T13:03:42-04:00,MasterCard reported mixed results for Q1 2015.The majority of the earnings beat was based on a substantially lower effective tax rate.The valuation of MasterCard remains stretched for a company with limited operating income growth.,"Investors reading my work know that I'm not bullish on a company with volumes growing around 10%, margins at very high levels that attract competition and valuations suggestive that growth is double the current level. Those are the general numbers that MasterCard (NYSE:MA) offers investors with the last quarter not providing any improvements on that theme.For Q1, MasterCard reported mixed results with an earnings beat and a revenue miss. Investors initially cheered the results, sending the stock to new highs before the enthusiasm soured. The reality is that the payments processor trades at 26x current earnings estimates, but the company produced the following less than stellar numbers:The original headline number that caught the markets attention was the supposed earnings beat by $0.09. In reality, all of the beat was due to the lower effective tax rate that the company forecasts jumping back up to 28% for the full year. Without the tax benefits, earnings were only $0.79 per share. Analysts forecast limited EPS growth over the next two quarters.Source: Yahoo Finance analyst estimatesA lot of investors will point to the currency impacts that reduced the revenue levels from an 8% growth rate adjusted for currency. Offsetting that though were the benefits to operating expenses that pushed expenses down by four percentage points. The reported number was a 1% decrease, but adjusted for currency expenses would've grown 3%.Ultimately, a lot of the currency issues offset, leading to the 5% gain in operating income. Not many stocks are worth 26x earnings estimates when operating income is seeing limited growth.MA PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsThe key takeaway is that MasterCard is producing growth somewhere in the 10% range when removing the currency impacts. It is very difficult to justify paying higher values for the payments processor based on that growth. Not to mention, the theme continues that a lot of work is being done by competitors and customers to replace or bypass the company in the whole payments processing system to avoid the fees.MasterCard is great company, but it doesn't offer the growth to justify the current valuation."

One day, the wolf found a sheared sheep’s hide and used it to disguise himself as a sheep. The wolf in sheep’s clothing slid right into the shepherd’s flock, undetected, where he remained, picking off sheep to his heart’s content without anyone knowing he was the cause of the thinning flock. At least for a while.The lesson learned: Keep your eyes peeled since you never know who might be hiding in plain sight waiting to eat you as lunch.That’s a lesson that’s pretty relevant when assessing the payments field of play and trying to figure out who’s actually competing with whom – on any number of fronts.To show you one example of what I mean, try your hand at this multiple choice test.Q: Who on this list has the biggest potential to destroy the existing online advertising business model?A: Yahoo (YHOO)B: Bing (NASDAQ:MSFT)C: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)D: Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)E: The Card NetworksA: Now because this article is on PYMNTS, you’ve probably figured out that the answer I am looking for is “E” – the card networks. And you’d be right. But you might not entirely know why. The card networks, and Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) in particular, are making (and have made) a series of investments to create offers and promotions ecosystems. These ecosystems make it possible for merchants with offers and consumers with network-branded cards to be connected, via issuers, through their relationships with card-linked offers platforms. Other innovators with data assets and mobile payments assets and technology enablers can all play along too, by connecting to the card networks, the merchant or issuers.And mobile is now bringing it all to life.Visa’s exclusive deal with edo Interactive and acquisition of TrialPay, and MasterCard’s purchase of Truaxis and its bid to acquire Applied Predictive Technologies, along with their APIs that expose those assets, are just a few examples of the tools and technologies they are leveraging to make it possible for such an ecosystem to exist and flourish.If you’re a merchant, that probably sounds like it could be a pretty sweet thing to be a part of. In theory, this ecosystem gives merchants the means to efficiently target and convert a qualified buyer without having to organize it all themselves and without too much of an integration hassle. And since in order to receive an offer, a consumer has to opt-in, merchants get the chance to pitch their offers to a qualified buyer – or at least one that has a strong intention to buy from them. And see and be reminded of the existence of offers via their mobile devices.Giving merchants an efficient way to distribute offers to, in theory, motivated buyers with the tools in hand to make them more accessible, and who also have the means and the tools to pay (a credit card), is what could ultimately mean a world of hurt for the traditional ad-based search engine businesses which are all about dishing up ads for products and offers, and hoping to get consumers to click.I started thinking about this after speaking with the new CEO of edo, Souheil Badran, last week. Among other things, I was curious to ask him about his plans for edo since card-linked offers haven’t exactly set the world on fire. They’ve been around for a while, kind of slogging along. edo, in fact, Badran reminded me, has been in existence for seven years.The results have seemed pretty unremarkable, I think, for a couple of reasons.One, the offers themselves are pretty generic and often not even linked to purchase behavior. My Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) offers portfolio is about as unconnected to my spending patterns as it gets – mostly because for big purchases I use my credit card and what Bank of America sees via my online checking account and my debit card is pretty lackluster. That’s why most of the ads I get are for things I could care less about: car washes, fast food and oil changes.But offers linked to the credit card platforms that get the bulk of my spending still miss the mark in my opinion, too. I’ve linked one of my cards to a few merchant offers – which I’ve done when prompted – and then I promptly forget that I did. That means that the act of linking my card to a merchant doesn’t drive my spending. Most of the time, the merchants I link my card to are merchants that are on my short list already. So, my opting-in hasn’t shifted my spending at that merchant – if anything it could even cost more for a merchant I already use and use often to serve me.Then, and perhaps worst of all, the “surprise and delight” associated with redeeming my card-linked offer is missing. The first time that I’m reminded that I got a benefit from that merchant is when I view my statement, some days and weeks after my shopping experience happened. There is no virtuous circle created of me being reminded of the existence of a card-linked offer opportunity and any other trigger — location, past purchase history, new merchandise received at the merchant, and/or new experiences in the store — that might get me in there to spend in the first place and then a thank you and reminder to spend again the first chance I get.But the more that Badran and I chatted about the card-linked offers space, its pitfalls to date, the potential for the future, and the impact of mobile on card-linked offers overall, it suddenly dawned on me that the mashing up card-linked offers’ platforms with the card networks has the potential to create an entirely new ecosystem that could turn the notion of ad platforms on its head.And turn card networks into powerful competitors to everyone else who is hoping to make a living serving ads to consumers (and hoping that those who click on ads become customers).Just incase you need more convincing.First, the product discovery process has been massively disrupted. The search for the products that consumers might like to buy doesn’t start via a search done on Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) the way it once did. In fact, as I wrote a few weeks ago, more than half of consumers start somewhere else: favorite/known merchant sites, aggregator sites that drive traffic to merchant sites, social networks or marketplaces. Time-pressed consumers with mobile phones and access to the Internet on a variety of connected devices now have gobs of alternatives that allow them to avoid the looking-for-stuff-in-one-place-and-then-hopping-all-over-the-place-to-actually-make-the-purchase dance that used to typify the consumer’s path to purchase. That, of course, varies by what consumers are buying, but the numbers tell the story of how consumers have shifted their buying behaviors — all because they want to eliminate the friction associated with shopping and buying — and making sure that they get a good deal in the process.Second, for consumers to care about card-linked offers – or any offer – they need to be good offers at the great merchants they care about and want to buy from. And that’s all about scale and distribution. Thousands of issuers enabling billions of cardholders will attract lots of merchants with great offers who want to reach them. Lots of merchants with great offers will attract lots of consumers that will attract lots more merchants and merchant offers. The card-linked offers platforms are the intermediaries that link issuers with cardholders to merchants that want them. Card networks can make that happen for them at scale – and just keep the virtuous ecosystem circle alive and kicking.Third, card-linked offers eliminate a few big headaches for merchants and cardholders and innovators. Coupons, even the digital ones, become a quaint relic as everything simply gets pegged to the consumer’s card account. Consumers don’t have to remember to clip coupons – or save them. Merchants don’t need to worry about the pain and agony of redemption. Cards (or accounts), in essence, become the enabling platform for offers and promotions and how they are redeemed — full stop — saving everyone time and money while adding a ton of value to the consumer.Fourth, and perhaps most compelling, is the potential to increase conversions – and merchant sales. People who know this stuff say that Ad Sense conversion rates range from ~2 percent on the low end to ~5.6 percent on the high end. But that’s just conversion defined by clicking on an ad. The percent of consumers who then go on to buy is a fraction of that fraction. Card-linked offers platforms today say they have the ability to deliver relevant offers based on purchase history and current purchase patterns in real-time. And, match merchants and offers to consumer profiles and even message consumers when an offer has been redeemed to engage them and create the virtuous circle that can incent future behavior. And have the heft to get merchants to craft unique offers that match consumers with specific tastes and behaviors with offers that will not only get more to opt-in in the first place, but convert later on.And, therefore, make it way more attractive for merchants to shift their time, money and attention away from traditional ad platforms to those that are more connected to consumer preferences, not to mention what they’ve actually done.The reality, however, is a bit distant from the picture that I just painted.But stepping back and looking at the puzzle pieces that have been assembled by two of the most powerful players in payments – Visa and MasterCard – suggests that what’s to come might not be too far off – or away.It appears that what’s taking shape is the development of a rich and robust ecosystem of card-linked platforms, offers, and innovators that they enable, enrich and scale.So, don’t be too surprised when one day the existing online ad networks wake up to find that some of their most valuable flock of advertisers and brands have been led away by another network. That’s a network disguised as payments but is in reality a more robust, relevant and ROI-rich sales network for merchants.If, that is, they can deliver a proposition that gets enough consumers to opt-in in the first place and then motivates them to use it as part of their ongoing shopping and buying experience. Otherwise they just become another thing that merchants have to support without any incremental upside."
3125316,86396,2015-04-30T18:53:27-04:00,Their incredible money-making business model.Poof in the pudding: 1 billion in total sales for first quarter 2015 and a soaring operating margin.What I will keep my eyes on for quarters and years to come.,"The incredible Money-Making business modelI purchased shares of MasterCard (NYSE: MA) less than a year ago (back in July of 2014 to be exact) and the stock is already up over 20%. One of the factors that attracted me the most to researching this particular company for a possible investment is their profitable business model. In a nutshell, the way this company makes money is by charging various types of fees to merchants (some of which are explained in the next section) including getting a percentage of transactions each and every time someone swipes their credit card or debit card with a MasterCard or Maestro logo in it (same goes for Visa (NYSE: V) and other card transaction companies in the market).The best part of it all, in my opinion, is that companies in the card transaction space carry no credit risk whatsoever. In other words, their only job is to facilitate the transactions from merchant to customer and collecting a percentage of said transaction. Whether or not you pay your credit card bill at the end of the month- or ever- is irrelevant.My investing style, besides being for the long term, also likes to focus on companies that participate in industries with very few competitors. As most of us know, the space of card-transactions has four main contestants: Visa, MasterCard, American Express (NYSE:AXP), and Discover (NYSE:DFS). As per a study by cardhub.com, MasterCard owned 30.8% in market share as of December 2013, following Visa's leadership with a 49.3%, based on number of cards in circulation by the end of 2013. To clarify, I am talking specifically about companies within the industry of payment transactions that involve a credit or debit card number.Popular technologies in this space which eliminate the use of cards, such as PayPal (PAYPL), are not to be ignored. However, it looks like there is space for both methods of payments (or receiving payments) within this industry and the use of cards or credit card numbers remains at the forefront. As per first quarter of 2015, there were 162.2 million of registered PayPal users worldwide. Although a growing number, is still not close to the billions of people with credit or debit cards. Even popular emerging developments such as ApplePay (NASDAQ:AAPL) still require the user to register a credit card number in order to be able to pay with their phone. As the culture of ApplePay (and similar technologies) grows, so should the amount of card transactions. Hence, making companies like MasterCard that much more profitable.First quarter earnings 2015: Success across the boardMasterCard reported earnings for first quarter 2014 on 4/29/15. Another successful earnings call reinforces their powerful business model with no signs of slowing down. Below I list the parts of the call that I believe to be most notable. *The results below are adjusted for foreign currency exchange headwinds.The successful net revenue results were attributed in part to the following factors:Source.Final thoughts: What I'll be keeping my eye on & a few words on valuationI plan to hold MasterCard stock for many years but as with all other stocks in my portfolio, I will keep a close eye on how they continues to succeed in their space. I'll specifically continue taking a look at the following:It'll also be imperative to keep a close eye on companies that do not rely on credit card numbers to allow customers to make transactions, such as PayPal. I'll be mostly interested on trends where individuals choose the PayPal route and whether or not this technology, or similar types of technology, take away market share from companies MasterCard at any point in the future.In regards to valuation, many may argue that MasterCard is expensive with a current P/E of 29.3% and 5-year MA P/E of 23.7%. The company is not cheap by any means, and well above the S&P500 industry average of ~17%. However, when I have the utmost confidence in a company's operations and the company has demonstrated strong past performance as well as clear plans for continuous growth and success, valuation is not something I necessarily put much weight on. Valuation is an important metric to look at, however, as long term investors there are many other factors to look at that sometimes say a lot more than numbers.Tell me, what are your thoughts on MasterCard? What do you think of the competition that comes from companies like PayPal? Looking forward to this discussion."
3189246,44001,2015-05-17T00:05:47-04:00,I subtracted MasterCard because the company no longer meets my criteria for earnings growth in a financial company.I added Bristol-Myers because I believe the company has a vote of confidence from the big investors.The growth portfolio is up 6.38% this year against the 3.1% gain in the S&P 500.,"Back in December 2014 I decided that I wanted a portfolio strictly for high flying high growth stocks and added Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) as the first stock in the portfolio. Since that time the portfolio has grown as high as 26 positions and is up 6.38% for 2015 compared to the 3.1% gain in the S&P 500. The intention of this portfolio is to be liquid, or for short-term investments.Almost on a weekly basis I've been making moves in this portfolio, either by adding a stock or removing. After breaking out my screens into the different sectors I adjust my search criteria within each sector. First and foremost I look for companies which are midcaps or larger (over $2 billion), have been profitable over the past year, and depending on the sector usually double digit earnings growth rates for the short- and near-term earnings expectations (except for utility stocks). This past week I sold MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and bought Bristol-Myers (NYSE:BMY). I'd like to give a quick synopsis of it right now and provide an update for the entire portfolio.MasterCardThe stock appears to be fairly valued on next year's earnings estimates and on earnings growth potential, and has great near- and long-term earnings growth expectations. The company pays a tiny dividend which is well covered by trailing earnings (20%) and free cash flow (17%) and has exceptional returns on assets, equity, and investment. The reason I got out of the stock was because I recently upped my requirement for earnings growth potential from financial companies and MasterCard no longer passes my criteria.Bristol-MyersThe stock appears to be fairly valued on next year's earnings estimates and expensive on earnings growth potential, but has great near- and long-term earnings growth expectations. The company pays a decent dividend which isn't covered by trailing earnings (110%) and free cash flow (92%). The reason I got in the stock was because after the recent selloff in the biotech space I noticed that this was the one name that didn't really sell off, which tells me that the big investors have lots of confidence in these guys going forward. Boutique firm Berenberg recently initiated coverage on the name with a ""hold"" rating and $70 price target which is only $3 away from today's price.Now it's time for an update on the entire portfolio.Now for some updates on some of the other stocks in the portfolio. On Friday Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shot up 4.5% on the back of news that the company is talking with Jack Ma backed Wasu Media which could potentially bring in $14.5 billion in the next three years.These are definitely high flying stocks with the exception of Dominion (NYSE:D), Mark West Energy, American Tower (NYSE:AMT), and Enbridge Energy Partners (NYSE:EEP). All these puppies are definitely geared for growth in my opinion. So far this portfolio is beating the overall market but the key is to keep tabs on all your stocks regularly as well.Disclaimer: This article is in no way a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned. This article is meant to serve as a journal for myself as to the rationale of why I bought/sold this stock when I look back on it in the future. These are only my personal opinions and you should do your own homework. Only you are responsible for what you trade and happy investing!"

And with plans to grow its international exposure, MasterCard (NYSE:MA) is showing a level of confidence that suggests its profits will continue to pour in.Wednesday, MasterCard, the world's second-largest payments network delivered earnings of 89 cents per share that beat analysts' estimates by 9 cents. While revenue came in below Wall Street projections at $2.23 billion, it still marks a 3% year-over-year increase from last year's revenue of $2.17 billion. And when adjusting out currency issues, revenue would have climbed by 8% year over year. The company continues to benefit from improved consumer spending.While its shares aren't cheap at 29 times earnings, placing a bet on MasterCard here can yield gains of 15% to 20% in the next twelve to 18 months. And that's even assuming the company's global expansion plans hits a snag. MasterCard has been focusing on expanding its presence outside of the U.S. by acquiring smaller companies.What's more important to focus on, however, is how MasterCard is profiting today and the likelihood that its business -- as it's currently structured -- can remain profitable organically well into the future. And its first-quarter earnings results Wednesday, which showed strong growth on purchase volume, or the amount of money customers spent on their MasterCards, suggests that will be the case.For the quarter that ended March 31, MasterCard's purchase volume was $783 billion, up around 12% year over year. This means MasterCard accelerated its purchase volume by 1 percentage point from the fourth quarter, when purchase volumes climbed 11%.This is important because that's how MasterCard makes its money -- by taking a small percentage of each transaction in exchange for merchants using its network. And here's why it will pay to bet on MasterCard now.Research firm eMarker recently predicts that global retail sales to reach $22 trillion in the next three years. As the second-largest payment processing company behind Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard is certain to get a sizable chunk on that projecting revenue, given the rate at which its volumes are growing.What's more, MasterCard should be one of the beneficiaries of consumers saving more at the gas pump and having more discretionary income. The more money people have to spend, the more they will charge their cards and pay at retailers that uses MasterCard's network. And with a 17% year over year increase in profits, the quarters ahead looks equally bright.Consider, as these results suggest, MasterCard is growing earnings at twice the rate of revenue, indicating how focused the company is on its bottom line. And that's exactly what investors should look for in an investment. So with shares now trading at around $90, MasterCard stock should reach $100 in the next 12 to 18 months.Bottom LineThe company's ongoing improvements, coupled with a thriving economy makes MasterCard stock a safe bet. Add in MasterCard's stock buyback program of $7.25 billion, investors would be foolish to ignore MasterCard shares -- something that now looks like free money."

While not a dividend monster, it's a small kicker to the equity appreciation that's taken place over the last few years.Since the financial crisis ended, over the past 5-year period, MA has been the clear winner and ""best of show"" of the credit card companies. It has posted gains of nearly 250% in just 5 short years. Despite this, we don't think MA can keep the momentum up going forward, and we think the company is a little too overvalued here, even heading into rate hikes.MA data by YChartsThose bullish on MA into earnings have argued that the company's addition into emerging markets, combined with buybacks and continued low rates will help justify the company's hefty valuation. We think just the opposite is true. As low rates wind down, assets will move to cash and lending will slow. While we think that over a much longer course of time, MA can be a decent buy-and-hold; it's not our ""best of show"" in credit cards, and we certainly don't want to own it into this earnings report with the expectations that come with trading 21x forward earnings.There have been suggestions that MA is going to be subject to headwinds from FX, the same way that American Express (NYSE:AXP) was earlier in this earnings season. AXP called the dollar strength a ""major problem"" for multinational corporations, and attributed its poor earnings to this.But just a couple of days ago, Morgan Stanley published a note talking about the impact of China opening up competition for bank card clearing services through the country. This would obviously be of a huge benefit to Visa and MasterCard, both of which traded up on the news. They could be expected to begin operations as soon as 2016 or 2017, according to Seeking Alpha. We see this news as priced in.Let's look at what analysts are expecting for the quarter, and how they stand on MA right now. Current analyst ratings are:For the upcoming report, analysts are expecting MA to earn $0.80 this quarter on revenue of $2.29 billion. This compares to $0.73 in the year-prior period on revenue of $2.18 billion. MA is expected to earn $3.47 in 2015 and $4.16 in 2016. This places the company's valuation on the higher end of valuations that we'd consider heading into rate hikes and an uncertain changing broader market environment. MA and V share similar valuations, while American Express is far behind.MA PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsBut we'd rather own AXP than MA. Why?We made our case for AXP in a previous article:To put it another way, we have taken a ""best-in-sector"" approach to credit card companies/processors, and we like American Express as our pick in the sector. We find it tough to own a lot of equities with this type of valuation heading into potential rate hikes (even if there's benefit to credit card companies). Though MA's balance sheet is in good shape, with $6.3 billion in cash to just $1.5 billion in total debt, the company's earnings multiple is too high for us to confidently own a position in today's market climate.We think MA is too expensive into next week's report, and we'll be watching to hear about management's take on global expansion, the effect of FX and rate hikes, and guidance for the remainder of 2015."
3116346,33291,2015-04-29T12:07:32-04:00,"Nearly everyone has, or knows someone who has a MasterCard and there are no signs the company will be slowing down.I discuss the company's recent performance and key metrics which are impressive given the rough macroeconomic climate the company is operating under.On top of it all, the company is shareholder friendly, but there is room for dividend growth.","MasterCard (NYSE:MA) is a company that everyone knows. I myself have at least three credit cards in which MasterCard is certainly taking a cut from all of my transactions. The business model has been absolutely stellar and has only improved over the years as consumers have moved away from physical assets and cash for purchases, to more electronic/fast means. Think about it. When was the last time you were at a major retailer and watched someone write a check? But this is rather well known. What I find interesting is that despite an economy which has very slowly recovered, although today's GDP numbers suggest otherwise, consumers continue to spend. Families routinely pay bills electronically. Some use their cards exclusively to rack up rewards points. Holiday shopping continues to grow annually. All of these things benefit major card companies. I recently covered American Express (NYSE:AXP), which reported some difficulties in its quarter. Thus, I felt it prudent to look into the just reported quarter from MasterCard, whose stock trading at 29 times earnings is right near its two year high (figure 1).Figure 1. Two Year Share Price History of MasterCardSource: Yahoo FinanceIn short, I am impressed. The company continues its slow but reliable growth. Net revenue for the came in at $2.2 billion, a 3% increase over Q1 2014. However, due to currency changes, and a stronger dollar, it may not be directly comparable. Thus if we control for currency the company actually saw and an 8% increase in revenues. This was in large part due to a 19% jump in international volumes and a 12% increase in processed transactions to approximately 11 billion. The numbers are rather striking and seem to suggest a rather robust global economy, although the degree to which folks have moved primarily to using their cards versus cash/checks etc. versus last year is not delineated. That said, global purchasing volumes rose 12% to over $780 billion in the quarter. The company reports that at the end of Q1 2015, there have been over 2.2 billion cards issued.While revenues were up, expenses were flat-to-slightly higher. Total operating expenses as reported were actually down 1% year-over-year. However, as I did above for revenues, we really have to consider currency changes. When we adjust for changes in currency, we see operating expenses were up almost 3%. This slight rise in my opinion is quite acceptable when revenues rose 8%. Total operating expenses were $879 million. This minuscule increase was impressive considering the acquisitions made in the quarter. There was also $11 million in ""other expenses"" reported by the company. All of this led to operating income jumping 12% (currency adjusted) year-over-year. Operating margins were a stellar 60.6%.Factoring in revenues and expenses, the company reported net income of $1.0 billion, an increase of 17% as reported. Once again, adjusting to a constant currency basis, net income actually jumped 24%. This translated to earnings per share of $0.89. These earnings were up 29% adjusted for currency compared to Q1 2014. Wow. I will point out that it would have been even higher except that the acquisitions made by the company led to a $0.02 dilutive impact on earnings.These numbers are impressive. On top of it all, the company is shareholder friendly. It has a nice repurchase program. During Q1 2015, MasterCard bought back 11 million shares for approximately $947 million. Here in Q2, the company has bought back another 2.7 million shares at a cost of approximately $240 million (through 4/22/15). There is still another $2.8 billion remaining under the current repurchase program authorization. The company also pays a dividend of $0.16 quarterly. This only translates to a 0.75% yield. While a dividend is shareholder friendly, I expect this dividend to grow in the coming years. The company can afford it, particularly if it exhausts its buyback program. With fewer shares on the market, fewer dividends have to be paid. There is room to create more shareholder value. Despite the company trading a bit higher on basic metrics, it commands a premium thanks to its stellar performance. I would be a buyer on a pullback."
3191076,39011,2015-05-19T07:31:45-04:00,MA has continuously posted impressive results and the stock has moved higher in sympathy.MA trades at a slight discount to rival Visa despite terrific earnings growth.I think MA will continue to move materially higher in the coming years even if it doesn't achieve multiple expansion.,"Payment processor MasterCard (NYSE:MA) has, like its larger archrival Visa (NYSE:V), shown tremendous gains since coming public. The stock continues to shoot up and is trading for all-time highs at present. The company is growing organically and through new initiatives and analysts are optimistic. Are the good times set to continue or is MA getting a little ahead of itself? In this article, I'll take a look at MA to see if it is still a good time to buy the stock or if perhaps it is a bit expensive at this point.To do this, I'll use a DCF-type model you can read more about here. The model uses several inputs including earnings estimates, which I've borrowed from Yahoo!, dividends, which I've estimated to grow at 20% annually, and a discount rate, which I've set at the 10-year Treasury rate plus a risk premium of 6%.The fair value estimated by the model is $88 which compares unfavorably with the current price of $93. However, the difference is rather insignificant in magnitude, suggesting MA is likely fully valued at this point. Let's take a look at the company's fundamentals to see if that is the case.MasterCard, like Visa, has the distinct advantage over lesser companies of being what essentially amounts to a toll booth. The toll booth allows consumers and businesses access to cashless commerce and for that privilege, MA makes a large amount of money from fees. This is a very powerful business model because it means that MA can produce tremendous scale and margin expansion because additional volume and fees don't necessarily correlate to higher expenses the way it would for a retailer, for instance. The more people spend on their MasterCards, the more MA collects in fees without additional spending.It is for this reason that MA shares trade for a premium to the market - currently 22 times forward earnings - in what is certainly a high valuation. But valuations are only high relative to the growth of the company they apply to and in this case, MA's growth has been and will continue to be spectacular.MA reported earnings a few weeks ago, and investors were very pleased indeed. Transactions and dollar volume both increased at a 12% rate, surely disappointing no one. In addition to huge volume growth, the company posted an operating margin of 60.6%, up 142 bps from the comparable quarter a year ago. That kind of margin expansion is what makes MA such a compelling investment; its revenue base will simply continue to grow and as it does, margins will expand as well as additional investment is not needed to grow. This unique combination of growth and margin expansion is leading to huge EPS growth, and that is why MA shares are up so much and why they should continue that trend.I'll admit that 22 times forward earnings is steep but it is actually lower than Visa's forward PE at 23. Both stocks exhibit the same basic characteristics in terms of the business model, and both are posting rapid earnings growth. MasterCard also has its growth initiative in Africa paying off which should help the company continue to post high earnings growth rates.MA's expected EPS growth should be relatively easy to post given that it should increase revenue by 12%+ next year and that margins continue to expand. I don't think 17% EPS growth will be much of a challenge at all given revenue growth, margin expansion and the company's share repurchase program, which should provide a ~3% tailwind to EPS, given that the current program has $2.8 billion remaining on it. I fully expect that when this authorization is complete that MA will fund a new, larger authorization and continue to reduce the float.I think MA hitting 17%+ in EPS growth is basically a given and in light of that, I think it is instructive to understand what that means for the stock moving forward. The company's current forward PE is 22, and if we extrapolate that out two years to fiscal 2018's EPS target of $5.68, the stock should be trading for $125 in two years without multiple expansion of any kind or EPS boosts. While I don't know that MA will be able to command a higher earnings multiple on a sustainable basis, I am quite confident that given MA's strong EPS growth and initiatives, it will see some upward revisions to its earnings targets. Thus, at this point, I still think the stock represents a great long opportunity despite it being fully valued at present. You're buying a piece of the toll booth of future commerce and right now, it looks very strong despite trading at all-time highs."
2872216,22148,2015-02-02T08:08:46-05:00,"MasterCard beat Q4 earnings based on a substantially reduced effective tax rate.The payment processor hasn't gained in value since the stock split over 12 months ago.The stock valuation still appears stretched, especially considering the ongoing headwinds.","Though the previous prediction wasn't popular with shareholders, MasterCard (NYSE:MA) has struggled to gain momentum ever since the company split the stock last year. At the time, the argument was that the overvalued stock was going to lose momentum following the 10-for-1 split that allowed investors to cash in portions of their position. The stock spent the majority of 2014 in the doldrums following the January split and even now has failed to breakout above that previous level more than 12 months later.While the market was willing to pay upwards of 27x forward earnings about a year ago due to high operating margins and the ongoing global transition from physical currency, the payment processor continues to face a market either wanting to share in the high margins or bypass the firm's services entirely. Either way, the market is having a difficult time justifying the high valuation, and the Q4 earnings results hinted at the start of some troubling growth patterns.Facing HeadwindsThough MasterCard reported revenue that surged 17% on a constant currency basis, operating income was flat unless one adjusts for a 3 percentage point hit based on currency. Due to acquisitions, operating expenses soared 29% on an adjusted currency basis. The main driver of the 21% quarterly growth in EPS to $0.69 was a much lower effective tax rate. The Q4 tax rate plunged to 20.3% versus a rate of 32.0% in the comparable period in 2013.For 2015, MasterCard is only forecasting net revenue growth in the mid-single digit range. The major impact is FX headwinds combined with some slowdown in spending from lower gas prices. The forecasted FX impact is up to 5 percentage points. Operating expenses are expected to grow at a similar mid-single digit range when excluding the FX impact. In addition, the effective tax rate will jump back up to the 28% level. EPS will take a hit from the recent acquisitions of TNS and 5one Marketing, but the total dilution is only $0.04 to $0.05 when excluding non-cash charges.Considering a lot of these headwinds, such as FX, are only short term in nature, MasterCard continues to forecast these long-term goals:These targets for a company with a market cap of nearly $100 billion are the type that attract competition into the sector. A company could make a very solid business with half the operating margins of MasterCard and that's one of the biggest risks to this growth story.Tough ValuationWith MasterCard trading sideways for the last year or so, the PE multiple is more reasonable now. The PE ratio of 23 is still pricey considering the company isn't reaching the stated goal of 20% EPS growth. For 2015, analysts are only forecasting earnings growing 14% and that appears a stretch based on the guidance. Compared to competitor Visa (NYSE:V), the stock continues to maintain a slightly higher multiple.MA PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsAnother sign of a stretched valuation is the limited stock buyback compared to the market cap. MasterCard might have spent $3.4 billion on repurchasing shares during 2014, but that only adds up to roughly 3.5% of the outstanding shares. Even worse, the company only spent $155 million during the first quarter further suggesting a stretched valuation.It's never a good sign when a company makes the effort to repurchase shares, but it doesn't make much of a dent. If the stock was undervalued to the point warranting a stock buyback, a company can easily reduce the share count by at least 5% on an annual basis or more. After all, MasterCard had over $4 billion remaining under the current repurchase authorization.TakeawayMasterCard has a very profitable business model, but it doesn't mean that the stock can't have a stretched valuation. The stock hasn't gone anywhere in the last year and the guidance for 2015 isn't that strong. The biggest fear remains that investors have to pay nearly $100 billion for a stock with annual revenue only forecast to top $10 billion this year. The operating margins above 50% make both MasterCard and Visa a target of the market.The valuation still appears stretched with reduced growth and the eventual reality that some concept such as virtual currencies will remove MasterCard from the payment loop."
3026186,23471,2015-03-25T03:22:59-04:00,"MA is suitable for Enterprising Investors following the ModernGraham approach.According to the ModernGraham valuation model, the company is fairly valued at the present time.The market is implying a 14.04% earnings growth over the next 7-10 years, within a margin of safety relative to the rate the company has seen in recent years.","MasterCard Inc. (NYSE:MA) should attract all Enterprising Investors, particularly due to the company's stable earnings growth over the last few years. That said, Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to determine a potential investment's merits. Here's an updated look at how the company fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.This model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor, who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another company. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.MA data by YChartsDefensive Investor - Must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 2/7Enterprising Investor - Must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests, or be suitable for a Defensive Investor: Score = 5/5Valuation SummaryKey Data:Balance Sheet - December 2014Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryMA Dividend data by YChartsConclusionMasterCard Inc. should satisfy the Enterprising Investor, but not the Defensive Investor. The Defensive Investor is concerned with the low current ratio, lack of earnings stability over the last ten years, short dividend history, and the high PEmg and PB ratios. The Enterprising Investor has no initial concerns. Therefore, Enterprising Investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.From a valuation side of things, the company has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $0.84 in 2010 to $2.45 for 2014. This level of demonstrated growth is in line with the market's implied estimate for earnings growth of 14.04% over the next 7-10 years. The ModernGraham valuation model, therefore, returns an estimate of intrinsic value falling within a margin of safety relative to the current price, indicating the company is fairly valued at the present time."
3056566,85906,2015-04-08T09:03:59-04:00,"MasterCard is poised to grow their customer base through emerging markets and more diversified technologies.MasterCard shareholders have seen their value rise with increased dividends and share repurchase programs.With a growing economy, transition away from cash, and low interest rates, MasterCard has the potential of up to 35% price appreciation.","By Carlos Alcala, Andrew Abernathy, Jonathan Prather, and Tyler GaunttWe believe MasterCard (NYSE:MA) is a value company with very high growth potential. This is rare for a company with such a large market cap and little default risk. We recommend taking a long position in MasterCard due to the following reasons: short term economic growth, increased customer base, both domestically and through emerging markets, and technological innovations in the payment industry.MasterCard offers a wide, global network that connects consumers, merchants, and financial institutions and offers the ability to exchange electronic money. MasterCard primarily makes money through transaction fees, i.e. whenever a consumer uses their credit or debit card sponsored by MasterCard the merchant gives them a percentage of the transaction. Furthermore, MasterCard charges acquirers and issuers a domestic assessment fee based on dollar volume activity. Also, MasterCard charges a cross-border fee based on dollar volume activity when issuer and acquirer are in different countries. Other revenue sources include advisory services such as research and fraud protection. MasterCard currently operates in over 210 countries and in 150 currencies (primarily US Dollar, Euro, and Brazilian Real); this gives MasterCard a global presence and access to several economies, both in developed and emerging markets.MasterCard is in the payment services industry and its major competitors include Visa, American Express, Discover, and Western Union. In this industry there has been a trend towards more regulation and consolidation with the banks, which may lead to less bargaining power for companies like MasterCard. This industry is highly competitive, especially within the emerging technologies like Square, PayPal, and Bitcoin. The industry is also seeing people moving away from cash payments and moving towards cards, mobile payments, and e-commerce). Furthermore, low interest rates are becoming a global norm that will provide incentives to increase consumption. Also, emerging markets continue to show positive growth and are in position to continue growing.There are few companies that are situated in a position for exceptional growth with limited downside. MasterCard has several factors that will allow it grow organically in the coming months and more importantly in the long term. The U.S. economy has grown at an average of 2.32% for the past fifty years. We believe, based on strong company earnings nationwide and historic trends that the economy will continue on this path and allow MasterCard to capture the consumer discretionary space entirely. With this in mind, a growing economy provides the incentives for payment transactions; as the economy grows so will MasterCard. Furthermore, despite global uncertainties there are several opportunities to expand. Over 2.5 billion people do not have a bank account; those are 2.5billion potential customers for MasterCards. The CEO of MasterCard, Ajay Banga, has pushed his company towards providing financial inclusion for these people. This is evident with partnerships MasterCard has created with governments and banks in Africa, such as Equity Bank Group in Kenya. Despite the fact that Africa has historically fallen behind in economic growth, they have skipped the traditional step in cash and transitioned straight to credit cards and mobile payments. Furthermore, MasterCard has invested highly in the mobile payment technology, most notably with Apple Pay. The fact that Apple Pay has captured almost 2% of the mobile payment market in its first two months and has continued to grow since then, shows that it will be a major contender in this field. As iPhone users move away from older models and more merchants begin the transition towards providing mobile payment technology, this market share will increase and with that so will MasterCard's revenues.As for valuation we predict a 22% price appreciation to $106.71. Based on the current price of $87.25, we believe the market has not taken into account all the growth prospects like increased consumer base through countries like Kenya, the impact of Apple Pay, and the move from cash towards other payment technologies. We grew our free cash flows by 13.47% for the next 5 years based on analyst estimates. In our model we used a conservative terminal growth rate of 1.92%, which is the current risk-free rate. With that said, when we used higher growth rates, closer to our estimate of the long term impacts of growing consumers and number transactions, we saw a potential of up to 35% price appreciation.MasterCard is in prime position to take full advantage of a growing global population while maintaining a simple business model and returning value to shareholders. MasterCard has increased their dividends per share around 50% year over year and they have approved share repurchase programs to fulfill their commitment to creating value for shareholders. MasterCard is a company that offers stability in their earnings with consistent dividend growth, while continuing to invest in emerging markets and other technologies to grow their company at incredible rates. We believe the future is bright for MasterCard and for their shareholders."
2874846,67805,2015-02-02T12:42:07-05:00,"MasterCard is covering the world with its services.During the third quarter, the USD started to gain substantially against foreign currencies.Despite handling enormous volumes of transactions in foreign countries, the company's statements for the third quarter showed impressive resilience.The company is trading at fairly high levels relative to earnings, so MasterCard needs to remain resilient to the exchange rates to justify the valuation.","MasterCard (NYSE:MA) has some very interesting international activities. When I decided to start researching the company, I expected to see some substantial headwinds to growth coming from the changing exchange rates. I expected that the strengthening dollar could put MasterCard in a difficult situation if its revenues in international markets were translating into fewer dollars.For investors that aren't familiar with just how global MasterCard is, the following map should help:MasterCard is working hard to blanket the globe with its credit cards, and it looks to me like it has got a pretty good start on that goal. The company appears to have a huge international operation, but there is clearly still some significant room to grow.I pulled up the third quarter investor presentation to check.MasterCard is a huge play on the ""Rest of World"" category. It is the lion's share of MA's revenues and it is the fastest-growing area. Bullish expectations should rely on the company being able to offer robust international growth.Foreign exchange adjustedWhen you see such a huge portion of the revenues being international, it is natural to expect foreign currency headwinds whenever the USD is getting stronger.In the third quarter, the company had almost no change in its reported performance when controlling for fluctuations in the exchange rate. That's interesting, because the third quarter was when the USD started going up dramatically.I compared those results against the more recent performance in Q4.In the fourth quarter, the impacts were significantly more meaningful, but still smaller than I would have expected given the enormous volume of overseas revenue.When adjusting for movements in exchange rates, both revenues and expenses move by 3%. In my opinion, this reflects MA being effective at structuring its costs to reflect its revenues.Charting USD against an indexI pulled up a chart from FXStreet to check my memory on exchange rates.According to the chart, it was during the third quarter that the exchange rate started moving dramatically. Granted, the third quarter impact was not anywhere near as dramatic as the fourth quarter has been, but I would have expected to see more substantial adjustments for foreign exchange rates. From the fourth quarter, we can see that the increase in movements did increase the effect, but MA still managed to control the impact.It'll be important for MasterCard to be resilient to changes in the foreign exchange rate, because the company is trading at fairly bullish levels relative to its history when looking at adjusted operating income, as shown by the following FAST Graph:It is the earnings that really drive a large company. The share price may go up and down with expectations for the earnings, but eventually the earnings determine the value of the company. The chart shows that the company is pushing towards the top of the range again. If the company can deliver solid growth, then there are no issues. If there are headwinds, I'd be concerned that we might see regression towards lower multiples.A great companyIn my opinion, MasterCard qualifies as a great company. I'm concerned that the company, like much of the S&P 500, is looking expensive. However, my expectations for the company to struggle on the impact of exchange rates have not been supported. If the company were priced a little lower, I'd be fairly bullish on the company.In general, I find the payments industry fairly attractive. I expect ""Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay"" to be a bullish factor for the industry because the tokenization technology could reduce the costs of handling fraud. In my opinion, Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard are largely interchangeable from the perspective of the consumer. However, the companies have done a solid job of playing by the oligopoly rules. Both companies are avoiding price-based competition and passing costs on to merchants rather than to the consumers.ConclusionMasterCard is trading at a relatively high level compared to current earnings so it will be important for the company to continue growing its earnings even in the face of weaker exchange rates. I expected strength in the USD to be a slight challenge for MasterCard's earnings, but the performance in the third quarter did not show difficulty from the exchange rate movement. In the fourth quarter, there was some difficulty, but less than I would have expected at first glance.I like the payments industry, and MA and V are my favorite plays on it. I'm not holding either individually, but may have some positions through ETFs or mutual funds. I'll be changing the composition of my portfolio quite substantially. I'm fairly certain that the new composition of the portfolio will hold more of each company through the ETFs I am selecting.Despite the market looking a little expensive, I don't engage in market timing for purchasing ETFs."
2825076,31831,2015-01-15T19:44:48-05:00,"The current cashless payments ecosystem is not likely to have any substantial entrants from new forms of technology.MasterCard is going to continue to be needed, and can't be forced into obsolescence without drastic and highly unlikely changes to our financial system.Competition is going to continue to be fierce from existing competitors.There is however enough room for growth in the market for multiple competitors to all prosper.","New Digital Payment MethodsThis area seems particularly misunderstood by many. On numerous occasions I have seen highly rated comments on Seeking Alpha that touch on this subject, but are incorrect. Many times comments discuss, for example, how cumbersome it is to do transactions with traditional credit cards, and how easy it is with something like Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Pay. The conclusion drawn is that this will spell the demise of companies like MasterCard (NYSE:MA) in a few years.Assuming items such as Apple Pay become ubiquitous, it might spell the end of using traditional plastic cards, but not a company like MasterCard. Apple Pay still has users link their credit and debit cards to the account. They are still needed to help facilitate the transaction. All Apple Pay is doing is replacing the need for plastic cards and their magnetic strips which hold the account information. Apple Pay instead uses a near-field communication antenna on compatible devices (such as the iPhone 6), and encrypted payment data is sent this way. As a payment network such as MasterCard is still used in the transaction, Apple Pay gaining significant traction actually stands only to benefit MasterCard. Apple will be nothing more than the holder of your digital credit card. For a company such as Apple to cut out MasterCard, it would have to create its own payment network-highly, highly unlikely, for reasons I'll touch on later in the article.There are other digital payment methods such as eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) PayPal, which can link directly to a user's bank account, circumventing the need for MasterCard. Despite this ability, PayPal accounts are still largely funded by debit and credit transfers using companies such as MasterCard for security reasons. On top of this the attractive incentives consumers get for using cards would be lost by linking directly to a bank account.Another digital payment method comes from CurrentC by MCX, which is a rather ill-conceived attempt to fight against the card companies. Merchants such as Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Target (NYSE:TGT) and Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) have joined forces, and hope to get more retailers on their side. They wish to fight against the fees paid to MasterCard etc, which are cutting into their margins.Unfortunately the platform is actually a step back for consumers just using their credit and debit cards, and it is extremely unlikely to catch on. CurrentC might solve retailers' problems with paying fees, but unless it improves consumers' payment issues, they have no reason to jump on board. Much like with the option available to PayPal users, allowing consumers to draw money straight from their checking accounts(there is also a pre-pay option), CurrentC restricts sales to consumers who wish to purchase an item covered by funds available in their banking accounts. As the average U.S. adult with a credit card has $5,596 in credit card debt, clearly consumers do not want to be restricted in this way.Other Ways Of Cutting Out The MiddlemanIn the aftermath of the great recession the already highly concentrated banking industry became even more concentrated. A company such as Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), were it to gain even more size could hypothetically cut MasterCard out of the payment ecosystem altogether. This would of course eliminate payments issuing banks make to MasterCard, giving them larger profits-an attractive proposition. But given the lively debate which centered on the ""too big to fail"" issue, further consolidation of financial institutions to any substantial extent is extremely unlikely. There is still talk about many of the large banks being broken up, in fact. Fragmentation requires a company such as MasterCard will be needed to connect all the players in the industry.With the aforementioned Apple, there are barriers to entry which are extremely high, which would prevent them, or any other new entrants from competing with a company like MasterCard. Even in the event merchants could save on the fees paid to MasterCard with something else, the amount of lost sales from no longer accepting MasterCard is something which should make them think twice. Consumers are interested in payment networks which have widespread acceptance already, and with this issuers don't have a strong selling point with anything new entrant. Because of all this, as MasterCard continues to grow, the ability for new entrants to go into the existing payment ecosystem continues to decrease.Direct Existing CompetitionVisa (NYSE:V), of course, has been MasterCard's main competitor for quite a while. There are also smaller competitors in American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Discover Financial Service's (NYSE:DFS) Discover Card. Competition is fierce as they are competing for the same revenue, but it is a mostly peaceful competition even so. There have even been instances of these companies joining forces on some industry creativeness, usually those dealing with security features.There is however an unusual newcomer that might cause some worry-China UnionPay. Because of China UnionPay being granted a monopoly by the Chinese government, and China experiencing strong economic growth for many recent years, China UnionPay has actually surpassed Visa for the #1 spot in global spending volume. This has been accomplished in less than a decade. This national success is however not likely to be duplicated internationally, in my opinion. The international payments ecosystem is complex, with many participants, and it should value the American companies higher, with their higher transparency, better trusted regulations and other positive attributes which they possess over China UnionPay. Many Chinese companies have not found much success expanding beyond their home market.ConclusionLike any company, MasterCard is not free from risks. Items such as regulations and lawsuits could still adversely affect the company. The risks from competition, while not nonexistant, are not especially significant. Given that cash still accounts for approximately 85% of all the world's transactions, there is enough room for multiple companies to experience substantial growth. Even in the event of a worldwide economic slowdown, the shift away from cash to credit and debit cards will help mitigate some of the depressed economic activity and buoy MasterCard's results."

MasterCard (NYSE:MA) has prospered over the years and worked its way through to become the operator of the world's fastest payments network.Source: eMarketer.comThere is a direct relation between retail sales and the revenue earned by MasterCard, as the company charges a transaction fee every time a payment is made. An improvement in macro economic conditions has resulted in lower unemployment, which, coupled with declining gasoline prices, has increased consumers' disposable income. The recent forecast released by eMarketer shows that this will ultimately push consumer spending higher in the upcoming periods. Moreover, this is expected to bring about a positive impact on the financial returns generated by MasterCard, as it holds a sizeable market share of 26.9% in the payment of retail transactions made worldwide.Source: The Nilson Report, 2014Retail Sales Growth QuantifiedSource: eMarketer.com, The Nilson Report, 2014, Morningstar, Thomson ReutersAccording to the forecasts released by eMarketer, global retail sales are anticipated to go up to $28.3 trillion by fiscal year 2018. Based on its hefty market share of 26.9%, I have assumed that the company will be able to pocket the same percentage of worldwide retail payments being made through its credit cards.I have worked back the transaction fee charged by MasterCard against its services by dividing its estimated revenue for 2014 by the share of global retail sales payments made through the company's credit cards. The transaction fee is computed to be 0.2%. Moving ahead, I have computed the forecasted revenue for the forthcoming years by multiplying the retail sales worldwide with the company's market share and transaction fee charged. Thereafter, to remain on the safe side, I have applied the 5-year average net profit margin of 33.52% to the calculated revenue to determine the net income. On a per share basis, the company's earnings are expected to clock in at $3.66 for the fiscal year 2015, increasing to $3.88, $4.10 and $4.33 in the years 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.Entering The Chinese MarketSource: Barron's Asia, Morningstar, Thomson ReutersChina's State Council is in the process of authorizing foreign companies to provide their credit card services in China, which has been lead by China Union Pay ""CUP"" up until now. Currently, MasterCard's cards are being used in China, but the major domestic processing income goes in the pockets of CUP, while only cross-border income is passed onto MasterCard.Although no time frame has been announced, MasterCard is anticipated to get entry approval by 2016. According to the estimates released by Barron's Asia, this is likely to elevate the company's top line by $180 million by fiscal year 2016. Staying conservative and applying the 5-year average net profit margin of 33.52%, the incremental earnings are derived to be $60 million. On a per share basis, this represents an increase of $0.05 by 2016. The financial return is likely to increase in subsequent years, as at the moment, CUP has an established market position in China, and it may take awhile for MasterCard to build its market share. I have assumed a discount rate of 10% to compute the present value of the incremental EPS, which is derived to be $0.04.Final ThoughtsOn the premise of the positive future outlook for retail and the company's expected entry in the Chinese credit card service market, I believe MasterCard poses an attractive investment opportunity for investors."
3112946,41961,2015-04-28T18:08:39-04:00,"MasterCard has strong barriers to entry and deep network advantages which generate strong returns on equity.MasterCard's growth drivers going forward are positive, and the company remains one of my favorite growth stocks.I am positive on the outlook for MasterCard and recently topped up my holding in the company.","I have owned MasterCard (NYSE:MA) stock for several years as part of my growth portfolio. It is now one of the largest positions in this portfolio. I've been watching the stock's fairly static price performance over the last year with some interest, given I am looking to top up my position in the company.Consistent performer with good operating historyMasterCard is one of the major credit card networks in the world, along with Visa (NYSE:V), Amex (NYSE:AXP) and Discover (NYSE:DFS). MasterCard is an almost $100B business, earning close to $9.5B in revenue with very high gross margins.MasterCard's growth since the IPO has been very impressive. Since 2005, revenue has increased from $3B to $9.5 in 2013, a growth rate of 14% annually. Operating cash flow has increased from $650M in 2006 to $4.1B, an annualized growth rate of 24%. MasterCard's return on equity has generally averaged well over 40% in recent years. This is indicative of a company with strong competitive advantages, with relatively few companies returning such a strong return on equity.The company introduced a dividend of $0.01 per share in 2006. This dividend has been increased to $0.49 in 2014. There is likely still significant room for MasterCard to increase the dividend, given the company has a payout ratio of around 16%.MasterCard's total return performance since the IPO has been exceptional. An investor who invested $10,000 in MasterCard in 2006 would have received returns close to $200,000, which is substantially better than the performance of the S&P 500 over a similar duration. A $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 would have returned $20,000 over a similar time frame. Over the last 12 months, however, MasterCard's stock price has essentially been marking time, with the stock price not much changed from where it was in January 2014.A simple, but powerfully efficient business modelMasterCard is a toll taker for the credit economy. Each time a credit card or debit card transaction is processed on the MasterCard network, MasterCard charges the merchants who put through that transaction an assessment fee. This is basically a small percentage of the total transaction value.On average, MasterCard keeps something like 0.2% of the average transaction value. While the merchant is paying more per transaction, MasterCard has to pass on some of this to the bank that issues the MasterCard, as well as to the bank that the merchant banks with.It's a fairly complex ecosystem,where MasterCard takes a small piece of every transaction that takes place on its network. MasterCard also doesn't take any credit risk.Credit card networks have huge moats. It's not an easy task to set up a network, what with needing to have banks issue the cards, consumers to use the cards, and merchants to accept the cards. The network effects are significant and not easy to replicate. It's the reason that credit cards are one of my favorite businesses.MasterCard is riding a number of growth driversWhile MasterCard has enjoyed some impressive growth to date, I'm not convinced that the company's growth journey is over. There are still a number of growth drivers that the company can still ride.Entry into China - China has finally indicated that they will allow bank card clearing by foreign forms. This announcement is significant, because up till now, this has been the sole preserve of China UnionPay. As disposable income increases in China, the average spend per user will also increase, contributing to significant credit and debit purchase volume in the country.Mobile may boost volumes - The holy grail of mobile payments is the ability to deliver real-time offers at the point of sale. Practically, what this means for the retailer is the ability to increase the basket size by pushing consumers relevant, related items to go along with their purchase at the time of checkout. For example, a $1 off coupon on a drink with a purchase of fries could stimulate a larger basket order than may otherwise be the case. Thus for MasterCard, mobile doesn't just mean a shift in plastic to digital payment. If done right, mobile should really be additive to total system charge volume.Tokenization Services - While still an emerging area, MasterCard and Visa have taken initial steps to develop and monetize tokenization services. The essence of tokenization would be to transform static credit card data into dynamic data. Each credit card transaction would be given its own unique identifier that would be for one-time use. Thus, any tokenized data that is stolen essentially becomes useless, as it would be only be applicable to a specific transaction, with tokens not capable of being reused. Tokenization should help prevent the recent spate of credit card data theft that has been seen in places like Target.Limited Risk impact on the horizonThe 3 major risk factors that concern me with MasterCard are the threat of digital disruption, the threat of retail disruption, and ongoing litigation.Digital disruption doesn't strike me as a great concern at this stage. Advocates for digital currency are seeing first hand just how difficult it is to orchestrate a new currency capable of use by consumers and acceptance by merchants. Successfully bringing together both of these elements is a non trivial feat.While retail consortiums such as MCX are threatening to unseat MasterCard and Visa through closed loop currencies, the practical illustration of just how difficult it is to do so is being shown by just how painfully slow it is to bring something to market. The bigger question is, assuming MCX can actually launch something, will it solve a need for consumers and be accepted by them?My biggest fear is the continued and ongoing litigation by merchants against Visa and MasterCard for abuse of market power. Thus far, MasterCard has been successfully settling these claims, and I expect it should be able to continue to do so.Topping up MasterCardI've had a very profitable, but also painful association with MasterCard since the company's IPO. I picked up close to $7,000 of stock shortly after the IPO, which I went onto sell for almost $25,000 a few years later, thinking this was a great return. Regrettably, I didn't appreciate the true earnings power of the business, which continues to be on display today. In any event, I picked another $7,000 in MasterCard stock in 2012, which has grown nicely since.Given my assessment of the growth drivers for the business and what I consider to be a limited set of risk factors, I was determined to increase my holding in the business. I recently added another $5,000 to my MasterCard holding at a price of $89. At a PEG of 1.2, I believe the business is currently trading at a fair price for the opportunities in front of it. Morningstar currently rates MasterCard at 4 stars, while S&P has a Buy rating on the stock.This time, I don't intend to dispose of my holdings in MasterCard at any stage."
2773895,65113,2014-12-22T16:07:07-05:00,"Using the dividend discount model, I forecast a target price range of $124-144 for MasterCard.The opportunities for expansion of wireless payment technologies globally as well as continued development of MasterPass offers unique growth opportunities for the company.I believe that the company will continue to grow dividends and earnings at a rate of 15% per annum.","In my opinion, MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is a company set to see significant growth over the next five-year period. While we are increasingly living in a digital economy attempting to make the transfer to electronic payment means, cash and checks still count for 85% of the world's transactions. In this regard, as a company renowned for payment efficiency and financial security, MasterCard is in a perfect position to capitalize on its ""A World Beyond Cash"" initiative through the introduction of various technological payment mechanisms across both developed and emerging markets. It is notable that while you have seen the MasterCard and Visa logos on your credit card, these companies do not actually manufacture the credit cards themselves - this is the responsibility of the bank in question. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that should companies like MasterCard develop new payment technologies in the near future, your local bank will be sure to adapt. This is increasingly heading in the direction of wireless payment mechanisms. The achievements made to date in this area have been numerous. For instance, this year MasterCard pioneered a biometric payment mechanism in Nigeria which is the largest electronic payment initiative in Africa currently. Moreover, in light of the release of MasterPass in the U.S. and Canada last year, this technology has since been rolled out to a consortium of countries, including most recently France and Russia. I believe that given the market for electronic payments and MasterCard's capabilities in this regard, the company will continue to increase earnings and return cash to shareholders. Moreover, earnings growth throughout the past five years has been impressive, consistently showing an upward growth trend:Sources: CNBCIn addition, Gross Dollar Volume for 2013 showed an increase across all major card segments:Sources: 2013 Annual ReportIn this article, I use the dividend discount model to 1) backtest performance from 2009-13 to analyze the impact of dividend and earnings growth on actual price, and 2) extrapolate findings from past trends in conducting a sensitivity analysis of projected dividend and earnings growth to reveal forecasted five-year price targets. I use a 7% discount rate (as a generally accepted long-term rate of return on the S&P 500 Index).Sources: Business Insider/Goldman SachsBacktestingFrom the period 2009-2013, earnings grew by an average of 23% while dividends grew by an average of 40% during this time. However, it is notable that the majority of dividend growth came at the end of the period. Therefore, I backtest this model by assuming a 20% year-on-year growth in DPS to account for the compounding effect, along with a 23% growth in EPS.Sources: Yahoo FinanceWe can see that the model forecasts a price of $46.84 for the year 2013, while the actual price for 2013 was $51.84 - yielding a forecast error of 10.68%. Using a range centered on both a low and high end of the forecast error, this would yield a target range of $41.68 - $51.84, which would represent a minimum 206% upside from the 2009 price of $13.58, and a 41% annual rate of return.Scenario Analysis - Dividend Discount ModelIn light of the above findings, I now use the model on a forward-looking basis under the growth scenarios of 10%, 15% and 20% growth to extrapolate future price targets:10% scenarioTarget Price Range: $100-11615% scenarioTarget Price Range: $124-14420% scenarioTarget Price Range: $152-176Note that dividends per share for 2014 are left unchanged after the 10-to-1 stock split for the purpose of comparison with past trends. e.g. it is assumed that if an investor held MasterCard and received dividends of $2.10 per share in 2013, the 10-to-1 stock split means he/she would have received (($0.33*10) + $1.10 = $4.40 in 2014. I expect that DPS and EPS growth will be a minimum of 10% annually over the next five years, and this would yield a target price range of $100-116, or a minimum upside of 16%. However, I believe it is much more likely that we could see a 15% growth rate given the prospects in the electronic payments market, and therefore I believe a target price range of $124-$144 is more realistic.Ultimately, MasterCard is a company that has excellent prospects to capitalize on growth in the electronic payments industry, and in this regard I believe a 15% growth rate is not unreasonable. The company has already raised its dividend forecast for the first quarter of 2015 and earnings appear to be on target to meet 2014 estimates. Should the current growth trajectory continue, then I believe a long-term target price range of $124-$144 is quite achievable."

(NYSE:MA) should attract all Enterprising Investors, particularly due to the company's stable earnings growth over the last few years. That said, Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits. The last time ModernGraham reviewed Mastercard, it was rated as fairly valued and suitable for the Enterprising Investor. Here is an updated look at how the company now fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor, who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another company. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.MA data by YChartsDefensive Investor - must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 2/7Enterprising Investor - must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a defensive investor: Score = 5/5Valuation SummaryKey Data:Balance Sheet - September 2014Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryMA Dividend data by YChartsConclusion:Mastercard should satisfy the Enterprising Investor, but not the Defensive Investor. The Defensive Investor is concerned with the low current ratio, lack of earnings stability over the last ten years, short dividend history, and the high PEmg and PB ratios, while the Enterprising Investor has no initial concerns about the company. Therefore, Enterprising Investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.From a valuation side of things, the company has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $0.84 in 2010 to an estimated $2.42 for 2014. This is very strong and an impressive level of demonstrated growth which is in line with the market's implied estimate for earnings growth of 13.6% over the next 7-10 years. In fact, actual historical growth is about 37.62% per year, so the market has priced in a slight earnings drop to a more sustainable level over the long term. The ModernGraham valuation model therefore returns an estimate of intrinsic value falling within a margin of safety relative to the current price, indicating the company is fairly valued at the present time."
2750095,74105,2014-12-11T17:26:02-05:00,,"This week I initiated a position in these two companies -- Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA). As I mentioned in my previous post I made significant investments during October's market panic.There were many companies that were trading at very attractive prices but like any investor, I had to make choices, and at the time, even though I considered Visa to be the most undervalued company, they were offering a very low dividend yield and I was interested in maintaining my average dividend yield around 3%. This led me to pass on it at the time. Ironically, I intended to initiate a position in December as soon as I had capital available. Unfortunately for me, the price increased dramatically on the results announcement combined with the announcement that China would open itself to foreign payment processing services.As I evaluated the current opportunities presented by the market I noticed there weren't many bargains around. Everything I was following rebounded strongly after October. So, according to my analysis, after the rebound, I still see Visa as the best opportunity available.Previously, the valuation difference between Visa and Mastercard was significant, which led me leave Mastercard out of my options. However, right now, I see their valuations as being in-line with each other and so I considered Mastercard as well.In a quick summary, they are very similar companies, they both operate world-scale payment processing networks. Contrary to popular belief, they are not lending or credit companies. Their cards are merely a means for you to execute a transaction through their network, meaning that they are able to use other means to connect with their network, such as web APIs, apps on mobile, and apps and other devices. This is their moat -- a time-tested and already proven acceptably secure payment network combined with the trust already earned with so many financial institutions that rely on these networks. I am of the opinion that it is simpler for Visa and Mastercard to replicate the innovation of others than it is for others to be able to emulate the security and trustworthiness enjoyed by these brands.  Currently, Visa is the bigger player of the two and has a much higher volume of transactions. On the other hand, Mastercard has traditionally been able to provide faster growth. They are by far the two biggest players in the non-paper payments industry.This is an industry poised for immense growth. The advantages of non-paper-based payments are evident and so it is not hard to see that this is and will be a core industry of our society. However, what really sparked my interest was discovering that as of right now, only 15% of all the transactions made in the world are made through non-paper-based mechanisms, meaning that the growth in this space is still in front of us. Even notwithstanding the population growth and the rise of the middle class in emerging markets, there is currently an unserved market more than 5 times bigger than the currently served market. On top of that, no one is better positioned to capture this growth than Visa and Mastercard, which currently hold a combined market share of approximately 87.4%.  Not only is the market large and interesting, but the players in the industry have so far done a wonderful job at capturing growth. For example, Visa sports a 5 year EPS CAGR of 16.54% and Mastercard shows 21.12%. This growth is not forecast to stop anytime soon, as the industry itself is expected to keep growing at an accelerated pace.Looking at their balance sheets individually, they are quite similar and follow roughly the same strategy regarding capital allocation. On top of that, they have flawless balance sheets sporting no debt and a high free cash flow on account of a low capex required to maintain and grow their earnings. Their capital allocation strategy is the following: 1. Invest in maintaining and improving the infrastructure to seize opportunities 2. Pay a small dividend but grow it aggressively 3. Use the remainder of the operational cash on share buybacksThese are exactly the kind of companies I like. They focus on ensuring a safe and growing dividend, sport a very high free cash flow, and have low capex requirements.As shown in this table, they have sported impressive growth coupled with impressive shareholder returns. Based on their initiatives to integrate with new players (such as Apple Pay) and to provide a strong service of mobile and e-payments, I see no reason for this growth not to continue well into the future.I know that I am making this purchase right after a significant spike in the price and I would not be surprised if the shares drop in the short term. But that is not predictable, and I do not attempt to time the market; I deploy cash as soon as I have it available on opportunities that I consider fairly priced for the potential risk/reward they might provide, and that is just what I did.Visa:Stock Price: 262$Dividend Yield: 0.7%Dividend Raise Streak: 6 YearsTypical Yearly Dividend Growth (5yr): 30%Mastercard:Stock Price: 87.58$Dividend Yield: 0.7%Dividend Raise Streak: 8 YearsTypical Yearly Dividend Growth (5yr): 60.55%"
2675635,47391,2014-11-13T17:51:34-05:00,MasterCard is an investor in a Canadian startup called Bionym.Bionym has persistent secure identification technology based on heart rhythms.MasterCard and Royal Bank are testing a prototype now.MasterCard's broadening technology base and willingness to test new concepts make it the vehicle of choice in the payments space.,"Forget Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay. Think about the venture startup supported by MasterCard (NYSE:MA) called Bionym. Most investors have never heard of Bionym or Nymi, but the tiny Canadian startup is on to something quite critical in the race for secure authentication.Apple Pay is grabbing the headlines but not likely to set the world on fire, since iOS devices make up only 11.9% of the world's smartphones, and secure payments affect everyone. Not all retailers are embracing Apple Pay, with 93% of small businesses (video at link) rejecting the concept.Bionym has developed technology that uniquely identifies the wearer of its Nymi bracelet by the nature of their heart rhythm. Take the bracelet off, and it's just a bracelet. Wear it, and it can ID you based on your heartbeat.Source: Bionym Bracelet photo from TechVibes.Medical researchers at the University of Toronto discovered that heart rhythms are as unique an identifier as fingerprints, if not even more reliable. What makes heart rhythms more compelling than fingerprints is that they are persistent identification - that is, they identify the user only if they are present and their heart is beating. Fingerprints, by contrast, provide lasting identification of where you have been and not necessarily where you are; and, importantly, can be copied and, therefore, ""hacked.""If you are wearing a device that can uniquely identify you by your heartbeat and then confirm your identity wirelessly to any other device you may be using, you have the capability for real-time and persistent authentication.The bracelet itself is, in my view, not the ideal execution, but it is a great start. If you can have the technology in a bracelet, you could have it in a smart watch or, as processors shrink further and further, a ring.Apple has already registered a patent for a seamlessly integrated heart monitor for its devices, reportedly conceiving of use of the heart rhythm as an identification method. That level of authentication has many applications that require more than notional security. Law enforcement agencies and intelligence personnel use identification such as palm prints and retina scans for secure access in some places today. A Bionym-based identification system is less complex and more reliable. Police forces could have Bionym identification built into the handgrip of their side arms, making them lethal only when held by the policeman who owns them and useless if taken from them.The security application possibilities are limitless.It should be no surprise that MasterCard is among the investors in this startup. Eliminating payments fraud would dramatically lower the costs of payments processing for all participants in the payment chain. Importantly, a Bionym-based solution would be cross-platform, leaving the user free to choose whatever device they wish to pair it with, and not tied to any particular operating system or protocol.I was fortunate to be able to buy a small holding in Bionym in a recent funding. It is not public yet, but no doubt will take that step when the time is right.I do see the possibility of Bionym becoming a key feature of the MasterCard payments system, with the prospect of tangible benefits to both entities. MasterCard, Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY) and Bionym just launched a trial version of the Bionym bracelet integrated with an NFC connection that is compatible with MasterCard terminals.Source: Business.caOne thing is certain - the payments space will become increasingly crowded. Sooner or later, a Bionym or Bionym-like persistent identification system will become the gold standard in payments, eliminating all need for passwords, fingerprints, retina scans, or documentary proof of identity. The room for fraud will shrink dramatically.The best plays in this space are not Apple Pay or Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Wallet, but leading processors such as Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard. Apple and Google will at best be intermediaries enhancing their operating systems and devices to line up with the established providers and the evolving standards. The company that tries to break away and stand alone will become the next BetaMax - interesting technologically, but moribund from an investment point of view.MasterCard recently acquired TNS payment gateway, adding important secure data links to its network offerings. Earlier this month, it acquired 5one Marketing Ltd. for its data analytics capabilities.Bionym is already shipping bracelets to developers and offering them for pre-order on its website for $79, with over 9,000 bracelets already pre-ordered. Sooner or later, one of the major players in smart-connected devices will want to integrate Bionym technology into their device and toss the less reliable fingerprint scanner into the dustbin. Regardless of such an event, biometric identification has the potential to all but eliminate electronics payments fraud. In my view, biometric identification is an area of innovation in its infancy, but poised for rapid growth. I expect to see developments like Bionym's become mainstream within the next five or ten years.If that happens, it will be bullish for MasterCard."

And while analysts predict that MasterCard will achieve impressive earnings growth over the coming years, the recent gains in its stock price mean that the company now trades at 28 times projected 2014 earnings. Compared to Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard's shares are noticeably more expensive and analysts believe that the two competitors will realize similar levels of earnings growth moving forward. This article examines MasterCard's industry, competitive position, balance sheet and dividend policy to determine whether growth investors should view the company as a worthwhile addition to their portfolios.Please click here to read my article which outlines the DRAG analysis framework in more detail.To summarize, the four variables used in a DRAG (dividend and risk adjusted growth) analysis are as follows (each company is ranked from 0 to 3 in each category): 1) How cyclical is the industry in which MasterCard operates? 2) How strong is MasterCard's competitive position within this industry? 3) How risky is MasterCard's balance sheet? 4) What is MasterCard's dividend yield and dividend growth history?The premise is that a company that operates in a non-cyclical industry with a strong competitive position and a clean balance sheet that pays an attractive dividend should trade at a higher earnings multiple than a company without these attributes even if the lower quality company has higher projected future earnings growth. After adjusting for these variables, it becomes easier to compare companies in different sectors with different levels of future growth potential.MasterCard DRAG Analysis:While consumer spending trends make the credit card processing business somewhat cyclical, MasterCard has significantly less economic sensitivity than competitors like American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Discover Financial (NYSE:DFS) that hold consumer loans on their balance sheets. Growth in credit and debit card usage is significant and MasterCard takes a small fee from each transaction it processes. While the iShares U.S. Financial Services ETF (NYSEARCA:IYG) has a beta slightly below 1, MasterCard's shares have been nearly 20% more volatile than the S&P 500 during the last 12 months. However, this academic research web site shows that the average Information Services stock in the United States possesses a beta of 0.84. MasterCard has exhibited a significant amount of earnings variability during the last decade, although since 2008 (when it lost $0.20 per share), the company's results have demonstrated much more consistency. Due to a slightly above-average beta, a history of earnings volatility and the constant threat of future legal action (which always seems to exist in the payment processing industry), MasterCard receives only an average score for its level of cyclicality.While MasterCard's operating margin is nearly 10 percentage points lower than Visa's, the company more than makes up for this with shockingly high efficiency ratios. As the payment processing industry only contains two major players (three if you include American Express), these firms have impressively strong competitive positions. Barriers to entry are massive in this industry and should allow MasterCard to continue generating ample returns on its invested capital. I contend that this enviable competitive position represents a chief reason why MasterCard and Visa both trade at such premium valuations.Similarly to Visa, MasterCard maintains a pristine balance sheet. Although the company has added $1.5 billion in long-term debt to the balance sheet this year, its cash position of nearly $8 billion dwarfs its total debt outstanding. Shareholders can be completely confident in both the short-term and long-term financial health of the company and this position also gives management the flexibility necessary to make acquisition(s) it deems prudent.Although MasterCard's dividend growth rate over the past 36 months is astonishing, the company's overall payout is still diminutive. Investors are not buying shares of MasterCard for their ability to generate income, but it is positive to see management increase its payout so aggressively. Like Visa, MasterCard used much of its free cash flow to buy back shares in recent years. In fact, the company spent nearly 10 times as much cash on share repurchases last year as it did on dividends. Management will need to raise its dividend significantly several more times before MasterCard becomes relevant to income investors.Not surprisingly, as is the case with Visa shares, the DRAG model believes that MasterCard represents a compelling investment opportunity. At its current price of $86, its fundamentals and growth outlook suggest that MasterCard's stock is undervalued by approximately 20%. While Visa maintains an even more conservative balance sheet than MasterCard does, MasterCard's return on invested capital blows its larger competitor out of the water. Based on the analyst consensus earnings growth estimate and these positive fundamental characteristics, MasterCard should be trading at approximately 29 times forward (2015) earnings, suggesting 20% further upside from its current share price. Yes, this undoubtedly represents a premium multiple, but with forecasted earnings growth in the mid-teens, a return on invested capital above 40% and over $6 billion in net cash on the balance sheet, MasterCard is worthy of it."
2782955,70065,2014-12-28T08:11:30-05:00,"Dividend investors should carefully consider adding the stability of credit card stocks to their portfolio.These stocks have extremely low payout ratios (13-19%) and strong track records of growing dividends.Based on analyst projections, these stocks have ample room to increase dividends going forward.Visa's yield is 25% higher than MasterCard's (0.64% vs. 0.51%), but Visa's payout ratio is 38% higher (13.4% vs. 18.5%), and on this basis, I would prefer to add MasterCard.","IntroductionCredit card stocks offer a very conservative and stable dividend yield that income oriented investors should consider adding to their retirement portfolios. Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) have yields of 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively, which represent very low proportions of their net income and free cash flow. These low payout ratios make them an extremely conservative source of income for a retirement portfolio, and also provide upside potential from capital gains in the future.Dividend YieldOver the last 12 months, Visa shares have appreciated 21.2%, while MasterCard is up 5.8%. Despite the run up, Visa still has a higher yield, in part due to its higher payout ratio.V Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YChartsIf we examine these two stocks in terms of their absolute growth in dividends per share, we see that MasterCard has grown its dividend 500% over the past five years, while Visa has grown its dividend 320% over the same period. This extraordinary dividend growth makes a compelling case for investors who want their income to increase during retirement.V Dividend Per Share (Quarterly) data by YChartsEarnings per share tells a similar story as dividend growth, and hence dividend payout ratios, have been quite steady. On a percentage basis, MasterCard has had higher growth in EPS than Visa, and also a more stable payout ratio.V Normalized Diluted EPS (TTM) data by YChartsV Payout Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsFree cash flow per share for Visa has been more volatile than MasterCard. Visa's current free cash flow yield is 3.9%, while MasterCard's is 3.4% which shows that the market is willing to pay more for MasterCard than it is for Visa.V Free Cash Flow Per Share (TTM) data by YChartsConsensus EPSIf we look forward at what analysts are forecasting (source: Capital IQ), we see that both companies are expected to have significant growth in EPS.Visa10.40 for 201512.10 for 2016MasterCard3.61 for 20154.29 for 2016On this basis, we can conclude that payout ratios should slowly reduce at current dividend rates, OR dividends have the potential to increase if payout ratios remain constant.ValuationIn terms of valuation on a P/E basis, the two companies are essentially equally valued. Visa trades at 30.4x trailing EPS, while MasterCard trades at 29.6x trailing EPS. As shown above, the market has bid MasterCard shares up to a lower dividend yield and lower free cash flow yield, which highlights their lower payout ratio and slightly more conservative profile.V PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsConclusionAfter examining both Visa and MasterCard, it is clear that these credit card stocks offer a conservative and stable dividend, which may be suitable for retirement portfolios. Both companies have demonstrated the ability to significantly grow EPS and dividends over the last 5 years, and payout ratios still remain very conservative at 13% for MasterCard and 18% for Visa.Visa's yield is 25% higher than MasterCard's (0.64% vs. 0.51%), but Visa's payout ratio is 38% higher (13.4% vs. 18.5%), and on this basis, I would prefer to add MasterCard shares over Visa."
2616935,47561,2014-10-30T10:00:17-04:00,"Q3 earnings were announced before the market opened on October 30.
        The results surpassed analysts' expectations.
        The company reported more than $1.3 billion in free cash flow.
        The stock has responded by moving higher.","MasterCard (NYSE: MA), the second largest payment technology company in the world, has just released its third quarter earnings report and the results exceeded Wall Street's expectations. MasterCard's stock has reacted to the news by rising about 2% higher in the pre-market trading session, so let's take a look at the results to determine if we should consider initiating long-term positions today.The Quarterly BeatBefore the market opened on October 30, MaterCard released its third quarter report and the results surpassed the consensus anlayst estimates; here's an overview of the key statistics:MasterCard's earnings per share increased 19.2% and its revenue increased 12.8% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2013; these results were driven by worldwide purchase volume increasing 11.1% and total processed transactions increasing 10%. The company also noted a 12% increase in gross dollar volume and a very strong 15% increase in cross-boarder volume growth.Operating profit increased 13.8% to $1,420 million and the operating margin showed fight, expanded 40 basis points to 56.7%; this growth and expansion can be attributed to total operating expenses increasing just 11.6% during the quarter, including a 1% drop in advertising and marketing expenses, as total revenues increased 12.8%.On a very positive note, MasterCard reported $1,385 million in net cash provided by operations and only $58 million in capital expenditures, resulting in a very strong free cash flow of $1,327 million; the company used this free cash, and the $2,878 million in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet to begin the quarter, to repurchase 5.3 million shares of its common stock for approximately $404 million and pay out approximately $128 million in dividends.At the conclusion of the third quarter, $431 million remained on MasterCard's share repurchase authorization, and it noted that it had already made $121 million in repurchases in the first three weeks of the fourth quarter, so it will likely complete its repurchase plan by the end of the fiscal year. I think it is very likely that the company will announce a new repurchase plan as soon as the current one is completed.All in all, it was a great quarter for MasterCard and its stock reacted correctly by making a move to the upside; however, I also think there is plenty of room left to run.The Bottom LineMasterCard is one of the world's premier payment technology companies and the growing safety and security of credit cards has led it to incredible financial growth. The company announced earnings results for the third quarter this morning and it exceeded expectations on both the top and bottom lines. MasterCard's stock has responded by rising about 2% in the pre-market trading session, but I think this will only be the beginning of a sustained rally higher, as the stock still trades more than 8% below its 52-week high and trades at just 21.7 times forward earnings estimates."
2625405,41961,2014-10-31T17:04:55-04:00,"MasterCard posted revenue and earnings in Q3 that blew away analyst expectations.MasterCard continues to demonstrate the power of a business model that is leveraged to consumer credit transactions.I own MasterCard stock for my growth portfolio which was acquired in 2012, and which I don't intend to ever sell again.","MasterCard (NYSE:MA) delivered a great result in Q3 2014 as far as growth in it's revenue and earnings were concerned. Revenue exceeded analyst expectations and was up a respectable 13% year over year. MasterCard also had a great quarter as far as profitability was concerned, with earnings per share of $0.87, well up from $0.73 in the prior year. The stock was up more than 10% on the result.MasterCard saw strong growth in both transaction volume as well as Gross Dollar Volume (GDV) and purchase volume. MasterCard saw a 10% rise in transaction volumes to 11B transactions. Cross border transactions were also up 15%. As a result, worldwide purchase volume was up almost 11% year over year to $843 B. Of considerable interest was the announcement the same day that China is willing to liberalize its credit card processing sector, which is currently dominated by China UnionPay and from which both MasterCard and Visa are locked out.Overall, this was a very solid quarter for MasterCard in my opinion, and serves to demonstrate the resiliency of the toll taker business model for credit cards. What seems to be occurring is strong growth in international transaction volume, as evidenced by the rise in cross border transactions. Mobile offers potential as a promising growth driver within the U.S. market, and MasterCard's support of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay offers interesting potential. Market entry into China could also be a strong growth driver for Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard.MasterCard's strong result reinforces my bullish view on the stock, and demonstrates why its one of my favorite growth companies. Both MasterCard and Visa have unassailable competitive advantages in the consumer credit markets which provide them with a steady transaction toll. That should lead to compelling monetization for MasterCard over a long period of time. I am happy to retain a core position in MasterCard in my growth portfolio, the bulk of which I initiated at a post split equivalent of $41 in 2012 and don't intend to ever sell this position. In fact, my earlier disposal of MasterCard stock for only a 300% return will likely always be one of my worst investing mistakes."
2573715,74955,2014-10-20T02:29:19-04:00,"Visa and MasterCard both play a vital role in the payments ecosystem and get paid handsomely to do so while bearing little risk.They are both wonderful businesses that benefit from a durable competitive advantage in the form of embedded ecosystem integration and universal acceptance coupled with strong consumer brand recognition.They both also benefit from a secular shift to card-based/digital/mobile payments, strong economics, high operating leverage and a natural index to inflation.There are risks/considerations to both businesses that include pricing power degradation, customer concentration, competition from China UnionPay, new digital payment technologies, potential disintermediation and also lawsuits.MasterCard trades at a ~23% discount to fair value at current prices near ~$71 and thus provides a bit more upside than Visa.","Business OverviewVisa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) both operate open loop payments networks. This is in comparison to companies like American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Discover (NYSE:DFS) that operate closed loop payments networks. To better understand this, it is necessary to understand the complex ecosystem in which both companies operate. The two graphics below (from the Visa 10-K and the MasterCard 10-K) illustrate how they operate amidst the payment ecosystem. Essentially, V and MA act as an intermediary that links card issuers and merchant acquirers to facilitate the processing of credit card and debit card transactions. They act as a middleman that enables all of these institutions to speak to each other so that you can pay for your goods at the store quickly, conveniently and securely and they get paid a tiny fee every time a transaction is made on a V or MA issued card. This is sometimes confusing for consumers, but V and MA don't actually extend credit so they don't bear any credit risk.Visa Payment Ecosystem (from Visa 10-K)MasterCard Payment Ecosystem (from MA 10-K)Other than V and MA, there are typically many parties involved in what appears to be a simple credit card transaction. First, the card issuer - think companies like Chase (NYSE:JPM), Capital One (NYSE:COF) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), who actually issue the cards and bear the credit risk of lending money. They earn the interest and late fees that are paid if the card owner carries a balance or makes a late payment. The card issuers also earn the largest portion of the merchant discount. This is the fee that merchants pay when they accept credit card payments and all the players in the ecosystem eat a portion of this fee. While the size of this fee depends on the merchant type and many other factors, it typically ranges from 1.5% to 2.5%.To exemplify, let's say that a consumer shops at a grocery store and spends $100 on her Chase credit card. Of this $100, the grocery store receives $98 (assuming a 2% merchant discount) and Chase (the credit card issuer) and several other parties split $2 as a fee for facilitating the transaction. The card issuer usually receives the largest portion of this fee because it is the card issuer that bears the risk of the $100 loan to the consumer.One of the other parties involved in the transactions is the merchant acquirer (shown as Merchant's Financial Institution in the MasterCard graphic above). Many of these companies aren't as familiar to the average consumer, but they are an essential part of the ecosystem. They enable merchants (grocery store in the example above) to accept credit cards and include players like First Data and Global Payments as well as some of the issuers themselves like Chase Paymentech and Wells Fargo Merchant Services). These companies typically provide the credit card terminal equipment to the retailers to accept credit card payments and serve as the merchant's financial institution. Essentially, they hold the funds when the card issuer makes the $98 payment to the retailer. They also receive a small portion of the merchant discount.Visa and MasterCard provide the payment networks that connect the card issuers to the merchant acquirers and enable them to speak to each other. They provide the software ""highway"" that transactions are routed on between the two parties and ensure that the transactions are authorized and settled securely. And they collect a small toll for doing so. They do this for credit cards, debit cards and also prepaid cards and the tolls are somewhat different for each.American Express and Discover operate somewhat differently than V and MA. As mentioned, they operate closed loop payments networks meaning they are both the card issuer and payments network. The card issuer typically assumes all of the credit risk of the borrower or cardholder. Thus American Express and Discover both assume credit risk, but also make more money on a given transaction as a result. These are both also great businesses but they do carry more risk in an economic downturn as some consumers default on their credit card payments.Revenue ModelLet's talk more about the toll that V and MA collect from the merchants that drive on their highway.Visa and MA generate revenue primarily from three sources:Both companies also generate other revenues from some additional services and solutions they provide but these revenue streams are relatively small versus the other revenue streams.V and MA also have a contra-revenue account that consists of rebates and incentives that they provide to their card issuer customers. These are often incentives provided to these partners to drive higher payment volume and greater card issuance. These incentives have historically averaged ~25% of revenue for MA and 17% for V. However, these numbers can be a bit misleading because of the slightly different way that the companies account for this contra revenue. I am led to believe that the incentives are likely comparable on a percent of revenue basis when accounted for on a like-for-like basis.Investment MeritsThere are a lot of things to like about the businesses of V and MA that attracted me to a potential investment in these companies.Source: Visa 10-Ks and my financial analysis for projected numbers. Pro Forma 2007 represents a combined statement as if Visa were operating as a combined independent company.Source: MasterCard 10-Ks and my financial analysis for projected numbers(1) Adjusted Operating Margin excludes litigation expenses; while it could be argued that these may be ongoing for the company, they are considered one-time for these purposes Source: Visa and MasterCard 10Ks and my analysis for projectionsInvestment Risks and ConsiderationsWhile both V and MA are wonderful businesses, they are not without their risksSource: Fortune Magazine and The Nilson ReportManagementBoth V and MA generally have good, capable management teams that have for the most part acted in the best interest of shareholders. Each company needs to be evaluated separately in this regard.Visa ManagementA former JPM exec, Charles Scharf, has been at the helm at Visa since late 2012. Scharf is no stranger to the banking world having been one of Jamie Dimon's right hand men at JPMorgan previously. Scharf has had meaningful impact in a short time at Visa. I would guess that Scharf was one of the chief architects behind the recent transition from nearly all of JPMorgan Chase Bank's credit cards from MasterCard branded cards to Visa branded cards. Previously Chase issued both MasterCard and Visa cards to its customers. I would imagine that Scharf (given his relationships at JPM) was able to strike some type of sweetheart deal that assures exclusive Visa issuance or at least very high volumes of Visa cards for lower interchange fees. Anecdotally, my Chase MasterCard was recently automatically switched over to a Visa card. Given that Chase is the largest card issuer in the country, this is a big deal for Visa, even though it's difficult to determine exactly what the financial impact will be. Scharf was quick to bring over his colleague from JPM, Ryan McInerney, to serve as president. McInerney was previously CEO of consumer banking for JPMorgan Chase so he has the experience and relationships to serve him well in this new role. Scharf is supported by a solid supporting cast, but I wouldn't be surprised to see some C-suite turnover in the near term as many of the folks (CFO, CMO) are of the old-guard pre Scharf.Visa has treated shareholders pretty well during Scharf's term. They increased the dividend 21% (from 33c/share to 40c/share) and also repurchased 33 million shares for $5.4bn. The company also put in place a new repurchase program of $5.0bn in October 2013 through which 16mm shares (for $3.4bn) have been repurchased through June 30th, 2014. Some of these repurchases have offset dilution caused by stock options and other stock based rewards, but the total diluted share count has decreased considerably from 2011 through June 2014, which is good for shareholders. Generally, I would say that management has acted in the best interest of shareholders, but I would like to see more of the cash dedicated to dividends going forward as it signals confidence in the business from the management team as I have articulated previously.From a corporate governance perspective I also appreciate that Visa maintains an independent chair of the board (Robert Matschullat) that is separate from the CEO position. While it is important that the CEO and Chair of the Board work together collaboratively, it is also important to maintain a separation of powers.MasterCard ManagementAjay Banga, a former Citigroup and Nestle executive, has served at the helm of MasterCard since 2010 (joined MA in 2009 as COO). He has a diversity of experience working in financial services and also consumer packaged goods, which I think is very well suited to a company like MasterCard that depends heavily on both brand marketing and its financial institution partnerships. Banga has been credited with driving a new focus on innovation at MA and repositioning the company to think of itself as a technology company rather than just a payments processor. He has also launched an internal innovation lab called MasterCard Labs in 2010.Like Visa, MasterCard demonstrates good corporate governance practices by separating the role of CEO and Chairman.Banga has generally acted in the best interest of shareholders. During his tenure as CEO, dividends have increased at a CAGR of 65% (2010-2014). This is a tremendous feat. More importantly, Banga has drastically improved the dividend policy versus his predecessor. Before his arrival, dividends were held flat since early 2007, likely due to the recession, but I would argue unnecessarily so. Banga also initiated MA's first ever share repurchase program in September 2010. Since then, the company has repurchased nearly $8.3bn of shares through July 24, 2014, which is significant given a current market cap of $88bn. $728mm is remaining under the current repurchase program, but I expect management to authorize a new program fairly soon. My primary gripe with MA is the same as V. I would like to see a meaningful increase in its dividend. I expect management to partly deliver on this next year.ValuationV and MA are both great companies. They both generate robust operating margins due to high operating leverage and a natural index to inflation. They will both also continue to experience strong growth as they benefit from the continuing secular shift to card-based payments. Generally they both also benefit from a durable competitive advantage and defensible moat in the form of embedded ecosystem integration, coupled with universal acceptance, strong issuer relationships and strong consumer brand recognition.As with all great companies, the question comes down to valuation and if the current prices provide a reasonable return to prospective shareholders.Based on a simple DCF, using reasonable assumptions for discount rate and growth, I arrived at a value of ~$87 per share for MA, which provides about 23% upside from today's price of $71. For Visa, similar discount rate and growth assumptions were utilized to arrive at a value of $223, which would make it modestly undervalued (~10% upside) versus today's share price of ~$200.What does all this mean? Valuation is an imperfect science with many inputs so these derived values are not exact. Generally, I believe there is a decent margin of safety (right around the minimum of 25% I would require) built into MA at current prices. Visa is modestly undervalued and has very little margin of safety. However, as Warren Buffett has said on many occasions, ""It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price"" and both V and MA are wonderful companies where the expected margin of safety will typically be less than can be found on other less wonderful businesses. However, even buying at fair value would provide a return of 7-8% annually (with low risk) for an investor. And I believe that management can and will drive more value over time by increasing dividend payments, thereby instilling more discipline and signaling more confidence in the future business (which lowers risk and in tandem, the discount rate).Based on the valuation analysis, I am a buyer of MA at current levels and would look to buy on short-term dips to provide further upside. For V, I will withhold buying until short-term dips present a more attractive entry point."

However, the mere size of these companies has not translated into success in the stock market in 2014, with both stocks widely underperforming the overall market.V data by YChartsThere is still plenty of time for the stocks to reverse their courses and head higher on the year, and strong earnings reports could be the catalysts behind these turns. Both companies are scheduled to report earnings results shortly, so let's take a look at the current expectations and what else we should watch for, and then decide if the stocks represent long-term opportunities today.Visa's Q4 Expectations & What To Watch ForVisa's fourth-quarter earnings are scheduled to be released after the market closes on October 29, and analysts currently anticipate significant growth; here's an overview:The estimates above call for earnings per share to increase 14% and revenue to increase 7.4% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.

        The stock sports a tiny dividend but has a lot of room to grow it.
        For my IRA I'm looking for something which is undervalued or has a pretty good dividend, and MasterCard doesn't offer either of those options right now.","MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is a technology company in the global payments industry. On October 30, 2014, the company reported third quarter earnings of $0.89 per share, which beat the consensus of analysts' estimates by $0.11. In the past year, the company's stock is up 15.71% excluding dividends (up 16.28% including dividends) and is beating the S&P 500, which has gained 14.67% in the same time frame. I am taking my IRA back from my financial advisor who has managed to not make as much money as the market has and I've decided that I want to look at Mastercard as a potential investment. With all this in mind, I'd like to take a moment to evaluate the stock to see if right now is a good time to purchase shares for the financial sector of my IRA portfolio.FundamentalsThe company currently trades at a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 30.23, which is expensively priced, but I mainly like to purchase a stock based on where the company is going in the future as opposed to what it has done in the past. On that note, the 1-year forward-looking P/E ratio of 23.45 is currently fairly priced for the future in terms of the right here, right now. The 1-year PEG ratio (1.58), which measures the ratio of the price you're currently paying for the trailing 12-month earnings on the stock while dividing it by the earnings growth of the company for a specified amount of time (I like looking at a 1-year horizon), tells me that the company is fairly priced based on a 1-year EPS growth rate of 19.19%. The company has great near-term future earnings growth potential with a projected EPS growth rate of 19.19%. In addition, the company has great long-term future earnings growth potential with a projected EPS growth rate of 16.44%.FinancialsOn a financial basis, the things I look for are the dividend payouts, return on assets, equity and investment. The company pays a dividend of 0.53% with a payout ratio of 16% of trailing 12-month earnings while sporting return on assets, equity and investment values of 23.1%, 47.2% and 41.7%, respectively, which are all respectable values.The really high return on assets value (23.1%) is important because it is a measure of how profitable the company is relative to its assets, telling us how efficient a management team is at using its assets to generate earnings [for comparison purposes, MasterCard has the highest ROA of all companies in the credit services industry followed by Visa (NYSE:V), which sports an ROA of 18.9%, and Qiwi plc (NASDAQ:QIWI), which sports an ROA of 14.5%].The really high return on equity value (47.2%) is an important financial metric for purposes of comparing the profitability, which is generated with the money shareholders have invested in the company to that of other companies in the same industry [for comparison purposes, MasterCard has the fourth highest ROE of all companies in the credit services industry behind Atlanticus Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ:ATLC), which sports an ROE of 343.4%, Western Union Co. (NYSE:WU), which sports an ROE of 73.1%, and Qiwi, which sports and ROE of 65.5%].The really high return on investment value (41.7%) is an important financial metric because it evaluates the efficiency of an investment that a company makes and if an investment doesn't have a positive ROI then the investment should not be made (for comparison purposes, MasterCard has the second highest ROI of all companies in the credit services industry behind Qiwi, which sports an ROI of 51.1%, and ahead of Blackhawk Network Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAWK), which sports an ROI of 24.1%).Because I believe the market may get a bit choppy here and would like a safety play, I don't believe the 0.53% yield of this company alone is good enough for me to take shelter in for the time being.TechnicalsLooking first at the relative strength index chart [RSI] at the top, I see the stock approaching overbought territory with a current value of 65.27. I will look at the moving average convergence-divergence [MACD] chart next. I see that the black line is above the red line with the divergence bars increasing in height which tells me bullish momentum is in the name. As for the stock price itself ($83.75), I'm looking at $93.94 to act as resistance and the 50-day simple moving average (currently $75.91) to act as support for a risk/reward ratio which plays out to be -9.36% to 12.17%.ConclusionThere is absolutely no doubt that this company operates very well as evidenced through its financial efficiency ratios. Fundamentally I believe the company to be fairly valued on next year's earnings estimates and on earnings growth potential. Financially, the dividend is small and does have a lot of room to grow while sporting excellent returns on assets, equity, and investments. On a technical basis the risk/reward ratio shows me there is more reward than risk right now. The fact that the stock is fairly valued already and has only a tiny dividend makes me not want to invest in it for the IRA.Disclaimer: This article is in no way a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned. This article is meant to serve as a journal for myself as to the rationale of why I bought/sold this stock when I look back on it in the future. These are only my personal opinions and you should do your own homework. Only you are responsible for what you trade and happy investing!"
2650545,25791,2014-11-06T13:14:14-05:00,,"By Sindhu SubramaniamMasterCard (NYSE:MA) reports preliminary financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2014.MasterCard just reported its preliminary financial results based on which we provide a unique corporate earnings release based analysis of its performance. Our analysis focuses on the company's performance for the same quarterly period on a year-on-year basis (unless stated otherwise). This earnings release follows the earnings announcements from the following peers of MasterCard - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS), Total System Services, Inc. (NYSE:TSS), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), WEX Inc. (NYSE:WEX) and Western Union Company (NYSE:WU).HighlightsThe table below shows the preliminary results and recent trends for key metrics such as revenues and net income (See complete table at the end of this report):Companies sometimes focus on growing their top-line (Sales or Revenues) more than their bottom-line i.e. Earnings or Net Income. Investors should look at revenue growth to understand a company's ability to grow its market share, and earnings growth to look at the company's ability to generate returns. Comparing revenue growth to earnings growth helps understand a couple of items: (1) A company's focus on gaining market share vs. generating profits and (2) How additive or dilutive the revenue performance has been to earnings.MA's year-on-year change in top line compared to the same period last year of 13.00% trailed its change in earnings which was 15.47%. The company's performance this period suggests a focus on boosting the bottom-line earnings. While the revenue performance could be higher, it is important to note that this change in revenues is among the highest in the peer group thus far. Also, for comparison purposes, revenues changed by 5.30% and earnings by 9.02% compared to the immediate last quarter.Operating Cash Flow Growth Versus Earnings Growth Companies often post earnings numbers that are influenced by non-cash activities. One way to gauge the quality of the declared earnings number is to judge the deviation in the growth in earnings from the growth in operating cash flows. In general, an earnings growth rate that is higher compared to the operating cash flow growth implies a higher proportion of non-operating and even one-time activities - such activities are typically not sustainable over long periods.MA's year-on-year change in Operating Cash Flow of 4.77% trailed its change in earnings suggesting that the earnings number might have benefited from some unlocking of accruals. In addition, this change in Operating Cash Flow is less than the average among the declared results thus far in its peer group.Unusual ItemsThe company's earnings growth has also been influenced by the following factors: (1) Improvements in EBIT margins from 55.03% to 56.73% and (2) unusual items. The company's pretax margins are now 56.65% compared to 56.61% for the same period last year.EPS Growth Versus Earnings GrowthMA's year-on-year change in Earnings per Share (EPS) of 19.67% is better than its change in earnings of 15.47%. However, this change in earnings is better than the peer average among the declared results thus far in its peer group suggesting that the company is gaining more ground in generating profits in this group.Supporting DataThe table below shows the preliminary results along with the recent trend for revenues, net income and other relevant metrics:MasterCard, Inc. is a technology company, which is engaged in the global payments industry. It connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments and businesses worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks. The company also offers a wide range of payment solutions that enables the development and implementation of credit, debit, prepaid, commercial and related payment programs and solutions for consumers and merchants.

2528365,72215,2014-09-29T12:32:18-04:00,"The highest court in Europe ruled in favor of the European Commission's judgment passed in 2007 to ban cross-border fees charged by MasterCard Inc.The decision is significant because it will regulate how MasterCard carries out its business in Europe, and for more reasons explained below.There is potential threat to MasterCard from retailers like Target, Wal-Mart, Debenhams and Next, who are pressing for reductions in interbank rates domestically.The shares for MasterCard have received a consensus rating of ""Buy"" from 23 brokerages analyzing the company.","The highest court in Europe ruled in favor of the European Commission's judgment passed in 2007 to ban cross-border fee charged by MasterCard Inc. (NYSE:MA). The decision was made on the grounds that it breached competition rules.MasterCard had challenged the 2007 ruling in 2012 by the second-highest court in Europe, The General Court in Luxembourg. Now that the court has backed the commission's decision, the ECJ's decision is binding and cannot be appealed against.President of MasterCard Europe, Javier Perez, said, ""Today's negative ruling by the European Court of Justice in relation to cross-border interchange fees is disappointing."" He added that the decision will not have any major impact on the credit card company, since it has been complying with the decision passed by the commission for several years now. He also said that, ""We will continue to comply with the decision as we have been doing for a number of years. This means we would maintain our European... cross-border consumer interchange fees at a weighted average of 0.2% for debit and 0.3% for credit.""The spokesman for the EU Competition commissioner said that the judgment was a ""big win for European consumers"", who were paying ""unjustifiably high hidden fees"".Outcomes of the rulingEach card purchase made by a customer leads to the levying of an interchange charge by the cardholder's bank to the retailer's bank. The commission argued that the current fee system being used by MasterCard is anti-competitive, as it leads to increases in prices for customers. Since the banks charge higher fees, credit card companies provide them with the incentive to issue their cards, instead of issuing their competitors' cards.The interchange fee is different from country to country, and is set by the credit card companies. When transitions occur across borders, it often means merchant banks in different countries have to pay cardholder banks located in different countries as well.In its defense, MasterCard has argued that by removing the fee, banks would end up charging customers and businesses a higher fee, in order to make up for the fee amount that is lost. The card company argues that this move would go against the interest of the customers and businesses.The decision is significant not only because it will regulate how MasterCard carries out its business in Europe, but will have a bearing on similar competition in the EU as well.According to the commission, rulings against MasterCard in Italy, France and Hungary, as well as the U.K. investigation were put on hold, and added that this ruling could have an impact on the damages that were launch against MasterCard in the UK.The EU is preparing itself to impose caps on the limits of interchange fee to 0.3% of the credit card transaction carried out. €0.07 ($0.09) or 0.2%, whichever is lower, will be charged on debit card transactions. These caps were voted for in April, but their imposition is still under approval by EU member states before it becomes the law.The financial impact on MasterCardAs already mentioned, the adverse impact of this decision will lead to no major constraints for the company, as it had already been complying with the commission's ruling for the past seven years.However, there is potential threat to MasterCard from retailers like Target, Wal-Mart, Debenhams and Next, who are pressing for reductions in interbank rates domestically so that they are at par with the cross-border interchange fees. The latest ruling in the EU has brought the company under scrutiny of Britain's Competition and Markets Authority for the domestic card payment fees that are being charged. Although the decision for this is expected by October, the company could be charged with almost £1.0 billion ($1.63 billion) in damages.Analyst ratingsThe shares for MasterCard have received a consensus rating of ""Buy"" from 23 brokerages analyzing the company. Six recommended a hold rating for the share, while ten recommended it as a buy. The average twelve-month target price for the share was set at $337.03.Analysts at Morgan Stanley rated the share as ""overweight"", and set a target price of $88. Zacks analysts rated the share as ""neutral"", and set a target price of $78, while analysts at Goldman Sachs rated the share as a ""buy"", and set a target price of $86.ConclusionShare prices of MasterCard Inc. dipped following the ruling passed by the European court regarding the interchange fees being charged by the bank. Investors seemed to be offloading the shares, not because they are expecting the decision to affect company revenues, but because it can lead to an impact on the damages that the company could be looking at in the UK.The decision regarding the UK damages is expected by the end of October, so investors have considerable time to trade in the share after its latest dip, buying at lower prices and then selling at a high.However, from the point of view of a long-term investment, it would be wise for investors to wait until the announcement of the decision from the UK before investing. Once the decision is made, investors will be able to get a clear idea about the direction that share prices are heading in, in the future.It would be wiser to invest in the share after the announcement of the decision in October, because if prices decline following the announcement of an unfavorable decision, shareholders could be looking at some very attractive buying rates for the shares."
2488975,41961,2014-09-11T16:38:24-04:00,Payment tokenization is likely to be a significant growth driver for Visa going forward.Visa and MasterCard have strong solutions and first-mover advantage for tokenization.Visa and MasterCard are providing tokenization solutions for Apple's Apple Pay payment service.,"I had previously written a detailed analysis about Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard's (NYSE:MA) future growth coming from tokenization, and how both companies would be starting tokenization trials for a variety of issuers. Visa and MasterCard have both accelerated their entry into payment tokenization with the announcement that they will provide tokenization for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Pay payment service.Visa and MasterCard announced on September 9th that they would support Apple Pay. They subsequently mentioned that they would make available their tokenization platforms to issuers wishing to support payment credential tokenization for Apple Pay. MasterCard has also recently announced pricing for its tokenization service, which will be a rate of approximately $0.025 per transaction.As a result of Apple Pay's announcement and Visa and MasterCard's tokenization support, I expect Visa and MasterCard to develop supporting tokenization revenue streams much faster than what I had originally expected. With the Apple Pay service having a broad base of support from merchants and other ecosystem players, issuers will no doubt be keen to test the waters of mobile payments. Given tokenization is a requirement for any credentials made available on Apple Pay, this should provide Visa and MasterCard with a ready supply of merchants wishing to utilize their tokenization services. A side benefit of the Apple Pay launch for Visa and MasterCard is that it should lead to the realization of mobile payments at a much faster rate than analysts are expecting, leading Visa and MasterCard to both benefit from additional transactions over their payment rails."
2568025,58341,2014-10-16T16:09:35-04:00,MasterCard's credit card transactions accounted for 14.4% of total merchant transactions in 2013 (12.2% for debit cards).Shares of MA are down over 14% year to date.85% of global payments are still via cash or check.,"Shares of MasterCard (NYSE:MA) have been an underperformer for 2014 with a year to date loss of 14.53% vs. the S&P 500's SPX 1.59% gain. The correction in the stock isn't related to a decline in the fundamentals either since they not only reported better Q1 and Q2 results on a year over year basis (top and bottom line), but also beat Wall Street consensus estimates. However, it does have to do with the stock soaring 70.68% in 2013 (more than double the rise in the S&P 500). The stock had simply gotten ahead of itself and needed to take a breather. Revenue has been growing 10-13% recently and is expected to do so in the upcoming years too. Earnings growth has been even more impressive at an annual rate into the mid-to-high teens and analyst estimates are looking for 19.3% in 2015.The $82B global payment technology company trades at a P/E ratio of 19.83x (2015 estimates) and a price to sales ratio of 9.08x. This compares to its larger competitor, Visa (NYSE:V) who trades at a P/E ratio of 19.55x (2015 estimates) with 15.4% EPS growth and a price to sales ratio of 10.31x. Revenue is expected to increase 7.6% in 2014 and 10.4% next year. Visa trades at a slightly lower P/E ratio, but doesn't have the top and bottom line growth that MasterCard has. Both have a dividend yield, albeit small, Visa's is currently at 0.79% and MasterCard's is 0.62%. Overall, Wall Street analysts remain bullish on both companies. MasterCard has 15 buy ratings, 6 hold ratings, and 1 sell rating, while Visa has 19 buy ratings, 4 hold ratings, and 0 sell ratings.When comparing the payment technology companies, MasterCard trades at a more favorable valuation, but it's not cheap at a PEG ratio of 1.03x (fair value). Over the last five years, the stock has traded at a historical P/E ratio of 23.45x, which is near where the stock trades at when using EPS for 2014 (23.66x). If MasterCard continues to exceed expectations as they have for the last 4+ years (only missing EPS estimates once in that time) it will likely trade at the 23x-24x multiple for 2015 earnings by the year after next year. So this means a nearly 20% increase can be achieved, or a move just above the January highs, but what will be the driver that takes the stock to $85?Net revenues rose 13% year over year in Q2 to $2.377B, largely due to an 11% increase in domestic assessments (largest revenue segment). Transaction processing fees almost crossed the $1B mark in the quarter ($995M) on a 15% rise in the quarter. Cross-border volume fees, the third largest revenue segment that generates higher fees than domestic assessments, picked up 14% to total $750M for Q2 2014. Most cross-border transactions generate higher revenue per transaction due to higher fees with currency conversion fees being the major factor, compared to domestic assessments where the merchant and issuer country are the same.Operating margins did see a 40 basis point decline in the quarter to 58.2%, but is still up 20 basis points to 58.6% for the first two quarters of the year. A 13% climb in operating income to $1.38B made up for the slight decline in quarterly margins. The U.S. is by far the largest revenue stream for the company at 39% of the business, but when looking at GDV (Gross Dollar Value) the Asia Pacific/Middle East/Africa region is growing 18% on a local currency basis (+15% when converted back to U.S. dollars). Europe and Latin America were strong too as both saw a 13% increase on a local currency basis. The U.S. segment has stayed steady at +9% for Q1 and Q2 of this year.Roughly, half of all transactions in the U.S. are still via cash and check and an astounding 85% on a worldwide level are too. This presents a huge opportunity for many years to come as modernization takes place across the globe, hence the growth in the Asia Pacific/Middle East/Africa and Latin America regions. MasterCard's credit card transactions accounted for 14.4% of total merchant purchase transactions in 2013 (12.2% for their debit cards). The market share they have now is nice, but the company is looking to grow that by co-branded cards with major retailers. This year, they partnered with Target (NYSE:TGT), beating out its rival Visa who had previously had the deal. They also took over Discover Financial Services' (NYSE:DFS) co-branded deal with Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) in the U.S. Internationally they want to expand the Wal-Mart partnership to the Latin America markets and have done so recently in Japan with a deal with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company's marketing push of the Priceless Cities Platform (along with other marketing successes) is set to grow to 36 cities by the end of this year and has currently had over 2 million cardholders benefit from the program.Mobile payments are another growth opportunity as a whole for the industry that makes the switch to credit/debit cards seamless for more developed areas of the world. Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) move into the payment space through Apple Pay in September resulted in MasterCard announcing that all point-of-sale terminals will be required to have NFC capability built in by the start of 2016 (the same wireless technology Apple Pay will require).Organic growth is still a large opportunity going forward, but MasterCard has been excellent at financial engineering and being shareholder friendly too. In December, they announced a $3.5B share repurchase program, an 83% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.11 per share, and a 10 for 1 stock split to make shares more accessible to retail investors.Possible headwinds for MasterCard include currency volatility and slowdown in the economy. While fluctuations in the FX market are always a potential negative given its business is nearly 3/5ths outside of the U.S., declining forecasts for GDP in European countries is cause for concern. Germany recently lowered their 2014 GDP forecasts to 1.2% from 1.8% and 2015 forecasts to 1.3% from 2.0%.Shares of MA have already fallen about 10% in the last month with Q3 earnings results set to come out on October 30th (likely pricing in some of the economic woes and setting low expectations for the quarter). On October 9th, someone sold 4,679 October 31 weekly $70.50 puts for $0.64 each (collecting $299K+ in premium). He/she is making a bullish bet that the stock will close above $70.50 on October 31st (one day after earnings come out). Taking all of this into consideration, MasterCard is worth taking a long position in the stock ahead of the Q3 report due to its international (and domestic) growth potential and its push to take market share from the competition. If the weakness in U.S. equities continues and drags MA shares to the mid to lower $60s, it would be an opportunity to build a full position in the stock at a forward P/E ratio in the 17x-18x range."
2529715,71765,2014-09-30T02:14:33-04:00,"Data for the past three months reveals share prices have not gone above $78.32 or lower than $73.40.Despite the fact that the company reported a 13% increase in its net revenue at $8.3 billion, the figure fell short of what was actually expected by the company.According to these analysts, 12 month price targets for the company have a median price of $90, a high estimate of $100 and a low estimate of $79.","Over the past few months, MasterCard's (NYSE:MA) shares have been trading in a triangle pattern; data for the past three months reveals share prices have not gone above $78.32 or lower than $73.40. However, it now seems that this triangle pattern can be broken by the company. Closing prices for the company's stock have recently been successful in going above the resistance levels with closing prices on both September 18, 19 and 22 being above the previous resistance level of $77. There are several factors that indicate that MasterCard's stock will continue increasing in the future as a result of which many investors might consider taking up a long position.Earlier in 2014, the company disappointed both analysts as well as investors when it failed to perform up to the expectations of these groups. Despite the fact that the company reported a 13% increase in its net revenue at $8.3 billion, the figure fell short of what was actually expected by the company. MasterCard's earnings per share, which were $2.56, were 8 cents below the earnings per share that Wall Street analysts had been expecting. These factors led to the ultimate decline in the price of the company's shares as a result of which the company had been struggling with getting its share prices to increase. However, new expectations from the firm are that the share prices will finally start increasing.The company has been performing fairly well recently. The financial performance of the company managed to exceed expectations in the second quarter of 2014. The company's earnings per share, at 80 cents, managed to exceed Zacks Consensus estimate of 77 cents by 3 cents. The EPS, as compared to the EPS of the same quarter from the previous year, increased by 10 cents from 70 cents in 2013. Net revenue also managed to remain slightly above the expected revenue of $2.3 billion at $2.38 billion. Operating income for the company also increased by 12.6% and retained earnings increased from $10.12 billion at the end of 2013 to $11.67 at the end of June 2014. All these values indicate that the company has been performing well.However, the company's operating expenses and taxes significantly increased by 14.5% yoy and as a result of this, the profit margins of the company got adversely affected. The overall profit margins fell from 58.6% to 58.2%. The company's cash and cash equivalents also significantly fell from $3.6 billion to $2.88 billion. However, this can be attributed to the company's increased investment in acquisitions and several strategic initiatives.MasterCard will release its third quarter financial data on October 30, 2014. The company's performance in the second quarter provides some reassurance to investors regarding the company's overall performance. Revenues for the company have been on the rise which means that this trend can be expected to continue in the third quarter of 2014. However, at the same time, the company seems to have a problem with its operating expenses which can also increase and affect the company's profit margins adversely even more than they already have been affected.A consensus forecast amongst 39 analysts reveals that MasterCard is expected to outperform in the third quarter of 2014. According to these analysts, 12 month price targets for the company have a median price of $90, a high estimate of $100 and a low estimate of $79. These estimates provide a promising future for the investors of the company and also indicate that investors who have kept a long position will be able to benefit from their decision in the future. Since this forecast also expects a dividend increase of 48.28%, the future looks bright for investors.In conclusion, MasterCard definitely holds a number of different benefits for its investors. While it is true that the company's profitability got affected adversely because of the company's inability to manage expenses effectively, the company's revenues have been increasing. If the company can maintain this upward trend in revenue generation while solving its expenses problem, it can very easily manage to increase its profitability levels. The company's cash flow has been affected due to its investment in acquisitions, this is eventually going to be good news for the investors as the company's business will expand as a result of which the company's revenues will also increase.In the second quarter, the company managed to exceed expected earnings per share and this can be expected from the company in the next quarter as well. Furthermore, the company's dividends are also expected to increase thus ensuring investors higher returns. This positive change in the company's financial performance is expected to have a positive impact on its share prices, which is already visible since the company has been managing to cross the resistance price lately. In short, the future looks bright for both the company as well as its investors and maintaining a long position on the company's stock can allow investors to benefit from their decision in the future."
2502835,41961,2014-09-17T18:10:47-04:00,"MasterCard has strong barriers to entry and deep network advantages which generate strong returns on equity.The company has experienced very strong rates of revenue and free cash flow growth.MasterCard's growth drivers going forward are positive, and the company remains one of my favorite growth stocks.","I have had a love-hate relationship with MasterCard (NYSE:MA) for a number of years. I have owned MasterCard at various points since its IPO back in 2006. I first acquired MasterCard back in 2006 at a pre-split price of about $50. Needless to say, I got greedy and sold much of my stock for what I believed to be a windfall gain when the stock hit $200. That decision has caused me grief ever since, as I watched MasterCard's share price continue to zip higher and higher. I since bought back into the company at around $350 pre-split. Irrespective of missing out on some massive gains along the way, MasterCard remains one of my favorite growth stocks and a major component of my growth portfolio. My experience with the stock taught me a valuable lesson, which is never to sell a good business.Consistent performer with good operating historyMasterCard is one of the major credit card networks in the world, along with Visa (NYSE:V), Amex (NYSE:AXP) and Discover (NYSE:DFS). Highly likely that somewhere in your wallet, you may have your own branded MasterCard card that has been issued to you by your bank. MasterCard is an almost $90B business, earning close to $9B in revenue with very high gross margins.MasterCard's growth since the IPO has been very impressive. Since 2006, revenue has increased from $3.3B to $8.3B in 2013, a growth rate of 14% annually. During this same period, operating cash flow has increased from $650M to $4.1B, an annualized growth rate of 24%. MasterCard's return on equity has generally averaged well over 40% in recent years. This is indicative of a company with strong competitive advantages, with relatively few companies returning such a strong return on equity.The company introduced a dividend of $0.01 per share in 2006. This dividend has been increased to $0.29 in 2013. There is likely still significant room for MasterCard to increase the dividend, given the company has a payout ratio of around 12%.MasterCard's total return performance since the IPO has been pretty good. An investor who invested $10,000 in MasterCard in 2006 would have received returns close to $175,000, which is substantially better than the performance of the S&P 500 over a similar duration. A $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 would have returned $22,500 over a similar time frame.MasterCard's Business Model is powerfully efficientHow does MasterCard make money? Each time a credit card or debit card transaction is processed on the MasterCard network, MasterCard charges the merchants who put through that transaction an assessment fee. This is basically a small percentage of the total transaction value.On average, MasterCard keeps something like 0.2% of the average transaction value. While the merchant is paying more per transaction, MasterCard has to pass on some of this to the bank that issues the MasterCard, as well as to the bank that the merchant banks with.It's a fairly complex ecosystem, but the important thing to remember is that MasterCard takes a small piece of every transaction that takes place on its network. Unlike American Express, MasterCard doesn't do any consumer lending.What this means is that MasterCard doesn't take any credit risk. So the person defaulting on its credit card payment doesn't really affect MasterCard at all, as MasterCard makes money each time from processing the transaction and not on the lending.Credit card networks have huge moats. It's not an easy task to set up a network, what with needing to have banks issue the cards, consumers to use the cards, and merchants to accept the cards. The network effects are significant and not easy to replicate. It's the reason that credit cards are one of my favorite businesses.MasterCard is riding a number of growth driversIncreasing spend - We are moving more and more to a cashless society. While penetration of credit cards is fairly high in Western economies, the amount of spend that's being put on credit cards is increasing. Checks and cash are decreasing in use, with check usage globally declining from 22% in 2005 to 16% in 2009.Increasing acceptance - Credit cards are being accepted by merchants who previously hadn't accepted them. This is thanks to the lower costs of Point of Sale terminals, such as those distributed by Square. The result is that accepting credit card payments is now cheaper for many smaller merchants, all of which will contribute additional payment volume for MasterCard.International - Credit card penetration amongst some of the rapidly growing BRIC countries has been rapidly increasing. Russia and China have seen increases in credit card penetration to 24% and 65% respectively. This was in the single digits in the early 2000s. As disposable income increases, the average spend per user will also increase, contributing to additional credit card purchase volumeTokenization Services - While still an emerging area, MasterCard and Visa have taken initial steps to develop and monetize tokenization services. The essence of tokenization would be to transform static credit card data into dynamic data. Each credit card transaction would be given its own unique identifier that would be for one-time use. Thus, any tokenized data that is stolen essentially becomes useless, as it would be only be applicable to a specific transaction, with tokens not capable of being reused. Tokenization should help prevent the recent spate of credit card data theft that has been seen in places like Target.Why does this represent such a significant market opportunity for MasterCard? To get a scale of the opportunity, one only needs to consider the cost of credit card fraud in the US today, which runs close to $200B annually. Much of this occurs because credit card data is stolen and then used to generate fraudulent sales with online merchants. MasterCard recently announced that it would be providing tokenization services for Apple Pay, Apple's payment service.ConclusionsMasterCard is, in my view, the poster child of what you want in a growth stock. It currently generates strong revenue growth and tremendous free cash flow growth. The business has high barriers to entry, which are difficult to replicate. Finally, the growth drivers for MasterCard moving forward are positive, with the company poised to experience sustainable growth for the foreseeable future. For these reasons, MasterCard is one of my favorite growth stocks."
2439265,67815,2014-08-20T15:00:49-04:00,"Visa is the focus of this article, with the company’s profitability, growth potential and income prospects discussed.We also compare it to a key sub-industry peer and find that it could be relatively overvalued.As such, we think that Visa could underperform its rival going forward.","In this article, we're focusing on Visa (NYSE:V) and assessing its strengths and weaknesses relative to MasterCard (NYSE:MA). We're comparing the two companies because they are similar in size, with Visa having a market cap of $135 billion and MasterCard having a market cap of $88 billion. The two companies also offer very similar services and sit in the same GICS sector of information technology, as well as the same GICS sub-industry of internet software and services. We hope you find the article useful, since we know many investors apportion their capital based on GICS sectors and GICS sub-industries, and we welcome your comments and views!Growth ProspectsWith the US economy continuing to make slow but steady progress, we're pleased to see that Visa is also starting to make improvements with its earnings growth rate. Indeed, Visa's fortunes are very closely tied to those of the US economy due to it being a cyclical play, so the fact that its forecast growth rate shows an improvement between this year and next year is encouraging. EPS growth in the current year to September 2014 is due to be 6.4%, while in the year to September 2015, this figure is expected to rise to 15.2%.Despite this, Visa doesn't seem to be able to keep up with MasterCard. That's because its smaller sub-industry peer is forecast to increase EPS by a highly impressive 12.4% in the current year to December 2014, with the growth rate expected to rise to 19.7% in the year to December 2015. So, while we're very impressed with Visa's forecasts, they're currently only good enough for second place when compared to the equivalent figures for MasterCard.ProfitabilityIt's a similar story when it comes to profitability. We're very impressed with Visa, but even more impressed with MasterCard! So, while return on equity of 20.5% is very strong - especially when you consider that Visa has no debt on its balance sheet - it is not as high as MasterCard's equivalent number of 49.5%. Sure, MasterCard runs some financial leverage, with its debt to equity ratio being 24%. However, since MasterCard's debt levels are actually fairly low we think that they are likely to only make a limited amount of difference to return on equity, which enhances our view that MasterCard's figure is the better.Indeed, it's a similar story when looking at return on assets, with Visa making good use of its asset base with a return on assets number of 13.3%. However, MasterCard again pips its larger rival with return on assets of 23.4%, which shows that it is able to squeeze more efficiency and more profit out of its total assets. That's not to say that Visa isn't hugely profitable - it certainly is. It's just that its numbers are very much second-best when pitched against its sub-industry peer, MasterCard.Income PotentialDespite both companies yielding less than 1% (Visa's forward yield is 0.8% and MasterCard's is just 0.6%), they both have the potential to be at least reasonable income stocks. That's because their payout ratios are incredibly low at 18% for Visa and just 12% for MasterCard. Sure, we appreciate that both companies need to reinvest within their businesses to keep their products slick and relevant. However, we also feel that they could be more generous when it comes to shareholder payouts going forward. Although neither stock is an attractive income play right now, they both have the potential to push north of a 2% yield even with an only moderate overall payout ratio.ValuationGiven that its growth forecasts and profitability are some way behind those of MasterCard, we expected Visa to trade at a significant discount to its sub-industry peer. However, Visa's forward P/E is just 1.9% below that of MasterCard at 20.8 versus 21.2 for MasterCard. Furthermore, Visa's EV/EBITDA ratio is slightly above that of MasterCard at 16 versus 15.9 for MasterCard. This surprises us somewhat, since we feel that Visa should trade at a sizeable discount to its rival. As a result, we feel that Visa may be mispriced and could, therefore, underperform its sub-industry peer going forward.A Third Option?Of course, we recently took a closer look at American Express (NYSE:AXP) alongside Visa and found that Visa was the more preferable of the two companies. While we were impressed with Amex's profitability, we were concerned about its debt levels, since the company has a debt to equity ratio of 285%. Furthermore, we felt that American Express had growth forecasts that were rather pedestrian in comparison to Visa, which made us feel that the company could struggle to justify its PEG ratio of 2. As a result, we felt that Visa could outperform American Express going forward.ConclusionAlthough we're impressed with Visa's profitability and growth potential, we are of the view that it is very much second-best when compared to MasterCard. Indeed, Visa's return on equity and return on assets, although impressive, are significantly lower than those of MasterCard. Furthermore, Visa's earnings growth forecasts, while showing signs of improvement as the US economy continues to pick up pace, are also much less than those penciled in for MasterCard.As a result, we were surprised to see that Visa does not trade at a discount when it comes to the EV/EBITDA ratio and only trades at a small discount based on the forward P/E ratio. Due to this, we think that Visa may be overvalued relative to MasterCard. Of course, we stand by our view that Visa is a better option than American Express right now, but also believe that it will underperform MasterCard moving forward, as the market reacts to what appears to be a mispricing going forward.We'd love to hear your views in the comments section below.

2454545,67775,2014-08-27T12:01:18-04:00,"Will MasterCard continue to trade at a 16.3x EV/LTM EBITDA multiple?MasterCard's operating segments highlight important growth drivers.My assumptions in the Levered Returns valuation models yield a fair value per share of approximately $72, below its August 26th closing price of $77.00.","EBITDA MultipleI expect MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V) to benefit from powerful secular trends over the next decade as economies outside the United States grow and the use of cash declines. Both companies are projected to achieve double-digit EBITDA growth over the next several years, while regulatory issues pose the only real imminent threat. The market is currently placing a significant premium on these powerful trends, as both companies trade at over 16.0x EV/LTM EBITDA multiple, which is above their three- and five-year averages (shown in the table below).MasterCard has a bright future with outsized growth prospects, but I am skeptical that the company justifies an LTM EBITDA multiple above 16.0x. This is why I have selected a fair value EBITDA multiple of 15.0x shown below in the Levered Returns comparable company model. My selection implies MasterCard currently trades at approximately an 8% premium. At the time of this writing, the Levered Returns community is approximating the fair value of MasterCard at approximately $71.50, close to my fair value estimate of $71.00. In the model below, you can contribute your fair value to view the latest LR community's price estimate.To further test my multiple selection, I forecasted MasterCard's revenues by operating segment and created a discounted cash flow analysis, which is described in the next two sections.MasterCard's Operating SegmentsUnderstanding MasterCard's operating segments sheds light on the company's important growth drivers. Thus, I've built a revenue forecast on an operating segment basis for the company:MasterCard's operating segments are as follows (per 10-K):DCF Valuation ModelThese revenue and profitability growth drivers are reflected below in the Levered Returns discounted cash flow analysis model to determine an Enterprise Value. I then deduct net debt, minority interest, and net litigation liabilities to conclude the total equity value and resulting per-share value for the company:Other Key AssumptionsCapital Expenditures: MasterCard has historically spent between 1.1% to 2.0% of sales on capital expenditures. I've selected 1.5%, which is consistent with what equity research analysts are projecting, according to Thomson Reuters.Working Capital: I've selected -12.9%, which equals the average net working capital dollar amounts over the last four quarters as a percentage of sales.ConclusionBased on my assumptions in the Levered Returns 5-year DCF analysis above, MasterCard currently appears slightly overvalued, with a fair market value price target of approximately $72. This is an outstanding company that is poised to benefit from powerful trends over the next decade without having to spend much in terms of additional capex. On a long-term basis I believe MA has some upside, but legal and regulatory pressure against interchange fees remain a real imminent threat. I do not recommend value investors increase their positions in MA at the current prices. However, the interactive tables above allow you to play with the assumptions and come to your own conclusions."
2475625,23892,2014-09-06T10:37:42-04:00,"MasterCard's strong brand is among the most recognized in the world.The company generates double-digit growth with a highly profitable business model.Over the last decade, free cash flow has grown strongly from $266 million to $3.5 billion.","Strong Brand And NetworkFounded in 1966 by a group of bankers as the Interbank Card Association, MasterCard (NYSE:MA) was renamed to its current name in 1979 to reflect a commitment to international growth. In 2013, more than 60% of the company's $8.3 billion in revenues was derived from countries outside of the U.S.The MasterCard brand is among the most recognized in the world. The company offers a wide range of payment solutions, including credit, debit, prepaid, digital wallet and commercial programs through a family of well-known brands, including MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus. With a unique and proprietary global payments network, MasterCard connects close to two billion cardholders with tens of millions of merchants around the world.In the last four decades, people and businesses worldwide have transformed how they pay for goods and services. The rise of electronic payments has fueled economic growth while delivering value to consumers, merchants and governments. From its earliest days of credit cards to the contactless and wireless payment options of today, MasterCard has led the industry with its innovative and growing range of products and solutions.With 85% of the world's transactions still made with cash and checks, there is significant opportunity for further long-term growth for MasterCard as billions of people migrate away from cash to a more efficient and secure global payment network as the digital and physical worlds converge.Double-Digit GrowthMasterCard generates revenues based on the volume of activity on cards that carry their brands and the number of transactions they process for customers, as well as other payment-related services. Over the past five years, the firm has generated strong double-digit growth with sales compounding at a 13% annual rate and EPS at a 23% annual rate.During the first half of 2014, double-digit growth continued with revenues rising 14% to $4.6 billion and EPS charging 16% higher to $1.53. Second quarter results reflected double-digit growth in key metrics, including a 13% increase in gross dollar volume to $1.1 trillion; a 16% increase in cross-border volume; and a 12% increase in processed transactions to 10.6 billion.Profitable OperationsMasterCard's business model is highly profitable with net profit margins expanding from an excellent 29% in 2009 to a superb 37% in 2013. This has translated into high returns on shareholders' equity which have averaged an outstanding 38% over the same period.Strong Cash FlowsWith profitable operations and minimal capital expenditure needs, MasterCard generates strong free cash flows. Over the last decade, free cash flow has grown from $266 million to $3.5 billion on a trailing 12-months basis. While the company currently pays a modest dividend, the dividend has been increased significantly in the last four years from $.06 per share to a current $.44 per share. Given the low dividend payout ratio, MasterCard has plenty of room to increase the dividend further in the years ahead.MasterCard has also been using its strong cash flows to repurchase significant amounts of its stock including more than $5 billion of stock in the last three years. During the first half of 2014, an additional $2.8 billion of stock was repurchased. The company has $728 million remaining authorized for future share repurchases.Long-term investors should go shopping with MasterCard, a HI-quality company with a strong, global brand, double-digit growth, highly profitable operations and strong cash flows.

2448845,24580,2014-08-25T12:08:30-04:00,The company’s latest financial results for the second quarter of 2014 reveal significant growth.MasterCard has managed to process over 20 billion transactions.MasterCard generates a significant portion of its earnings via its international transactions.,"MasterCard (NYSE:MA) has managed to come a long way and has become a globally well known publicly traded company since its initial public offering. The company has significantly grown and it seems like its growth is not going to be slowing down anytime soon.The company's latest financial results for the second quarter of 2014 reveal significant growth. MasterCard reported net income of $931 million which showed an increase of 10%, or 9% after being adjusted for currency, and earnings per diluted share of $0.80 which showed an increase of 14% as compared to the same period in the previous year. The company reported net revenue of $2.4 billion in the second quarter of 2014 which is a 13% increase from the same period last year. All the financial results for the second quarter of 2014 reveal significant increases as compared to the results in the same quarter the previous year. The question that arises here is: what are the factors that have resulted in MasterCard achieving such high growth rates.The total transactions processed have increased:MasterCard charges fees on all the services it provides including authorizing, settlement and clearing services to the issuer and acquirer banks along with merchants and customers. During the year 2013, MasterCard managed to process 38 billion transactions, thus generating a significant amount of revenues from transaction fees. During the first half of the year 2014, MasterCard has managed to process over 20 billion transactions, meaning that there is an expected increase in the overall transactions processed during this year; this has resulted in a direct increase in the company's growth rate and revenues. Expected total transactions for the year 2014 are 42 billion transactions, which connotes that a major reason behind the company's growth is the fact that the number of transactions processed has been increasing.Worldwide purchase volume is increasing:At $821 billion, the total worldwide purchase volume has increased by 13% as compared to the same quarter in the previous year. The company's customers had issued 2 billion MasterCard and Maestro branded cards by the end of the second quarter of 2014. This shows that the overall purchase volume is increasing at a global level as a result of which the company is experiencing excellent growth rates. The increase in the overall purchase volume also leads to higher total transactions, thus benefiting the company in more than one way.The Gross Dollar Value is increasing:One of the ways that MasterCard charges its customers is based on the dollar value of their transactions. The company has been experiencing a continuous increase of 10% in the Gross Dollar Value ((GDV)) in each quarter as compared to the same quarter in the previous year. GDV for the whole year 2014 is expected to rise by 0.5 billion to 4.5 billion as compared to the GDV of 2013. This is one of the key factors that have contributed to the overall growth of the company.The company's international transactions have also been increasing:It is worth noting that the company generates a significant portion of its earnings via its international transactions. It operates in over 200 countries globally which makes it a strong international company in its category. The company's widespread presence means that it deals in over 150 currencies. It charges fees for all the services that it provides to the customers globally. There has been a significant increase in the overall transaction fees that the company has been receiving at a global level. International GDV is expected to increase over the $300 billion mark, as a result of which this factor continues to remain a significant reason behind the growth of the company. Reasons for this increase include the fact that individuals travel abroad more frequently as a result of which they look for non-money solutions to their needs which is exactly what MasterCard specializes in providing them.Will this growth continue?So far, all the expectations for the second quarter of the year 2014 point towards higher growth rates for the company. The transactions made by MasterCard customers are increasing not only at a national level but are increasing globally. This means that the fees that the company charges its customers on these transactions are also significantly increasing, as a result of which the company will continue to grow in the years to come. Furthermore, it is expected that the European and Asian markets will be experiencing favorable economic conditions, as a result of which they will continue to provide strong growth opportunities to the company which will result in higher growth for the company. MasterCard's continuous expansion plans will also allow the company to significantly grow, as a result of which the company will remain a good option for investors for a long time to come."
2458065,25106,2014-08-28T14:56:39-04:00,Both V & MA currently have very little debt on their balance sheets.The stability of V and MA earnings make them good candidates for increased levels of leverage.Shareholders are currently missing out on potential benefits of leverage.,"As far as mega cap companies go, Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) are in rarefied air in terms of their balance sheets. Currently, Visa has more than $4 billion in cash and no debt. MasterCard has $5.7 billion in cash and $1.49 billion of debt. After taking a look at the list of most valuable companies by market cap, the only other companies with nearly debt free balance sheets are tech giants Google and Facebook. While Apple, Exxon, Chevron, and Microsoft also have strong balance sheets, these companies have accumulated some debt in recent years to help fund stock buybacks.Business Model StabilityVisa and MasterCard are in a low risk business as both companies earn profits on transaction fees and do not take interest rate risk. This is not the case for peers such as American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Capital One (NYSE:COF). While Visa and MasterCard profits will increase or fall based on the strength of the economy and consumer spending, both companies are quite profitable. Visa has operating profit margins of 62% and MasterCard has operating profit margins of 55%. The nature of the transaction based business model means that even in a severe recession Visa and MasterCard will still be profitable and will not face losses due to weakening credit conditions. In my opinion, Visa and MasterCard can almost be looked at as the utilities of the financial services sector. While energy usage could fall somewhat during a recession, utilities earnings typically fall only slightly. The same idea applies to Visa and MasterCard as a drop in consumer spending would be a negative but not enough to cause major problems for Visa and MasterCard. As shown by the chart below, even during the 2008 recession both Visa and MasterCard were able to increase revenues and profits.V Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsShareholders Are Missing Out On Benefits Of LeverageAs everyone knows, under the wrong circumstances, too much debt can be fatal for a company. However, there are also strong arguments to be made in favor of higher debt levels and increased leverage. One potential benefit from debt financing as compared to equity financing is that interest expense on debt is tax deductible. Furthermore, another advantage of debt financing is that, based on interest rates, it can be cheaper than equity. Given the current low interest rate environment, it is likely a good time for companies to use the debt markets to finance themselves as much as possible. Presently, Visa and MasterCard shareholders are missing out on the opportunity to take advantage of historically low interest rates.My Proposed PlanCompanies engaged in relatively stable businesses such as cable operators, electric utility operators, and telecom providers tend to operate with a significant amount of leverage. For example, AT&T carries debt of $84 billion against an equity market cap of $180 billion. Consolidated Edison carried debt of $12.6 billion against an equity market cap of $16.7 billion. If Visa were to carry the same proportional amount of debt, relative to equity, on its balance sheet as AT&T then Visa would need to issue more than $63 billion of debt. Due to the fact that Visa trades at a significantly higher enterprise value to EBITDA, 16.49 vs. 5.41, Visa cannot carry the same amount of debt as AT&T. However, Visa could carry about a third as much debt as AT&T. This would mean that Visa could potentially carry $21 billion worth of debt. Based on the same logic, MasterCard could carry about $13.6 billion worth of debt. While Visa and MasterCard are unlikely to raise as much debt as they possibility can, I believe it is not unreasonable for both companies to issue debt amounting to 10% of each company's respective equity value with the proceeds being used to buy back stock. For Visa, this would mean issuing $13.6 billion worth of debt and for MasterCard $8.8 billion worth of debt.ConclusionSome might argue that a buyback does not make sense given the fact that both Visa and MasterCard trade at about 20 times forward earnings, well above the S&P 500 average. However, due to the fact that Visa and MasterCard operate businesses with strong earnings visibility and reduced risk relative to most companies I do not believe these valuations are excessive. For this reason, I believe buying back shares at current valuations is a good move. Visa and MasterCard are good companies and I am positive on both stocks for the long term but over the short term I do not see a major catalyst to send shares higher unless they follow my prescribed plan or a similar plan."

It's a great recipe for achieving significantly high future yields-on-costs for investments that you make today.When researching for these kinds of companies, one company worthy of full diligence is MasterCard (NYSE:MA).For most of its trading history, MasterCard had no pretense of appeal for income investors. There was no dividend until 2006, and the dividend received in 2006 was only a penny (adjusting for the recent ten-for-one stock split). Then, the annual dividend remained static at the $0.06 mark until the end of 2011.But somewhere during the past couple of years, MasterCard began showing signs of taking its dividend payout to shareholders more seriously. The quarterly dividend doubled from $0.015 to $0.03 in the second quarter of 2012, then doubled again to $0.06 in the second quarter of 2013. Shareholders in 2014 were welcomed with yet another significant dividend increase, as the $0.06 quarterly dividend grew to $0.11 per share.Although the 30.5% dividend growth rate of the past five years is almost entirely the product of MasterCard's picayune dividend payout, the story of rapid dividend growth does not seem to be over yet: in relation to expected 2014 earnings of $3.10 per share, the current $0.44 quarterly payout still only amounts to 14% of current profits. Rather than doing something like pay out $1.50 in cash right now, the MasterCard Board seems to be employing the ""sliding approach"" of rapid dividend increases spread out over a decade or more (for comparison, see the change in McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) dividend payout from 2000 to 2013, as the payout ratio increased from the 15-20% range to the 50% range).But the appeal of MasterCard is not just the potential rise in the dividend payout ratio: the company is also increasing earnings per share quite rapidly. Every core metric for the company appears on solid footing right now: in the past two years, MasterCard has doubled its cash on hand from $2 billion to slightly over $4 billion. Revenues have been increasing at 14% annually because its MasterCard, Maestro, Cirrus, and MasterCard Electronic brands operate on the gross dollar volume model which means that increases in card spending is an automatic inflation hedge that automatically trickles to the company's bottom-line without the requirement of additional investment.In fact, MasterCard's reinvestment needs have declined in recent years as the company has been processing ever larger volume amounts without needing to set aside more capital for development of its credit infrastructure. To put numbers on it, you can see that operating margins have increased from 38.4% in 2008 to 47.0% at the end of 2013. This is what happens when your company benefits from people spending more money on cards but the cost of maintaining the infrastructure does not rise commensurately.But even though revenues are increasing at a 14% annual clip, the profits per share have actually been raising by a higher clip because MasterCard has a serious commitment to reducing share count through stock buybacks. At the time MasterCard started its buyback program in 2005, there were 1.35 billion shares outstanding. Now, that figure is down to 1.16 billion. In other words, only 85% of the shares exist today that did exist in 2005 (and some of this understates the true effect of MasterCard's buyback program, as it has issued stock for minor acquisitions in recent years that allowed shareholders to benefit from having new companies under the MasterCard corporate umbrella without having to experience overall share count dilution). The net effect for MasterCard in the past two years has been this: core profits have been increasing by 14% annually, but due to the additional effect of stock buybacks, profits per share have been increasing by 17-18%.The best hockey player of all time, Wayne Gretzky, once gave hockey advice that applies well to investing: ""I skate to where the puck will be, not where it is."" In the case of MasterCard, we have a very interesting opportunity in front us for dividend investors that are willing to accept a low payout now (the current dividend yield is still only 0.5%, thus putting it automatically off the radar of many investors interested in income who could get almost 4x the starting yield by merely investing in an index fund that tracks the S&P 500).The appeal of MasterCard is where its dividend will be ten years from now. You have a situation where a lot of positive forces are coming together: core profits are growing by double-digits, the growth in dollar volume transactions is increasing faster than MasterCard's capital expenditures, the stock buyback is taking 3-5% of the shares off the market per year, and the dividend payout ratio is in the early stages of double-digit growth as the current payout ratio is still only 14% of current profits. Based on those facts, you can draw your own conclusions if you prize rapidity of income growth over the current level of income generated.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is a technology company in the global payments industry. On 01May14, the company reported first quarter earnings of $0.73 per share, which beat the consensus analysts' estimates by $0.01. In the past year, the company's stock is up 33.9% excluding dividends (up 34.37% including dividends) and is beating the S&P 500, which has gained 18% in the same time frame. I just initiated my position today. With all this in mind, I'd like to take a moment to evaluate the stock on a fundamental, financial and technical basis to show that today was a good time to purchase the stock for my growth portfolio.FundamentalsThe company currently trades at a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 28.6, which is fairly priced, but I mainly like to purchase a stock based on where the company is going in the future as opposed to what it has done in the past. On that note, the 1-year forward-looking P/E ratio of 21.21 is currently fairly priced for the future in terms of the right here, right now. The 1-year PEG ratio (1.47), which measures the ratio of the price you're currently paying for the trailing 12-month earnings on the stock while dividing it by the earnings growth of the company for a specified amount of time (I like looking at a 1-year horizon), tells me that the company is fairly priced based on a 1-year EPS growth rate of 19.48%. The company has great near-term future earnings growth potential with a projected EPS growth rate of 19.48%. In addition, the company has great long-term future earnings growth potential with a projected EPS growth rate of 16.94%.FinancialsOn a financial basis, the things I look for are the dividend payouts, return on assets, equity and investment. The company pays a dividend of 0.58% with a payout ratio of 16% of trailing 12-month earnings while sporting return on assets, equity and investment values of 23.5%, 44.8% and 41.7%, respectively, which are all respectable values. Because I believe the market may get a bit choppy here and would like a safety play, I don't believe the 0.58% yield of this company is good enough for me to take shelter in for the time being.The really high return on assets value (23.5%) is important because it is a measure of how profitable the company is relative to its assets, telling us how efficient a management team is at using its assets to generate earnings [for comparison purposes, MasterCard has the highest ROA of all companies in the credit services industry followed by Visa (NYSE:V), which sports an ROA of 14.9%, and Qiwi plc (NASDAQ:QIWI), which sports an ROA of 14.1%].The really high return on equity value (44.8%) is an important financial metric for purposes of comparing the profitability, which is generated with the money shareholders have invested in the company to that of other companies in the same industry [for comparison purposes, MasterCard has the third highest ROE of all companies in the credit services industry behind Qiwi, which sports an ROE of 77.0%, and Western Union Co. (NYSE:WU), which sports an ROE of 76.1%].The really high return on investment value (41.7%) is an important financial metric because it evaluates the efficiency of an investment that a company makes and if an investment doesn't have a positive ROI then the investment should not be made (for comparison purposes, MasterCard has the highest ROI of all companies in the credit services industry followed by Qiwi, which sports an ROI of 30.3%, and Blackhawk Network Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAWK), which sports an ROI of 24.1%).TechnicalsLooking first at the relative strength index chart [RSI] at the top, I see the stock in middle-ground territory with a current value of 57.08. I will look at the moving average convergence-divergence [MACD] chart next. I see that the black line is above the red line with the divergence bars decreasing in height, indicating bearish momentum. As for the stock price itself ($76.35), I'm looking at $78.72 to act as resistance and $75.62 to act as support for a risk/reward ratio, which plays out to be -0.96% to 3.1%.Recent NewsConclusionThe quarter was great and was contradictory to Visa, hence the reason for purchasing it in my growth portfolio. However, I'd love to see the dividend at least in the 2% range, the free cash flow and the earnings can definitely support it. Fundamentally, the company is fairly priced based on next year's earnings estimate and on future growth potential. Financially, it has top of the line financial efficiency ratios but practically no dividend. On a technical basis, the reward outweighs the risk right now. Due to the high earnings growth expectations, lovely financial efficiency ratios, and the decent reward/risk ratio, I felt it was time to purchase my first batch in the stock today.Disclaimer: This article is meant to serve as a journal for myself as to the rationale of why I bought/sold this stock when I look back on it in the future. These are only my personal opinions and you should do your own homework. Only you are responsible for what you trade and happy investing!Disclosure: I am long MA, V.

2421115,41961,2014-08-13T20:52:04-04:00,Mobile payment volumes have been insignificant thus far due to standardization issues and operator control.Host Card Emulation opens up payment issuance to a wide range of participants.Mobile payments should generate incremental card volume which will benefit Visa and MasterCard.,"A payments revolution is slowly taking place with the shift away from physical card payments to mobile payments. Mobile commerce is still fairly small today, but the shift is expected to accelerate steadily, and mobile commerce should contribute close to $110B in U.S. retail sales by 2017.While this number may still seem fairly small in the context of total commerce volumes, the growth trends point firmly in the favor of the mobile device as a transaction mechanism and as the basis for card issuance by banks. Why is this?Increase in Basket SizeThe wholly grail of mobile payments is the ability to deliver real time insight and analytics at the point of sale. Practically, what this means for the retailer is the ability to increase the basket size by pushing consumers relevant related items to go along with their purchase at the time of checkout. For example, a $1 off coupon on a drink with a purchase of fries could stimulate a larger basket order than may otherwise be the case. This is done in a fairly clunky way today with paper based coupons, but the whole experience should be far more elegant in a mobile world.As such, mobile commerce payment volumes won't just be a straight replacement for volume that may otherwise have occurred on physical cards. The secret sauce here is that mobile should actually unlock purchase volume that likely wouldn't otherwise have occurred. It's impulse buying on a far bigger scale. For Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA), that means additional payment volumes running over their payment rails that they likely wouldn't have otherwise seen.Minimal Issuance cost for banksGetting plastic cards to subscribers comes at a cost for the banks. For a magnetic stripe card today, the physical cost and distribution of the card is roughly $1.00-$1.50. However the U.S. is about to join the rest of the world and embark on a journey down the path of EMV (EuroPay MasterCard Visa). Now EMV cards are far more sophisticated and have more elaborate encryption than traditional magnetic strip cards, but they also come at a far higher cost. Issuance costs for EMV cards are some $4-$5, making them quite expensive for banks to issue. Mobile issuance of EMV cards can be done at a fraction of the price, which is of significant value to the banks.In emerging markets, card issuance and distribution can cause significant challenges, where logistics may not be very good. Mobile delivery of credit cards to consumers will be a far more efficient mechanism for banks to deliver card credentials.Banks will be incentivized to push volume down the mobile channel to help reduce their cost structure.So where does host card emulation fit in, and what does it mean for Visa and MasterCard?While the benefits of mobile commerce and mobile payments volume are clear, growth of the mobile channel for card issuance has been fairly slow today.The reason for this has been largely because of issues around what the relevant payment interface standard should be at the point of sale to accept mobile payments.What has become clear now is that Visa and MasterCard have come down unambiguously in favor of NFC (Near Field Communications) by requiring merchant compliance with EMV. Visa and MasterCard have set requirements that merchants who do not support EMV based transactions by the end of 2015 will bear the cost of any fraudulent activity that happens as a result. This should drive merchants to deploy Point of Sale terminals that support EMV by the end of 2015.This is very significant from a mobile payments perspective, because NFC technology embedded within mobile phones operates on the same technical specifications as EMV. What this means is that NFC handsets can support mobile payments that occur using EMV infrastructure.While standards alignment now exists, one of the big roadblocks for banks in embracing mobile payments via an NFC infrastructure has been that mobile carriers such as AT&T (NYSE:T) have been exercising control of the secure element and charging banks hosting fees that banks have been reluctant to pay. Given that the mobile operators had a virtual monopoly on the secure elements within the mobile device and were reluctant to negotiate, this worked to limit the number of issuers willing to issue mobile payment credentials.The recent innovation for mobile payment volume has been the introduction of Host Card Emulation (HCE) into the mobile device. What this effectively does is create a secure element which is stored in the cloud as opposed to on the mobile device. The cloud based secure element isn't controlled by the mobile operators and is effectively open to use for anyone.This is significant for a couple of reasons. It means anyone can issue mobile payments credentials directly to the mobile device without needing to go through the mobile operator. For banks, this is important because it promotes low cost issuance of mobile credentials. Even more important, is that it allows the banks to control their own customer experience and not have to go through somebody else's wallet.What this will effectively mean is that there will be a lot more banks who will be driving mobile payment volume that goes over the payment rails of Visa and MasterCard.Implications for Visa and MasterCard stockThe implications of the introduction of HCE should lead to a steady uptick over time in mobile payment volumes processed on Visa and MasterCard rails. This is largely due to the ""larger basket size effect"" that I outline above. Mobile won't just replace physical card volumes. Rather it should lead to incremental growth of the pie.While this phenomenon will be slow to emerge, it will pick up speed as EMV terminal deployment accelerates within the U.S., and more NFC handsets become available in the hands of customers.While we are still some ways away from a tipping point in mobile payments volume, the eventual arrival of mobile payments at scale should prove a windfall for Visa and MasterCard.Disclosure: The author is long MA, V.

For investors with a long-term focus, this provides an opportunity to pick up two of the world's strongest franchises at fair valuations.Visa and MasterCard are known worldwide as the two dominant companies in the global payments industry. According to Visa's most recent annual report, Visa's market share is more than 50% globally, while MasterCard captures 33% of the market. Visa processes more than 58 billion credit and debit transactions annually; MasterCard processes more than 34 billion. Their brands are ubiquitous, and they're largely trusted by both businesses and consumers for the processing of payments.Each of these companies has rebounded well from the financial crises of 2008, with strong and consistent growth in revenue, earnings per share and dividends paid:Source: Morningstar.Since 2009, Visa has grown its revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 11.3%. MasterCard is close behind at 9.7%.Source: Morningstar.Visa has grown earnings per share at an annual rate of 30% since 2009; MasterCard at nearly 18%. While in the long term one would expect the growth in earnings per share to get closer to the growth in overall revenue, the outsized EPS growth since 2009 represents a strong comeback from the financial crisis.Source: Morningstar.The yields on both V and MA are pathetically low, with each yielding under 1%. V and MA can rightly be criticized for not sharing more of their earnings growth with their investors. Still, since 2009, V has grown its dividend at an annual rate of 25%, and MA by 39% on average each year (after nearly doubling its dividend last year).These are two companies with strong business models and globally recognized brands. Due to the reliability of their healthy earnings stream, these companies have generally traded at a premium to other stocks. But recently the stocks have each slipped more than 15% from their 52-week highs, and on Friday each stock declined 5% on news that economic sanctions on Russia could impact the companies' earnings in the short term. The sanctions imposed on Russia caused Visa and MasterCard to stop processing payments for some Russian banks. In response, Russia's president has called for Russia to establish its own payments system in place of Visa and MasterCard. Visa's CFO estimates that the events in Russia could reduce Visa's 2014 earnings by ""several pennies"" off of their expected earnings of more than $8 per share.In my view, the market's response to the events in Russia with respect to Visa and MasterCard is an overreaction. For investors with a longer range view than the next few quarters, this temporary weakness in V and MA shares provides an opportunity to own two of the dominant franchises in the global payments marketplace at fair prices. Certainly, even after the 5% declines on Friday, these stocks are not cheap: V still trades at a P/E of 25, MA at a P/E of 27. These shares would become even more attractive if they decline further based on short term geopolitical events.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2177973,23625,2014-04-30T14:48:49-04:00,,"MasterCard Inc. (NYSE:MA) is set to report FQ1 2014 earnings before the market opens on Thursday, May 1st. MasterCard is a global financial services company most well known for the debit and credit cards that bear its name. Last week peer and rival Visa (NYSE:V) reported much higher than expected earnings, but also missed its revenue target by $34 million, or over 1%. This quarter the Street expects MasterCard to report an earnings gain of 10c per share compared to FQ1 of last year and a year over year revenue increase of 12%. The frequency at which consumers are using credit cards is increasing and Visa and MasterCard stand to gain while many newcomers to the mobile and electronic payments industry are attempting to disrupt their business. Here's what investors expect from MasterCard this quarter.The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize.com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors.(Click Here to see Estimates and Interactive Features for Mastercard)The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for MasterCard to report 72c EPS and $2.138B revenue, while the current Estimize.com consensus from 39 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 72c EPS and $2.145B in revenue. This quarter the buy-side as represented by the Estimize.com community is expecting MasterCard to report in-line with Wall Street's expectations on EPS and come in slightly ahead of revenue projections.Over the past 6 quarters the consensus from Estimize.com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting MasterCard's EPS and revenue 4 times each. By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge-fund analysts, asset managers, independent research shops, students, and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69.5% of the time, but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market's actual expectations. It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant. Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus.The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market. In this case we are seeing a very small differential between the two groups' expectations on MasterCard's earnings.The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize.com platform range from 69c to 76c EPS and from $2.123B to $2.200B in revenues. This quarter we're seeing a wide range of estimates on MasterCard's EPS and a moderate range of revenue predictions.The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already. A wider distribution of EPS estimates signals less agreement in the market, which could mean greater volatility post earnings.This quarter the Wall Street and Estimize EPS consensuses for MasterCard both remained flat throughout the period. Meanwhile, the Wall Street revenue consensus also remained largely unchanged, while the Estimize consensus fell from $2.165B to $2.145B. Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and downward analyst revenue revisions going into an earnings report are often a bearish indicator.The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is turbinecity, who projects 73c EPS and $2.142B in revenue. turbinecity was our Winter 2014 season winner and is ranked 3rd overall among over 4,350 contributing analysts. Over the past 2 years turbinecity has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 60% and 54% of the time respectively throughout over 2000 estimates. Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy. In this case, turbinecity is expecting MasterCard to beat the consensus on EPS by a comfortable margin while reporting between the projections from Wall Street and Estimize on revenue.This quarter the Estimize community is expecting MasterCard to report a gain of 10c per share in earnings and a year over year revenue increase of 12.5%. The credit card companies are doing well right now and emerging payment technologies are starting to their set sights on the high transaction fees that Visa and MasterCard charge merchants. For the time being though, growth prospects for MasterCard look solid.Disclosure: None"

The company followed up the split with an earnings miss that further hit the stock. Suddenly, a stock that had ridden an uptrend for several years faces the reality that a bullish trend doesn't mean a never ending stock gain.MasterCard is the second largest payment processing network behind Visa (NYSE:V). The company connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, and businesses in more than 210 countries around the globe. Even after the recent stock weakness, MasterCard is still worth around $90 billion.Investors have long valued the promises of the shift from cash payments to credit card transactions around the globe, but the stock got to the point that investors didn't see any risks to the stock. Now virtual currencies such as Bitcoin hope to replace the payment processing networks of MasterCard and Visa. The high costs of those networks have businesses and consumers alike looking for alternative options leading to a potential loss in momentum for the stocks.Disappointing Q4On top of losing momentum with the stock split, MasterCard reported that Q413 earnings missed estimates due to higher costs. Below are the highlights from the earnings report:With analysts expecting earnings to reach $0.60, the $0.03 miss has analysts lowering 2014 and 2015 earnings estimates leaving the stock pricey for one losing momentum. The stock trades at roughly 25x current year earnings assuming those are even met.Margins Too High?The real key to understanding the MasterCard story is that revenue is only growing 12% and the payment processing market doesn't particularly appreciate the substantial 47.7% operating margins for the quarter. Even more incredible, the company generated an operating margin of 55.1% for full-year 2013. Margins this high place the company in the target sights of numerous companies hoping to grab a share of those profits.Even more incredible, Visa has an operating margin in excess of 60%. For a comparative purpose, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) have payment operations along with other strong businesses, yet their margins don't even approach those of the leading payment processors. See the below chart for a comparison of the operating margins over the last five years:MA Operating Margin (TTM) data by YChartsVirtual Currency ThreatWhile Bitcoin has hit several major bumps in the road recently, the interest in the payment method stems partly from the huge operating margins reported by MasterCard and Visa. Bitcoin or any other future digital or virtual currency will no doubt have as a selling point a lower cost to use than the current payment processing networks.According to bitcoin.org, using bitcoins has virtually no costs and allows for fast international payments. The coins allow for the removal of intermediate banks that typically require a wait of three business days. In addition, Bitcoin payments are irreversible and secure, meaning that the cost of fraud is no longer pushed onto merchants. Of course, the Mt. Gox bankruptcy and Bitcoin theft brings different fears to consumers of the virtual currency.The CEO of Overstock.com (NASDAQ:OSTK) is on record claiming that the use of Bitcoin helps the company save up to 2% on interchange fees. Patrick Byrne is always controversial and a notable early adopter of new technologies, but his move could hurt MasterCard's growth by pushing other retailers to accept the payment method.Within two months of accepting the cryptocurrency, the company has sold over $1 million in product to Bitcoin users. The impressive part is that almost 60% of the 4,300 Bitcoin customers were new to the retail site.ConclusionMasterCard remains a well-run company that has a high-class problem. Unfortunately, the stock has lost momentum due to the stock split and earnings miss, but ultimately it might face a bigger threat down the road. The emerging reality that virtual currencies might be here to stay could threaten the substantial operating margins that exceed 50%. With revenue only growing 12%, it won't take much of a margin hiccup to cause profits and the stock to stall.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

At the moment a customer and merchant attempt to finalize the purchase of a good or service, MasterCard's network very quickly electronically talks to the cardholder's financial institution (Issuer) and the merchant's financial institution (Acquirer) in order to clear and ultimately validate the transaction. Depending on a multitude of factors, an interchange fee is already negotiated between the Issuer and Acquirer. In the absence an agreement MasterCard gets standard. These Interchange fees can vary from 1.5% to 4% and are set by the financial institutions in the MasterCard network and simply passed through by MasterCard. In FY2013, MasterCard was paid a blended net average fee of approximately 20 basis points (or 0.20%) for every gross dollar value (GDV) processed through its network.To more vividly explain this; let's take a hypothetical domestic consumer purchase. A MasterCard cardholder goes to Target (NYSE:TGT) and purchases a $1,000 television and for simplicity let's says the interchange fee was 2%. So after clearing, process, and settlement, the merchant would get paid $980 instead of the $1,000. The next logical question is where does the $20 worth of revenue go and who benefits. Well, on average, MasterCard or a competing network gets paid $2 (20 bps), the Issuer (the cardholder's financial institution) gets about $15 or 150 bps, and the rest is split between the Merchant Service Provider, the hardware partner, and the Acquirer Bank (35 bps).Please note interchange fees vary largely based on the three factors below:Risks to the MasterCard bullish thesis:It is crystal clear after reviewing MasterCard's financial results from FY 2007 to 2013 that MasterCard is a simple business once you understand the above section. MasterCard gets paid an average of 20 bps for every gross dollar value that is processed over its network. So due to competition from direct competitors (Visa, American Express, and Discover Card), as well as emerging threat the likes of PayPal and many start-ups, MasterCard's pricing power is limited. For exhibit A of evidence, please refer to page 36 of MasterCard's 10-K which lists ""rebates and incentives"" as a percentage of gross revenue and lo and behold this number held steady at 26% YOY. To arrive at MasterCard's approximate revenue, you simply multiply GDV x approximately 20bps and you will get a very close revenue number. Beyond the competitive landscape, the biggest factor restricting MasterCard's pricing power is regulation.If you read the risk factors section of MasterCard's 10-K, it should be noted that as of July 2013, actual regulation in the European Economic Area (EEA) has placed explicit limits on MasterCard's including 30 bps per GDV for credit transaction and 20 bps per GDV for debit card transactions. Stemming from pressure from retailers and perhaps the political capital regulators accrue by slaying evil financial institutions, the trend and trajectory of regulation is in motion to reduce and cap interchange fees. Again, this inhibits MasterCard's pricing power. Moreover, in the U.S. and embodied in the proposed Dodd Frank legislation please read this quote taken directly from MasterCard's 10-K (page 16):What this means is that given the regulation backdrop and competitive threats from primary adversaries, MasterCard's pricing power is limited. Moreover, MasterCard's only growth lever is to win market share and ride the secular tailwinds of consumer's preference for transacting in plastics as opposed to cash and checks. Also, I haven't even started tilting at windmills and mention the army of Silicon Valley funded start-ups waiting in the wings with aspiration of disrupting MasterCard's profit pool.A picture is worth a thousand words, so let's take a look at three charts that I created using the data available from MasterCard's investor relations website. I'll make a few high level remarks and then let the readers draw their own conclusions.Through the lens of history, MasterCard has experienced quite impressive growth outside of the United States, led by APMEA and Other regions and very notable growth on an absolute dollar value basis in Europe. MA has clearly underperformed in the United States. Also, the major growth engine has been the use of debit cards, which as a group have experienced torrid growth. Credit card growth has been losing share to debit cards. Despite catchy advertising, pitched by celebrities offering the lure of enticing airline miles, rebates, and travel perks for consumers to use their cards, consumers are incrementally choosing debit cards.These graphs simply illustrate that MasterCard has an enterprise value of $82.6 billion based on its April 29th, 2014 closing price. According to its balance sheet, it generated $10.1 billion in earnings since inception and redeployed most of this capital back to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Also taking the data from my second graph, MA has operating cash flows of $4.135 billion in FY13, so its cash flow yield to current enterprise value is 5.1%, respectable but nothing to write home about.In the interest of a balance analysis, please find below my perception of the bullish and bearish cases.The Bull's case:The Bear's case:Valuation and Concluding RemarksMasterCard is still considered a growth stock, considering its low dividend yield and high valuation compared to its EV/Book. Therefore, the only thing that matters to growth investors is whether current earnings estimates are too optimistic or pessimistic. Let's look at them:Source: Yahoo FinanceMasterCard is trading at 23.2X FY14 earnings and 8.69X EV/FY14 revenue. This is quite expensive considering that investment banks and money center banks, yes different animals, but in the somewhat similar industries, are trading at much lower valuations. Moreover, Investment Banks and Money Center Banks will benefit if the global economy does finally turn the corner.So therefore, based on decelerating growth, a high valuation, and the risks of unresolved litigation, I would argue MasterCard is a sell at $72. If MasterCard does report better than expected results, as expectations are low going into the quarter based on last quarter's miss and Visa's disappointing earnings, I would sell into strength.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

American Express and Discover trade at or above fair value. (Full disclosure: Morningstar is an investor in YCharts.)Capital One's business model includes significant stakes in the straight-up banking world, so it is more of a hybrid credit services firm compared to the others.For a purer transaction-based plastic story, MasterCard is the best relative value in terms of perceived discount to fair value. And for a stock trading at a 10% discount to fair value in a pricey market MasterCard is anything but a basket case. In the first quarter transactions run through its payments system rose 14% to 9.8 billion, with revenue and net income also rising 14% year over year.And that's just continuing a longer-term trend, as strong income and earnings have pushed free cash flow up more than four fold over the past five years.MA Net Income (TTM) data by YChartsIn terms of valuation, Discover and Capital One trade at much more palatable multiples than MasterCard. That's because Discover and Capital One are mostly money lenders, and thus acutely vulnerable to the economy's ups and downs. MasterCard is a payment processor, letting banks that issue its cards take on the lending risk, and reaping an ever-increasing level of fees for itself. In short, MasterCard is a play on consumer spending; Discover and Capital One are plays on consumer creditworthiness.MA PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsIf its multiple gives you pause, MasterCard is a smart stock to keep an eye on for a possible pounce at the first sign of market weakness. But keep in mind there's a bit of analytical logic behind that higher multiple.MasterCard leads on return on equity (ROE):MA Return on Equity (TTM) data by YChartsAnd return on assets (ROA):MA Return on Equity (TTM) data by YChartsVisa bests MasterCard's operating margin, but both clearly set the pace for the industry group.MA Operating Margin (TTM) data by YChartsTrading at slightly larger discount to estimated fair value than Visa, MasterCard fits the bill of a great company selling at a fair price. Which as Mr. Buffett points out is preferable to a fair company selling at a great price. YCharts has also in recent weeks looked at eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and its PayPal payments operation, and at the activity in stock buybacks at American Express.Carla Fried, a senior contributing editor at ycharts.com, has covered investing for more than 25 years.

2078993,42201,2014-03-10T16:26:28-04:00,MasterCard is growing at a high pace outside of the United States.Its low dividend yield means this is not a stock for investors in need of income.High P/E and P/S ratios can be justified by strong growth.,"For today's article, I'd like to take a look at MasterCard (NYSE:MA). This global payment provider has seen its shares go up by 447% over the past 5 years, which is even more than its largest competitor Visa (NYSE:V), as can be seen in the next graph.(From Google Finance)Revenue and incomeMasterCard's revenue has increased in each of the past 5 years, reaching $8.34 billion in the most recent fiscal year (2013). A large part of this growth comes from outside of the U.S. Last year, GDV (Gross Dollar Volume) was up by double-digits in Europe, Latin America and APMEA (Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa), while GDV growth in the United States was only 6.6%.MasterCard's profit margin has gone up from 28.7% in 2009 to 37.3% last year, which means net income is growing at a far higher pace than revenue. Over the past 5 years, MasterCard saw its net income increase from $1.46 billion to $3.12 billion, while revenue went from $5.10 billion to $8.35 billion.Balance sheetMasterCard's balance sheet looks really good, with its current ratio at 1.82. The company has a large amount of cash and short-term investments, which is even more impressive when we consider the fact the company has no long-term debt.MA Cash and ST Investments (Quarterly) data by YChartsReturning money to shareholdersWith a current yield of 0.56%, MasterCard might not be the perfect stock for investors looking for high yields. Even Visa's dividend is higher (though 0.71% still isn't very much). However, MasterCard does return a lot of money to shareholders through the repurchase of stock. In fiscal 2013, the company bought back $2.44 billion worth of its own shares, meaning it spent almost 10 times as much on share buybacks as on dividends.MA Repurchase Cap. Stock (Annual) data by YChartsForward estimates and price targetsAnalysts expect MasterCard's earnings per share to reach $3.05 in the current fiscal year, giving the company a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 25.6. This is quite close to Visa, which has a forward P/E of 25.4. MasterCard's 5-year average P/E stands at 23.7.With revenues expected to reach $9.31 billion and a market cap of $125.60 billion, MasterCard's forward price-to-sales ratio is 13.5, which is quite a bit higher than its 5-year average of 7.9. Visa is currently valued at 11.0 times this year's expected revenue, making it a lot cheaper than MA.Analysts have an average price target of $89.70 for shares of MasterCard, which would be an increase of over 15% from current levels.ConclusionThough MasterCard is currently valued at higher multiples than its 5-year averages, I feel its strong growth in foreign markets makes it a great stock to hold for the next couple of years. MA spends a lot of money in share repurchases, which increases earnings per share. A dividend yield of 0.56% means investors looking for high income should stay away from MasterCard. However, if you've got time on your side, MasterCard might be a great investment over the next few decades.Disclaimer: I am not a registered investment advisor and do not provide specific investment advice.

2015171,50662,2014-02-12T13:56:51-05:00,,"Executive summary:_________________________________IntroductionAs I like the business model of credit card companies but had no idea if I should prefer Visa (NYSE:V) or MasterCard (NYSE:MA), I will compare both companies in this article, based on operational metrics, the situation of the balance sheet and the outlook for 2014 and beyond. Based on the comparisons in the different sub-paragraphs I will be able to form a conclusion at the end of this article.The financial resultsIn this paragraph, I will compare the financial results of Visa and MasterCard. I think it's fair to compare the companies based on their full-year results instead of the last completed quarter. As such, I will compare the FY 2013 results from Visa with the FY 2013 results from MasterCard.Let's start with the operating margin of both companies. MasterCard recorded operating income of $4.503B on total revenue of $8.346B, whilst Visa reported an operating income of $7.239B on total revenue of $11.778. This means that Visa actually wins this first round as it has a much higher operating margin than MasterCard.I'm moving over to the net margin now to see if the difference between the net margins between both companies is smaller than the operating margin. And Visa wins again here as its net profit of $4.98B results in a net margin of 42.3% which is substantially higher than MasterCard's 37.3%.The third and last point I'd like to discuss is the free cash flow ratio. The free cash flow is based on the operating cash flow minus the investment cash flow. For Visa's operating cash flow, I decided not to take the litigation expenses into account, as in the longer run these costs will not be recurring. This results in an operating cash flow of $7.4B and an investing cash outflow of close to $0.5B for a total free cash flow of $6.9B. I also decided not to take the sale and purchase of investment securities into account, so I just focused on capital expenditures. MasterCard reported an operating cash flow of $4.135B and spent just $300M in capex so its net free cash flow is approximately $3.835B.This means that at the current market capitalizations, Visa has a free cash flow yield of 4.93%, and MasterCard 4.18%. So Visa actually wins on all three accounts, as you can see in the following table which summarizes my findings.The Balance SheetsTo compare both balance sheets with each other, I will use the latest available filings, which means I will compare MasterCard's year-end balance sheet with the balance sheet of Visa at the end of its first quarter of FY2014.At the end of the most recent financial quarter, Visa was trading at approximately 5.2 times its book value, which isn't exactly cheap. However, MasterCard's valuation is even worse as the company is currently trading at 12.25 times its most recent book value. And once again, Visa is a clear winner. However, if I deduct intangibles and goodwill from the equity, MasterCard wins, as its intangibles total just $1.8B, while Visa's goodwill and intangible assets have a total value of approximately $23B. Taking this into account, MasterCard is trading at 16.2 times the tangible book value, while Visa is trading at approximately 35 times the tangible net assets.Moving over to the current ratio of both companies, both companies have healthy ratios with MasterCard once again outperforming Visa with a ratio of 1.81 versus 1.77 (keep in mind a ratio higher than one means the company has sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities). Granted, the difference is small, but MasterCard scores some valuable points here.Let's summarize the results again in a table.The outlookIn this paragraph I will compare the outlooks of both companies based on the average analyst expectations. I will look at the EBITDA growth over the next three years and the trend in operating margins. I will immediately summarize my findings in a table.So MasterCard will show a faster increase of EBITDA compared to Visa, which is relatively important. However, its operating margin will still be approximately 10% lower than Visa's operating margin in 2015.ConclusionBased on all metrics I analyzed in this article, I think Visa is a better buy than MasterCard at this point, despite MasterCard showing a higher EBITDA growth over the next few years and despite the fact that Visa has a lot of intangible assets on its balance sheet. As Visa will continue to expand its business, I expect the free cash flow (excluding investments other than capex) to be $10B by 2016.Does this mean I'll run out and buy Visa right now? No, I prefer to wait for a dip. There seems to be a technical support around the $200 level, and I would prefer to wait and pick Visa up around $200/share. Investors could also write put options while they are waiting. I'd particularly be looking at writing a P200 September 2014 for $8.70 which results in an annualized yield of almost 7%.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

Recently though, it has.MA data by YChartsRecent FinancialsRecent earnings were a bit of a disappointment to some, as EPS missed by $.03 and revenue missed by $20 million. Net margins were eaten into a bit during the quarter, due to both more incentives and rebates from MasterCard. Due to increased investments, operating costs increased 11% YOY. When including 1 time items, that number jumps to 21%.Still, there was a 14% increase in volume to $1.1 trillion, and processed transactions rose 13% to 10.4 billion. Further, net revenue growth was 13%, net income growth was 15%, and EPS were up 19% for 2013. The flight to plastic is still in full effect.Geographically, the company generates over half of its revenues from the United States and western Europe, but a significant portion of its growth has been coming from emerging markets. Fortunately, the shift to electronic payments is fairly immune to economic cycles, but it is not untouched by it. Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa Gross Dollar Value was up 20%, while Latin America was up 17%.PotentialThe potential for long-term growth is still intact. CEO Ajay Banga pointed out in 2010 how 85% of the world's transactions are still in currency format. Since then, near 9% growth a year has been seen in non-cash payments.33 countries compose 85% of the Earth's GDP. Countries such as Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom are nearly cashless. But many other large countries, such as Brazil and India, have many individuals still without even a bank account, and the middle class is growing rapidly.Prerequisites necessary in order to make the move to cashless transactions, involving technological innovations, are needed in some places. But many others are available markets. Governments also have incentives to help the process of transitioning to non-cash payments, as by some estimates cash usage costs societies 1.5% of their GDP.Of all the non-cash payment options, debit and credit cards remain the most popular. While their growth is healthy and in double-digit territory, it is surpassed by what it is being seen in electronic and mobile payments. Through 2014, industry experts expect E-payments to grow at 18.1%, and mobile payments to grow at 58.5% (note that some claim that due to a lack of centralized data collection, these numbers could be inflated by a factor of up to 50%).MasterCard is not absent of getting involved in these trends, as Masterpass demonstrates. As mentioned in the Q4 earnings call, they are now live in 5 markets with Masterpass, and many more are in the pipeline. More than 30,000 total merchants are on board. Major global retailers such as J.Crew, Brooks Brothers and Ticketmaster are among the major global retailers already accepting it.Share Repurchases and DividendsOver $750 million was spent to repurchase close to 10 million shares during the quarter. So far during the first 3 weeks of 2014, 4.2 million more shares at a cost of $351 million were repurchased. 41 million shares at a cost of $2.4 billion were bought back during all of 2013. This is after earning $2.76 billion in 2012. $3.3 billion remains in the approved budget for future stock repurchases.MasterCard spends nearly all of its earnings returning value to shareholders. Due to the nature of its business, including no debt, it can afford to. In conjunction with its announced 10 for 1 stock split, MasterCard also increased its dividend 83%.ConclusionWith such a large amount of opportunities, MasterCard can experience substantial growth even if it only captures a small fraction of available customers. The emerging middle class over the next decade will be in the hundreds of millions, creating huge profits for the industry.MasterCard is not super-extravagantly priced. But, currently at a bit less than 29x trailing earnings and with a forecast 12 month forward PEG ratio of 1.35, the stock is definitely not cheap, either. Following the Buffett adage, ""It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price,"" that doesn't disqualify it from being invested in, though. Part of the problem with waiting for the perfect entry point with a stock like MasterCard is that often doesn't come, and investors are left on the sidelines watching a stock they were interested in, but didn't purchase, rise greatly.This recent correction is the first over 10% since the 2nd quarter of 2012, and nothing has changed regarding the outlook of the company. Based on a slight miss in numbers in an otherwise excellent quarter, the price decrease isn't really justified, but it is giving MasterCard a healthy breather, and a chance to pick up some extra shares.Disclosure: I am long MA.

This is best done by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another company. By using the ModernGraham method one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries. What follows is a specific look at how Mastercard fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.MA data by YChartsDefensive Investor - must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 2/7Enterprising Investor - must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a defensive investor: Score = 5/5Valuation SummaryKey Data:Balance Sheet - 12/31/2013Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryMA Dividend data by YChartsConclusion:Mastercard Inc. is suitable for the Enterprising Investor but not the Defensive Investor. In fact, the only requirements of the Defensive Investor that the company satisfies are the market cap level and the earnings growth over the ten year period. That said, the company passes all of the requirements of the Enterprising Investor, and that investor type should feel comfortable proceeding with further research into the company and its competitors through a review of ModernGraham's valuation of Visa (NYSE:V) and 5 Low PEmg Companies for the Defensive Investor.From a valuation perspective, the company appears to be fairly valued. The company has shown strong growth, having brought EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $0.50 in 2009 to $2.00 for 2013. This demonstrated level of growth supports the market's implied estimate of 15.35% earnings growth and leads the ModernGraham valuation model to return an estimate of intrinsic value that falls within a margin of safety in relation to the price.The next part of the analysis is up to individual investors, and requires discussion of the company's prospects.

2044303,62133,2014-02-24T16:29:45-05:00,,"Last month, as I was flying from NYC to India for a business meeting, my company sent a cab from the usual taxi service we've been using for years. The only problem with this cab service is that they don't accept cards (cash only). But this time was different. At the airport, the cab driver took out his smartphone, plugged in his Square device, asked me for the tip amount, and it was done. As I settled in after the security check, I started to think about Square, Inc., which is planning to go public in 2014. I realized that the biggest beneficiaries of growth in mobile payments will be payment processing companies, such as MasterCard (NYSE:MA).MasterCard's Past GrowthMasterCard is the world's second-largest processor of electronic payments, with global credit transactions market share of 33.5% and global debit transactions market share of 19%. Most people relate MasterCard to the financial services industry, whereas it is largely a technology company that uses its network to process millions of transactions between issuers and merchants every day. The company, which was founded in 1996, went public in 2006 at $39 per share and since then has provided its shareholders a cumulative return of almost 1,600%. This is a tremendous ROI for a company that has grown revenues by an average of 13%-22% in the same period. Despite this growth, the company is still in the early stages of growth. Its growth drivers are picking up pace, thus offering a nice entry point for those who want to invest in a safe, established technology company with a proven business model and fairly high barriers to entry.Annual Revenue Growth for MasterCardSource: WikiInvest.MasterCard Future Growth DriversGlobal personal expenditure consumption is expected to rise by 4%-5% in the next five years, and that has an immediate impact on the growth of payment processing companies such as MasterCard. Any economic slowdown (as we are witnessing among certain European and emerging countries) has a direct influence on the top-line growth of these companies. However, there are other, non-obvious growth drivers that will continue to drive the double-digit revenue growth for MasterCard for the next five to 10 years, with little impact from cyclical factors. These growth drivers could largely be categorized into three areas:1. Global migration from cash to electronic payments: Despite the significant growth in electronic payments in the last decade, 85% of global transactions still happen in cash and check form (56% in developed countries and 93% in developing countries). Excluding the U.S. and Northern Europe, the global transition from cash to electronic payments has happened rather slowly and insignificantly in the last decade. However, this is changing quickly, and apart from the obvious economic factors that are increasing the spending power of people in emerging markets, the biggest impetus behind the growth in global electronic payments is coming from governments throughout the world that have a vested interest in expediting this transition. This is because any reduction in a cash-based system in an economy adds a few more basis points to a country's GDP, as a result of the increased tax revenue and savings from printing lesser currency.This sentiment was recently conveyed by the CEO of MasterCard, Ajay Banga, on the company's Q4 2013 earnings conference call:For instance, in 2012, the Italian government passed a law that requires all business transactions above 1,000 euros be done electronically. This has helped the government collect more tax revenue in 2013. Similarly, the governments in Nigeria and South Africa have issued biometric cards, in partnership with MasterCard, to distribute subsidies and welfare among their people. While these programs were intended to make sure that the full benefits pass down the system to the recipients, they have also helped MasterCard bring in more revenue from the emerging markets by increasing consumers' reliance on payment cards.Recently, the company signed an agreement with EcoBank, the largest pan-African bank which reaches 65% of the African population. As per the agreement, the bank will issue MasterCard-based credit, debit, prepaid, and other payment solutions in 23 countries in Africa. Similarly, in India, the government is in the process of issuing biometric cards to each of its citizens (program Aadhar) and is investing in its payment infrastructure to minimize tax evasion.2. Mobile payments: In 2013, the global value of transactions facilitated by mobile devices is estimated at $235 billion, of which $37 billion worth of transactions were generated in the U.S. alone. This number grew by 44% from $160 billion in 2012 and is estimated to rise to $721 billion by 2017 at an annual growth rate of 35%. Although much of the earlier growth in electronic payments came from developed countries, the growth in mobile payments will be fueled by the increased mobile penetration in emerging countries. This is due to the fact that in Africa and South East Asia, mobile payments serve as an alternate route of economic activity, since banking infrastructure is poor or nearly nonexistent. Some may argue that the growth in mobile payments will offer little benefit to the card payment companies, as consumers are just changing the channel here, but the payment method is still the same, since these are the same people who were using the electronic cards for most transactions anyway.However, the idea here is that the growth in mobile payments will help boost the worldwide speed of adoption of electronic payments. For example, in India 90% of the retail stores are still mom and pop stores that do not take credit or debit cards. However, many of these mom and pop stores will prefer to accept and process cards via mobile in the future (using devices like Square), since the infrastructure cost of doing so is almost negligible. All this is bolstered by the fact that the mobile penetration in many of these developing countries has already surpassed the internet penetration, thus providing an upper hand to the mobile payments. MasterCard has recognized this opportunity and is working aggressively with telecoms throughout the world to upgrade their infrastructure in order to allow for the safer and seamless mobile payment transactions.3. Co-branding and digital analytics: The third and probably the least known area of growth for MasterCard is its co-branding and digital analytics business. The co-branding business allows MasterCard to leverage its technology to provide credit services to loyal customers of different companies. The co-branding business is a significant business in the U.S. that is growing at a double-digit growth rate. MasterCard is a leader in this space, winning almost 60% of the total brand market share over the past 12 months, and the company is expanding aggressively by signing more deals and leveraging its data analytic capabilities to provide a greater value to its customers. The company recently signed a deal with American Airlines, the world's largest airline (after its merger with United Airlines), and is at the forefront of product innovation in the co-branding business. In the future, I see opportunities for the company to go beyond larger companies and partner with local businesses (through partnership with companies like Yelp), as well as benefit from the growth in rewards program industry.With the above-mentioned growth drivers, and the rise in global income, MasterCard has a long runway for growth and possibilities ahead of it. For these reasons, MasterCard is an investment for every long-term serious investor who wants a less risky, high-growth technology investment in his or her portfolio.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1989821,24699,2014-02-03T17:37:31-05:00,,"MasterCard Inc. (NYSE:MA) is one of the main global credit card carriers that specialize in mobile and electronic payment processing. The firm competes against the likes of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS), and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP). MasterCard like its peers is basically an intermediary between consumers, financial institutions, and merchants. These firms make money basically by charging a fee to the bank that is issuing the card and swipe fees. Firms like American Express that also function as a bank can make money in three different ways.1. The fee that is charged to the merchant for providing the consumer with the convenience of taking the credit card. This fee can vary a great deal ranging from 1% to 4% of the transaction cost.2. Fees charged to the card holder. These can include the annual fees, over limit fees, and missed payment fees.3. Interest is another major revenue generator. Interest is charged monthly to the card holder when a balance is carried from month to month.When MasterCard reported a 4th quarter miss this past week the company's shares slid 5.2% to $75.68 per share. The firm reported that net income had risen 3% to $623 million, which translated to $0.57 per share. This report missed the $0.60 per share consensus estimate that analysts had hoped MasterCard would deliver. The main reason that was cited for the miss was an increase in expenses this past quarter as the company spent more on marketing and reinvesting in its people.Compared to its peers MasterCard was the only one of the four major card companies to report a significant quarterly miss. Visa reported a profit increase of 8.8% to $1.41 billion. Discover reported an increase of 12% to $602 million. American Express did miss estimates by a penny, but the firm also doubled its profit on higher consumer spending, so the negative news was a bit muted.Given that news it is easy to see why the market pushed MasterCard down on Friday. I view the recent turn down as an excellent buying opportunity and feel that MasterCard's quarter results really were not all that bad. Below are the main reasons why I am still very bullish on MasterCard and feel it should be bought on its recent price weakness.1. Both MasterCard and Visa last month won approval to settle the ongoing litigation that the companies had been fixing card swipe fees for $5.7 billion. Removing this unknown from the equation is a big win and will allow the company to get back to focusing on growth.2. MasterCard grew its net revenue by 12% this past quarter to $2.1 billion. MasterCard generates majority of its profits outside of the U.S., and this past quarter processed transactions having increased by 13% to $10.4 billion this quarter a big chunk of that was driven by the increases seen in cross-border spending volume, which increased 18%.3. Full year EPS for MasterCard came in at $2.62 per share, this represented an 18.6% increase over the $2.21 that was generated in 2012. The firm also increased its operating margin to 55.1% up from the 53.5% the year prior.4. MasterCard continues to return value to its shareholders through an increased dividend and share buyback plan. Back in December the firm announced that it would be increasing the quarterly dividend by 83% to $1.10 a share (pre-split price), while also increasing its share buy-back program by another $3.5 billion.5. Fundamentally MasterCard is a rock solid company. The firm has no debt, generates free cash flow of almost $4 billion, currently has $6.3 billion in cash on the balance sheet, and sports a growth rate in the double digits.All of these stats are very telling, but the real question is why should you buy MasterCard over Visa, Discover, or Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) favorite American Express. Below I have created a chart that compares these four companies against one another with a ranking being provided for each metric that will help highlight why MasterCard is still in very solid footings compared to its peers and should not be underestimated.** Scale is 1-4 with 4 being the highest score possibleBased on the rating above Discover is the best all-around company given that all metrics are rated equally. I did not apply any weight to these metrics because that weight would be based on my own investment preference and I didn't want to blow up the comments section of this article about how my weighting is wrong, so I will leave that up to you.If I were to apply a weighting the three metrics that I would put the most weight on would be profit margin, return on equity, and free cash flow. Since in my investing style that is where I like to focus my attention. When examining these three metrics my scoring would have generated the following:· American Express - 8· MasterCard - 10· Discover - 5· Visa - 7Based on that scoring it is clear to see why I prefer MasterCard's fundamentals over those of the other three. Additionally, given the reasons that I highlighted above on the company's performance and the strong growth projections that management provided I think that this current hick-up in pricing is a gift and should be bought.Disclosure: I am long MA.

1986541,25381,2014-02-01T05:08:37-05:00,,"On Friday, MasterCard (NYSE:MA) announced its quarterly results and many investors were not happy at all with these results. The company earned $684 million or 57 cents per share on revenues of $2.12 billion for the quarter as the gross dollar volume increased by 14% and purchase volume increased by 12% year-over-year. Many investors were looking for stronger growth rates and they are concerned that the company's growth is slowing down. Others are wondering if the slowdown is due to the global economy and whether it had anything to do with MasterCard at all. Given that most retailers like Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) failed to beat the estimates during the holiday season, those who are blaming the global economy rather than the company might be on to something.The transactions for the quarter totaled $1.1 trillion with cross-border volumes rising faster than the overall volumes (18% vs. 11%). There are now over 2 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards that were issued by the company.During the quarter, MasterCard had to offer more rebates and incentives than usual, which ate into the company's net margins. The company's higher investments, new hiring and marketing initiatives in the fourth quarter increased the operating costs by 11% year-over-year. This excludes one-time items, inclusion of which would grow the operating costs by 21% compared to the previous year.For the full-year, MasterCard earned a net income of $3.2 billion or $2.61 per share, which indicates a growth rate of 15% (or 19% if we factor the reduced dilution due to share repurchases) compared to the previous year. This excludes one-time items, such as the litigation charges and expenses that occurred in 2012 and 2013. MasterCard generated $8.3 billion in revenues for the full-year of 2013, indicating a revenue growth of 13%. Since the company's revenue growth was slower than its earnings growth, we are looking at a margin expansion for the year of 2013. For the full-year of 2013, gross dollar volume was up by 14%, cross-border volume was up by 18% and processed transaction was up by 13%. Again, rebates, incentives and increased marketing costs ate into the company's profit margins to offset some of the gains. For the full-year, operating expenses rose by 9% excluding one-time items and 11% including one-time items. MasterCard's operating margin for the full-year was as high as 55.1%.During the year, the company's cash rose from $2.05 billion to $3.60 billion, with about $723 million additional cash in restricted accounts that were set aside for the litigation settlement charges faced by the company. The company has another $2.70 billion in highly-liquid assets. During the year, settlement due from customers rose from $1.12 billion to $1.35 billion. This could be due to more customers having trouble with paying their bills, another signal about the state of the global economy. The company's settlement due to customers rose at an even faster rate from $1.06 billion to $1.43 billion. MasterCard's total assets rose from $12.46 billion to $14.24 billion for the full-year, which indicates a growth of 14%. Meanwhile, the company's liabilities rose from $5.53 billion to $6.75 billion, a growth of 22%. MasterCard continues to be debt free and the company's book value is now $7.50 billion, up from $6.92 billion a year ago.MasterCard spent $751 million in order to repurchase 9.8 million shares during the quarter. In addition, the company bought another 4.2 million shares at $351 million in the first 24 days of this year. For the full-year of 2013, the company bought back 41 million shares, spending $2.4 billion. MasterCard still has about $3.3 billion in the approved budget for stock repurchases and it will be making more repurchases throughout 2014. The company recently had a stock split, which brought the stock price to $70s from $700s.After Friday's sell-off, MasterCard's market value is about $90 billion or $75 per share. Given the company's $2.57 per share in net earnings, MasterCard currently trades for 29 times its trailing earnings. If the company can continue to grow its earnings in double-digits, this P/E may be deserved but if the growth slows down any further, investors might start cashing out at faster rates. In 2012, MasterCard earned $2.76 billion and the company spent $2.4 billion in the following year (as mentioned above) on stock purchases. In 2013, it earned $3.1 billion and it is scheduled to spend about $3.3 billion in stock repurchases. As you can see, MasterCard spends nearly all of its earnings on stock purchases and returns value to shareholders even though the dividend yield is below 0.60%. The analysts expect MasterCard to earn $3.11 this year and $3.68 next year. If the company keeps growing its earnings in double-digits and continues to repurchase its stocks in large numbers, it will continue to be a good investment for most investors. The next few quarters of MasterCard will tell us a lot about not only the company, but also about the state of the global economy.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1943481,22148,2014-01-14T04:19:17-05:00,,"The upcoming stock split could interrupt the relentless gains by MasterCard (NYSE:MA). While performing a split technically has no financial impact on investors, the mechanics of the split greatly impacts the psyche of investors.As most everybody knows, MasterCard operates a payments processing network, connecting consumers, financial institutions, merchants, and businesses in more than 210 countries around the globe. The company competes against Visa (NYSE:V) in a near duopoly for the processing of credit card payments.Investors might find it surprising that MasterCard is now worth $100 billion and Visa tops out at around $145 billion. Most people see the fees charged by these payment processors as excessive giving rise to the bitcoin and privately held Square that attempt to supplant these services and costs.Stock Split ThesisThe theory of the stock split dates back to a time when trades were made in round lots of 100 shares. Having to purchase 100 shares of a $100 stock would prevent most investors from the market making a stock split a requirement to keep the price low enough. In the 1990's, stock splits occurred on a routine basis with the bull market pushing stocks higher and higher. The market was so irrational at the time that stocks that split typically had a big run prior to he actual split.The definition of a stock split from Investopedia:One of the consequences of the stock split mania back in the 1990's has been an almost negativity placed on the concept. Stocks no longer split considering the clear evidence of the high prices of popular tech stocks Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).Baron's noted that only 14 firms split their shares in 2013. The number is near the all-time low and far below the average of 50 since 1980.MasterCard Split DetailsBack on December 10, MasterCard announced plans to execute a 10-for-1 stock split of the common stock with a record date of the close of business on January 9, 2014. Consequently the shares outstanding will increase from 120 million to 1.2 billion. As well, the company announced an increase in the share repurchase plan to $3.5 billion and an 83% increase in the dividend to $1.10 on a pre-split basis.In reality, the split does nothing other than convert 100 shares into 1,000. The value in a brokerage statement will be the same the following day. The stock though surged on the announcement and the limited dividend and share buyback couldn't have done the trick. Remember that MasterCard is an $800 stock with a $100 billion market value. A $3.5 billion share buyback doesn't go far and a $1.10 dividend doesn't add up very fast.Considering the large gains over the last several years, MasterCard might be setting up a peak in the stock. How many investors that will have 1,000 shares might sell 100 shares to lock in profits? This constant drip of shares from investors lock in small portions of profits will impact the supply and demand balance for the stock.Fundamental QuestionFor a financial with a market cap of $100 billion and a bigger competitor, MasterCard trades at a lofty valuation of nearly 27x forward earnings. Even more concerning is the 12x sales multiple. As an entrepreneur, the payment processing sector would have a wide appeal considering the extraordinary margins generated by the duopoly of MasterCard and Visa. MasterCard generated an astounding operating margin of 56% during Q313.The chart below shows a similar pattern to the initial gains from the V.F. Corp (NYSE:VFC) more traditional four-for-1 stock split. MasterCard gaped up on the day of the announcement and hasn't looked back.The retailer saw the similar gap up followed by strong gains up to the point of the split. Since the new shares started trading on Dec. 23, the stock has hit the pause button. MasterCard investors might be wise to follow VF Corp over the next month to see if it doesn't rollover. The gap up and subsequent gains weren't warranted based solely on the meaningless split news.ConclusionBoth MasterCard and Visa are leading the cashless revolution around the world, but new options are starting to pop up to supplant that dominance. The news that Overstock.com (NASDAQ:OSTK) raked in $126,000 in first day sales from allowing bitcoins could be a sign of a direct attack on the high margins of payment processors. The $100 billion market cap, operating margins with nowhere to go but down, and the 10-for-1 split just might be the bell ringing the top in MasterCard.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1917711,23478,2013-12-26T18:20:40-05:00,,"By Dee GIllUp there in the thin air of a momentum market, where the likes of TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) fly, it’s shocking to find an old-school financial company, MasterCard (NYSE:MA).MA data by YChartsMasterCard is hardly a baby. It’s a $96.28 billion market cap company well past an adolescent growth spurt. Yet its share price is up 64% this year, and investors now are paying almost as much on a forward price-to-sales basis for MasterCard shares as they do for some really popular newbies.MA PS Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsThat’s a record-level sales valuation for MasterCard. Its forward PE ratio of about 31 is nearing record levels also.MA PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsWhat’s wrong with this picture? Is MasterCard in the wrong place? Or, could its market valuation be justified, and the only thing suspect about the situation is that it’s up there with stocks that trade on hype and hope?First, MasterCard warrants a higher valuation than normally seen in huge companies, at least at the moment. MasterCard collects fees on credit card transaction instead of lending money. As YCharts wrote last February, that’s a booming business that MasterCard is well positioned to profit greatly from.The company recently announced an 83% rise in its dividend (although it’s still a less than 1% dividend yield), a major stock buyback plan and a 10-for-1 stock split. Assuming MasterCard hits fourth quarter targets, revenues are forecast to grow about 12% next year and earnings about 18%. While there may be a case to be made for MasterCard shares as overvalued, there are a lot of reasons to like the shares.Secondly, one needn’t worry that MasterCard reached this high valuation because all mega-caps are jacked up. Sure, shares of Visa (NYSE:V) are also well up for similar reasons. But only a half dozen mega-cap stocks trade above MasterCard’s valuation. Setting the YCharts Stock Screener finds that almost half of the 64 mega-cap companies in the database trade at forward price-to-earnings ratios of less than 15, which has been a pretty average valuation for the market in recent years.These include shares from a variety of sectors and include popular investments like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Exxon (NYSE:XOM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK).AAPL data by YChartsOn an historic basis, the S&P 500's average price to earnings ratio remains at a modest level.S&P 500 Cyclically Adjusted Price-Earnings Ratio data by YChartsThat sharp rise at the end of the line above reminds us that it is, actually, prudent to worry about whether the stock market is entering dangerous bubble territory. But there are better ways to monitor this than tracking the gains of an individual share. YCharts outlined several stock market correction metrics worth watching in a piece earlier this month.Disclosure: None."
1890981,25319,2013-12-11T05:29:29-05:00,,"It is no secret that MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V) compete with each other for consumers' dollars. They also compete for investors' dollars. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that MasterCard has just announced a big hike to its annual dividend a couple of months after Visa's announcement. Here are a few quick details from MasterCard's announcement:We recently profiled Visa as a potential income stock for investors with a long time horizon. It is hard to look at stocks like Visa and MasterCard that yield less than 1% as potential income stocks. But let us look at a few points why MasterCard might deserve a place in your portfolio, especially from the total returns point of view.Since these two companies compete so much with each other, it is only fair that MasterCard is evaluated for the same points that we evaluated Visa recently. Let us get into the details.Dividend History: MasterCard has been paying dividends since October 2006 (the year it became a public company) and has not missed a quarterly payment since, not even during the 2008/2009 crisis. In this time period, the quarterly dividend per share has grown more than ten folds from 9 cents to $1.10.Payout Ratio: The new annual dividend of $4.40 per share gives MasterCard a payout ratio of 17%, based on trailing twelve months EPS of $25. This is much lower than Visa's already low 28%. Obviously there is a lot of room for dividend growth here.Dividend Growth Rate: Visa just recently met the minimum 5 year dividend growth threshold that some income investors look for. MasterCard has some catching up to do here. Although the dividend has grown more than 10 times the initial 9 cent payout, there is a no set dividend growth pattern yet. For example, dividend was steady at 15 cents/quarter from 2007 till Jan 2012 but has since been increased from 15 cents to 30 cents to 60 cents to $1.10 in less than 2 years.Buybacks: Tuesday's buyback announcement is not MasterCard's first and it certainly won't be the last. The share count has gone down from a high of 136 Million to 120 Million in about 5 years. That represents a 12% reduction in share count.What is impressive about MasterCard as well as Visa is the fact that they both buyback shares with their profits and not on debt. Both companies carry a big fat zero debt. As mentioned in the Visa article, it is no irony that a company that deals with credit card services carries no debt. (Source: YCharts.Com)Extrapolation and Future Returns: This section is a bit harder as MasterCard hasn't really yet shown the dividend growth pattern that is found in Visa. But just to make the comparison with Visa an even tussle, the table below assumes an annual dividend growth rate of 12% for the first five years and 8% per year for the next 5 years.The yield on cost almost triples for the patient long term investor. Sure, that does look low on paper but the assumptions above are beyond conservative given the last 3 dividend hikes (83%, 100%, and 100%). Of course this frenetic pace will not continue forever but we expect the dividend growth to be pretty impressive.Note: Table above adjusted for the just announced 10:1 stock split.Earnings Potential and Future Estimates: The comparisons and similarities with Visa just don't end. Like Visa, this is also a company that has been in existence for about half a century but is still seen as a growth company/stock. MasterCard is expected to grow its earnings at 18% per year over the next 5 years.If the company grows earnings even at 10% per year over the next 5 years, we are looking at an earnings per share of $4 (post-split). Even if the company maintains the current low payout ratio of 17%, we are looking at a quarterly dividend of 17 cents per share in 5 years, which is about 50% higher than the current 11 cents per share.(Source: Finance.Yahoo.Com)Conclusion: MasterCard is a company/stock that has a lot of great characteristics for investors, including:If forced to pick either Visa or MasterCard, we will pick Visa just because of its clear dividend growth pattern. But there is no question that both stocks deserve your attention if you are looking for a strong dividend, dividend growth, and earnings growth candidate (meaning a powerful total return candidate). However, given the 60% run the stock has had in the past 52 weeks, we suggest waiting for a pullback before pulling the trigger, unless you are willing to treat it as a very long term holding.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1891851,53552,2013-12-11T10:56:42-05:00,,"After rallying more than 55% so far in 2013, shares of MasterCard (NYSE:MA) picked up another 3% after hours thanks to several shareholder friendly announcement (available here). While the march to $1,000 has been delayed, perhaps indefinitely, should investors buy MA after its buyback, dividend, and stock split announcement?(Click to enlarge)First, MasterCard is doing a 10:1 stock split. While this could add some liquidity and make investors more interested in the stock as many don't like buying a stock priced above $700, the stock split is neither a reason to buy or sell shares. Stocks are not expensive based upon their price but based upon their valuation compared to fundamentals. MA has earned $25.30 the past twelve months and is at $763. After the stock split, it will have earned $2.53 and be priced at $76.3. Every ratio remains the same, prices and per share data just move a decimal place. An investor who wasn't a fan of MA before the split should not become bullish because of the split.Why then did shares rally 3% on the news? I hope it is not because of the stock split but the other two announcements. First, MA is increasing its dividend by 83% to $1.10 (or $0.11 after the split). While that is a nice hike, that is still a meager 0.58% yield. With 20% EPS growth and 13% revenue growth, MA pays out a small fraction of its earnings (14% of next year's projected EPS). In total, the dividend will cost $520 million. Management would clearly rather reinvest in the business than make dividend payments to shareholders, and with the growth rates in the payment business as plastic takes shares from cash in emerging markets, I fully understand. While the yield is not compelling on its own to buy shares, I would expect continued annual hikes of at least 50% for several more years. Management will need to raise the payout by 20% just to keep the payout ratio the same, and I expect over time as MasterCard matures and slows down, a higher payout ratio will be targeted. Strong dividend hikes are a positive, even if they currently account for very little return.Finally, MasterCard authorized a $3.5 billion buyback program that will begin when the previous $2 billion program is exhausted. $514 million remains on that program, so MA plans to buy back a little more than $4 billion in stock or 4.4% of outstanding shares. MA has $6 billion in cash on the balance sheet, so this is a significant program, though with $4.5 billion in annual operating cash flow it is certainly sustainable.The $2 billion buyback was announced this past February, so this buyback was unexpected only 10 months later. Over the past 10 months, MA has repurchased $1.93 billion in shares, and I would expect the vast majority of the company's current authorization to be used in the next 12 months, meaning a nearly doubling of the pace. Between the dividend and buyback, MA will be returning about 80% of cash flow to shareholders in the next 12 months, which shows an increasingly shareholder friendly management.While some investors might prefer a higher dividend, I am happy that management is devoting the majority of resources to the buyback. Management has consistently offered a bullish view of the business, and 20% expected EPS growth in 2014 is indicative of that. As emerging markets develop, debit and credit cards will be the de facto form of payment as they are in the United States. As MasterCard and Visa (NYSE:V) expand into these markets, collecting swipe fees, potential growth is tremendous with the only competition, not cash, but the potential for mobile payments systems like PayPal (NASDAQ:EBAY) on a phone. With so much growth ahead, investors will do better with a share buyback and smaller share count than a dividend.With a growing but nascent dividend and major buyback announced, it is easy to see why shares of MA rallied after hours even with the fanfare on the stock split, which has no bearing on the company's value. These actions will provide incremental returns to shareholders while accelerating EPS growth beyond net income growth. With so much growth potential overseas, I see 20% EPS growth for MA for 3-5 years and $31-$32 in EPS in 2014. With that type of growth and market opportunity, I think a PEG ratio of 1.5x is appropriate for a 30x P/E multiple. I like MA here with upside to $950 in 2014. Even after the pop, MA has further upside, though given the massive run, I can understand waiting for a pullback.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1981441,23625,2014-01-30T14:16:18-05:00,,"MasterCard Inc. (NYSE:MA) is set to report FQ4 2013 earnings before the market opens on Friday, January 30th. MasterCard is a global financial services company most well known for the debit and credit cards that bear its name. Before the opening bell on Thursday fellow credit company Visa (NYSE:V) posted stronger than expected earnings and reported an increased frequency in card use. An expanding middle class in emerging markets is predicted to be an area of growth for MasterCard, however recent turbulence in Turkey, Argentina, Ukraine and other emerging economies could cause a set back. Additionally Master is expected to benefit from new technologies such as Stripe and Square which are making it easier for customers and businesses to transfer money using credit cards over the internet. Here is what investors expect MasterCard to report on Friday.The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize.com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors.(Click Here to see All Estimates for MasterCard)The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for MasterCard to report 60c EPS and $2.134B revenue while our current consensus from 27 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 62c EPS and $2.162B revenue. This quarter the buy-side as represented by our community is expecting MasterCard to beat the Street’s expectations on both profit and revenue.The magnitude of the difference between Wall Street's and our consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market. In this case we are seeing an average differential between the 2 groups’ EPS forecasts.Over the previous 6 quarters the aggregate consensus from our community has been more accurate in forecasting profit and revenue 5 and 4 times respectively. By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge-fund analysts, asset managers, independent research shops, students, and non professional investors, we have created a data set that is up to 69.5% more accurate than Wall Street, but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market’s actual expectations. It has been confirmed by an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from us than from the Wall Street consensus. The distribution of estimates published by analysts on our platform range from 59c to 65c EPS and $2.134B to $2.200B in revenues. This quarter we’re seeing a large distribution of estimates on profit and a smaller distribution of estimates on revenue.The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already. A larger distribution of estimates signaling less agreement in the market, which could mean more volatility post earnings.Throughout the quarter the EPS consensus from Wall Street and us both remained flat at 60c and 62c respectively. Over the same period of time the revenue expectations from both groups have been rising. Wall Street raised its consensus from $2.127B to $2.135B while our community raised its aggregate expectation from $2.140B to $2.162B. Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and rising expectations going into the report are often a bullish indicator. The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is cixoTrades who projects 63c EPS and $2.197B in revenue. In the Winter 2014 season cixoTrades rated as the 15th best analyst and is ranked 19th overall among over 3,650 contributing analysts. This season cixoTrades touts an impressive 64% accuracy rate vs Wall Street on EPS and 68% vs the Street on revenue. Our confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy. This quarter cixoTrades agrees with our community that MasterCard will beat Wall Street’s expectations, but cixoTrades thinks they will do it by a wider margin.This quarter analysts on our platform are expecting MA to go above and beyond the bar set by Wall Street. Year over year profit and revenue are both expected to be up and MasterCard is looking to build on the back of 2 consecutive better than expected quarters."

The company's EPSmg (normalized earnings) have gone from $2.07 in 2008 to an estimated $20.12 for 2013. However, the company does not qualify for the Defensive Investor because it does not have the earnings stability or dividend history the investor type requires, and is trading at high PEmg and PB ratios. The company does qualify for the Enterprising Investor, who is willing to take on more risk than the Defensive Investor through completing further research as the company passes all five of the requirements of Enterprising Investors. From a valuation standpoint, the market is currently implying a growth estimate of 15.76%, and while that is above our upper limit for growth, that is still supported by the demonstrated historical earnings growth. As a result, the company would appear to be fairly valued and Enterprising Investors should feel comfortable taking further steps in research, such as reviewing the ModernGraham Valuation of Visa.Disclaimer: The author did not hold a position in Mastercard Inc.

1789952,23625,2013-10-30T18:47:51-04:00,,"MasterCard (NYSE:MA) is a company that bases its strength on consumer spending. That's why the news that major banks have been issuing more credit cards this quarter was received with great fanfare. However, revenue for MA was provided if consumers were actually going to use the cards they had been issued. Because of a falling consumer sentiment and reduced spending overall, analysts are worried that MA will be posting up weaker numbers tomorrow because of those factors despite an increase in credit card holders. MasterCard is expected to report FQ3 2013 earnings on October 31st after the market close. The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors.The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for MA to report $6.95 EPS and $2.131B revenue while the current Estimize consensus from 21 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is $7.03 EPS and $2.150B revenue. The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market. In this case, we're seeing a greater differential between the Estimize and Wall Street numbers compared to previous quarters.Over the past four months the Wall Street consensus trend for EPS has increased from $6.32 to $6.95 while Wall Street revenue expectations have increased from $2.005B to $2.131B. The Estimize EPS and revenue consensus have surged throughout the quarter with EPS increasing from $6.48 to $7.03 and revenue increasing from $2.030B to $2.150B.Over the previous 6 quarters, MA has beaten the Wall Street consensus for EPS 5 times while beating the Wall Street Revenue consensus 5 times. Over the same time period MA has beaten the Estimize EPS consensus 4 times and the Estimize Revenue consensus 5 times.The distribution of estimates published by analysts on Estimize range from $6.90 to $7.15 EPS and $2.100B to $2.200B revenues. We're seeing a smaller distribution of estimates this quarter for MA than normal. The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already. A narrower distribution signaling the potential for greater volatility post earnings, a wider vice versa.The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is Daniel Miller who projects $7.05 EPS and $2.145B revenue. Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by our deep quantitative research, which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy.All signs point to uncertainty. Though MasterCard will put up an increased revenue for this quarter, analysts are still unsure how much the malignant effects of a falling consumer sentiment will weigh the revenue of the company down. And with those that are pessimistic wondering how much consumer sentiment will push MA down, there are also others hoping that the increased volume from card issuers will lift MA up."
1893991,25120,2013-12-12T04:16:54-05:00,,"Investors in MasterCard (NYSE:MA) are applauding the capital actions which the company announced on Monday after the market close. A stock split, a sizable repurchase program and an aggressive dividend hike sparked enthusiasm among investors.After very strong momentum so far this year, combined with increasing valuation multiples, I would be a bit more cautious.I stay on the sidelines.Capital ActionsMasterCard announced a set of capital actions on Monday after the market close, sparking great enthusiasm among investors. The board of the company announced a 10-for-1 stock split after shares have advanced towards $800 per share in after-hours trading. Note that the record date for the split is set to the 9th of January of 2014.On top of this ""cosmetic"" effect, shares saw another boost on the back of an 83% increase in the quarterly dividend to $1.10 per share, on a pre-split basis. On top of that, management furthermore initiated a new $3.5 billion repurchase program.ValuationAt the end of October, MasterCard released its third quarter results. Cash, equivalents and short term investments total $6.0 billion, while the company has no debt outstanding. As such, MasterCard operates with a rock-solid balance sheet.Revenues for the first nine months of the year came in at $6.22 billion, up 13.2% on the year before. Net earnings rose by 15.7% to $2.49 billion, for incredible net profit margins of 40%, even after tax. Full year revenues are seen at $8.5 billion, as earnings could come in around $3.3 billion.Factoring in gains towards $800 per share, the market values MasterCard at $96 billion, or its operating assets at $90 billion. This values operating assets of the firm at 10.6 times annual revenues and 27 times annual earnings.The proposed dividend hike towards $1.10 per share provides investors with a modest 0.5% dividend yield.Some Historical PerspectiveBack in 2006, shares of MasterCard were sold to the general public at a price of $39 per share. Ever since, shares have seen incredibly good returns, with shares roughly increasing by a factor of twenty fold towards current levels at $800 per share. So far this year, shares have already risen some 55%.Between 2009 and 2013, MasterCard increased its annual revenues by an expected cumulative 67% to $8.5 billion. Earnings more than doubled, increasing by an expected 125% to $3.3 billion. The company has been retiring its own shares at a modest pace in recent years, fueling earnings per share growth even more.Investment ThesisMasterCard's management has done a great job at creating shareholder value, as consumers continue to shift their payment method from cash to electronics. Concerns about litigations and other emerging competition have been more than offset by a strong operational performance.Shareholders are sharing the gains resulting from the strong performance as ironically enough, MasterCard has no debt outstanding. The strong cash balances allow for the $3.5 billion repurchase program and the aggressive dividend hike. Note that as recent as the start of 2012, MasterCard's quarterly dividend was just $0.15 per share, while it now proposes a $1.10 per share payout.Despite the aggressive payout hikes, MasterCard continues to operate with a rock-solid financial position.Back in November of last year, I last took a look at MasterCard's prospects. I noted that the company has witnessed strong operational growth, as the strong share price performance resulted in a price-earnings ratio of 18 at the time. While I was not immediately attracted to the absolute valuation, the relative valuation compared to rival Visa (NYSE:V) appeared attractive, especially given the greater emerging market exposure of MasterCard.The strong growth, numerous joint ventures with banks, financial institutions, technology and telecommunication companies reinforces the position of the company to remain on the frontier of the global payment industry. Note that the industry might still be subject to fast and structural innovations.At the time I advised investors to pick up some shares as an investment, or set up a pair trade with Visa. In both cases, investors have done well. Shares of MasterCard have risen some 60%, in a year's time, even when excluding after-hours gains. Shares of Visa have risen some 35%, making a pair trade profitable as well.After the payday holiday as announced by the firm, and the premium valuation following outstanding returns this year, I remain very cautious and stay on the sidelines.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1812092,56852,2013-11-06T12:25:14-05:00,,"Companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Sears (SHLD) sell a lot of products during the Christmas season. This is a given. But no one usually considers who else profits from increased consumer spending (and overspending). Credit card companies such as MasterCard (NYSE:MA), Visa (NYSE:V), and American Express (NYSE:AXP) not only see a higher usage of their cards, but they receive an assessment fee from the retailer every time someone uses their card to make a purchase. This is part of a transaction fee that retailers must pay for every purchase, and it's usually already priced into the product.Club FEDCredit cards will continue to see heavy usage after the holiday season with the help of low interest rates, which allow Americans to borrow more. Last week, the FED decided not to taper quantitative easing (contributing $85 billion per month to American banks while keeping interest rates low) in order to compensate for the effects of the government shutdown - that means financials, including the credit market, should be as strong as ever. FED spokesman have stated the delay could last until March 2014, more than enough time for MasterCard to give your portfolio a boost from consumer overspending and low borrowing rates.MA is promisingOut of all the credit card stocks, I'm most excited about MasterCard. The company already reported a 14 percent profit increase for the quarter, handily beating analyst estimates. Analysts mainly attribute it to Europe's strong economic recovery, since MasterCard has significant exposure in the European market. It reported larger than expected profits in America as well. Because of exposure to a European recovery, MasterCard has a stronger quarter ahead of it than Visa, whose exposure is limited and did not fare as well in their quarterly report.Risks to mitigateI see two possible macroeconomic risks when buying MA: the FED could change its mind and increases interest rates, or the European recovery could grind to a halt. For the FED to change its mind, unemployment would have to drop significantly and inflation would have to increase to its 2% target. Currently, inflation figures are hovering between 1.5 and 1.7%, and have been for months. The unemployment report on October 30th was the worst in 6 months, so there is not much danger of the FED reversing its credit-friendly policy in the near future.As for the European recovery, the dollar's continued devaluation bolsters the Euro's buying power and MasterCard's bottom line, so keep an eye on the EURUSD currency pair. MasterCard generated 28%of its revenue from Europe this quarter, while Visa only generated 2% in Europe, so the currency rate most likely gave MA a boost. MasterCard claims to have a strong presence in Northern and Eartern Europe, where the economies are more robust and people tend to spend more, which could mitigate the effect of a fluctuating EURUSD exchange rate.Fundamentally soundHere's how MasterCard and Visa stack up fundamentally:MasterCard's smaller P/E of 29 is favorable to Visa's 36, and their higher percentage of institutional ownership demonstrates that big names trust the company to a greater degree. The difference in the stocks' beta is relatively negligible. In spite of MA's higher stock price, the company's smaller market capitalization gives it the edge to grow more quickly than its competitor, as smaller caps historically outpace larger caps in terms of growth rate. MasterCard handily beat earnings this quarter, creating a higher EPS and a rise in price targets, while Visa's earnings were so-so and targets reacted accordingly.Buy parametersCitigroup's estimates put MA's target price at $835, and on November 5th it closed at $736.38, so the target is a 12% increase from its current price. If you take a look at MasterCard's chart, it looks like the equity curve on a black-box trading system, even through the interest rate uncertainties of the summer of 2013.Yahoo Finance 5-year MA ChartMasterCard is a promising play this quarter if you want to leverage seasonal purchases and the lowest borrowing rates in the history of borrowing rates. I recommend buying the stock on a pullback to the 21-day Exponential Moving Average if you're an aggressive investor, or at the bottom of its Bollinger Bands if you're more cautious. After that you could play it two ways:1. If it's a medium-term trade, hold it until the earnings report date and sell on the good news.2. If you are looking to invest in the company longer-term, I would hold until it reaches Citigroup's current price target of $835 or until March 2014, when the FED is likely to seriously reconsider its interest rate policy, and reevaluate your position according to their decision. Pay close attention to the interest and currency rates - you can find the FED's announcement schedule here, and on Thursday you can monitor the European Central Bank's interest rate decision, which affects the EURUSD.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1732602,53422,2013-10-07T13:50:27-04:00,,"The credit services sector has performed extraordinarily well during the economic rebound in the US. Increases in consumer spending and in processed transactions have led to premium valuations for Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and American Express (NYSE:AXP). MasterCard is the top performer taking the top spot for best 1-year and 5-year performance. Visa performs best on a 2-year performance benchmark.Credit card companies have also outperformed the broader S&P 500 which has doubled over the last five years. MasterCard has outperformed the S&P by nearly 244%, American Express by 121% and Visa by 166%. The run-up in share prices has caused valuations to balloon up making new investments in the sector very unattractive.Operating and financial performanceNo doubt, Visa's results are strong across all service lines. Visa's data processing revenues increased 15% and international transaction revenues 14% y-o-y in Q3 2013 and all service lines contributed positively to revenues (revenue y-o-y changes per segment are illustrated in the graph below). Total transactions attributable to both credit and debit cards have increased 12% for the third quarter 2013 while processed transactions have increased 14% y-o-y. Net operating revenues increased to $3 billion in Q3 2013 from $2.6 billion in 2012 (+17%) and operating income jumped 22% to $1.8 billion in Q3 2013 compared to $1.5 billion in Q3 2012. Strong results deserve a premium, but not as high as in the case of Visa Inc.ValuationVisa's fiscal 2013 operating cash flows are affected by a $4.3 billion cash outflow related to accrued litigation of which $4 billion relate to unsettled matters. Visa's most recent 10-Q explains:Accordingly, I have treated litigation related cash outflows as non-recurring for FY 2013. Net debt changes remain a negligible issue for Visa. Shares outstanding result from an as-converted A-class basis. Visa's free cash flow guidance suggests $5 billion proceeds in 2014 which I incorporated into the analysis. A $5 billion free cash flow translates into $7.75 FCFE per share and an implied free cash flow yield of 4.07%. The forward P/FCFE multiple stands at nearly 25 and clearly isn't a bargain.Market valuationHigh P/FCFE multiples suggest high P/E multiples as well. Investors purchase both Visa and MasterCard at very high multiples of above 20 indicating limited chances of multiple expansion. The market assigns significant growth premiums to both companies which are not justified based on a FCFE basis. American Express ranks much better on a P/E basis with a ratio of 13.90.Dividends paid by card service companies are only marginally positive. Visa pays a mere 0.69% while MasterCard pays only 0.36%. Dividend investors can find better bargains elsewhere.ConclusionThe credit services sector is an unattractive place for value investors: Low dividend yields and very high multiples make this sector not a prime place to invest. Growth investors may find some incremental growth in multiples but given the high valuations, the risk/reward ratio remains unbalanced. High growth premiums embedded in the shares are unlikely to be justified by transaction or fee growth. In fact, growth in cards and transactions as well as in fees may further be limited by unfavorable consumer protection regulation. As long as multiples remain inflated other sectors offer much better yields and potential for capital appreciation.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1730722,38201,2013-10-06T06:25:12-04:00,,"By Shweta DubeyMasterCard (MA) has been focusing on growth opportunities from under-penetrated regions. This is quite justified after two recent research reports. One of the reports, named ""Global Journey from Cash to Cashless"", discusses 33 emerging countries that include India and China, which are moving towards cashless transactions. The other report ""Road to Inclusion"" provides insight on the un-served and underserved population in Western Europe, including how the respondents feel about the financial services. What opportunities lie ahead for MasterCard with the findings of these reports?Expecting to tap the unbanked European marketIn the ""Road to Inclusion"" report, MasterCard has taken into consideration the financially excluded and financially underserved residents from six European countries. The countries included in the report were Poland, Spain, Russia, Italy, France, and UK. The report highlighted that 25% of both un-served and underserved respondents stated not having a bank account since they didn't had enough money to use this facility.Moreover, 95% of both un-served and underserved respondents used cash to pay for their utilities. There is significant potential for this population to adopt a cashless payment facility. It was surprising that a considerable portion of six major countries in Europe still aren't financially included. The company expects a considerable portion of the population will be financially included by facilitating prepaid card services.Prepaid card facility will drive financial inclusionMasterCard found that utilization of general financial services such as prepaid cards could make major portion of the population financially included. People's general interest in prepaid cards was also estimated:Source: Company dataAccording to the above chart, 22% of the overall respondents said they were interested in using prepaid card services. Moreover, 39% of the respondents said that they would be very/somewhat interested in MasterCard branded prepaid cards. The company could generate considerable returns by facilitating prepaid cards in Western Europe. We estimate, out of 93 million underserved and un-served people in Western Europe, 36.27 million can be converted into MasterCard prepaid card users.What potential lies ahead for Europe as a whole?We have our estimates for Western Europe's underserved and un-served population. The impact of this opportunity will benefit overall European operations, since it takes into consideration six important economies in the region. We believe that European operations are important to understand whether the company will be able to harness the opportunity lying ahead with the un-served and underserved population in the Western Europe.Let's look at how MasterCard performed in the last few quarters in Europe, year over year in terms of gross dollar value, or GDV. The GDV includes both purchase volumes and cash volume.In the last three quarters, the GDV from Europe increased at a consistent rate of more than 14%. Moreover, in past quarter results, the GDV from Europe was MasterCard's highest compared to other regions outside the U.S. We believe that this growth will continue in the coming quarters, if MasterCard is able to harness the potential growth from the region.It is also important to have an analysis of purchase volume since it has a significant portion in the GDV. The Nilson report for the purchase volume estimation from Europe for MasterCard, along with its peers Visa (V), American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Diners, is given below.Source: Nilson reportFrom the above chart, we infer that MasterCard has much better growth potential in purchase volume in Europe as compared to Visa, American Express, and Diners. MasterCard can expect an average year-over-year increase of 14.6% in purchase transactions by 2017 in Europe. This is because the overall growth estimation from 2007 to 2017 is 146%.With MasterCard achieving an average growth rate of more than 14% in the last few quarters, we can comfortably say that the region's purchase volume growth projection is meeting the year-over-year GDV growth. Meanwhile, Visa is giving close competition to MasterCard with an average growth rate of 12.6% in purchase volume by 2017, since its overall growth for the period has been 126%.Despite having better growth potential, MasterCard will not be able to overtake Visa as market leader in Europe purchase transactions. The market for purchase transactions for MasterCard will be $1.16 trillion, much lower than Visa's $2.65 trillion.On the other hand, American Express will not be able to capture significant purchase volume market share, since its average volume growth until 2017 will be 7.6%. This will be comparatively low to that of MasterCard's 14.6%.High expectations ahead in China and IndiaAccording to MasterCard's Global Journey from Cash to Cashless report, cashless payment in India accounts for 32% of overall consumer payments. With such low cashless payments, we can say that India has huge opportunities in term of its financially un-served population. Moreover, MasterCard describes India as being at an inception stage, moving towards cashless economies. MasterCard believes that by educating Indian residents, it can shift them to electronic payment mechanisms.The BCG estimated that India's consumption spending will grow from $990 million in 2010 to $3.6 trillion in 2020. This will lead to consumption spending growth at a compounded annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 13.7% by 2020. India's consumer spending will be $1.28 trillion for 2013. Even if 32% of consumers make cashless payments, then a $409 billion paperless transaction business opportunity is available in India.To harness the growth potential from India, MasterCard entered into an agreement with Central Bank of India and Suvidha Infoserve, which is India's leading retail services company, in September 2013. It will launch Central Bank of India-Suvidhaa Channel Card, which will be accepted at 65,000 Suvidha retailers across 2,800 towns in India. This will offer services like bill payments, payment of municipal taxes, travel ticketing, and shopping. The services are targeted towards reaching the 15 million digitally underserved people in the country.The company also has considerable expectations from China. The cashless payments in the country account for 40% to 60% of the overall consumer payments. MasterCard categorized China under transitioning countries, which means that they are moving towards cashless transactions at a much faster pace.The overall consumer spending for China in 2013 will be $2.34 trillion and $6.2 trillion by 2020; this is a CAGR of 10% until 2020 from 2010, as per BCG's estimates. MasterCard can expect around $936 billion of paperless transactions in 2013 from China, based on at least 40% cashless transactions.Despite opportunities lying ahead for MasterCard, the company is facing increasing competition from government backed payment networks in China. These services are expected to lower the transaction costs, and in turn, it will affect MasterCard's market share in China. MasterCard was not successful in harnessing opportunities in micropayments and the rural population, which may hamper its pace of growth from the region.Despite the threat from the government backed payment networks, ample opportunities lay ahead for MasterCard from China since consumer spending in China is expected to grow at an average growth of 10%, and the majority of this spending is expected to convert into paperless transactions.ConclusionWe expect huge opportunities exist for MasterCard in emerging economies.Source: Yahoo FinanceIn the above table, MasterCard appears to have better revenue prospects than Visa. Moreover, its PEG ratio seems highest among its peers, but not with considerable margins, so its long-term growth prospects look promising. Although its trailing twelve month, or TTM, P/E is the highest, we believe the company has huge earning potential from China and India. According to our analysis, the GDV from European countries also looks promising. We expect the company will provide considerable capital returns in the coming future and recommend buying.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1725862,27361,2013-10-02T14:44:03-04:00,,"With consumers steering away from cash in favor of the convenience of credit and debit cards, companies that offer these products are expected to see significant growth over the next few years. As the number of cashless transactions is increasing globally, year over year, MasterCard Inc. (NYSE:MA) is a global payments technology company set to capitalize on this growing trend.MasterCard is a technology company and payments industry leader. Unlike American Express (NYSE:AXP) or the Discover card (NYSE:DFS), MasterCard Inc. does not issue cards, set cardholder fees, interest rates, or make loans to cardholders. Much like MasterCard's closest competitor Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), the cardholder relationship belongs to the company's network of financial institution clients and is managed by them. MasterCard derives revenues primarily from fees paid by these financial institutions based on payment amounts, transactions that MasterCard processes and other services that MasterCard provides.Using the analysis below, I will analyze the past four years of MasterCard's performance. I will look at MasterCard's past profitability, debt and capital, and operating efficiency. Based on this information, we will look for strengths and weaknesses in the company's fundamentals. This should give us an understanding of how the company has fared over the past few years and will give us an idea of what to expect in the future.ProfitabilityProfitability is a class of financial metrics used to assess a business' ability to generate earnings compared with expenses and other relevant costs incurred during a specific period of time. In this section, we will look at four tests of profitability. They are: net income, operating cash flow, return on assets and quality of earnings. From these four metrics, we will establish if the company is making money and gauge the quality of the reported profits.MA Net Income TTM data by YChartsOver the past three years MasterCard's net profits have increased from $1.846 billion in 2010, to $2.991 billion in 2013 TTM. This represents a 62.02% increase.Operating income is the cash generated from the operations of a company, generally defined as revenue less all operating expenses, but calculated through a series of adjustments to net income.Over the past three years MasterCard's operating income has increased from $2.752 billion to $4.298 billion in 2013 TTM. This represents an increase of 64.03%.ROA - Return On Assets = Net Income/Total AssetsROA is an indicator of how profitable a company is relative to its total assets. ROA gives an idea as to how efficient management is at using its assets to generate earnings. Calculated by dividing a company's net income by its total assets, ROA is displayed as a percentage. Sometimes this is referred to as ""return on investment.""Over the past three years MasterCard's ROA has increased from 20.89% in 2010 to 24.88% in 2013 TTM. This indicates that the company is generating significantly more income on its assets than it did in 2010.ROE - Return on Equity = Net Income / Shareholders' EquityAs shareholders' equity is measured as a firm's total assets minus its total liabilities, ROE reveals the amount of net income returned as a percentage of shareholders' equity. The return on equity measures a company's profitability by revealing how much profit it generates with the amount shareholders have invested.Much like the ROA, the ROE is showing increasing profitability. Since 2010 the ROE has increased from 35.46% to 42.62%. As the ROE has increased over the past four years, this reveals that there has been an increase in how much profit has been generated compared to the amount that shareholders have invested, thus indicating an increase in shareholder value.Quality Of EarningsQuality of earnings is the amount of earnings attributable to higher sales or lower costs rather than artificial profits created by accounting anomalies such as inflation of inventory. To ensure there are no artificial profits being processed, the operating cash flow must exceed the net income.2010201120122013 TTMOver the past three and a half years, the operating income has been higher than the net income in all years. This indicates that MasterCard is not artificially creating profits by accounting anomalies such as inflation of inventory.Debt And CapitalThe Debt and Capital section establishes if the company is sinking into debt or digging its way out. It will also determine if the company is growing organically or raising cash by selling off stock.Total Liabilities To Total Assets, Or TL/A ratioTL/A ratio is a metric used to measure a company's financial risk by determining how much of the company's assets have been financed by debt.Over the past three and a half years, MasterCard's total assets have increased by $3.184 billion, while the total liabilities have increased by $1.371 billion. This indicates that the company's assets have increased more than the liabilities thus adding shareholder value.Working CapitalWorking Capital is a general and quick measure of liquidity of a firm. It represents the margin of safety or cushion available to the creditors. It is an index of the firm's financial stability. It is also an index of technical solvency and an index of the strength of working capital.Current Ratio = Current assets / Current liabilitiesOver the past three and a half years, MasterCard's current ratio has dipped but also returned to its 2010 level. As the most recent current ratio is well above 1, this indicates that MasterCard would be able to pay off its obligations if they came due at this point.Common Shares OutstandingOver the past three and a half years, the number of company shares have decreased. Since 2010 the amount of common shares have decreased from 130.90 million to 120.62 million.MA Shares Outstanding data by YChartsOperating EfficiencyOperating Efficiency is a market condition that exists when participants can execute transactions and receive services at a price that equates fairly to the actual costs required to provide them. An operationally efficient market allows investors to make transactions that move the market further toward the overall goal of prudent capital allocation without being chiseled down by excessive frictional costs, which would reduce the risk/reward profile of the transaction.Asset TurnoverThe formula for the asset turnover ratio evaluates how well a company is utilizing its assets to produce revenue. The numerator of the asset turnover ratio formula shows revenue found on a company's income statement and the denominator shows total assets, which are found on a company's balance sheet. Total assets should be averaged over the period of time that is being evaluated.Over the past three and a half years the revenue growth has increased by 41.09% while the assets have increased by 36.03%. This is an indication that the company from a percentage point of view has been more efficient at generating revenue.Based on the information above we can see that MasterCard has produced very strong results from a fundamental point of view. Revenues over the past three and a half years, have increased by 62.02%, the ROA and ROE have both been indicating an increase in profitability, while the increase in assets has significantly outnumbered the increase in liabilities. The company's share buyback program is also creating shareholder value as the number of shares outstanding has decreased significantly over the past few years. Based on the results above we can see that the company has produced exceptional results in spite of some setbacks.Looking ForwardLooking forward, MasterCard is anticipating many opportunities for growth over the next few years. Over the next three years MasterCard is anticipating strong global, industry and market growth. Year over year, MasterCard is anticipating personal consumption expenditures (CPE) to increase by around 5% YOY. This coupled with global secular trends and increased market opportunities through expansion in emerging markets means MasterCard is anticipating revenue growth 11% - 14% CAGR.With the expected growth in revenue and the company's plan to keep operating margins at a level of 50%, this translates into growth for the company's bottom line. The company anticipates a minimum of 20% GAGR in EPS growth over the next few years. This anticipated growth translates into EPS targets for FY 2014 being $29.32 and FY 2015 at $35.98.ValuationsIn the section below, I will use a couple of different methods to find a valuation of the stock price. In this section, I will use the Discounted Cash Flow valuation model and forward P/E ratios to estimate the current value of each share.I believe using the Discounted Cash Flow valuation model for MasterCard to be fair because DCF analysis can help one see where the company's value is coming from and one can generate an opinion based on that.Even though there are variations in calculating this formula, this model is based off of a terminal value of $83.128 billion and a WACC of 5.93%. The terminal value $83.128 billion is based off of the company trading at 20X EBITDA. I have concluded MasterCard's value to be $688.24 per share.In another method, I will use MasterCard's forward P/E ratios with estimated earnings to find the value. Currently, MasterCard has a forward P/E of 20.00 and FY 2015 earnings projected at $35.98. These two metrics lead to a target price of $719.00. I believe this to be a fair P/E ratio moving forward. As we look to be heading into a rising interest rate environment, P/E ratios tend to drop during this time. Even if I took 7% off an already fair forward P/E of 20.00 this would give the company a forward P/E of 18.6. A forward P/E of 18.6 would give the company a value of $669.23 per share.As of October 2, MasterCard's stock was trading at $677.79. Using the Discount Cash Flow Formula, this indicates the stock is trading at a 1.54% discount to today's price. If I calculate a valuation using forward P/E ratios this indicates a valuation $719.00 or a discount of 4.47%.Chart sourced by (Finviz)StrategyAt this point in the market, I believe if you added a 50% position here and waited for the overall market to bring the price down closer to the trendline, this would present and excellent opportunity to add positions in a company with excellent growth prospects and a great business model.ConclusionMasterCard's stock price has had an impressive run in 2013. Even though there is excellent growth potential with over 85% of the world still using cash and checks, I believe the stock is close to fairly valued at this point. If the market has a selloff and the stock price falls back to the trendline around the $640.00 range, this would provide an outstanding opportunity to invest in a company with a great business model, and excellent growth prospects. Having stated that, at this point in the market, based the Discount Cash Flow Formula, I have calculated that MasterCard is currently trading at a slight discount.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1603872,52022,2013-08-05T09:20:32-04:00,,"A few days ago (July 30), I made a comprehensive valuation of MasterCard (NYSE:MA) in which I argued that the stock still had enough upside potential to reach levels of $660 - 670 or more in the next few weeks, from a conservative perspective (while a more realistic scenario would lead us easily to the range of $800 - 830 in a longer span of time); that is, over 12% return in a few weeks and up to 39% return in a longer period of time (MasterCard price at the time of valuation was $597).After publication (August 1), some people who read my article on MasterCard kindly asked me if I would be willing to do another valuation article on Visa (NYSE:V) using the same methodology shown in MasterCard's valuation. So this article goes especially to those readers who asked for Visa.I must say that I have changed slightly my approach this time: in this article I want to go one step further and illustrate which stock is a better investment opportunity.Just like I did in my previous article, I will divide my valuation into two main sections, which will be broken down to several sub-sections. Nonetheless, for the sake of readability, I will skip some of the argumentation regarding the reasons why I conducted the valuation in the way that I did, therefore if anyone is interested in digging a little deeper, they can simply turn to my previous article and will find it thoroughly explained there.A. Quantitative valuation1. Income Statement Method (Valuation using multiples)Once we have checked that the major players in the Payment card industry (Visa, MasterCard and American Express (NYSE:AXP)) are indeed comparable, we can proceed with this method.A very important remark must be made here: Visa's 2012 EBITDA should be a lot higher than it shows (USD 2,472 million), since there is a USD 4,100 million Litigation provision (a very rare item, almost non-existent in 2011 and 2010). In order to make more accurate predictions on income growth (which eventually has an impact on the price of the stock), I have added back the 4,100 million to the EBITDA. Please note that I am not saying that an investor should completely omit the fact that Visa has an extraordinary additional cost of 4,100 million (which certainly is a negative thing), but when making predictions of the future income evolution I believe that is best to omit this infrequent item.Anyway, for the I.S. Method I used the following ratios, with the following weights based on Dr. Fernández empirical evidence regarding the usefulness of each ratio when performing a valuation of a company in the financial services industry.a) P/E ratio, 10% weightPV= EPSV*P/ECompetition= $185.09b) EV/EBITDA ratio, 7.5% weightEVV*=EBITDAV*(EVCompetition/EBITDACompetition) = $276.97 per shareIn fact with this multiple you obtain the ""true"" market value of the firm (Enterprise Value), but if we divide this ""true"" value by the current enterprise value, we will get a rough estimate of how undervalued the enterprise value really is, and then with a few tweaks more you can easily get the projected price per share.c) P/Book Value ratio, 7.5% weightPV = BValueV*(PCompetition/BvalueCompetition) = $264.95d) P/Dividend ratio, 5% weightPV = DivpSV*(PCompetition/DivpSCompetition) = $287.06Sub-section average price: $245.02.The weight in the final valuation is 30%, for the reasons stated in the previous article.2. Dividend discount model (modified Gordon model)Firstly, I call it ""modified"" because the standard Gordon model has only one growth rate (""g"") and I have used two different growth rates: a short-term rate and a long-term one.The short-term rate is the average compounded annual dividend growth rate for Visa since the company went public in 2008, which is 52.99% annual increase. I have used this rate to estimate the next 4 years (2014-2017).From the 4th year on, I have used a ""long-term"" growth rate of 7.223%, which I have obtained in the following way: I first estimated the growth of the company's expected equity cash flows using the formula suggested by Dr. Damodaran (PhD from UCLA and Professor of Finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University), which basically is an improved version of the popular ROE*Retention ratio.Finally, I gave the obtained rate a weight of 80% and for the remaining 20% I used the growth rate of the GDP of the countries in which Visa operates (preserving the proportion in which each country contributes to the company's net income when computing that average growth rate, of course), which is 3.03% on average for the period 2003-2012.Let me add here that Visa obtains a substantially larger proportion of its income from the U.S. (46.7%) compared to MasterCard (32%).The result of this ""2-stage"" Gordon model is a price per share of $172.91, which is a very conservative price, in line with what usually is obtained using this model.Finally, I gave this method only 10% of the final overall valuation weight due to its hyper-sensitivity to the rate ""g"" chosen: even if it has been thoroughly computed, a slight variation in ""g"" could lead to a large change in price.3. Discounted Cash Flows MethodThis method, although being the ""only conceptually correct"" one, relies heavily on the growth rate assumptions that the analyst has to make, although not quite as much as the Dividend discount model.With that in mind, I did not make 1 growth rate assumption, but 3: I took 3 viewpoints (""conservative"", ""neutral"", and ""aggressive""), and then, instead of computing an average value (which would not make much sense), I will leave those 3 possible prices until the end of this analysis, in which I will make a final, overall, valuation taking into account a Qualitative analysis.In any case, I would say without a doubt that the ""neutral"" viewpoint is in fact quite conservative, due to the (conservative) way I computed the perpetual growth rate of the equity cash flows, whose fundamental assumptions remain unchanged in all 3 scenarios.For a detailed explanation about how I computed the perpetual growth rate of the equity cash flows, please check the MasterCard valuation article, since I did it in the same exact way (to be consistent).The result is a 7.21% perpetual growth rate.Then, it is plain to see that the growth rate used is quite conservative, since Visa's average equity cash flows growth rate in the last 3 years has been about 15%, annually.What do I change to create a certain scenario? 2 elements: required market risk premium (in the range 6.5%-5.5%), and I multiply the 7.21% perpetual growth rate by a factor less than 1, equal to 1 or larger than 1 (although not much larger than 1, based on findings from researchers like Dr. Eric Jondeau (PhD in Economics from Paris University 9 Dauphine) that conclude that stock market returns not only do not follow a normal distribution, but also are not symmetrical, and in fact the negative extremes are more likely).Then, the prices obtained with each of those viewpoints are the following:- (Very) Conservative: $133.85- Neutral: $195.42- Aggressive: $258.68I gave this method a 60% weight of the final overall valuation, since this is the method that is considered most accurate by the majority of academia in Finance.Finally, the overall valuation considering the sub-section prices and its weights gives us an estimated value of $171.11, $208.05 and $246.01, for the ""conservative"", ""neutral"" and ""aggressive"" viewpoints, respectively.The arithmetic average would be roughly $208 per share, but, as I said earlier, it would not make much sense since 1) to allocate equal weights to the probabilities of each scenario is arbitrary, and 2) in reality you will not see an ""average"" of those 3 scenarios, since the ""neutral"" scenario is already some sort of an average of what is likely to happen.In the following section, we will find out which of those 3 scenarios seems more likely, in the light of qualitative analysis.B. Qualitative valuation1. Financial Ratios Analysisa) One-dimensional analysis for the period 2009-2012:-Current ratio (Current assets/Current liabilities) = 1.48, which is a good value, which means that current assets are almost 50% more than current liabilities. Ideally, the optimal value should be between 1.5 and 2.-Cash ratio (Cash/Current liabilities) = 0.26, a good value that means that with the current cash 26% of the current liabilities could be paid, which is the same as to say that the company could spend 26% of the year (just over 3 months) without getting any money from customers and still being able to pay for its current liabilities. The optimal value should be between 0.3 and 0.4.-Debt ratio (Debt/Assets) = 0.31, again a decent value, which means that debt only finances 31% of all of Visa's assets, the rest is from self-financing (basically, retained earnings). Note that this ratio is slightly worse than MasterCard's (0.42), since it's probably not optimal to finance your business with as little debt: sure the business is presumably ""safer"", but Visa is paying a heavy cost for it (a lower ROE, which makes the business less attractive to investors). The optimal value should be between 0.4 and 0.6.b) Multi-dimensional analysis for the period 2009-2012:- Altman Z scoreThe Z score has been computed using not only considering 2012, but an average of the period 2009-2012.The Z score is 7.04, which basically means that the probability that Visa goes bankrupt is extremely, extremely low (based on the information contained in the audited financial statements of the company). Note that here we don't care that much about the fact that MasterCard's 11.23 Z score is substantially larger than Visa's: from a certain point onwards, an extra 0.01 doesn't make the business any safer (well, maybe just a little, but not much).I suppose one can imagine the Altman Z score as a square root function relating Z (X axis) with 1- Probability of bankruptcy (Y axis).- Balanced growth patternTheoretically, an ideal balanced growth pattern would be like this:Net Income growth > Net Sales growth > Assets growth > Debt growthAnd Visa's actual pattern is:Net Income growth > Net Sales growth > Debt growth > Assets growthTherefore, we can conclude that the ideal pattern and the actual pattern are quite similar, and so theoretically the company is having a quite balanced growth (as well as rapid).Actually, the truth is that the growth pattern of Visa looks a little better than MasterCard's, since there's only 1 disruption like MasterCard but in Visa it happens at a later point, and plus the disruption is less worrying, since it could actually be a good thing that the company's debt grows faster than its assets (for a limited period of time), since this implies that the Debt ratio is improving (too little debt can be a negative thing, as we discussed before).2. Porter's 5 Forces for the Payment card industryHighlightsThe Porter's 5 Forces analysis is essentially the same for the case of Visa as for MasterCard, and so we will remind briefly the main points:1) Attractive industry: 4 out 5 forces (all except for ""rivalry among established firms"") drive profitability up for the current players.2) High barriers to entry preserve profitability for the current players.3) The legislative pressure on debit and credit card fees is not likely to affect (much) companies like Visa, since although Visa doesn't charge directly the card fees to consumers, the company could pressure the issuing banks to charge a higher annual fee to consumers, and consumers really have not much choice but to pay those hypothetical higher annual fees (provided there's not a new court ruling invalidating such a measure), as the BBC news reported on July 24, 2013.4) The worldwide drive away from cashWithin the last decade, the number of credit cards in the US has been as high as 5 cards per person, and the trend in the developing economies is to switch from cash to electronic payments. As, Ajay Banga (MasterCard's CEO) said in an interview last year, ""85% of the world's retail transactions are still in cash, and only 15% are electronic payments but that's changing, and there's a secular move from cash to electronic"".In that direction, it is believed that China's market is extremely interesting: most of the people still use cash. Here Visa is at a disadvantage with MasterCard, since the latter company started years ago to build a partnership with China UnionPay (although for now the partnership is not as close as MasterCard would like).5) Court ruling invalidating the Fed's rule on interchange debit card feesBad news for the issuing banks, as well as the card companies, especially for Visa (MasterCard relies less on revenue coming from debit cards than Visa).In any case, the Fed might appeal the ruling, and therefore the new cap on debit card fees will not be into place (if ever does) in months or years.6) The role that social networking sites playFacebook and other social sites are a great opportunity for the payment card industry, because when people want to make payments in those social sites, they need a credit/debit card to fuel that account.7) Mobile banking is the (present and) futureMobile phones represent the future of payments: the number of people who have mobile phones compared to the number of people who have bank accounts, it's multiples (6 billion compared to 2.5 billion). Nowadays, mobile phones can be used as a payment processor provided they are enabled with the required technology (like Google Wallet's NFC technology) and the consumer has a linked card she can use. Moreover, it's also possible to send money by mobile phone (for instance, by using the PayPal app, text message, or the PayPal mobile website).Similar to MasterCard, Visa is not willing to miss out on this opportunity: Visa's partnership with Vodafone and Samsung to focus on NFC technology is very promising.Therefore, there's a decent chance that NFC technology will become tomorrow's most used payment method, and in case that event occurs, Visa (as well as MasterCard) will be in a privileged position to benefit from this technological change.Conclusion: Visa or MasterCard?In both cases, the qualitative analysis supports the good results obtained in the ""neutral"" and ""aggressive"" quantitative valuation.However, given the recent strong MasterCard's upside move, I have to say that Visa's short-term price target (under a ""neutral"" scenario) allows for a larger return than MasterCard's (14% vs. 3.5%).Nonetheless, Visa's long-term Price Target is less attractive than MasterCard's (23.5% vs. 28.6%), if we compute the long-term PT as an arithmetic average of the neutral and aggressive scenarios for both companies (the conservative scenario doesn't seem likely at all).In other words, Visa will probably perform better in the short term, but in the long term, we should see larger gains in MasterCard due to its superior growth rate estimate (computed based on an historically superior growth).Additionally, Visa's financial ratios are slightly worse than MasterCard's.But, Visa's projected maximum drawdown is a lot smaller than MasterCard's (7% vs. 29%).In conclusion, Visa's projected share prices under the different scenarios considered show a tighter interval, therefore making it in some sense a ""safer"" bet than MasterCard right now, but MasterCard does reward for that ""additional risk"" with an expected larger long-term upside move. And here really comes down to preferences (risk aversion) and all I can say is that if I had to buy one right now, I would perhaps pick Visa (looking at levels of $210, for a nice and quick 14% return) over MasterCard, and then maybe some time down the road, I would sell my position in Visa and open a long position in MasterCard, looking at levels of at least $800.Disclosure: I am long MA.

1612092,24634,2013-08-07T05:21:49-04:00,,"I know, I just cursed the stock. Once you say $1,000 it is over, right? We will see. Purchase, New York seems like a fitting location for a company like MasterCard (NYSE:MA). The company is a large-cap company ($77b) that provides global payment solutions in support of the credit and payment programs of financial institutions.Data from Best Stocks Now AppI stepped up to the plate and added MasterCard to the conservative growth portfolios that I manage back in December of last year. This was during the fiscal cliff crisis. Since I bought it, MA is already up 33%, but I would have no problem adding to my position today. The stock continues to do well and the company recently reported blowout earnings.On my recent radio shows, I have been discussing how earnings season affects your portfolio a lot. When a company exceeds analysts' estimates the stock follows almost immediately upward. Why? Because stocks trade based upon expectations, and when the expectations of a company increase, the price follows almost right behind the stock. When the earnings estimates go up, we raise the target price and the stocks follow almost immediately. MasterCard recently once again beat their earnings estimates quite handily. I still like the stock. Here is why…I am a money manager that requires a stock to meet at least three major criteria before I will consider buying it. Those criteria are performance, value, and a healthy stock chart. Is that too much to ask? It certainly does narrow down a very large field.ValuationLet's begin with the current valuation of MasterCard. The company is expected to make $30.66 per share in earnings next year. It is expected to grow those earnings by about 18 percent per year over the next five years. That seems doable as the company has been growing their earnings by 27% per year over the last five years.Now when I take those current earnings estimates of MA and grow them by 18 percent per year over the next five years, I come up with potential earnings of almost $60 per share five years from now.Next, I choose a multiple that I think is appropriate for a company like MA. I look at its trading and multiple history. I also look at other financial stocks that compete with MA such as American Express (NYSE:AXP), Visa (NYSE:V), and Discover (NYSE:DFS) to see what multiples they are trading at.I then choose a multiple that I think is appropriate for MasterCard. I believe that a multiple somewhere in the 18-20X range would be appropriate. When I do the match, I come up with a five-year target price on MasterCard of $1,160. I believe that the stock is well on its way to being $1,000 plus stock at some point in time!Consider that the shares were trading at $40 per share back in 2006 and now they are trading at over $650 per share! MasterCard meets my first criteria-it passes my valuation test. I require 80% or more upside potential over the next five years. It currently gets a value grade of B right now.Data from Best Stocks Now AppThere are currently a lot of stocks in the market that currently pass my value test. But I have found over time that there are way too many value traps in the market. Value traps are stocks that are seemingly undervalued-they have low PE ratios, low PEG ratios, low price-to-book value ratios, low price-to-cash flow ratios, etc. But what do they lack? They lack performance! Let's take a look at the performance numbers of MA because it has already satisfied my valuation criteria.PerformanceIs MA another value trap? I don't think so, because it also has performance to go along with its value. MA is one of the most successful IPOs of all time! It became public at $40 per share in 2006. Today, MA is at $642 per share! But how often have you seen them talk about MA on the main stream financial channels? I do not know that I have ever seen it. MA has done better than Google and most IPOs during the last decade, yet I have not seen MA get the kind of attention nor congratulations that it really deserves for putting money in shareholders' pockets!Data from Best Stocks Now AppLet's look at MA's performance numbers. Over the last five years, the stock has more than tripled the returns of the market - while the market's been delivering 5.5 percent per year, MA has delivered 22.5% percent per year.Over the last three years, MA has continued to more than triple the returns of the market, While the market has been averaging 14.9 percent per year, MA has been averaging 47.6 percent. Over the last 12 months, while the market is up 25.3 percent, MA is up 53 percent. MA gets a momentum grade of A. It's one of the top performing stocks in the entire market!MA is already up 30.8 percent year to date, and this is not been a very good year for large cap stocks. So far, 2013 has proved to be the year where small and mid-cap stocks, for whatever reason, are way more popular than large cap stocks, yet MA has delivered small cap stock-like numbers!Stock ChartThe last thing I need to consider in regards to MA is a healthy stock chart. Let's take a look at a one year chart of the stock.As you can see the stock broke out of a five month consolidation trend back in May of this year and has not looked back since. I recently broke out on its earnings report and it continues in an extremely healthy uptrend.The beat goes on in Purchase, NY with the $76 billion company. Out of 3,443 stocks that I currently rank in my Best Stocks Now! app, MA comes in at number 73. That is really impressive for a large cap stock. My overall grade that I give to MA is A! Master card is a very large position in my conservative growth accounts!Data from Best Stocks Now AppFollow me on Twitter @billgunderson for a change in my opinion on this stock.Disclosure: I am long MA.

1499962,23479,2013-06-13T11:56:32-04:00,,"MasterCard’s (NYSE:MA) stock has rallied on strong first quarter earnings and signs of improvement in the U.S. economy. The stock has gained 5% since the company reported a 9% year-on-year increase in gross revenues for the first three months of 2013. Nearly 40% of MasterCard’s revenue comes from the U.S. and given the nature of the company’s business, MasterCard’s performance is closely linked to the country’s economic condition.MasterCard charges data processing fees from its banking clients on the basis of the total number of transactions processed for the client and assessment fees as a percentage of the gross dollar value (GDV) of transactions processed for the client. Assessment fees account for 30% of the company’s revenue and data processing or transaction fees account for 30%. The company also charges cross-border fees for transactions where the issuer or cardholder’s bank and the acquirer or merchant’s bank are based in different countries. These fees account for 25% of the revenues earned by MasterCard.Our price estimate for MasterCard is $550, in line with the current market price.MasterCard has around 1.2 million cards in circulation worldwide, of which around 436 million are debit cards, 686 million are consumer credit cards used by individuals, and 36 million are commercial credit cards offered to corporations. Consumer credit cards account for nearly half of the GDV processed by the company while debit cards account for 40% and commercial credit cards account for the remaining 10%. The company processes around 30 transactions per card in a year with a total of 34 billion transactions processed annually. MasterCard charges an authorization, settlement and switch fee of around $0.08 per transaction and connectivity fee of $0.008 per transaction.In the U.S., MasterCard reported a 15% increase in debit and prepaid GDV in 2012, resulting from the implementation of the Durbin amendment to the Dodd-Frank bill. The bill requires banks with more than $10 billion in assets to use separate payment processing networks for signature authorized and PIN authorized debit card transaction. [1] This bill has hurt MasterCard’s main competitor, Visa (NYSE:V), whose logo is displayed on three out of four debit cards in the country. [2] The company’s near-monopoly in the market meant that it lost market share to MasterCard. Visa’s payment volume increased by only 6% in the U.S. last year, with debit volume remaining unchanged. Debit cards now account for half of MasterCard’s GDV in the U.S.Electronic payment adaption in the U.S. is very high. Electronic payment solutions account for more than 60% of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) in the U.S. [3] According to our analysis, MasterCard has maintained a market share of 10% of the PCE in the country. [4]PCE as a percentage of actual disposable income in the U.S. (the income available to an individual for spending after paying taxes) dipped from 96% in 2007 to 91% in 2008 and 2009, as a direct consequence of the economic downturn observed worldwide during this period. However, the percentage has revived to 94% in the last three years, as the economy has improved. [5] To forecast the disposable income, we must use the growth rate observed in the real disposable income, calculated using chained 2005 U.S. dollars. [6]The per capita real disposable income fell by 3% from 2008 to 2009 as the U.S. economy was affected by the global financial crisis, but has since been growing at an annual rate of 0.7% in the last few years. The U.S. population annual growth rate is around 0.7% to 1%. Extrapolating this rate to the end of the decade, we get a population of 330 million.The unemployment rate in the U.S. has recovered remarkably from the peak of 10.1% observed during the financial crisis in 2009 and reached a four-year low of 7.5% in April, indicating a general recovery in the job market, leading to higher disposable income. [7] Assuming the per capita disposable income continues to grow at a rate of 0.7% for the next three years, followed by higher growth ~1%-1.5% in the next four years, we get actual disposable income of $13.3 trillion by 2019.With improving economic conditions, the PCE can be expected to reach the pre-recession level of 95% of the actual disposable income. If MasterCard is able to retain its market share of 10% then it can generate $1.27 trillion in GDV from the U.S.MasterCard charges an assessment fee of 0.098% of the GDV processed for a client. Assuming it maintains this fee structure, it can generate $1.2 billion in assessment fee revenues from the U.S. by the end of the decade.

In other words, we look at what happens when the company beats or misses the whisper number expectation.The table below indicates the average post earnings price movement within a one and 30 trading day timeframe:The strongest price movement of +4.3% comes within 30 trading days when the company reports earnings that beat the whisper number, and -3.1% within 30 trading days when the company reports earnings that miss the whisper number. Overall average price movement is ""as expected"" through 30 trading days when the company reports earnings.The table below indicates the most recent earnings reports and short-term price reaction:In the comparable quarter last year, the company reported earnings four cents ahead of the whisper number. Following that report, the stock realized a 3.4% loss in five trading days. Last quarter, the company reported earnings six cents short of the whisper number. Following that report, the stock realized a 0.6% loss in one trading day. Overall historical data indicates the company to be (on average) an ""as expected"" price reactor (beat the whisper and see strength, miss and see weakness) through 30 trading days when the company reports earnings.Enter your expectation and view more earnings information here, or let us know your expectation in the comments section below.**********************************Since 1998, WhisperNumber.com has been tracking and publishing ""crowd sourced estimates"" for earnings. We call these earnings expectations whisper numbers. Our whisper numbers are gained from individual investors and traders just like you that have registered with our site. While the whisper number itself is an important part of our analysis, a company's ""price reaction"" to beating or missing the whisper number expectation is the key. On average, companies that exceed the whisper are ""rewarded,"" while companies that miss are ""punished"" following an earnings report. Trading on whispers is a technical play on market psychology, rather than a bet on a company's fundamental strengths.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1593962,52022,2013-08-01T10:50:44-04:00,,"Normally when an investor faces a stock that has been up roughly 1,400% since it went public (May 25, 2006), he or she tends to think that the upside potential may have come to an end, and in most of the cases the investor would be right since with this little information it certainly looks like a price bubble about to burst. However, a little fraction of such cases are not bubbles but well-run businesses like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is up nearly 1,600% (yes, at today's current price), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), up about 1,200%, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), up nearly 750%, Grifols (NASDAQ:GRFS), up over 300% in only 2 years, or MasterCard (NYSE:MA), roughly 1,400%.After a thorough analysis of MasterCard I have found out that this company has not reached its peak quite yet: using a conservative approach, MasterCard is right now undervalued by 12.5%, and perhaps a more ""realistic"" approach would lead us to staggering figures like 40% or more as I will explain in just a moment.My valuation will be divided into two main sections, which will be broken down to several sub-sections.A. Quantitative valuation1. Income Statement Method (Valuation using multiples)First of all I would like to stress that this method, although quite popular these days, is often times too simplistic and it can only be used reliably if the companies that will be compared are actually ""comparable"", and to determine whether the major companies in the industry (that is, MasterCard, Visa (NYSE:V) and American Express (NYSE:AXP)) are really comparable I have based my research on the suggested relevant factors that Dr. Pablo Fernández (PhD in Business economics from Harvard University, and Professor of Corporate finance at IESE) pointed out in several of his academic papers (among others, ""Valuation using multiples. How do analysts reach their conclusions"", 2002 and ""Company valuation methods"", 2013).The conclusion is that those 3 companies are indeed comparable, as most of the relevant factors are sufficiently comparable (Net income, Market capitalization, global Market share, and executive team members). See figure 1 for a chart of the industry market share according to Visa's 2012 annual report.I have used the following ratios, with the following weights based on Dr. Fernández empirical evidence regarding the usefulness of each ratio when performing a valuation of a company in the financial services industry.a) P/E ratio, 10% weightPMA= EPSMA*P/ECompetition= $ 818.75b) EV/EBITDA ratio, 7.5% weightEVMA*=EBITDAMA*(EVCompetition/EBITDACompetition) = $ 956.49In fact with this multiple you obtain the ""true"" market value of the firm (Enterprise Value), but if we divide this ""true"" value by the current enterprise value we will get a rough estimate of how undervalued the enterprise value really is, and then if you multiply this factor by the percentage of the enterprise value that corresponds to Market cap (about 95% of EV), and then it follows that each stock of that Market cap is undervalued by that factor, and so all you have to do is to multiply the current price times that factor.c) P/Book Value ratio, 7.5% weightPMA = BValueMA*(PCompetition/BvalueCompetition) = $ 273.81d) P/Dividend ratio, 5% weightPMA = DivpSMA*(PCompetition/DivpSCompetition) = $ 283.93Sub-section average price: $ 627.81The weight in the final valuation is 30%, because on the one hand this method is a quite popular analysts' choice nowadays and on top of that we have argued that the selected companies are (sufficiently) comparable, but on the other hand it's an industry with few big competitors and so the reliability of this method is not as high as it could be if we had more comparable competitors, and for that reason the conclusions drawn should not account for too large a percentage of the final overall valuation.2. Dividend discount model (modified Gordon model)Firstly, I call it ""modified"" because the standard Gordon model has only one growth rate (""g"") and I have used two different growth rates: a short-term rate and a long-term one.The short-term rate is the average compounded annual dividend growth rate for MasterCard since the company went public in 2006, which is 31.13% annual increase. I have used this rate to estimate the next 4 years (2014-2017).After the 4th year, I have used a ""long-term"" growth rate of 10.05%, which I have obtained in the following way: I first estimated the growth of the company's expected Equity cash flows using the formula suggested by Dr. Damodaran (PhD from UCLA and Professor of Finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University), which basically is an improved version of the popular ROE*Retention ratio, since this popular version makes an implicit wrong simplification that all free cash flows to equity are paid out to shareholders (as dividends) and this is not true: empirically, according to Compustat database, in 1998 the average dividend to free cash flow to equity ratio across all firms on the NYSE was roughly 50%, meaning that only half of the equity cash flow is actually paid out as dividends to shareholders. Therefore, the resulting rate had to be divided by two to be consistent.Finally, I gave this rate we obtained a weight of 90% and for the remaining 10% I used the growth rate of the GDP of the countries in which MasterCard operates (preserving the proportion in which each country contributes to MasterCard's income when computing that average growth rate, of course), which is 3.62% on average for the period 2003-2012.The result of this ""2-stage"" Gordon model is a Price per share of $ 409.99, which is a very conservative price, in line with what usually is obtained using this model.Finally, I gave this method only 10% of the final overall valuation weight due to its hyper-sensitivity to the rate ""g"" chosen: even if it has been thoroughly computed, a slight variation in ""g"" could lead to a large change in price.3. Discounted Cash Flows MethodAs Dr. Fernández says, ""it can be said that, nowadays, the cash flow discounting method is generally used because it is the only conceptually correct valuation method"" (""Company valuation methods"", 2013).Having said that, there is no denying that this method, although being the ""only conceptually correct"" one, relies heavily on the growth rate assumptions that the analyst has to make, although not quite as much as the Dividend discount model.With that in mind, I did not make 1 growth rate assumption, but 3: I took 3 viewpoints (""conservative"", ""neutral"", and ""aggressive""), and then, instead of computing an average value (which would not make much sense), I will leave those 3 possible prices until the end of this analysis, in which I will make a final, overall, valuation taking into account a Qualitative analysis.In any case, I would say without a doubt that the ""neutral"" viewpoint is in fact quite conservative, due to the (conservative) way I computed the expected balance sheet & income statement data that I used for 2013, as well as the way I computed the perpetual growth rate of the equity cash flows, whose fundamental assumptions remain unchanged in all 3 scenarios.In case the investor is wondering how I computed the perpetual growth rate of the equity cash flows, I did it the following way: on the one hand, I used the growth formula suggested by Dr. Damodaran, (which replaces the Retention rate used in the popular version with the equity reinvestment rate, which measures the percentage of net income that is invested back into the firm), and gave it a 30% weight; on the other hand, for the remaining 70% I used the average growth rate of the GDP of the countries in which MasterCard operates, just like I did in the previous method. The result is a 8.38% perpetual growth rate.Then, it is plain to see that the growth rate that I used is quite conservative, since MasterCard's average equity cash flows growth rate in the last 3 years has been 19.50%, annually.What do I change to create a certain scenario? 2 elements: the required market risk premium (in the range 6.5%-5.5% based on Dr. Fernández research), and I multiply the 8.38% perpetual growth rate by a factor less than 1, equal to 1 or larger than 1 (although not much larger than 1, based on findings from researchers like Dr. Eric Jondeau (PhD in Economics from Paris Dauphine University) that conclude that stock market returns not only do not follow a normal distribution, but also are not symmetrical, and in fact the negative extremes are more likely).Then, the prices obtained with each of those viewpoints are the following:- (Very) Conservative: $ 393.78- Neutral: $ 731.94- Aggressive: $ 1272.48I gave this method a 60% weight of the final overall valuation, since is the method that is considered most accurate by the majority of academia in Finance.Finally, the overall valuation considering the sub-section prices and its weights gives us an estimated value of $ 465.61, $ 668.51 and $ 992.83, for the ""conservative"", ""neutral"" and ""aggressive"" viewpoints respectively.The arithmetic average would be roughly $ 710 per share, but, as I said earlier, it would not make much sense since 1) to allocate equal weights to the probabilities of each scenario is arbitrary, and 2) in reality you will not see an ""average"" of those 3 scenarios, since the ""neutral"" scenario is already some sort of an average of what is likely to happen.In the following section, we will find out which of those 3 scenarios seems more likely and why is that, in the light of qualitative analysis.B. Qualitative valuation1. Financial Ratios Analysisa) One-dimensional analysis for the period 2009-2012:-Current ratio (Current assets/Current liabilities) = 1.91, which is a magnificent value, which means that current assets are almost twice as much as current liabilities.-Cash ratio (Cash/Current liabilities) = 0.42, an excellent value that means that with the current cash MasterCard has 42% of the current liabilities could be paid, which is the same as to say that the company could spend 42% of the year (roughly 5 months) without getting any money from customers and still being able to pay for its current liabilities.-Debt ratio (Debt/Assets) = 0.42, again an excellent value, which means that debt only finances 42% of all MasterCard's assets, the rest of the financing coming from self-financing (basically, retained earnings).b) Multi-dimensional analysis for the period 2009-2012:- Altman Z scoreThe Z score has been computed using not only considering 2012, but an average of the period 2009-2012. The results would be even better if only the year 2012 is considered (since is the year with best figures).Therefore, again I have used a slightly conservative bias in my valuation.The Z score is 11.23, which basically means that the probability that MasterCard goes bankrupt is extremely, extremely low (based on the information contained in the audited financial statements of the company).- Balanced growth patternTheoretically, an ideal balanced growth pattern would be like this:Net Income growth > Net Sales growth > Assets growth > Debt growthAnd MasterCard's actual pattern is:Net Income growth > Assets growth > Net Sales growth > Debt growthTherefore we can conclude that the ideal pattern and the actual pattern are quite similar, and so theoretically the company is having a quite balanced growth (as well as rapid).2. Porter's 5 Forces for the Payment card industrySee figure 2 for a comprehensive chart elaborated in-house.HighlightsThe Porter's 5 Forces analysis shows us that the payment card industry is rather attractive since 4 out 5 forces (all except for ""rivalry among established firms"") drive profitability up for the current players. Then, the next logical concern would be to think that if this market is truly that attractive, more companies would get in up until the attractiveness vanishes; however, due to the reasons stated in the above chart, there are high barriers to entry that keep potential players (financial institutions or other payment solutions companies like PayPal) away from this market. Then, following a logical path, it would be reasonable to think that, considering all the arguments presented, the existing firms have incentives to engage in collusive practices… which in any case cannot be too evident or otherwise regulators will intervene in order to preserve market competition, in hopes of protecting the consumer interests (lower prices, higher R+D investments, wider product/service variety, etc).Speaking of regulatory interventions, last Wednesday (July 24, 2013) the European Commission proposed capping certain fees on credit and debit card purchases; would such a measure have a negative impact on MasterCard? Probably close to 0:1) This measure is only a proposal from the European Commission: there might be substantial amendments or even being rejected by the Parliament. Moreover, the legislative process can take several years.2) Even if this law is passed, MasterCard can pass on the cost to consumers, since the company has a strong bargaining position as competition is not very fierce in this industry and so it's not likely that Visa or American Express (MasterCard's only major rivals) will enter a ""price war"" and absorb the cost derived from that hypothetical new law. Plus, the risk of substitution is negligible. In addition, if Google Wallet accelerates its rate of adoption, maybe precisely through cutting fees to merchants, this cap on fees will not even apply at all.Therefore, the expected impact for MasterCard is nearly 0.Other key points1) Is cash still ""king""?Only in the developing markets and not for much longer: within the last decade, the number of credit cards in the US has been as high as 5 cards per person, and the trend in the developing economies is to switch from cash to electronic payments. As, Ajay Banga (MasterCard's CEO) said in an interview last year, ""85% of the world's retail transactions are still in cash, and only 15% are electronic payments but that's changing, and there's a secular move from cash to electronic"".In that direction, it is believed that China's market is extremely interesting: most of the people still use cash; that's where MasterCard comes into play: the firm has reached a mutually beneficial business partnership with China UnionPay (for example, they help MasterCard penetrate in China in exchange for some revenue).2) The role that social networking sites playFacebook and other social sites are a great opportunity for the Payment card industry, because when people want to make payments in those social sites, they need a credit/debit card to fuel that account.3) Mobile banking is the (present and) futureMobile phones represent the future of payments: the number of people who have mobile phones compared to the number of people who have bank accounts it's multiples (6 billion compared to 2.5 billion). Nowadays, mobile phones can be used as a payment processor provided they are enabled with the required technology (like Google Wallet's NFC technology) and the consumer has a linked card she can use. Moreover, it's also possible to send money by mobile phone (for instance, by using the PayPal app, text message, or the PayPal mobile website).Digging deeper into this market opportunity, it's essential to highlight that MasterCard is not missing out on this opportunity, and in fact, right now has an excellent strategic position to benefit from the development of this new way of making payments, thanks to the close partnership the company has with Google regarding ""Google Wallet"", which is a product launched by Google roughly 2 years ago and that has hitherto had a slow rate of adoption basically owing to the fact that at the beginning only the Nexus S was enabled with this technology, but as time goes by more and more devices have this technology, and even there are rumors that the new iPhone 5S (probably to be launched in late 2013) will have built-in NFC technology.Therefore, if Google is able to win the support of Apple and gets more merchants to join this initiative, there's a decent chance that NFC technology will become tomorrow's most used payment method, and in case that event occurs, MasterCard will be in a privileged position to benefit from this technological change.CONCLUSIONThe Qualitative analysis does nothing but support the good results obtained in the ""neutral"" and ""aggressive"" Quantitative valuation, and therefore I am confident that the true value of MasterCard is currently undervalued by at least 12.5%, as the headline of the article reads, and possibly lays somewhere in between $ 668.51 and $ 992.83, but it would not be sensible to state a certain figure (as an approximation, the average of those two figures is $ 830.67).However, those figures represent a good approximation to the true value that the company has, not the exact price that the market will eventually trade its shares for, since there is no perfect information and there exist transaction costs, and therefore the market is not fully efficient.But in any case, the price should approximate the real value, and therefore the margin of error if the valuation has been properly performed is rather small.Last but certainly not least, the strategy I recommend in order to benefit the most from this investment opportunity is to wait until tomorrow's (July 31) Q2 earnings announcement at 9:00 am ET: if MasterCard beats (again) analysts estimates, I suggest opening a long position in MasterCard through a financial derivative that allows for leverage (like a CFD, for instance), since there's a very high probability of reaching levels of $ 660 - 670 in the next few weeks; if MasterCard falls short, we might witness a pull-back and therefore the price may go down a little bit due to those news, but in any case MasterCard would most likely still be undervalued (at the current price) and therefore would still be a good longer-term investment opportunity.Disclosure: I am long MA.

1464551,47521,2013-05-28T12:05:10-04:00,,"Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) -- along with several giant banks, including Citigroup (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) -- have asked a federal judge to declare that setting fees paid by merchants that accept credit and debit cards aren't in violation of antitrust laws. What the request is about is providing a tool that can be used against a number of retailers that have opted out of a proposed settlement of $7.2 billion, which has been preliminarily approved. The original legal battle began eight years ago over allegations that Visa and MasterCard were inflating the fees retailers must pay for receiving the cards as payment for goods and services.Retailers Opting Out of the SettlementSince retailers involved in the original suit had until May 28 to opt out of the agreement, a number of them have already done so. The major reason many retailers are opting out of the suit is because of the inclusion of a provision that would not allow future lawsuits over antitrust violations. If retailers don't opt out of the settlement, it will be legally considered that they have accepted it.Target (NYSE:TGT), TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX), Saks (NYSE:SKS), Office Depot (NASDAQ:ODP), Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF), Macy's (NYSE:M), and J.C. Penney (JCP) have already opted out of the settlement, and others like Gap (NYSE:GPS), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) said they're going to opt out as well. Target, Macy's, Saks, TJX Companies, Office Depot, Kohl's, Abercrombie & Fitch, and J.C. Penney filed a lawsuit against Visa and MasterCard last Thursday, alleging the companies continue to engage in antitrust behavior. Wal-Mart, Starbucks, and Gap -- among others -- have said they may bring more lawsuits against Visa and MasterCard as well.They contend they are not being compensated enough for past alleged wrongs by the two companies, while being forced to accept releases for Visa and MasterCard concerning future lawsuits over antitrust issues. Visa and MasterCard have the option of ending the proposed settlement if the merchants opting out reach 25% or more of credit card volume. The National Retail Federation, which represents over 9,000 retailers, has asked its members to reject the settlement.VisaClick to enlarge images.MasterCardImplication if Judge Rules Fees Don't Violate Antitrust LawsThe complaint filed by Visa and MasterCard on Friday would have a significant impact on the companies if the judge rules that setting fees aren't in violation of antitrust laws. If the judge rules on behalf of Visa and MasterCard, it could stop retailers from pursuing damages in separate lawsuits. It may also stop retailers who opt out from seeking damages concerning swipe fees. In other words, Visa and MasterCard aren't just trying to stop future action against them -- they're attempting to stop damages being inflicted on them from alleged past violations.Included in the complaint were the National Grocers Association, National Restaurant Association, National Association of Convenience Stores, and National Association of Truck Store Operators -- among others. Along with Visa and MasterCard, plaintiffs in the complaint include the big banks mentioned earlier.Implications for Visa and MasterCardIf Visa and MasterCard don't reach a settlement with the retailers, it could open a floodgate of lawsuits in the future, which would do some serious damage to the companies. It would be extremely difficult for shareholders and investors to accurately predict the health of the companies if endless legal uncertainties linger over them.Considering that the two companies are profitable, based largely on swipe fees, it would be extraordinary if they were to be considered illegal (or potentially illegal) and the door to future lawsuits left open indefinitely. The complaint by the plaintiffs said the following: ""A declaration in plaintiffs' favor against the defendants is necessary to prevent the continuation of endless, wasteful litigation between defendants and plaintiffs.""That pretty much sums up what Visa and MasterCard face if nothing is really resolved, other than paying out settlement money. Both companies would consider the damages a cheap price to pay to end the ordeal. Those merchants still supporting the settlement, as well as Visa and MasterCard, believe the settlement will be approved.ConclusionThis is of vital interest to all parties involved, but even more so to Visa and MasterCard, as the fees are their moat. When a company can set prices with little competition, it's like owning the rights to a toll bridge -- all they have to do is sit back and collect the money.Visa and MasterCard assert if the judge doesn't rule in their favor, the merchants can bring ""essentially the same claims"" over and over again in new litigation. The fact the retailers are opting out over the ability to file future lawsuits appears to confirm that this is what would probably happen. What the retailers are trying to do is sue Visa and MasterCard in an effort to pressure them to require lower fees. If they sue enough times, both companies would have to lower swipe fees in order to remain viable businesses.Profitability is what's at stake here with Visa and MasterCard, and whether or not they'll be as attractive in the future as they have been in the past is what is close to being determined. Looking at their terrific performances over the last 12 months, billions are at stake in the battle. For retailers, it's the issue of how much of higher fees they'll have to eat if they are ruled against. There is only so much they can absorb before having to pass it on to consumers. Either way it's not a positive outcome for them, because margins could come under pressure. As usual, larger retail companies will be able to perform better in that environment.These two scenarios on the opposite sides of the issue is why they have dug in so hard in the battle. One way or the other, the major plays here will be Visa and MasterCard, as the share prices of the companies will move quickly whichever way the decision goes.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1398611,23479,2013-05-03T08:58:14-04:00,,"The payment solution industry continued to grow through the first three months of 2013. Card giants Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) reported 15% and 9% gross revenue growth for the first quarter of the calendar year, respectively. Both companies were helped by a worldwide shift to plastic. Visa reported a 7% increase in global payment volume, while MasterCard reported an 11% growth in gross dollar volume [GDV] across the world.Both companies earn revenues from their banking clients. Assessment fees are charged as a percentage of the GDV of transactions processed for a client while data processing or transaction fees are charged on the basis of the total number of transactions processed for a client. The companies also charge cross-border fees for transactions where the issuer or card holder’s bank and the acquirer or merchant’s bank are based in different countries.The Battle For U.S. VolumesVisa processed close to 14 billion transactions through its network in the March quarter, an increase of 6% over the prior year’s figure. U.S. growth was hindered by the implementation of the Durbin amendment to the Dodd-Frank bill, which requires banks with more than $10 billion in assets to use separate payment processing networks for signature authorized and PIN authorized debit card transaction [The Durbin Amendment Explained]. The company, which dominates the U.S. market with close to three-quarters of the market share, reported a 3% increase in transactions processed in the country.  The U.S. is an important market for Visa, accounting for 40% of its payment volume. MasterCard capitalized on Visa’s loss, with an 11% growth in U.S. transactions, primarily driven by signature processed debit transactions.Visa’s management also revealed growth figures for the month of April, with a 15% transaction growth driven by market adoption of the debit regulations. We expect the growth rate in processed transactions to normalize in the long term as the debit regulations are adopted by the market. Please read our article: How Will Visa Benefit From The Mobile Phone Revolution? for more on growth prospects.The effects of the debit regulations were also evident on the payment volume. Visa’s payment volume through consumer credit cards increased by 11% in the U.S. while the consumer debit volume dipped 4%. MasterCard was able to snatch market share, particularly through PIN processed debit transactions. The company reported a 6% increase in debit card GDV, but only 2% growth in credit GDV leading to a 4% growth in GDV. As with transactions, we expect the market to adapt to the new regulations in the coming months, allowing both companies to normalize growth rates.Normalization can already be observed, MasterCard’s 6% debit GDV growth rate for the first quarter was lower than 15% growth it reported in 2012. The low growth in credit cards is a concern for MasterCard as Visa continues to maintain dominance in this field.PIN processed debit transactions have a lower revenue yield than other transactions. So, although MasterCard reported a 12% increase in processed transactions across the world, the increase in transaction processing fees was just 9%. Continued Expansion Outside The U.S.Both Visa and MasterCard continued to expand outside the U.S. Visa reported a 20% increase in transactions processed outside the country with payments volume increasing 9%. This led to a 25% increase in revenues from transaction fees and a 10% increase in assessment fees. The company also observed a 10% increase in global cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis, leading to a 13% increase in international transaction revenue. As a result of this revenue outlook, the company increased its EPS guidance from high teens to 20%.MasterCard reported an 11% increase in GDV across the world with a 20% increase in Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Africa. The GDV in Latin America grew by 11% while the European volumes increased by 13%. MasterCard’s cross-border GDV increased by 16% over the prior year’s figure. The company’s management expects net revenues to grow by 11-14% over the next three years. Our forecast is more conservative, with revenue and gross profit growth around 10% during this period. You can modify the interactive charts in this article and the company pages for Visa and MasterCard, to gauge the effect a change in forecasts would have on our price estimate.Disclosure: No positions"
1473191,29371,2013-05-31T09:03:00-04:00,,"IntroductionSince my last article ""MasterCard And Visa Are Winning The War On Cash"" in early March 2013, shares of MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V), as well as those of the two other major credit card companies, American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS), have healthily outperformed the rise in the S&P 500 index (see graph). MasterCard and Visa should continue to benefit from:There are threats to the top two credit card companies from their smaller competitors Discover and American Express as well as from technological innovation, regulations and new entrants. However, there is little evidence so far that anyone is threatening significantly MasterCard's and Visa's global dominance in payment networks. The growth that Discover and American Express are seeing is mostly from offering additional services and products, not from gaining market share from MasterCard and Visa.Quarterly performance and valuationIn a word, MasterCard's and Visa's first-quarter performance was fantastic. During the quarter ended March 31, 2013, MasterCard and Visa reported revenue increases of 8% and 15%, while their earnings per share rose by 16% and 20%, respectively, compared with the same quarter of 2012. Net income per share growth was better than the growth in revenues due to lower rate of increase in expenses as compared to revenues and share buybacks. MasterCard and Visa repurchased shares worth $766 million and $1.8 billion during the latest quarter, respectively. Similarly, Discover's and American Express' revenues rose by 10% and 4%, respectively, while their earnings per share increased by 10% and 7%, respectively. MasterCard, Visa, Discover and American Express have approximately $1.7 billion, $1 billion, $2.4 billion, and $4.2 billion, respectively, available for share buybacks in the next few quarters.As of this writing, MasterCard and Visa traded at similar valuation levels based on price-to-earnings (22.5 for MasterCard and 23.8 for Visa) and on price-to-earnings-to-growth (1.2 for MasterCard and 1.5 for Visa). In addition to aggressively buying back their own shares, both companies return capital to shareholders by paying dividends. MasterCard and Visa have annualized dividend yields of 0.4% and 0.7%. Finally, both MasterCard and Visa are less volatile than the market as they have betas of 0.8 and 0.7, respectively. It is interesting to note that shares of MasterCard and Visa are valued as growth companies, while Discover and American Express have the valuation characteristics of banks with higher volatility, lower price-to-earnings ratios, and higher dividend yields.Recent developments and regulatory hurdlesFrom operational and competitive standpoints, MasterCard and Visa continue to win new customers and offer innovative services and products. During Q1 '13, MasterCard's MasterPass Wallet made a deal with Alibaba Group, the large Chinese based e-commerce company, which gave MasterCard access to 6,000,000 merchants and 800 million users. Visa's most notable development in the past quarter was its partnership with JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), which gave JP Morgan Chase bank more flexibility in setting interchange terms with merchants. This allows greater cooperation between issuers and acquirers without Visa standing in between with its rules. In essence, this is similar to American Express' own closed loop network. Overall, Visa will likely gain market share and some incremental revenue due to its relaxing of rules until MasterCard follows suit.Also, MasterCard is able to gain more corporate customers, likely at the expense of American Express, with its products offering automated business expense management. Most recently MasterCard introduced mobile applications that are able to reduce expense accounting overhead and improve the overall expense tracking process for businesses. The most recent large win in this area was the government of Canada, which is converting its travel expense program to MasterCard.On the negative side, MasterCard did have a setback recently as an organized group of criminals was able to drain over $40 million from two Middle Eastern banks, National Bank of Ras Al-Khaimah and Bank of Muscat, with fake ATM cards. Experts agree that if MasterCard had implemented the security chip and pin it already uses in Europe (EMV for Europay, MasterCard, and Visa) this large theft could have been prevented. Making ATMs and merchants accept EMV technology is going to require significant resources and is expected to be implemented in the U.S. by 2016. Companies that can benefit from ATM retrofitting include NCR (NYSE:NCR) and Diebold (OTCPK:DBD), which is the subject of another article.Discover is threatening MasterCard and Visa's dominance by partnering with eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) Paypal. Paypal hopes to be accepted everywhere where Discover is, while also giving Discover access to the millions of its online customers. This partnership is potentially dangerous for MasterCard and Visa as it combines two major payment companies with complimentary expertise. Paypal brings technology experience while Discover is an expert at point of sales and offline networks. The partnership is being rolled out this year and it is still early to measure its success.Also, American Express is rolling out its partnership with Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), called Bluebird, offering its network to be used similar to a bank and allowing the two companies to offer such services as FDIC insured free checking, pre-paid debit cards, and direct deposit from employers and governments. While these two developments are in their early stages and are currently taking place only in the U.S., they are something investors in MasterCard and Visa need to be aware of.Finally, on the regulatory front, MasterCard and Visa are having challenges that both companies have been able to manage well so far. In the U.S., MasterCard and Visa are close to settling the antitrust lawsuit filed by merchants and the expenses are already accounted for. The suit should not have a major impact on MasterCard and Visa as it simply slaps a fine on the companies without effectively increasing merchants' fee negotiation leverage. A major reason is that 11 states have already banned merchants from surcharging customers that pay by credit card. On the negative side a number of states, in addition to major retailers such as Wal-Mart and Home Depot (NYSE:HD) have recently voiced their opposition to the settlement deal as it will prevent retailers from suing MasterCard and Visa in the future.And in Europe, the European Commission is investigating MasterCard and Visa in regards to inter-regional interchange fees and cross-border acceptance rules. The effect of this investigation is too early to estimate but it is likely to have larger impact on MasterCard as VisaEurope is a separate entity from Visa.ConclusionCredit card companies such as MasterCard and Visa are no longer just about making paperless transactions more convenient and secure. They want to develop a deeper relationship with customers as evidenced in their evolving marketing campaigns. For example, MasterCard is sponsoring the BRITs music awards and recently signed-up Justin Timberlake to promote MasterCard at his concerts and in ads. Also, MasterCard is developing a concept called Priceless Cities that allows major cities' residents and visitors to find out about everyday events and deals.Similarly, Visa is offering a high-end Infinite Dining Series to its customers and American Express has its own Delights program and has partnered with Twitter to allow consumers to buy directly on Twitter. Finally, Discover card is offering new credit cards (Discover it) with lower fees and better customer service and is also expanding into traditional bank areas such as direct mortgages and student loans areas. Such innovative rewards and/or offerings increase customers loyalty. Importantly, new services and partnerships allow credit card companies to leverage their payment networks with minimal investments.Without a doubt, credit card companies are here to stay. Even more, it seems like they are taking full advantage of the secular move to a cashless society. Also, the credit card companies are partnering with issuers, merchants and even competing companies to offer a better and more competitive products and services. While anti-competitive regulations are likely to have a negative impact it is likely to be minimal due to MasterCard's and Visa's experience in the legal area. The current dynamics are likely to contribute to MasterCard's and Visa's continued strong performance for the foreseeable future.My past articles on MasterCard and Visa:Mar.

1385791,44731,2013-04-30T15:21:01-04:00,,"MasterCard (NYSE:MA) is an ideal stock for a long-term growth investment. The premium attached to this stock is mostly based on the consistent returns on equity provided since MasterCard's IPO in the summer of 2006. MasterCard is trading for $547 today ahead of earnings. MasterCard was initially worth $45 per share, it has consistently performed to provide a ROI five times greater than Visa's (NYSE:V) since 2008. Since its IPO, MasterCard has provided investors with an average of a 40 percent annualized return.New positives:For proper perspective regarding growth projections, investors should view MasterCard as a global tech firm with a niche in the payment and credit sectors. The growing card payment demands in places like China, the Middle East and Africa will all help MasterCard's value to increase in the near term. MasterCard has enough prospects currently on its docket to potentially provide strong returns to investors throughout the remainder of 2013 and beyond. Listed below are a number of these projects.Investors can expect increased revenues and additional sources of growth in the near future from new assets like the Royal Bank of Canada. MasterCard is also negotiating with Kenyan banks in Africa to bring payments options to this massive sample of potential customers. Around 80 percent of Africa is currently unbanked, any news or developments on this front may significantly increase MasterCard's stock.There are also opportunities for growth in MasterCard's mobile application, PayPass, which is gaining popularity in the U.S. and overseas as well. This app can provide significant transaction growth for MasterCard as users all over the world adopt smartphones as their primary wallet.Perhaps the greatest proponent for MasterCard's success in the near term will be its growth in China. There was news in mid-April that MasterCard signed a strategic cooperation agreement, with China CITIC bank, for providing payment services to merchants and cardholders in China and the rest of Asia. Some of the services will focus on e-commerce, risk management and provide virtual platforms to clients. MasterCard will benefit from this partnership as China CITIC intends to become the global bank card of China, and expand its worldwide market share.MasterCard also has a new partnership with Target (NYSE:TGT) that should create some new opportunities for growth and profits in the near future.MasterCard earnings release for the fourth quarter exceeded analysts' estimates, and it's feasible that the global payment firm will continue this trend. MasterCard's current ROE is almost three times higher than the industry's 16 percent average.Potential Negatives:Buying MasterCard at this level is not without risk. It's had an incredible run and any major pullback in the markets, consumer spending or the financial services sector could hurt future growth and earnings.As was seen during the 2008 financial crises MasterCard took a 50% hit in share price falling from the $290 to the $150 range. It however took less than a year to recover and has trended higher ever since.Potential protection could be purchased by buying Jan 2014, 520 strike puts, currently trading around $28 per contract. Then selling out of the money weekly expiration calls against your long stock position to recoup the investment in the puts. Giving you the possibility for significant downside protection at little or no cost.Conclusions:For investors that are considering one of the top global payment companies, there is good support for MasterCard's premium and value as a worthy investment. This is a very technically sound stock when compared with its peers; the return on equity, the growth, EPS and price ratios all favor MasterCard in comparison to Visa. Visa's annualized return for the past five years is less than half in comparison to MasterCard. Investors should expect MasterCard to continue to perform. The value in MasterCard is it has underperformed its peers thus far, year-to-date. Discover (NYSE:DFS), American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Visa have all provided slightly higher returns in the market than MasterCard for 2013. However, considering MasterCard's consistency and international prospects, it's hard to imagine that MasterCard won't catch up.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1717782,39551,2013-09-27T14:56:57-04:00,,"MasterCard (NYSE:MA), the world's second-largest payment network, held its annual investor day earlier this month. The focus of the investor day was on the rapid convergence of physical and digital payments, providing more value across the payments ecosystem and the global secular trend towards more plastic.The No. 2 global card network has invested about $1.9 billion in growth initiatives since 2011. Compared with its smaller rivals, the company has invested a huge total of $900 million in various organic growth initiatives since 2011. In addition, MA has spent $1.0 billion in acquisitions, which will be a bigger focus ahead. Breaking down the investment even further, about 43% of spend has been targeted on expansion/innovation (loyalty and rewards, information services, Access Prepaid, DataCash, digital initiatives, and MasterCard Labs), 35% of spend has been targeted on delivering growth (products, sales and marketing, acceptance, MasterCard Advisors), and 22% of spend as been targeted on technology and infrastructure (processing, safety and security and information technology). Despite increased investment spend, MA has increased operating margins by about 400bps since 2011. Visa (NYSE:V) also indicated on its investor day in July that it has spent about $700 million in growth initiatives since FY2011.The company is also actively looking for M&A opportunities that the company believes represent a strategic fit and meet MA's selection criteria. Potential M&A deals are expected to focus on companies that help add merchant value and use MA's robust data. MasterCard suggested potential opportunities in the information services space, loyalty and rewards space, and processing space, with an acquisition size likely to fall in the company's traditional $50 million to $500 million range.As mentioned above the target companies must meet MA's selection criteria including returns above MasterCard's weighted average cost of capital of about 10%, address strategic priorities and provide capabilities in products, technology, distribution or geography. MA is also committed to stock repurchases and boosting the dividend. MA currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.60 per share, which was raised in February from $0.30 per share.The company also reiterated its 2013-2015 long-term guidance of 11-14% net revenue growth, operating margin of 50% or greater, and EPS CAGR of at least 20%. In addition, MA expects 2H13 net revenue growth to be similar to 1H13 (12%). With respect to the impacts of currency, MasterCard indicated that if rates were to stay at the levels seen at the end of August, euro and real movements would effectively cancel each other out in terms of revenue, net income, and EPS impacts.Investment Thesis And ConclusionWe have a buy rating on MA. MasterCard remains well positioned to benefit from higher spending volumes and many positive long-term secular trends including a consumer shift from cash to electronic payment methods, emerging market exposure, and expanding card acceptance. MasterCard's business is highly defensible and characterized by recurring revenues, low capital expenditures, high incremental margins, and high free cash flow.The company is embracing new technology based offerings including mobile, online, and information services, all of which are expected to drive transaction volume. Moreover, preserving a strong balance sheet and liquidity remains a key priority of MA from a capital allocation perspective. MasterCard also anticipates organic growth investments and remains open to mergers and acquisition opportunities. Lastly, the company remains committed to returning excess cash to shareholders with bias towards buybacks.YTD MA is up by a little more than 40%; in comparison V is up by 30%.Source: Google FinanceDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1384431,24706,2013-04-30T11:55:00-04:00,,"By: Todd McDonald, AnalystOverviewMasterCard (NYSE:MA) is slated to report 1Q 2013 earnings before the opening bell on Wednesday, May 1. The actual results are typically released between 8:00 and 8:10 a.m. EST and follow with a conference call at 9:00 a.m.Outliers & StrategyRecent NewsTechnical ReviewMasterCard shares have spent most of 2013 consolidating in a $30 range after breaking $500. Although MasterCard has underperformed the market slightly this year, it had a great 2012, rising 29.83%. The all-time highs were set earlier this month, at $546.90, which should be used as an initial, albeit weak, resistance point if earnings surprise to the upside. If earnings disappoint, support can be found at the bottom of the recent range near $510, followed by $500. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com)SummaryMasterCard, along with the rest of the payment processing companies have been rewarding shareholders consistently thanks to an improving economy, rising consumer confidence, and excitement over innovative new payment processing systems. With the recent consolidation, there is potential for a large directional move. Look for numbers near the high end of the range for a reliable buy signal.Disclaimer: By using this report, you acknowledge that Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of commentary, analysis, and or data in this report.

1382541,32001,2013-04-29T17:44:16-04:00,,"Although we think of Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) as quasi-financial exposure ideas given that credit and credit usage are part and parcel to a healthy economy and are a function of consumers willingness and ability to spend, the fact is Visa and MasterCard are considered ""global payments technology"" companies, and are really part of the tech sector.This week, we hear from both companies in terms of their March 2013 quarters.If you bought the Mastercard IPO in mid-2006 at $45 per share, you would have a 1160% return on your money with MA trading at roughly $525 pre earnings.If you would have bought Visa's IPO in March 2008 at roughly $55 - $60 per share, you'd have a more modest return on your investment, but you'd still be up 280% in a tough market.The Durbin Amendment and the curtailing of debit card growth and the resultant fees resulted in a correction for both stocks, but both names have since rebounded and gone on to all-time highs.There continue to be cross-border issues around fees and such, and some of the inter-quarter data was a little weaker than expected, likely due to higher payroll taxes and slower tax refunds, but that should fade as we move through 2013.Visa: (V)When Visa reports fiscal 2nd quarter 2013 on Wednesday, May 1, after the closing bell, consensus analyst expectations per ThomsonReuters are looking for $1.81 in earnings per share (EPS) on $2.85 billion in revenues for expected year-over-year growth of 13% and 11%, respectively.For full-year 2013, current analyst consensus is looking for $7.34 in EPS on $11.577 billion in revenues for expected growth of 18% and 11% growth, respectively.Last quarter, V grew revenues and EPS 12% and 23% respectively, as total payment volume grew 8%, 3% debit volume growth with 12% credit volume growth.According to current analyst estimates, V is expected to grow revenues low to mid teens for the next three years, while EPS is expected to grow mid to high teens over the next 3 years.V's fiscal 2013 and 2014 EPS estimates have crept steadily higher over the last 12 months, a good sign relative to MA.Our internal model values V at $180 per share, while Morningstar carries an intrinsic value for V at $130 per share, so if we split the difference, V is thought to be fairly valued about where its is trading.We won't add any shares ahead of the earnings report.Mastercard:When MA reports first quarter 2013 before the bell, Wednesday, May 1, analyst consensus is expecting $6.18 on $1.93 billion in revenues for expected year-over-year growth of 15% and 10%, respectively.For full year 2013, EPS and revenue growth is expected at 16% and 11% respectively.We currently do not have a model on MA, but Morningstar values MA at $420 per share, so with the stock at $522 per share, MA is trading at a 25% premium to its proposed fair value.MA's 2013 and 2014 EPS estimates have been fairly stable over the last 12 months, and have not seen the upward revisions that V has, so analysts look to have become slightly more conservative on MA's outlook.Commentary:We are only long Visa for clients, but MasterCard, according to the analyst models we've looked at the company seems to have superior returns to Visa in terms of Return on Assets and Return on Equity.MasterCard's ROE is almost double that of V's, averaging in the 40% range, versus V's 15% - 20% range the last year. MA's transaction and volume growth is also mid-teens versus V's high-single digits.We are comfortable with our Visa position since the stock has kept pace the with the S&P for 2013, up about 12% as of the today's trading, while MA is up about 9% year-to-date.Frankly, I think both stocks have shown remarkable resilience given the payroll tax hike in 2013, the slower tax refunds, and the slow-growth economy. Ultimately, as long as the consumer remains in good shape and continues to spend, and the monthly payroll numbers average 150,000 - 200,000 jobs per month, and consumer balance sheets remain in good shape, I'd be willing to buy more of both names on weakness.Technically, MA should find its first layer of good support between $450 - $475, while Visa should find support between $140 - $150.Consumer balance sheets have improved greatly since 2008 and the housing collapse. Consumers are far less leveraged and far more liquid today than just 5 years ago.Disclosure: I am long V. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1304031,45851,2013-03-27T11:50:43-04:00,,"MasterCard (NYSE:MA), the second largest payment system in the world, is a credit card services provider. The company has been on a continuous up-trend and is expected to generate returns that exceed the S&P 500. The company earns small percentages on each transaction made by every debit or credit card through its network.The company works as an intermediary with very little risk while playing an important role in the global market. Merchants using the network benefit from reduction in fraud and higher consumption, while users enjoy the convenience of being able to withdraw money directly from their bank accounts. The company continues to expand internationally which is the main factor contributing to its growth.Impressive PerformanceMasterCard reported impressive financials for the fourth quarter of 2012, backed by expansion in overseas business that beat analysts' expectation. Net income for the quarter jumped to $605 million, or $4.86 per share, from $19 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier. Net revenues improved 10% to $1.90 billion, while the company processed 20% more transactions, including 17% higher cross-border volumes.The volume of cash moved outside the United States in 2012 rose 23.5% on a U.S. dollar basis compared with a 9.7% growth inside the U.S. For the full year, the company earned $2.76 billion, or $21.94 per share, on revenue of $7.39 billion.Rival Visa (NYSE:V), the world's biggest payments network, posted a 26% rise in the profit for the same quarter to $1.29 billion as consumer card spending accelerated.MasterPassMasterPass is the latest service from MasterCard, which allows users to make purchases from virtually any mobile device. The new service is based on the company's current PayPass Wallet services. MasterPass has the ability to scan a product barcode in the store aisle itself and purchase the item there and then, within the store's app.This service will help merchants design unique shopping experiences for their customers, enabling customers to check out even more quickly via their smartphones and tablets. The new service from the payment gateway company reflects MasterCard's quest to keep up with the evolving shopping landscape and consumer purchasing channels.Growing Despite Sovereign Debt CrisisAt a time when most of the companies are pinning their problems on the sovereign debt crisis, MasterCard claims that users in the region, mainly the Netherlands, Germany and Eastern Europe, are increasingly using credit and debit cards for purchases. Gross dollar volume in Europe, or the value of transactions processed by MasterCard, rose 9.3% to $1.1 trillion on a local currency basis last year.The main reason being, that the company is not just a credit card company but is also in consumer payment, and the global consumer expenditure is increasing 5 percent to 6 percent annually, which will also benefit the company's consumer payment segment.Dividend And BuybackThe New York-based company's board has authorized an additional $2 billion for the repurchase of Class A shares and also doubled the quarterly dividend for shareholders. MasterCard also revealed a month earlier that about $440 million of buyback is still remaining under its prior $1.5 billion stock-repurchase program. The company has also increased the quarterly dividend of 60 cents on or about May 9 to Class A shareholders, and Class B shareholders of record as of April 9. The last dividend of 30 cents that the company paid was on Feb. 8.This hike in repurchase and dividend reflects the confidence that the company has in its stock, along with the boost in capital as it inches to final approval of a federal class-action lawsuit reached last year with merchants.Experts Know BetterSixty-nine hedge funds tracked by indsidermonkey held long positions in MasterCard at the end of year 2012.Among all the funds, Tom Russo's Gardner Russo & Gardner had the biggest position in the stock, close to $437 million, constituting about 6% of its total 13F portfolio. Next on the list was Tiger Global Management LLC, managed by Chase Coleman with $327 million in the stock. The investment in MasterCard was 6.1% of its 13F portfolio. Other hedge funds that are bullish on the stock include Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global, Donald Chiboucis's Columbus Circle Investors and John Armitage's Egerton Capital Limited.Apart from funds, money managers have also been investing heavily in the stock. JAT Capital Management, managed by John Thaler, had the largest position in MasterCard with an investment of $22 million. Philippe Laffont's Coatue Management initiated a $16 million position during the quarter. The other funds with new positions in the stock are Mark Broach's Manatuck Hill Partners, Jim Chanos's Kynikos, and Seymour Sy Kaufman and Michael Stark's Crosslink Capital.ConclusionMasterCard is a good buy for those who are optimistic on the development of mobile payments, international commerce and the diminishing frequency of cash transactions (which we should all expect). The company recently introduced a dollar-denominated MasterCard card in China in alliance with Citibank. The continued expansion by MasterCard in growing Asian economies like India and China will drive future growth. Also, the company's innovation in coming out with merchant and user-friendly methods will help it gain more and more popularity globally. The stock is also a good buy for investors looking for exposure to the financial industry without bearing too much risk.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: Black Coral Research is a team of writers who provide unique perspective to help inspire investors.

1263611,29371,2013-03-11T14:36:05-04:00,,"Since my last analysis in Dec. 2012, the major credit companies have performed in-line with the rise in the S&P 500 with American Express' (NYSE:AXP) price slightly outperforming and Discover Financial (NYSE:DFS), MasterCard (NYSE:MA), and Visa (NYSE:V) stock prices slightly underperforming the index. The latest quarterly results of MasterCard and Visa exceeded Wall Street expectations and due to a lack of meaningful competition, a secular move to electronic transactions, and shareholder friendly policies, I expect the common stock of MasterCard and Visa to continue to perform well. Despite recent legislation to reduce credit card companies' pricing power and lawsuits against these companies, it seems like the music will continue to play for the major credit card companies for years to come due to their intrinsic ability to facilitate electronic transactions.Recent financial performanceFor the quarter ending December 31, 2012, MasterCard and Visa reported earnings per share of $4.86 and $1.93 outperforming the average estimate by 1% and 8%, respectively. MasterCard reached revenue of $1.9 billion and Visa of $1.3 billion for improvements of 9.7% and 12.9% from the same quarter in 2012, respectively. Both companies have healthy earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization margins of 53.3% for MasterCard and 24.9% for Visa. The companies are able to improve their bottom lines by investing in technology, having limited competition, and improving operations. And they can grow their top lines even in bad economic climate due to a transition from cash to electronic payments. For example, even if GDP in a country drops by 2% but 5% more consumers and businesses use credit cards and related services, credit card companies will likely increase their revenues.In addition to strong performance, both companies repurchase significant amount of shares. This spreads their earnings over a smaller amount of shares and also increases the demand for their shares. Currently, MasterCard has $440 million remaining from a previous repurchase authorization and $2 billion from a more recent authorization the company announced on February 5, 2013. Similarly, Visa has available $1.1 billion available under an old authorization and $1.75 billion under a recent share buyback program. This is in addition to annualized dividend yields of 0.5% (MasterCard) and 0.8% (Visa). These shareholder friendly policies, together with a strong operational performance has caused the shares to trade at significantly higher price-to-earnings ratios of 20.7 and 21.9 for MasterCard and Visa, respectively, compared to a forward PE ratio of 14.2 for the S&P 500.Merchant settlementIn 2005, hundreds of merchants filed a class action lawsuit against MasterCard, Visa and the major credit card issuing companies over fixing of credit card fees. After years of litigation, MasterCard and Visa, together with the other defendants and a number of plaintiffs, agreed to a settlement. The settlement calls for a payment of $7.25 billion to the suing merchants and $525 million to stores suing independently. In addition, merchants will be allowed to pass some of the fees to customers in the form of a surcharge.The settlement was welcomed by MasterCard and Visa as it basically imposes a fine on the companies without resolving the issue of fee setting. As a result, a majority of the plaintiffs oppose the settlement and in September 2013 a judge will decide whether the settlement stays.Ten states have laws that prohibit merchants from levying credit card related surcharge fees and their laws prohibit companies doing business in the state from instituting similar fees in all other states where they operate. Thus, large, national companies will not have surcharge fees. At the same time, small companies, in order to stay competitive with their larger competitors, will likely not charge such fees. It is easy to see that if the settlement is approved, it will not do anything more than slapping a (relatively) small fine to the credit card industry.New developmentsBoth MasterCard and Visa continue to expand globally. The most significant initiative both companies have undertaken is to reach the hundreds of millions of people without an access to the formal financial system. Reducing cash use in developing countries as well as developed countries makes economies more transparent, transactions easier, and reduces the risk of carrying cash. Also, MasterCard and Visa, as well as a number of other intermediaries, get a cut of each transaction.For example, Visa is part of Saral money in India launched recently in a partnership between the Indian government, five banks and the national identity system to offer debit cards there. In Russia, Visa is partnering with one of the largest payment networks, QIWI, to provide a digital wallet. And in February 2013, it launched a new plug-and-play mobile money platform together with leading mobile phone operators in India and Rwanda. The platform offers open-loop (allows consumers to change mobile providers without losing their payment information) and closed-loop payments as well as user interface design, consumer enrollment, transactions processing, authorization, clearing and settlement. In other developments, it entered in a partnership with Samsung to provide NFC (near field communications) capability by utilizing Visa's payWave technology (Apple's iPhone does not offer NFC capability).In the U.S., Visa extended its partnership with JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and ended the ban on retailer discounts for specific cards in an effort to relax its rules. On a company-wide basis, Visa's seven major focus areas include:Similarly, MasterCard is focusing on domestic as well as international expansion. In the U.S., recent wins include Intercontinental Hotel Group (NYSE:IHG), Bass Pro Shops, Shell (NYSE:RDS.A), KeyBank (NYSE:KEY), Aetna (NYSE:AET), and SunTrust. Its wins abroad include RBC (NYSE:RY) in Canada and significant wins in Africa (Equity Bank and Nigeria) and Latin America (Brazil). In addition, its PayPass service has reached over 700,000 terminals and is still growing strongly in Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa. Its MasterPass digital payment platform, which is an evolution of PayPass Wallet service, is well accepted by financial institutions and merchants. Also, MasterCard is helping financially under-served people with its mobile money partnership program.Finally, both companies are pushing for implementation in the U.S. of the EMV (Europay, MasterCard, and Visa) standard already implemented in Europe and other regions of the world. The implementation is costly for many merchants but MasterCard and Visa are relentless, offering incentives and threatening penalties for merchants that do not implement EMV technology by the October 2015 deadline (including shift of liability to the merchant for losses from fraud).ConclusionWithout a doubt, the credit card companies, including Visa and MasterCard provide value to the economy. For example, they can offer analytical data to their clients (merchants and financial institutions) about spending patterns and demographics. Certainly this and other benefits stemming from the ability to track transactions are not available when using cash. In addition, Visa and MasterCard are able to keep and return to shareholders most of the incremental profits from technological innovation and economies of scale as there are few alternatives to their global networks and experience in payments.On the negative side, MasterCard and Visa serve mostly merchants and financial institutions and have little incentive for a real change. For example, American Express, which issues its own credit cards, is teaming with Twitter to offer shopping service by utilizing special hash tags. Also it is offering an alternative to a checking account in a partnership with WalMart (NYSE:WMT) called the Bluebird. Similarly, Discover is friending Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and eBay's PayPal (NASDAQ:EBAY).It seems that due to their comfortable duopoly and close connection with established financial institutions and merchants, Visa and MasterCard are not venturing in similar business activities. Even the often talked about innovative payment company Square still relies on the major credit card companies. So far, it seems like Visa and MasterCard are winning the war against cash without taking any prisoners.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The card processing company reported 10%  growth in revenues through the first nine months of the year,  registering growth across segments. We expect the card processing giant  to have maintained this momentum through the fourth quarter.MasterCard earns revenues by charging assessment fees based on  payments volume and data processing fees (which include clearing,  settlement and transaction processing fees) based on the number of  transactions processed for a client (banks issuing MasterCard's debit  and credit cards). Assessment fees account for 36% of the company's $8  billion revenues whereas transaction fees account for another 30%.Our price estimate of $540 for MasterCard's stock is in-line with the current market price. Please read our article ""MasterCard's Business Overview (Part 1): Assessment And Transaction Fee Income"" for a detailed analysis of MasterCard's business operations. Debit BoostDebit card transactions account for almost two-thirds of total  cashless transactions in the U.S., and the U.S. accounts for 40% of  MasterCard's revenues. MasterCard's debit and prepaid transactions  processed increased by 15% in the first nine months of 2012, helped by  the implementation of the Durbin amendment to the Dodd-Frank bill. The  bill requires banks with more than $10 billion in assets to use separate  payment processing networks for signature authorized and PIN authorized  debit card transactions. This helped MasterCard take away market share from its main competitor, Visa (NYSE:V), leading to an 11% increase in total transactions.Gross Dollar VolumesAlthough debit card transactions are almost double the number of  credit card transactions in the U.S., spending is much higher on credit  cards. In the first nine months of 2012, the dollar volume of debit card  transactions in the U.S. was $1.1 trillion whereas that of credit card  transactions was $1.6 trillion. MasterCard reported a 10% increase in  gross dollar volumes during the period driven primarily by debit cards,  which increased by 15%. But, as credit cards account for a higher  percentage of gross dollar volumes, we expect the long-term growth rate  to be lower than that for transaction volumes.Disclosure: No positions."
1257481,41511,2013-03-07T17:12:17-05:00,,"The first time I saw a Square card reader was few years ago at a small coffee shop in Cedarville, Ohio. I thought it was really cool but, like many people, I wasn't really sure if it would catch on. In July of 2011 it was reported that Square was processing $3 million in transactions per day. In November of that year the number reportedly increased to $10 million; I realized that Square had indeed caught on. Fast forward to November 2012, and the number is over $27 million in transactions every day. That amount translates to Square processing about $10 billion in transactions annually, and excludes the transactions now processed for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX).It is no surprise that investors and analysts alike are concerned about the future of companies like Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA). Most of the articles I've read recently cite concerns that Square and concepts like the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Wallet are a major headwind for the card issuers. I recently had the opportunity to talk with a salesman for a credit card processor about how the process works, the conversation really changed my view on the role that these new processors and services might play.It is important to understand that Visa and MasterCard use multiple parties to process transactions, and the model is different than those of American Express and Discover. Pictured below is a graphic obtained from MasterCard showing how the process works.The real competition between processors is in the acquirer space (which, many times, represents more than one company.) and the settlement bank. Some companies attempt to be more competitive with vertical integration of these steps. Square only plays a part in these steps, nothing more. According to Square's founder, Jack Dorsey, Square has no intention of ever trying to cut the credit card companies out of the picture, it is just not what they are interested in. (Read full article here)When I looked for what the real headwinds facing card issuers are, I found this in MasterCard's most recent annual report:To me, this says that there are really two main concerns:I believe that concern number one is highly unlikely, but number two is highly likely.I'll start with my first concern, that other parties will be able to band together and disintermediate the card companies and make them useless. This is much tougher than it seems. I don't know very many people who don't have a single card with either a Visa or MasterCard logo, many of their cards are issued by banks as debit cards. Below is some key information about the top card companies. (source: Visa, figures as of year 2011) Visa and MasterCard already control most of the transaction volume around the world, and they are growing every day. The proliferation of card use is so widespread that cash is disappearing, I know people who can't pay for anything if their card stops working because they never have cash. Visa and MasterCard have collectively issued over three billion active cards, and clear over $100 billion in payments per year. In order to compete, someone would have to build their own massive data network, and then convince people to use their service instead. This would require a lot of capital, and probably wouldn't be profitable for a long time. It is also important to note that most of the world is equipped to accept this type of payment already, so changing would require a significant benefit to the end users.Now on to the second concern, others who want a piece of the action in payment processing. Companies like Square are not nearly as interested in the money they can make processing payments as they are with the information they can gather while doing it. If you read the same article I referenced earlier, Jack Dorsey believes that ""We think there is something much broader in the experience that has very, very little to do with payments.""Another concept in this arena is the Google Wallet. I personally love to buy new wallets, I do it all the time. The single thing my wallets have in common is that they hold my credit cards in them, and that extends to the Google Wallet as well. I personally have not used the service, but I would definitely be interested in it. I currently use a Starbucks app on my iPhone to pay for my coffee, but I still have to use a credit card to reload the virtual gift card I pay with. I have not found anything new in the works that will circumvent the use of MasterCard or Visa cards completely.The companies have tried at these value added ventures in the past, and it does not seem that either of them was very successful. The thing that these companies do best is build and maintain networks that process and authorize payments in the blink of an eye, and that is what they need to stick to.Looking at the financial statements, it is clear that both companies are investing a lot of money in the future of their networks. They both stand to gain a lot from companies like Square and Google adding value to their services and enabling people to make more payments. Some will point out that the card issuers face increased regulatory risk and some financial headwinds, but I believe these risks are well known and already baked into the stock price.One last note is that both of these companies benefit from strength in the U.S. dollar. More foreign countries are working, one way or another, to devalue their currency, but the U.S. is already doing so and does not seem to be speeding that up. There seems to be a consensus that other worldwide currencies have seen their run, and the dollar will be finding more strength in the months to come.I believe both companies will perform very well in the years to come. Benefiting from higher payment volume provided by the value added services that others produce, and from an overall increase in the use of electronic payments. I suggest you do a bit of your own research to pick who you think will be more successful in adapting and evolving with these value added services.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in V over the next 72 hours.

1174001,40021,2013-02-12T05:49:03-05:00,,"There are not many growth stocks that have been as dependable as MasterCard Inc. (NYSE:MA) has been since the company's initial public offering in 2006. From almost any perspective that I judge growth equities by, especially in relation to large cap growth stocks, MasterCard is superior to almost all. On a performance basis, a fundamental basis and a growth basis MasterCard excels like few others. Just last month the company reported better than expected earnings results, which beat analysts' consensus estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Shares quickly rallied to new all-time highs, capping an impressive one-year run of more than 30%.The recent positive news on the company should not come as much of a shock to investors focused on the financial services/payment processing sector, as the growth trends overall have been largely positive and the segment a consistent winner for quite some time. However, with shares of MasterCard sitting just below its all-time high of $535.35 recorded last week, is the stock still attractive?This article will analyze MasterCard, and by extension the company's bigger but equally dependable rival Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), from a growth investor's perspective. The analysis will focus on four main criteria: chart, revenue and earnings per share growth, fundamentals and valuation.MasterCard is a technology company and payments industry leader, originally founded in 1966 and based in Purchase, New York. The company offers a wide array of payment solutions including payment processing technology, services and security to consumers, merchants, financial institutions and government entities around the world. The company manages and licenses several brand name payment cards including MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus. Among the payment programs offered by the company are consumer credit and debit as well as prepaid and contactless payment solutions.The Chart:Let's take a look at some charts to see just how well MasterCard has done for investors over the years. When looking at the long-term chart of a growth stock investors need to see a consistently upward-trending chart, which is indicative of a positive growth story, anything else is cause for concern on the growth front. For comparative purposes, I have included the performances for the three main competitors that operate in the segment, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) and Visa Inc.The first is a seven-year chart of MasterCard, which begins with the company's initial public offering in late May 2006 (included are 50-day, 100-day, 200-day moving averages):(Chart courtesy of Yahoo! Finance, From May 2006 to February 2013)Total return from May 2006 to February 2013, unless otherwise noted (all with dividends reinvested):MA: 1,090% - annualized return of 44.7%V: 161.4%, - annualized return of 21.8% (from March 2008 to February 2013)AXP: 29%, - annualized return of 3.9%DFS: 49%, - annualized return of 7.3% (from June 2007 to February 2013)S&P: 37.1%, - annualized return of 4.3%Since its IPO, not even seven years ago, MasterCard has returned well over 1,000%, which easily bests the general indices over the same time period. The stock has managed these great returns through relative trading consistency as MasterCard has obeyed its moving averages very well, faltering significantly only twice in its existence, in 2008 and 2010 (both amidst greater market turmoil). MA's long-term chart is displaying the kind of immense strength that any growth investor needs to see; the trend is upward and has been very consistent.Now let's take a look at MA's one-year chart to see how the stock has been trading more recently (included are 50-day, 100-day, 200-day moving averages as well as MACD and slow stochastic indicators):(Chart courtesy of Yahoo! Finance, From February 2012 - February 2013)One-year total return (all with dividends reinvested):MA: 47.9%V: 58%AXP: 25%DFS: 48.5%S&P: 18.2%Once again, MA has easily outperformed the general indices and it has done so in a rather steady uptrend. MA has not come anywhere close to breaching its 200-day moving average in the last year and the MACD indicates consistent buying and very little selling. Again, MasterCard is displaying strength in the way it trades.Although lagging behind both V and DFS over the last year, MasterCard has continued to perform well for investors, appreciating almost 48%. Note, MasterCard's most recent one-year total return of 48% is only slightly above its annualized return of 44% over the last 6.5 years.Now, let's have a look at the growth that has been driving these impressive gains:Growth:(Numbers from Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money as of 2/6/13)* Some numbers derived from average analyst estimate in listed fiscal year** Numbers provided are actual EPS distorted due to one-time litigation/special item charges in fiscal 2011/2012 and were not used in calculating average growth rates, non GAAP 2012 numbers are 17.26% and 24.05% for MA, V respectivelyThe table above illustrates that although all of the companies are growing/projected to grow revenues and earnings per share for the most part during this most recent three-year time span, MasterCard and Visa clearly offer the best growth. All of the listed growth rates for MA and V are consistently above 10% in revenue and EPS categories (except where otherwise noted).Looking ahead, both MA and V offer revenue/EPS growth rates that are approximately double those of AXP and DFS. MasterCard is projected to see the best revenue growth in both 2013 and 2014 and Visa is projected to see slightly better EPS growth in the same two-year period.Fundamentals:(Numbers from Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money as of 2/6/13)* Some numbers derived from average analyst estimate in listed fiscal year** P/E ratios reflect one-time settlement charge in 2012The first major metric that distinguishes MasterCard and Visa from the rest of the competitors is the lack of any debt whatsoever. Both companies have a very nice track record of quickly paying down any debt accrued (click on corresponding ticker to view 10-year summary: MA, V). When compared to their peers, MasterCard and Visa's lack of debt is even more impressive as both American Express and Discover Financial have staggeringly unhealthy levels of debt; AXP's current debt is 90.78% of the company's market capitalization and DFS's debt exceeds its current market capitalization. MasterCard also has an impressive cash reserve of $5 billion, equal to 7.73% of the company's current market capitalization.All listed companies boast impressive profit margins above 15%. However, once again MasterCard exceeds all other competitors, with a net profit margin of 37.33%. The all-important 'return on invested capital metric,' a calculation used to assess a company's efficiency at allocating capital to profitable investments, is impressive for both MA and V although MA greatly exceeds all other competitors in this regard as well, with ROIC at 39.4%. MasterCard's five-year average ROIC of 30.1% indicates that above-average return on invested capital is the norm for the company. This shows that management at MasterCard has been consistently and increasingly investing in its business operations very efficiently. Discover Financial is not, and has not been in the past, successful at providing returns on invested capital and this is a worrisome trend.American Express and Discover Financial generate impressive revenues compared to market cap; both are not too far off from generating revenues of 50% of their respective market capitalizations. MasterCard and Visa lag significantly in this category. MasterCard has a price/sales ratio of 8.82 and Visa has a price/sales ratio of 11.83, both are significantly higher than the industry average of 6.89 and the S&P 500 average of 2.43.The bottom of the table illustrates two more negative aspects of MasterCard and Visa: the valuation and relatively low yield. Visa currently has the highest trailing twelve-month P/E ratio as well as the highest forward twelve-month P/E ratio, at 43.89 and 18.54 respectively. MasterCard is the second most expensive stock out of the four on a current and forward-looking basis, with P/E ratios of 23.9 and 17.3 respectively. It is important to note that the trailing-twelve month P/E ratios for both MA and V are abnormally high due to a one-time settlement in 2012. Discover Financial is by far the cheapest stock with a current P/E of 8.94 and a forward P/E of 8.86, however this is to be expected as DFS is projected to offer the slowest combined revenue and EPS growth out of all listed companies for the next two years.Taking a look at both MA's and V's historical P/E ratios, we can see that although both are elevated compared to peers, both stocks are trading at valuations close to where they have traded in the past on a forward-looking basis. MasterCard has an average three-year P/E of 18.66, slightly above the stock's forward P/E of 17.6. Visa has a much higher average three-year P/E ratio of 34.2, which is significantly higher than the stock's forward P/E of 18.54. So, although both stocks appear expensive on a trailing twelve-month basis, they are much cheaper on a forward-looking basis, cheaper in fact than they have traded in the more recent past.Also worth noting is that MasterCard offers investors the lowest yield, at 0.5%. Visa's yield of 0.8% is the second lowest while AXP and DFS provide respectable yields well over 1%, the latter being the highest and currently yielding 1.4%.Growth Catalysts:In the company's latest conference call, MasterCard's President and CEO Ajaypal Bhanga gave some encouraging words on the company's future growth despite what he called a ""mixed economic picture"" for 2013 around the world. The first major takeaway from CEO Bhanga's guidance was that MasterCard is making serious efforts to increase global expansion.First up is Canada, where the company announced the launch of the Royal Bank of Canada, RBC Target Co-Brand MasterCard Credit Card Program, which will be available to consumers both online and in Target stores across Canada. The Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is actively expanding across Canada and MasterCard's partnership with Target ensures a new channel of growth for the credit card issuer. Management believes that this new card line, in addition to capturing new customers in Canada, will also help to reinforce its already successful partnerships in the region with companies like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and The Hudson's Bay Company. As Target expands across Canada, so does MasterCard.Secondly, MasterCard made headlines a few weeks ago as CEO Bhanga visited Africa and unveiled the company's plans to begin unleashing some of the massive potential hidden within the largely untapped continent. Africa, which remains 80% unbanked and whose population is set to triple in forty years from 2009 levels, presents an enormous task for all credit card companies in the future. To begin making inroads in Africa, MasterCard has partnered with Kenya's Equity Bank, one of the region's largest financial institutions, to issue five million MasterCard-branded debit and prepaid cards over an 18-month period, the main objective being to empower African consumers to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash.This agreement with Equity Bank of Kenya is just the first step of MasterCard's expansion plans on the continent, whose slogan is ""Africa: Navigating the Next Cashless Continent."" The company's research into Africa has revealed some potentially lucrative growth opportunities, largely concentrated into three capital cities in Sub-Saharan Africa: Accra in Ghana, Lusaka in Zambia and Luanda in Angola. The MasterCard African Cities Growth Index, results shown here, studied 19 individual cities in depth to determine those with the highest growth potential. The study based growth on the next five years, from 2012-2017, and focused primarily on not-yet-mature Sub-Saharan cities to maximize growth.Africa's increasing urbanization coupled with the global economy's rather dramatic shift towards emerging markets means cities like Accra, Lusaka and Luanda will become the center of their respective regional economies. MasterCard's attempt at getting in on the ground floor on a city-by-city approach is one that could reap ample rewards for the company as the 80% unbanked continent shifts towards urbanization. While the company has yet to reveal specific numbers with regards to growth, the research MasterCard has focused on its African bet is considerable and the effort already well underway.Thirdly, MasterCard is aggressively pushing its mobile solution PayPass globally as well. PayPass will play an increasingly integral role in the company's African expansion but there are numerous other growth channels around the world. The company recently announced a deal with European oil company ENI to replace the company's standard loyalty cards with MasterCard-branded credit and prepaid cards in Italy. This new deal pushes MasterCard's PayPass outlets past the 700,000 mark worldwide, which is an increase of 75% from last year's 400,000 outlets.Shifting towards the company's domestic market, MasterCard is still making significant growth progress. The company recently announced new deals with InterContinental Hotels Group (NYSE:IHG) and Bass Pro Shops to be the exclusive payment brand for both; the latter business MasterCard was able to take from a credit-issuing competitor. MasterCard recently renewed its deal with Shell (NYSE:RDS.A) (NYSE:RDS.B) to continue the company's Shell Co-Brand Card rewards card for consumers. Also, the company signed a new deal with KeyBank to extend exclusivity rights on existing debit and prepaid cards as well as to include new issuance for consumer and commercial credit. And finally, MasterCard extended the company's agreement to be the exclusive card service for U.S. Bank's Fleet and Aviation Card Programs, which makes U.S. Bank one of the company's top 10 commercial card issuers as of 2012.Another plus is that on February 5, MasterCard announced that it would be doubling its quarterly dividend and be buying back $2 billion worth of its shares. This raise in dividend, which represents an increase of 100% and which will return approximately $75 million to shareholders every quarter, is MasterCard's fourth dividend increase since the company's IPO in 2006. MasterCard has a five-year average annual dividend growth rate of 17.2%. While the dividend increases have not been consistent enough for me to label MasterCard a dividend-growth stock just yet, I have confidence that management will continue to increase dividends in the future.Guiding Forward:MasterCard beat expectations when it reported earnings on January 31, 2013 despite tough comps in the last quarter. Growth in the quarter was driven primarily by ""volume and transaction growth,"" according to CFO Martina Hund-Mejean. It is important to remember that in the fourth quarter of 2012, even with challenges like Hurricane Sandy and the fiscal cliff debate negatively affecting consumer confidence and retail sales in the United States, a contracting UK economy and weak business sentiment across the Eurozone, MasterCard still managed to grow net revenue at an impressive 10%, which CEO Bhanga admitted is really 12% after adjusting for currency.This strong performance from MasterCard amidst such challenging economic circumstances in the most recently reported quarter should give investors ample reason to believe management's guidance going forward, which calls for 11-14% net revenue compounded annual growth rate in the 2013-2015 period and 20% CAGR on an earnings per share basis for the same three-year period.CFO Hund-Mejean also went on to state ""in later years, assuming the world would turn to a more stable environment, we believe net revenue growth could be at the higher end of the range and that could also benefit EPS growth in that particular period."" So, consider management's estimate to be a floor for the company's growth going forward, not a ceiling.Past success is often a useful guide to the future, especially when it comes from management that has performed admirably over long periods of time for investors. MasterCard's management team expects solid revenue/EPS growth during the next three years and I have great confidence in their ability to meet those expectations.Risks:A major risk to MasterCard's growth is a general downturn in the global economy. General consumer/business spending trends are important to all financial services/payment processing companies and any serious downturn in that regard can cause a serious pause in the growth channel. Additionally, and as expressed by management in the company's latest conference call, any sudden and unexpected weakness in the Eurozone can cause softness in the future.Another concern that will always remain a looming dark cloud over companies like MasterCard and Visa is the ever-present threat of government intervention/regulation. While MasterCard and Visa managed to wrap up a seven-year merchant lawsuit centered on the alleged fixing of interchange fees, it should serve as a reminder that the threat of regulation will remain.In July of 2012, MasterCard and Visa agreed to settle merchant claims for a cumulative $7.3 billion. Aside from payment, the settlement also allows merchants to add surcharges on credit-only purchases, which is another possible but slight negative depending on the adoption rate of the surcharge. This situation is unique because it can also be seen as a positive for investors looking towards the future, in that what was a lingering cloud over both companies since 2005 has now largely been removed.Another risk is the rate at which popular payment platforms like eBay Inc.'s (NASDAQ:EBAY) PayPal are growing among consumers. As of mid 2012, more than half of all transactions involving PayPal were still done via credit card, so the PayPal success is still driving sales for companies like MasterCard and Visa through sheer volume. However, with the 2012 announcement that eBay has partnered with Discover Financial to launch a physical card of its own, an attempt to bring PayPal growth from being primarily online to in-store as well, one has to wonder how long it will be before PayPal begins taking away more transactions from MA and V than the companies make up in volume. I think the risk is a long-term one for the credit card companies and not so much an immediate problem, as eBay's PayPal faces challenging hurdles in reaching truly widespread adoption, but this is a risk that needs to be considered and monitored going forward.Conclusion:Although MasterCard and Visa are among the most expensive companies in the sector, the premium is well warranted as they represent some of the best and most consistent growth, not just in the industry in which they operate, but also among large cap growth stocks in general.Both companies excel at growing revenue and earnings per share on a consistent basis. In addition, the two companies also have the best balance sheets in the business, supported by increasingly impressive fundamentals. What's really important is that both MasterCard and Visa have delivered solid and consistent growth for years in the face of very challenging economic uncertainties around the world. Imagine what management at both companies can do when given greater visibility in the future!Not surprisingly, both stocks have outperformed all of their peers and the general indices by a wide margin and I expect the outperformance to continue well into the future, as the growth story for the sector remains very strong. On the heels of strong earnings reports from both companies recently and with projections calling for continued growth above 10%, I believe investors will do well owning either MasterCard or Visa in any long-term growth.MasterCard is the better investment, in my opinion, because it offers similar revenue/EPS growth, as projected by analysts for the next two years, and is currently trading at slightly better valuations than Visa, at both a cheaper forward P/E ratio and a cheaper Price/Sales ratio. Additionally, MasterCard is stronger fundamentally, with metrics like net profit margin and return on invested capital at much higher levels. Add in the company's smaller market capitalization and higher cash reserves and MasterCard is the undisputed king of credit. With an increasingly bright and global future, I believe MasterCard shares will continue to charge ahead!Disclosure: I am long MA, V, EBAY.

1087341,29371,2012-12-30T13:52:06-05:00,,"In its last issue for 2012, Barron's cover story basically repeated what I said four months ago, that Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) are two solid investments. In fact, since my last discussion of these two credit card leaders, their common stock returns have outperformed significantly the S&P 500 and the returns of major competitors, American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) (see graph). But instead of giving pats on the back for past performance, this article will take an intimate look at the current state of MasterCard and Visa fundamentals, the new developments surrounding the electronic payments industry, and what investors can expect in the future.FundamentalsDuring the past four quarters, both Visa and MasterCard have been able to outperform the average earnings estimate by a single digit percentage. For the latest quarter ending September 30, 2012 Visa earned $1.54 per share vs. an estimate of $1.50 and MasterCard reported earnings per share of $6.17 vs. a consensus forecast of $5.92. It seems like Visa and MasterCard are two well-programmed money making robots.MasterCard is the smaller company as it has a market capitalization of $60 billion compared to $120.5 billion for Visa. Both companies have enterprise values that are slightly lower than their market capitalizations as their cash holdings exceed their debt. And in terms of dividends, MasterCard pays a token quarterly dividend of $0.30 for an annualized yield of 0.25% compared to Visa's recently increased quarterly dividend of $0.33 for an annualized yield of 0.9%.The average estimates are for Visa to earn about $7.30 per share for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2013 for a forward looking price to earnings (NYSE:PE) ratio of about 20. Similarly, MasterCard should earn about $26 per share in 2013 for a 2013 PE ratio of about 18.6. Both companies are expected to continue repurchasing their shares, so the performance per share is likely to improve as the share counts is reduced. As of September 30, 2012, Visa had $1.5 billion left under its most recent share repurchase authorization and MasterCard had $1.1 billion under its own share repurchase program. In addition, MasterCard is likely to increase its dividend payout in 2013 to a more meaningful yield, following the recent 50%+ dividend rise for Visa.New DevelopmentsThere are always new developments with the two global credit card companies and the past four months were no exception. Since August 18, 2012, Visa issued 30 press releases compared to 97 for MasterCard. It will be difficult to discuss all of these press releases here so the ones that are particularly interesting and the reason why they are important are listed below:What Lies Ahead in 2013Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) will generate approximately $60 billion of revenues in 2012 but no, or minimal, net income. Assuming the company pays a 3% credit card fee on its sales, Amazon.com has spent about $1.8 billion in credit card fees in 2012. It makes sense, for a company like Amazon.com, to launch its own credit card network in addition to chasing profits on the clouds. A competition from Amazon.com or other large retail companies represent the largest threat to Visa and MasterCard. In fact, a competitor, Discover Financial Services was launched by a retailer, Sears (SHLD), back in the 1980s. And eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has its own payment network, PayPal. Many merchants are unhappy by the virtual monopoly and the high pricing of MasterCard and Visa, especially in the current environment of razor thin margins for many retailers. With internet costs declining and connectivity to mobile devices increasing, the largest threat to MasterCard and Visa in 2013 and beyond is likely to arise from a company already in existence such as Amazon.com, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), or even revenue strapped Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).While merchants do not like credit cards banks love them as they bring revenues and customers to the banks. In 2013 and beyond, more banks should adopt MasterCard and Visa payment services and brands as demand for cashless payments increase. Banks are still the major holders of people's cash and this is not likely to change or be disrupted any time soon. MasterCard and Visa are long-term partners for banks and other financial institutions and this should allow them to benefit from the transition to a more cashless society.ConclusionMasterCard and Visa common stock offer investors an exposure towards the global trend towards online and mobile payments. While there are potential disruptive competitors, MasterCard and Visa partnership with banks and governments should ensure their stable growth in the foreseeable future. In addition, MasterCard and Visa offer a good inflation hedge as part of their fees are based on the purchase price and as prices rise so will their fees. Based on this two trends, MasterCard and Visa common stock should offer above average returns.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The strongest price movement of +4.1% comes within thirty trading days when the company reports earnings that beat the whisper number, and -5.4% within one trading day when the company reports earnings that miss the whisper number.Last quarter the company reported earnings ten cents ahead of the whisper number. Following that report the stock realized a 6.8% gain within thirty trading days. Enter your expectation and view more earnings information here, or let us know your expectation in the comments section below.Knowing how likely a stock's price will move following an earnings report will help you make better trades. Many investors believe that beating or missing the whisper number has the greatest impact on stock movement. If the number is exceeded, the stock is rewarded and prices move higher. If the number is missed, the stock is punished and prices move lower. Unlike the analysts estimate, the 'whisper number' from WhisperNumber.com has actually been proven to have a greater impact on stock movement.************************************Since 1998, WhisperNumber.com has been tracking and publishing 'crowd sourced estimates' for earnings. We call these earnings expectations whisper numbers. The 'crowd' that provides us with whisper numbers are primarily individual investors and traders just like you that have registered with our site.We are an independent financial research firm. We have no affiliations with investment banks, investment management, or corporate organizations that could compromise our data or analysis.

We also have two independent academic studies supporting the premise that investor expectations for quarterly earnings (our whisper numbers) provide greater returns when used as an investment vehicle, and have a greater impact on stock movement than analysts consensus estimates.A company's 'price reaction' to the whisper number expectation is the key - on average companies that exceed the whisper are 'rewarded', while companies that miss are 'punished' following an earnings report.According to the Wall Street Journal, ""positive surprises are becoming so common they are nearly universal. They are predetermined in a cynical tango-clinch between companies and the analysts who cover them. All the numbers are gamed at this point"".

1101771,26891,2013-01-09T01:47:27-05:00,,"I recently wrote an article about Visa (NYSE:V) and why I am bullish on the credit card giant. When looking at Visa's competition, there are several names, but none bigger than MasterCard (NYSE:MA). When I do my own analysis, I like to make it available online, hopefully helping other investors find the right choice for themselves. Instead of simply doing an analysis on MasterCard, I decided to compare Visa and MasterCard to see which is better. Who knows, perhaps both will have a place in your portfolio.First let's look at a couple of charts. For the purpose of looking at long-term growth, we will use the 3-year chart for both companies. These charts will use the 50-day, 100-day and 200-day simple moving averages, to show the respective trends over the 3-year time span. The charts will also have RSI measurements and MACD readings. For further simplicity of this article, Visa's data will always be first, followed by MasterCard. Below, the 3-year chart for Visa and MasterCard:Visa 3-Year Chart :Source: Stockcharts.comMasterCard 3-Year Chart :Source: Stockcharts.comAs you can see, both companies have excellent looking 3-year charts. In fact, the two couldn't be better to be honest. This is exactly the kind of thing you want to see if you're a shareholder. Over the last few years, neither company has shown any real weakness. This is evident when you see that neither company has touched its 200-day sma since 2011.Now we'll take a look at the more recent price action, by using the 1-year charts. This time, we'll use the 20-day, 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages. This will highlight the long-term trend (the 200-day sma), while simultaneously illustrating the short-term trend (the 20-day sma). Below, the 1-year charts for Visa and MasterCard:Visa 1-year Chart :Source: Stockcharts.comMasterCard 1-Year Chart :Source: Stockcharts.comAgain, as a shareholder, what else can you ask for? Both of these charts look great, although I think Visa's looks slightly better. Both of these companies have an upward trending chart, with strong price action pushing it higher. The movement has been slow and steady for the most part, something that's important since we're striving for consistency.The real challenge between these two is deciphering the growth. Obviously, when choosing between two long-term growth companies, growth is the main component! For a further look, we'll look at revenue and earnings per share (EPS) growth. First, we'll look at the revenue growth from the previous three years (2009-11), the current year (2012), and the future two-year estimates (2013-14). Below is the revenue growth for the aforementioned time span:Visa's Revenues (In Millions):(*) = Indicates that these are estimates for the fiscal years of 2013 and 2014.MasterCard's Revenues (In Millions):(*) = Indicates that these are estimates for the fiscal years of 2012, 2013 and 2014.So what can we take away from the two tables above? A lot actually. For starters, it shows that Visa generates more consistent revenues than MasterCard. Although they are estimated to be more consistent, MasterCard spent 2009 and 2010 growing revenues in the single digits, while Visa has managed to keep its revenue growth between 10-15%.Another thing worth noting is that MasterCard is expected to grow revenues slightly faster than Visa will. Of course, this could change as they are only estimates, but it is worth noting. Also, MasterCard will be reporting 2012 fiscal year results during its Q4 earnings report, scheduled for January 31st, 2012. In light of consistency, I prefer Visa when looking at the two tables above. Although MasterCard has been great the past few years and has appealing estimates, I don't like to be too surprised from my long-term holdings, I like the consistency.Now we'll take a look at EPS growth. This measures how much and how fast annual earnings are growing -- or contracting -- for the respective companies. The time span will be the exact same as revenues, with the previous three years (2009-11), the current year (2012), and the future two-year estimates (2013-14):Visa's EPS:(*) = Indicates that these are estimates for the fiscal years of 2013 and 2014.MasterCard's EPS:(*) = Indicates that these are estimates for the fiscal years of 2012, 2013 and 2014.This time, the consistency sits with MasterCard, although a lot of things can alter a company's EPS number. Either way, MasterCard has been able to grow its earnings with less fluctuation than Visa. So far though, both companies have proven to be consistent, on the charts and in growth. Below is an outline of several key figures that investors should consider when choosing a long-term investment:Note: There is no winner on market cap, since bigger is not always better. It's only listed to illustrate the differences of the two companies to the reader.First, let's talk about the valuation of the two stocks. While the current trailing P/E ratios would suggest an overvalued state, the forward-looking P/E ratios do not. At 18 and 20, it suggests these names might be overvalued if they weren't growing. But as we all know, this is not the case from the revenue and EPS growth we looked at earlier.Valuation in general is important. When you look at the two stocks side-by-side, many might choose Visa. But why? Well probably because Visa costs $157 compared to MasterCard which costs $518. I know this doesn't make sense, as we just saw when comparing the valuations, but many investors work this way, for whatever reason. As you can see from a forward-valuation standpoint, they trade very close to each other in terms of price-to-earnings.The PEG ratio isn't as widely used as the P/E ratio, but can help shed light on the growth, relative to the valuation. The PEG ratio is calculated by dividing the P/E ratio by the annual EPS growth. If the equation equals 1, it means that the company is fair valued. A reading below 1 would indicate an undervalued stock, while a reading over 1 would indicate an overvalued stock. Oftentimes, growth giants are not valued under 1.The 1-year PEG ratio favors MasterCard and the 5-year PEG ratio favors Visa. It's important to consider that neither of these measurements are vastly different from one another. When I say favors, I mean it slightly favors one company or the other. The measurements are very close.Visa has a higher yield than that of MasterCard, but both have a relatively low payout. Both yield under 1%, but then again, we're not buying either of these companies for income purposes. However small, it is nice to see nonetheless. Not a ton of growth companies pay out dividends as well. But shouldn't these companies pay down debts before issuing a dividend?That's the beauty of these two companies, there's no debt! Zero. Zilch. There's nothing better than checking out a company you have long-term prospect for, to find that it has no debt. When you see that ""0"" sitting there on the balance sheet, you get much more confident that this is the right company for your portfolio.So which one wins? Honestly, to the disappointment of all the readers, I like both. Neither have debt, the charts look great, the valuations are very similar. In all honesty, these stocks are very close to the same. If I had to pick just one, I would pick Visa. If you can add both, I would add both, but say you have a philosophy or personal rule, where you can only pick one company per sector or industry. In this case, I would choose Visa.Visa has a slightly more preferable valuation over the long-term. The P/E ratio is low, the PEG ratio is more favorable and the yield is higher. Revenue growth is more consistent, although it's forecasted to grow slightly slower than MasterCard's revenues. Again, I think it's important to remember that these differences are extremely slight. In the end, these are two excellent companies, with great prospects and fair valuations. The growth is estimated to remain high and I have a very bullish outlook on each of these names.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in V over the next 72 hours.

1328031,24063,2013-04-08T15:52:35-04:00,,"By Matt DoironCredit card stocks have generally done well over the last year, and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) has outperformed the S&P 500 with a 22% return despite generally being somewhat insulated from economic conditions (the stock's beta is 0.8). The company experienced a 10% increase in revenues in 2012 compared with the previous year. While earnings did increase significantly in percentage terms, this is partially an artifact of a large litigation settlement in 2011. If we strip out litigation settlement items from the financials, pretax income increased by 12% - showing little changes in margin. MasterCard reported $21.94 in earnings per share for the year, and at the current market capitalization of $65 billion the stock trades at 24 times trailing earnings.At that valuation, we'd generally expect to see a company which can grow its net income at double-digit rates for several years. We did see good earnings growth from MasterCard last year, but going forward we would question how sustainable MasterCard's growth rates are. Wall Street analyst consensus for 2014 implies a forward P/E of 18, so even if the company hits sell-side targets it will have to continue significant growth numbers from that point forward in order to justify the current valuation let alone provide undervalued.A number of hedge funds have liked credit card stocks in the past few quarters, and MasterCard is no exception. Tiger Global, a Tiger Cub hedge fund, had MasterCard as one of its five largest holdings by market value as of the end of December, reporting a position of about 670,000 shares in its 13F (see Tiger Global's stock picks). Viking Global- managed by fellow Tiger Cub, and billionaire, Andreas Halvorsen- cut its stake by 33% between October and December but still closed 2012 with about 550,000 shares in its portfolio. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed ownership of a little over 400,000 shares, though this was a relatively small position in dollar terms for the holding company (see Buffett's top stock picks).Visa (NYSE:V) is MasterCard's closest peer. Visa's forward P/E is 19, so it is valued essentially in line with MasterCard on that basis. In its most recent quarter, which ended in December (the first of its fiscal year), Visa grew its revenue by 12% compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year- even with MasterCard's sales growth rate for the year as a whole. Visa may well be thought to have a stronger brand than MasterCard, and so possibly superior in relative terms, but we aren't particularly excited about it from a value perspective either.We can also compare MasterCard to American Express (NYSE:AXP), Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS), and Capital One (NYSE:COF). These stocks are considerably cheaper than Visa and MasterCard, though their brands are not as strong. Capital One and Discover actually trade at 10 times their trailing earnings or lower- quite a heavy discount- and in their most recent quarter financial performance was quite good versus a year earlier as well (though Capital One was aided by an acquisition). In fact, at those earnings multiples Capital One and Discover could be bargains as long as they managed any earnings growth at all in the next couple years; we would recommend looking into them as value prospects. American Express only managed to grow its revenue by 2% in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to Q4 2011, and with a trailing P/E of 17- about square between Visa and MasterCard at one extreme, and the other two peers on the other- we don't think that it's a good stock to buy.It's possible that Visa and MasterCard will achieve high earnings growth over the next several years and prove cheap even at their premium valuations. However, we'd guess at this point that any such rise would be led by industry dynamics, which should at least in part help Capital One and Discover as well (even though those companies do not have as positive a reputation). As a result we think that those two cheaper stocks are a better place to at least start looking for value.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: This article is written by Insider Monkey's writer, Matt Doiron, and edited by Meena Krishnamsetty.

1075171,23479,2012-12-20T10:50:48-05:00,,"Mobile phones have come a long way from the (9 inches long, 5 inches deep and 1.75 inches wide) initial prototype first developed by Motorola. The modern day smartphone has had a big impact on most of our lives, with applications developed for nearly all our daily needs and wants. Mobile phones have now become as indispensable as wallets, which leads to the idea – what if mobile phones could replace wallets? What if mobile phones could not only facilitate online payments (which they have for quite some time), but also allow you to make payments at the point of sale, essentially replacing the cash you currently carry in your wallet?The idea is not recent. Technology companies have been making promises about mobile wallets for years, but have failed to deliver anything substantial. The advent or rather the adaption of near-field communication (NFC) technology by popular manufacturers like Samsung seems to have given the idea a much needed impetus. The much anticipated ISIS mobile wallet developed by Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T was launched in Salt Lake City, Utah, and Austin, Texas, earlier this year. The Google wallet has payment partnership with Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Discover Financial (NYSE:DFS), but received a lukewarm reception at launch last year, possibly due to the fact that it only only limited to users with Citibank-issued cards.  Let’s look at the effect of the developing mobile payment technology on payment solutions providers like Visa and MasterCard. We will discuss the market size, the potential for development and the impact that mobile payments could have on these payment giants. Worldwide ReachVisa estimates that over 30% of consumer spending across the globe is still carried out through cash and checks, accounting for over $10 trillion in gross dollar volume. Taking a look at some more statistics available from Statista, we see that mobile phone payment accounts actually outnumber credit and debit card accounts. There are about 1.3 billion active credit and debit accounts worldwide with more than 5 billion mobile phone accounts.This trend is particularly evident in developing nations in Asia (85 million mobile accounts) and Africa (58 million mobile accounts), where mobile phones have emerged as a means of extending financial services in lieu of an underdeveloped banking system. Most of these transactions involve SMS based payments, direct mobile billing using PIN and one time password (NYSE:OTP) authentication and mobile web payments.The global volume of money spent using mobile phones was around $106 billion in 2011, rising to $171 billion in the current year, and is expected to grow to about $617 billion by 2016.  About one third of these payments are through credit, debit or prepaid cards already owned by customers,  followed by payments directly from customers bank accounts.In the U.S., which accounts for about half of Visa’s revenue, smartphone adaption is low, only 2.7 million Americans used mobile payments at the point-of-sale in 2011 and the average spending per proximity mobile payment user was around $61. This figure is expected to grow. Berg Insight reports that the number of point of sales terminals will grow from 4 million at the end of 2011 to 43 million by 2017, with 86% of U.S. merchants accepting NFC based payments. Almost 50 million Americans are expected to use NFC technology by 2016 with an average spend of $1,300 per mobile payment user.I Can Understand The Growth In Developing Countries But Won’t Mobile Phones Just Be Replacing Cards In The U.S.?The growth of mobile phone payments will have a cannibalization effect on credit and debit card payment, but both Visa and MasterCard are gearing up for this paradigm shift. Along with the aforementioned partnerships with other wallet service providers, both card giants have launched their own mobile wallets: V.me and PayPass.In addition, studies by Deloitte have shown that smartphones might actually lead to an increase in spending. A recent survey by the company revealed smartphone users are 14% more likely to complete a purchase at the point of sale than non-smartphone users. Mobile phone transactions accounted for 5% of retail store sales in 2011, this percentage is expected to grow to 19% by 2016.Based on the growth in U.S. markets, influenced by an eventual economic recovery and increased penetration in developing markets, helped by improvements in mobile payments technology, we expect a steady growth in Visa’s payments volume over the coming years.Our price estimate of Visa’s stock is $151, in-line with the current market price.

1074481,39301,2012-12-20T03:01:52-05:00,,"IntroductionMasterCard (NYSE:MA) is a credit card services provider, it provides the second largest payment system in the world. MasterCard has been on a continuous up-trend but I feel that the upside is limited over the next year, however, MasterCard is a great growth investment. Over the long-term MasterCard will generate returns that exceed the S&P 500.Qualitative AnalysisMasterCard earns a small percentage on the transactional value of every debit or credit card transaction that takes places through its network. MasterCard avoids liability from loan losses, rather, it is the responsibility of the financial institutions who issue MasterCards that take on the risk of default from lending cash.MasterCard is an intermediary taking on very little risk. Businesses that are a part of the MasterCard network have to pay a small fee in order to be a part of the network. Every time a consumer spends money with a MasterCard, MasterCard receives a percentage of the transaction from the business. Businesses pay MasterCard directly. Businesses benefit through a reduction in fraud, and higher consumption. Thefts from employees who steal money from cash registers are averted through credit or debit card transactions. Online transactions are simplified and made possible because of debit and credit cards. Consumers also benefit from the convenience of being able to draw money directly from their bank accounts. MasterCard plays a useful role in the global market.MasterCard continues to expand internationally adding further to its revenue and net income growth. This growth is what is keeping investors on board.Technical AnalysisMasterCard has been on a continuous up-trend. The stock is likely to pull-back to the bottom of the channel and find support at $470.00 - $475.00 per share. The stock is expensive at these levels, but shorting it would be folly. Buying the stock on pull-backs seems to be the most practical investment strategy.Source: Chart from freestockchart.comMasterCard has been trading within the channel since June, and I don't anticipate this to change anytime soon. That being the case, slow and steady share appreciation seems to be the trend. The stock should not be bought at current levels, but going short is not likely to generate outstanding returns either. This implies that investors should be buying the stock on severe pull-backs. I will further clarify the investing strategy under the strategy section.Notable support is 477, 460, and 400 per share.Notable resistance is 495, 505, and 550 per share.Street AssessmentAnalysts on a consensus basis have strong expectations for the company going forward.Source: Table and data from Yahoo FinanceThe company shows reasonable growth as analysts on a consensus basis have a 5-year average growth rate forecast of 18.57% (based on the above table).Source: Table and data from Yahoo FinanceThe average surprise percentage is 2.4% above analyst forecast earnings over the past four quarters (based on the above table).Forecast and HistorySource: Table created by Alex Cho, data from shareholder annual report, and price history is from Yahoo Finance.The EPS figure shows negative net income for 2008, this was because the company was adversely affected by a one-time litigation settlement.Source: Table created by Alex Cho, data from shareholder annual reportWhen ignoring the one-time litigation settlement we can conclude that MasterCard is non-cyclical. The largest risk factor for MasterCard is the slowing of economic growth and competition from competitors like: Visa (NYSE:V), American Express (NYSE:AXP), PayPal (NASDAQ:EBAY), and Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS).Source: Forecast and table by Alex ChoBy 2017 I anticipate the company to generate $52.47 in earnings per share. This is because of earnings growth, an improving global outlook, and continued success of its product offerings. The forecast is proprietary, and below is a non-linear chart indicating the price of the stock over the next 5 years.Source: Forecast and chart by Alex ChoInvestment StrategyMA currently trades at 489.32. I have a price forecast of $424.24 for 2012, being that there are only 15 days before the end of 2012, the stock has already exceeded the price forecast by 65 dollars. This means we should move to the long run, and focus on 2013-2014. The price history indicates that MasterCard will gradually appreciate throughout the year. Its recent streak of surprising to the upside has slowed which implies limited upside surprises over the short-term; therefore, it seems more prudent to have a buy and hold mentality. This does not mean I recommend buying the stock today, but to wait before buying the stock.Short TermOver the next twelve months, the stock is likely to appreciate from $489.32 to $504.93 per share. This implies 3.1% upside from current levels. The technical analysis indicates a strong up-trend in the stock. However, just because the stock is in an up-trend does not mean investors should just buy the stock. Rather, investors should wait for a severe correction in price before buying the stock. For investors who require diversification, and are absolutely determined to buy MA, I recommend that investors be patient and buy the stock on pull-backs especially since the company has already priced in 2013 valuations. This means limited upside for investors over the short-term, but the long-term investment thesis remains strong in MasterCard.Investors should buy MasterCard at $460 (when it declines) and sell at $505 to pocket short-term gains of 9.7%. The return on investment is unlikely to beat the Standard and Poor 500 in 2013, and this implies that investors are likely to find more compelling opportunities over the short-term in other equities. However, the bullish case remains strong over the long-term.Long TermThe company is an exceptional investment. I anticipate MA to deliver upon the price and earnings forecast despite the risk factors. MA's primary upside catalyst is international growth, and margin improvement. I anticipate the company to deliver upon my forecasted price target of $1,013.24 by 2017. This implies a return of 107% by 2017. This rate of return is exceptional, considering MasterCard has a market capitalization of $60.8 billion. The large market capitalization allows for larger institutions to sell the stock without affecting liquidity, making it an investment of choice.ConclusionMasterCard is a great investment opportunity over the long-term. The stock is trading at valuations that far exceed the forecast for 2012, and is unlikely to trade at valuations higher than the 2013 forecast. This implies investors should look for longer-term appreciation rather than the typical buy and dump strategy short-term traders have. The conclusion though remains simple: buy MasterCard, but have a long-term investment horizon.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1017131,33161,2012-11-19T06:18:16-05:00,,"For the past several years, MasterCard (NYSE:MA) has delivered astonishing performance. Since 2006, the stock has increased over 600% in a move which has added over $40 billion to the value of the firm. In line with 6 years of strong performance, shares have increased an additional 30% this year. With such large increases in share price over the years, investors must be asking: what is the fair value of this company. Through this article, I will present my belief as to the future growth rate and fair value of MasterCard.The Question of GrowthThe underlying belief of nearly all investment disciplines is that a firm is expected to grow in the future. Investors do not park capital with an organization that is expected to decline or not exceed the average market rate of return in the long run. MasterCard is no different in that we should not consider investing in the organization if we do not believe that the firm will continue its upward growth. In order to extrapolate a fair growth rate, I have relied heavily on return on assets. Return on assets is a metric which informs the analyst as to how efficient an organization is at utilizing assets to generate profits. Return on assets is calculated by taking the net income of the firm divided by average total assets. In the chart below, I have shown the past 3 years of return on assets and total assets for MasterCard. images It can be seen that for the past 4 years, MasterCard has consistently increased its asset base. On average, MasterCard has increased its assets by around 50% every year. What is remarkable is that over the past 3 years, MasterCard has been able to continuously deliver around a 20% return on assets every year. This tangibly means that as MasterCard adds assets to its balance sheet, it retains the ability to continue generating proportional profits. Currently, MasterCard is able to bring in $20 in profit for every $100 of assets. These results are strong, but unfortunately this growth rate cannot be continued. If MasterCard were to continue this growth for the next 10 years, it would be one of the largest companies in the world. If these growth rates were to continue for 20 years, it would eclipse the entire United States economy. As MasterCard continues to reap these strong returns, competitors such as American Express (NYSE:AXP), Discovery Financial Services (NYSE:DFS), and Visa (NYSE:V) will be driven to deploy assets to capture this growth. This attrition of growth can be witnessed by the fact that return on assets has declined for the past year. I believe that we are in a process of attrition which will continue until MasterCard reaches a more stable growth rate.I believe that the current firm growth rate is unstable and will revert to a much smaller figure. MasterCard is currently growing its assets at around 50% per year and while is free cash flows are volatile; they also are growing at around 50% per year. This simply is unstable. I believe that as competitors witness MasterCard's profitability they will attempt to encroach into its profitable territory. This competition will ultimately drive MasterCard to an average growth rate. In the chart below, I have calculated the firm-level growth rates of each of MasterCard's primary competitors.It can be seen that on average, MasterCard's peers grow at around 12% per year. It is my belief that this will ultimately be the fair growth rate of MasterCard and I view the recent downtick in return on assets as a signal that MasterCard is in the process of reversion to the mean.The Fair Value of MasterCardI believe that MasterCard is entering a stable growth stage. Competitors are eating away at its market share and returns have been increasing at a slowing rate. In order to fairly value MasterCard, I have created the model below.The model above shows the fair value of MasterCard in light of all relevant fundamental factors. The model essentially examines the earnings, capital structure, cost of capital, and growth assumptions to arrive at a fair value per share. In light of this valuation method, I believe that the fair value of MasterCard is $499.71 per share. This fair value represents an 8% increase above the current stock price. Let's walk through the assumptions.Operating FactorsThe current earnings before interest and taxes is around $2.7 billion and MasterCard is paying around 31% of earnings in taxes. Earnings before interest and taxes, when adjusted for operating factors, can tell the analyst how much cash flow is available to the firm in a given year. In the long run, the value of the firm will be equal to the growth in its free cash flow since this represents the lifeblood of the organization.Direct Asset ExpendituresThe figures in the direct asset expenditures section show the current asset structure of the organization and the willingness of the firm to invest the resources needed to maintain its edge. Currently, MasterCard is investing 7% more than it loses to depreciation back into its assets in a given business year. This tangibly means that MasterCard is demonstrating the willingness to maintain its competitive edge by reinvesting into items which are expected to provide future economic benefit.Cost of CapitalThe cost of capital section of the model shows how much it costs MasterCard to raise and maintain debt and equity financing. MasterCard currently possesses no debt and it currently pays a small dividend of 0.30%. It is important to note that MasterCard has doubled its dividend in the last year. Additionally, as companies enter a mature and stable stage of business, they tend to pay a higher dividend in order to attract investors and maximize shareholder wealth. For this reason, I believe that a fair cost of equity is more than 0.30%. To arrive at a fair cost of equity, I used the firm-specific risk of the security and examined its historic performance in relation to the risk-free rate. The stock has been in a strong growth phase in the immediate past and I do not believe that this growth phase will continue. I believe that the most appropriate cost of equity is around 15%. This figure represents the return on top of the risk-free Treasury rate that I believe investors expect to earn in order to invest in MasterCard rather than a market index or fixed income alternative. The long-run market return is around 11% and I believe that MasterCard will need to deliver 4% above this return in its stable growth stage to continue to attract investments.Growth AssumptionsIt is my belief that the firm will continue growing its assets and cash flows at around 12% per year. This is much lower than the current 50% per year, but as previously discussed, I believe that MasterCard will revert to the industry average. The current growth rates are unstable and as the industry continues its competitive drive to capture profits, I believe that MasterCard will deliver an average growth of 12% per year.The RecommendationI believe that MasterCard is worth around $500 per share. I root this estimate in my fundamental assumption that MasterCard's extreme growth cannot continue and we are entering a time period of stable growth. With my price target of MasterCard only 8% above current market prices, I believe that investors should cautiously prepare to sell the security. Price has increased over 30% this year and I believe we are nearing fair value.Technically SpeakingEven though I believe that MasterCard is quickly approaching fair value, I do not advocate an immediate, or even a targeted sale of the security. Prices can remain irrational for long periods of time and profit-seeking investors would be wise to follow the long-term trends of the security. MasterCard has been in a strong uptrend for several years and I believe that there is potential for the trend to continue beyond $500 per share. For this reason, I suggest that investors consider following the trend until it has ended. This tangibly means that investors should not sell until price has broken below the ascending trend-line. It can be seen in the chart below that price has clearly defined the rising blue line as an area in which buyers will more than likely purchase shares. If price is able to close below this rising trend-line, then I believe the trend will have technically ended and investors should consider selling their shares. This means that for now, the current stop on long trades should be at $440 per share. For new investors seeking to enter MasterCard, my advice is to stay away from this security. The fair value of MasterCard, in my opinion, is only 8% above current market prices, leaving very little room for new profits.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The global payment and technology company connecting consumers, merchants and financial institutions announced a solid set of third quarter results.Third Quarter ResultsMasterCard reported third quarter revenues of $1.92 billion, up 5.5% on the year. In constant currencies, revenues rose some 10%. Growth was driven by 14% increase in gross dollar volume to $918 billion, in local currencies. The number of transactions rose 24% to 8.7 billion. Revenues fell slightly short of analysts expectations of $1.94 billion.The company reported a net income of $772 million, up 8% on the year before. Earnings per share rose 10% to $6.17 per diluted share and beat analysts consensus of $5.92 per share. In constant currencies, earnings per share rose some 15%.During the quarter, MasterCard repurchased roughly 0.5 million shares for a consideration of $216 million. The company has $1.1 billion remaining under its $1.5 billion repurchase program.Segmental InformationMasterCard reported a 14% growth in gross dollar transaction volumes to $918 billion.International transaction volumes rose 16.8% to $628 billion. Strong international growth was driven by solid performance in Asia-Pacific, Middle-East and Africa. Revenues in this geographic area rose 21.2% in local currencies to $251 billion.Volumes in Europe grew 14.5% in local currencies. Softness in Southern European countries was offset by strength in North and Eastern Europe. Latin American gross dollar volumes were up 16.4% to $74 billion as government stimulus programs in Brazil boosted the number of transactions in the country.Gross dollar volumes in the US rose 7.0% to $290 billion. US consumers are holding tight on their budgets, despite a modest increase in consumer confidence. Furthermore, MasterCard gained market share in the debit market from Visa, among others.ValuationMasterCard ended its third quarter with $5.6 billion in cash, equivalents and investment securities. The company operates without the assumption of debt, for a comfortable net cash position.For the first nine months of 2012, MasterCard generated revenues of $5.50 billion. The company net earned $2.15 billion, or $17.07 per diluted share. The company is on track to generate revenues of $7.5 billion, on which the company could earn $3 billion, almost $24 per share.The market currently values MasterCard at roughly $57.5 billion. This values the operating assets of the firm at roughly $52 billion. The valuation comes down to 6.9 times annual revenues and 17-18 times annual earnings.MasterCard pays a very modest dividend of $0.30 per quarter, for an annual dividend yield of 0.3%.Investment ThesisYear to date, shares of MasterCard have risen roughly 24%. Shares steadily rose from levels of $340 in January and rallied to $450 in April. Shares temporarily fell back to $400 in May and peaked at $485 a little earlier this month. Shares are currently exchanging hands at $460 per share.Over the past five years, shares have almost tripled. Shares traded as low as $125 the beginning of 2009 and gradually moved higher. Between 2008 and 2012, MasterCard boosted its revenues from $5.0 billion to an estimated $7.5 billion this year. The company reported a $253 million loss in 2008. For the full year of 2012, record profits around $3 billion are to be expected.Shares of MasterCard are currently valued at 17-18 times annual earnings. The valuation of the global payment company is fair given its history of strong earnings growth. The valuation seems cheap in comparison with Visa (V) which as a much higher valuation in terms of revenue and earnings. On top of that, MasterCard has a greater emerging market exposure, boosting the firm's growth profile.In August of this year, I already looked at the prospects for MasterCard's shares. From that point in time, shares have almost risen 10%. The company remains on track to innovate, and aggressively develop mobile payment solutions. This is very important as mobile systems are crucial in growth areas like Africa, which lack developed banking systems.Shares rose after the Federal Reserve Board announced its QE3 program and the major payment companies have resolved their litigation issues with US merchants. MasterCard previously announced that the settlements would cost $790 million, compared to $4.4 billion for Visa.Shareholders remain content with MasterCard on Wednesday. The company has numerous joint ventures with banks, financial institutions, technology and telecommunication companies to remain on the frontier of the global payment industry. The company realizes that payment methods might change rapidly in the medium term future, and MasterCard wants to make sure it remains a leading firm. The strong balance sheet allows MasterCard to make acquisitions when necessary, to stay upfront. Additionally, the company could potentially increase dividend payments or speed up share repurchases.I reiterate my investment thesis, which I wrote up in August. Investors might add MasterCard as an investment, or set up a pair trade by initiating a short position in Visa.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1167211,24491,2013-02-08T02:19:28-05:00,,"Late last week, payment processor MasterCard (NYSE:MA) announced terrific fourth quarter results. Revenue jumped 10% year-over-year to $1.9 billion, in line with expectations. Earnings, however, exceeded consensus estimates, growing 21% year-over-year to $4.86 per share.Much like Best Ideas Newsletter portfolio holding Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard continues to ride secular tailwinds as the world moves to a cashless society. Though the US is MasterCard's largest market, its credit card market share substantially lags that of Visa. Still, the company has tremendous global exposure. With credit and debit payments nearing maturity in the US, other markets (shown below) are driving the growth at MasterCard (Image Source: MasterCard Earnings Presentation).Although the company's exposure to Europe may be worrisome to a degree (given economic concerns), we actually like the firm's presence in the region because payment processing remains a long-term secular growth business (as opposed to cyclical). The benefits of credit and debit payments compared to cash are so strong that we don't see fluctuations in the economic cycle stopping this trend (for the foreseeable future).During the quarter, MasterCard did a fantastic job controlling expenses, as the company's operating margin increased 340 basis points year-over-year to 47.4%. Though this metric is still far behind Visa's measure, we think MasterCard's operating margin has further room to expand, especially if global economic growth rebounds. Going forward, the firm didn't provide much in terms of specific guidance, but it had this to say about expectations for future revenue and earnings expansion, which we think is achievable:""So looking forward, let me just start first with our long-term performance objectives. We remain confident that our business can deliver in a 11% to 14% net revenue CAGR and at least 20% EPS CAGR over the 2013 to 2015 period. These growth rates are on a constant currency basis and exclude any new acquisitions.""We continue to love the structural characteristics of the payment processing industry, but we think shares of MasterCard are fairly valued at this time. In the group, we prefer Visa (due to its stronger brand name and superior operating margin) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), which owns PayPal's dominant online payment franchise.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1046761,23407,2012-12-05T12:19:39-05:00,,"Picking retail winners and losers has always been a challenge. Fickle trends create inventory risks and the battle over wallets pinches margins.Instead of guessing whether American Eagle (NYSE:AEO) will trump Abercrombie (NYSE:ANF) or if Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) will beat out Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), investors may want to focus instead on MasterCard (NYSE:MA).Shopping continues to move online.Consumers appetite for convenience has pushed revenue away from traditional retail stores to online sites. The e-commerce revolution is shown clearly on the following chart.Despite a hiccup during the recession, e-commerce sales have grown significantly over the past decade, reaching $56.9 billion in Q3, up 17% from $48.6 billion in Q3 2011. Since Q1, 2009 e-commerce sales have climbed a remarkable 66%.Overall, retail sales have moved higher too. But at a much slower pace. In October, real retail and food services sales, excluding autos, totaled $336.8 billion, up 3.5% from $325.16 billion a year ago. Since spring 2009, they've climbed a solid 21%, well below the growth rate for online.While overall retail sales are hitting new highs, revenue formerly destined to box stores has increasingly migrated to various e-commerce sites.While some of these sites are still operated by big retailers, the shift has made it even more difficult to pick individual retail winners and losers.And, the prevalence of mobile devices isn't likely to derail the rapid growth in clicks instead of bricks anytime soon. As a result, we're likely to continue to see double digit e-commerce sales at the expense of traditional retailers.MasterCard is brick and click agnostic.Whether they're capturing fees from a shirt sold at Macy's (NYSE:M) or a handbag sold online at Michael Kors (KORS), it doesn't matter much to MasterCard. Either way, as long as the customer purchases using their MasterCard branded card, the company makes money.And we're not talking about penny candy.In Q3, revenue increased to $1.9 billion, up 5%, while operating margins expanded to 55.5% from 55.1%, year-over-year.The gross dollar volume (""GDV"") handled in the quarter increased in every region of the world, partially driven by a 13% increase in debit cards. GDV in the U.S., where MasterCard generates 40% of its sales, rose 7% in the quarter from last year.The number of transactions processed increased too. Globally, transactions were up 24%, helping transaction fees increase 10% as cards increased 8%.More cards, more transactions totaling more money mean bigger sales and profits for MasterCard. Q3 revenue rose 10% and GDV was up 16% through the first 9 months of the year. Transactions were up 27% year-to-date, outpacing the 17% growth in the comparable 2011 versus 2010 period. And, year-to-date operating margins expanded to 55.3% from 54.6% in 2011.As volume and value have grown, MasterCard has also firmed up pricing, which added 3% to net revenue this year.Healthier balance sheets will drive growth.In the U.S., the percentage of domestic respondents tightening consumer credit card standards in October was -11.1%, down from -7.9% in Q4'11 and a peak of 66% in Q3 2008. Banks continue to ease their standards for credit cards, bullish for issuance and usage trends.Meanwhile, the delinquency rate on credit cards fell to 2.83% in Q3, down from 3.47% in Q3 '11 and a peak of 6.76% in April 2009. Fewer people are looking like they'll default on their credit card debts, which means more cards in more hands this holiday season.That's good news for the company. According to the National Retail Federation, a record 247 million shoppers were out over the Thanksgiving shopping period. The record number spent $423 on average, up from $398 last year. This worked out to $59.1 billion in spending, up 12.8% from a year ago.Those numbers are likely to help MasterCard continue to post strong results. The company has beaten estimates in each of the past 4 quarters and analysts expect EPS to climb 16% to $25.50 in 2013, following a 17% increase in 2012 from 2011. As you can see from the accompanying chart, this is better than both the average large-cap stock and the average financials sector stock.Source:E.B. Capital Markets, LLCThe company's success has generated $2.88 billion in leveraged free cash over the past 12 months, which has brought cash and equivalents to $5.68 billion, or $45.67 per share. The fact the company is debt free doesn't hurt the chances investors will see some of that money put to work in the form of shareholder friendly dividends and buybacks.While shareholders have pushed share prices to $480 from a low of $390 this past May, shares are still reasonably priced compared to peers. Shares forward price to earnings ratio, divided by its 5 year PE low, is still lower than the large cap universe and large cap financials sector averages. This may suggest investors aren't adequately valuing the company's forward earnings.While back of napkin forecasts are fraught with risk and error, a simple extrapolation of the share's current PE to 2013 estimates gives a target price of $586, up 22% from here.Historically, Q4 has been a good time to own shares.Over the past 6 years, MasterCard has finished the quarter higher than it starts 5 times, producing an average 18.48% return.Source: The Seasonal InvestorAnd, in the three months starting December 1st and finishing February 28th, shares have gained in 4 of the past 6 years, increasing a respectable 2.67% on average.Given the strong holiday results, improving card issuance and declining default rates, MasterCard appears positioned to benefit nicely, regardless of whether shoppers stay at home or visit the mall. If so, picking up shares may end up being the best play on retail sales this season.Disclosure: I am long KORS. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

986751,23479,2012-11-07T12:36:42-05:00,,"Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) reported earnings for the September quarter on Wednesday, Oct. 31.  The growing popularity and adoption of cashless transactions in the  U.S. and internationally led to double-digit year-over-year revenue  growth for both card giants. Visa reported a 15% increase in revenues  over the prior year, whereas MasterCard achieved a 10% currency adjusted  revenue growth. Following the results posted by the two companies, we  have revised our models.Our price estimate of $538 for MasterCard’s stock  implies a premium of 20% to the current market price, driven primarily  by high short-term growth in processed transactions, whereas our $151 price estimate for Visa  is about 5% ahead of the current market price. Visa’s processed  transactions continue to grow at a high single-digit rate that has been  observed historically, and we believe that the markets have accounted  for this growth quite accurately.Visa’s Debit Share in the U.S. Slipping Following Dodd-FrankDebit cards are the most commonly used cashless payment system in the  U.S., accounting for more than two-thirds of all cashless transactions  in the country. The company has been losing share in the debit card market since the  Durbin amendment to the Dodd-Frank bill came into effect. The bill  requires banks with more than $10 billion in assets to use separate  payment processing networks for signature authorized and PIN authorized  debit card transactions.Visa, which dominated the market with over two-thirds of all cashless   transactions last year, has been adversely affected by this ruling as  it siphons away market share to its competitors. Debit transactions  processed by Visa’s network fell by 6% during the last quarter. In  contrast, MasterCard reported a 14% increase in debit gross dollar  volumes, which fueled a 24% increase in processed transactions.  Management attributed the majority of this growth to increased PIN debit  transactions. We expect the effects of the Durbin amendment to lead to a  short-term spike in the number of MasterCard’s transactions processed.We have changed our forecast for the number of transactions processed by  MasterCard, with short-term growth in the low teens through the next two  years. Long-term growth will be driven by improving global economic  conditions and the company’s expansion in emerging markets; we expect  MasterCard to maintain the high single-digit growth rate that has been  observed historically. Growth in transactions will not only drive  transaction fee revenue, but will also have a positive impact on  revenues earned through assessment fees that are calculated as a  percentage of gross dollar volume of transactions. We do not expect  operating margins to be influenced by the expansion, as most of the  company’s expenditure is on client rebates.Despite the fall in debit numbers, Visa still maintains a healthy  share of more than 50% in the cashless transactions market, which  includes credit, debit, and pre-paid cards. The effect of the debit  decline was mitigated by a 9% increase in credit card payment volume,  leading to a 14% year-over-year increase in data processing revenues.  The effect of the Durbin amendment will likely wear off in coming years  as the market adapts to the new policy; already the decline in debit  transaction volumes is less than the 9% observed in the June quarter.We expect Visa’s established network of issuing banks, which includes  over 15,000 financial institutions, and its reputation worldwide to  drive steady growth in processed transactions in the next few years. Our  forecast for the number of transactions processed by Visa has been  adjusted to reflect the high growth rate (approaching 10%) that Visa has  been able to maintain through the last few years and in 2012.Growth Outside the U.S.Visa has reiterated its goal of generating 50% of its revenue from  outside the U.S. To this end, it achieved growth of 12% in payment  volume outside the U.S. in the quarter. Cross-border volume grew by 10%,  which is a little less than the 14% growth rate reported in the second  quarter. The decline in growth rate was due to a slowdown in Southeast  Asia and Latin America.  International transaction revenues, which are  greatly influenced by currency exchange rates, increased by 5% to $796  million. We expect Visa to maintain a healthy growth rate in  international transactions and have adjusted our forecast to account for  this.MasterCard is also focused on achieving international growth. The  company reported a worldwide increase of 14% in gross dollar volume. Outside the U.S., the growth rate was 17%, with more than 20%  growth in Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and Africa. Cross-border  volume increased by 14%.MasterCard recently launched a U.S. dollar-denominated MasterCard card in China, in partnership with Citibank (NYSE:C). We believe that growing economies in Asia like India and  China will drive growth in MasterCard’s international transaction GDV,  leading to a subsequent increase in international transaction revenues.  For more details, see our article ""MasterCard Is Ready To Break New Barriers In China, But How Successful Will It Be?""Disclosure: No positions."

On Wednesday, the company published its second quarter results.Second Quarter ResultsMasterCard reported a 15% increase in net income to $700 million, or $5.55 per diluted share. The results include a $13 million after-tax charge related to the U.S. merchant litigation. Excluding the impact of the charge, earnings came in at $5.65 per share, beating analysts consensus of $5.58 per share. Recently, payment companies settled with U.S. merchants for $6.6 billion. MasterCard's share in the settlement was $790 million, however the company already took a $770 million charge in the fourth quarter.Net revenues increased 9% to $1.82 billion, or 13% on a constant currency basis. A stronger U.S. dollar was impacting nominal U.S. dollar revenue growth for MasterCard, as the company has significant international operations. On average, analysts have been looking for the company to report revenues of $1.88 billion.CEO Ajay Banga commented on the results, ""though economic uncertainties continued to persist, we experienced solid volume and processed transaction growth in all regions as we are focused on driving our global business to expand the reach of electronic payments.""Segmental InformationMasterCard reported a 15% increase in processed gross dollar volume to $890 billion, on a local currency basis. The number of processed transactions increased 29% to $8.5 billion. Cross-border volumes, which are very lucrative, increased 17%. At the end of the quarter, the company had 1.8 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards outstanding.The United States remains the most important continent, reporting 8.7% growth to $291 billion in transaction volume. Europe reported 16.4% growth in transaction volumes in local currencies. In dollar terms, growth was a mere 5.1% to $263 billion. Asia-Pacific, Middle-East and Africa, reported 22.8% growth in transaction volume in local currencies. In dollar terms, transaction volumes rose 19.2% to $233 billion.OutlookFor the remainder of 2012, MasterCard expects revenue growth to come in lower than the 13% growth rate in the second quarter. The company expects to make fewer deals, it has tougher comparables, and global economic uncertainty could temper both consumer and business spending trends.Furthermore, lower levels of the euro and the Brazilian real continued to generate currency headwinds in mostly the third quarter, and to a lesser extent in the final quarter of the year. The company did not specify a full year earnings per share target, but reiterated its target of achieving 20% compounded annual growth rate in earnings per share for 2012 and 2013. In 2011, the company reported full year normalized earnings per share of $19.07ValuationMasterCard ended its second quarter with almost $5.0 billion in cash, equivalents and investment securities available for sale. It operates without the assumption of debt for a net cash position of $5 billion. For the first six months of 2012, the company reported revenues of $3.6 billion on which it reported a net profit of $1.38 billion, or $10.91 per diluted share. At this rate, the company is on track to report annual revenues of $7.5 billion and earnings in the $22-$24 per share range.Based on MasterCard's closing price of $424.13 on Friday, the market values the firm at $53 billion, or $48 billion for its operating assets, if we exclude the net cash position. This values the payment firm at 6.5 times annual expected revenues and roughly 18 times annual expected earnings. This valuation compares to an annual revenue multiple of 11 times for competitor Visa (V), which trades on 36 times annual 2011s earnings.Currently, MasterCard pays a quarterly dividend of $0.30 for a mere annual dividend yield of 0.3%.Investment ThesisYear do date, shares returned 14% to levels around $424 at the moment. Shares peaked around the $460 mark by the end of April this year, but have corrected in line with the wider markets. Shares have roughly ten-folded since 2006 when shares traded around the $45 mark.Investors are enthusiastic about the continued adoption of the company's cards and the strong exposure to emerging markets. MasterCard proportionally derives much more of its revenues from outside the US, compared to Visa.Furthermore, MasterCard has rapidly been setting up joint ventures and partnership with telecommunication companies, to provide mobile payment solutions. In February it started Wanda, a joint venture with Telefonica SA (NYSE:TEF), to provide mobile payments solutions to over 87 million Movistar customers. In July, it signed a partnership with Deutsche Telekom AG (OTCQX:DTEGF), to do the same for 93 million mobile customers in Europe.While shares trade at roughly 18 times annual earnings, MasterCard does look attractive, especially in comparison with Visa which has a much higher valuation. MasterCard has more emerging market exposure which creates a short term headache with the recent dollar strength. However long term growth prospects remain rosy, especially as the company is aggressively working towards mobile payment solutions. With many potential customers in emerging markets not having bank accounts, but do having cell phones, it could be a real winner in the long term. Furthermore the overhang with of the U.S. merchant litigation has been resolved with the settlement last month.Investors might add MasterCard to their long term portfolio, or set up a pair trade by shorting Visa.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
885391,29461,2012-09-24T14:54:30-04:00,,"MasterCard (NYSE:MA) is one of our most favored stocks, and we recommend investors who are willing to play the secular shift in the Global Payments Industry to go long the stock. The company has recently been upgraded by Citigroup (NYSE:C) on its long term growth potential. The management, in its guidance for the second half of the current year, also presented impressive growth figures for the long-term, once the economy stabilizes. Also, the company has strong financial strength and attractive valuations.Rating UpgradeAs noted in an earlier report, the Global Payments Industry has witnessed tremendous changes in the past decade or so. From a cash and check-based payment system, consumers moved to a more convenient magnetic strip card-based payment system. We believe that in the coming years, these magnetic strip-based payments will erode, causing payments through mobile and contactless payments to dominate. We believe that MasterCard, considered to be the world's second largest card network company with a market share of 33.3%, is set to ride the secular shift in the Global Payments Industry. Supporting our belief, Citigroup upgraded its ratings for the company. The news of an upgrade also boosted the company's share price by 1.3%. Citigroup upgraded the ratings from Neutral to Buy, giving a price target of $525. This is against the consensus price target of $491.52.Citigroup believes the company has tremendous potential for long term bottom line growth of 20%. The bank further believes that the company will benefit from a supportive regulatory environment and rising equity markets. Despite the headwinds from Europe, MasterCard's international business is expected to remain on track.2H2012 GuidanceThe management at MasterCard released its guidance for the second half of the current year. Amidst the general global macroeconomic headwinds and the volatility in credit quality, management puts its top line growth under 13%. Alongside the growth in the top line, management also expects an increasing trend in operating costs. In the long-term, when the economy has stabilized, the management expects a bottom line growth of at least 20%.Financial StrengthThe company's financial strength can be seen in its strong operating cash flow generation, despite the economic turmoil. The company has an operating cash flow yield of 5%, which is the same as that of Visa (NYSE:V). Visa is considered to be the market leader in card network companies.Source: Fool.comThe graph above demonstrates the upward trend in the historical and expected turnover, operating profits, earnings, net margin and operating margin.OutlookIn order to ride the secular shift in the Payments Industry, the management at MasterCard has shown a continuous resolve to innovate its payments systems. In line with this resolve, the company recently announced its PayPass Walled Services. This new digital wallet platform, which supports Near Field Technology (NFC), has already attracted collaboration intentions from as much as 18 banks and other financial institutions. This new platform will enable the company to process billions of transactions in the coming future.ValuationsThe company's stock is attractively valued when compared to its peers in the Global Payments Industry. Visa, which is considered to have the largest card network, trades at a forward P/E multiple of 19 times, while MA trades at P/E of 18 times. Analysts have a consensus mean price target of $491.52 for MA, while the bullish price target is $566. At the current price of $459.52, the consensus mean price target provides an upside of 7%.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Qineqt's Financials Analyst.

In addition, American Express (NYSE:AXP) reported higher than expected EPS on July 18, although the company's revenue came in lower than expected. American Express said that its card members' spending ""remained healthy,"" although it decelerated year-over-year. Furthermore, on July 16, Deutsche Bank recommended aggressively buying shares of Mastercard and Visa after the companies announced a legal settlement with some U.S. merchants. The firm thinks that the deal removes a big risk for the card networks. However, the agreement does allow merchants to begin offering discounts to customers who pay with cash or checks, potentially increasing uncertainty for Visa and Mastercard. Also, in a note to investors on July 24, UBS contended that the risk/reward ratio for MasterCard is still unfavorable. The firm predicted that the company would be hurt by the slowdown in global growth ,and that its Q2 results would reflect this headwind. Moreover, Oppenheimer on July 19 wrote that MasterCard's Q2 trends ""held up relatively well,"" but it added that the company's foreign exchange exposure is a ""meaningful"" top-line headwind for the company.

As a result, the company will incur an additional $20 million pre-tax charge in its second quarter 2012 financial statements.MasterCard's closest rival Visa (V) reported on July 25 that 2Q earnings came in at $1.56 on an adjusted basis, ABOVE the Street estimate of $1.45, citing solid global growth in payments volume and transactions outside the U.S.Recent NewsTechnical ReviewMasterCard shares are up more than 8% from the July 24 low near $400, an impressive gap upward headed into the 2Q earnings release. Despite the recent surge, however, the shares stalled out right at resistance near $445/$450, implying a strong earnings release may be priced in at these levels. Should earnings blow past consensus estimates, resistance will be at the all-time closing high of $457.58 (May 1 - intraday). Support is at the 50-Day SMA near $420, with downside risk to $410 and the recent low near $400. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com)SummaryMasterCard shares have been surging over the past several sessions amid speculation that the Federal Reserve and governing bodies in Europe and China are prepared to undertake efforts to support economic growth. The shares are also rallying after reaching a settlement in a series of lawsuits as part of a broader U.S. merchant class litigation. The market views the decision as positive for Visa and MasterCard - enabling the two to maintain their dominant market position. Given the relatively high expectations, MasterCard needs to deliver earnings toward the high end of Street estimates (range is $5.36 to $5.82) for the shares to make a push back toward the all-time highs established in late April. Other risks include further litigation and antitrust complaints, along with any shock to the global economy, including potential inaction from the world's central banks to support global growth.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Disclaimer: By using this report, you acknowledge that  Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of  commentary, analysis, and or data in this report.

721291,28981,2012-07-15T06:47:25-04:00,,"MasterCard (MA) is a US listed business services and payment processing company. MasterCard is a constituent of the S&P 500 and has a market capitalization of $54 billion.MasterCard had an impressive performance over the last 52 weeks: The stock is up 41%. YTD the shares gained over 15% already. MasterCard currently quotes about 8% below its 52 week high of $467 and investors are wondering whether it makes sense to buy the stock close to its 52 week high. Since I am normally attracted to 52 week lows, justifying an investment in MA might put some contrarians at unease. However, MasterCard and Visa (which I have also rated a Buy) have extraordinary key performance indicators and are given room to grow their valuations due to the $7.25 billion settlement with merchants over transaction fees. This agreement will have an uncertain margin and earnings impact, however, given the past earnings track record, I am treating the settlement as a one-off, non-recurring event, that is not affecting my core earnings estimates.I estimate the company to earn about $26.80 per share in 2013 which is above analyst average 2013 EPS estimates of $26.07. As I have argued in my article about Visa (V), transaction processing companies operate in an oligopolistic arena and, hence, have high profitability measures. High capital expenditures are required to step foot into this industry, which act as an entry barrier allowing the existing companies to maximize their surplus. MasterCard's profitability is very attractive: The operating margin stands at 41%, the profit margin at 29% and the return on equity at 35%. Assigning a multiple of 20x forward earnings the fair value of MasterCard would be $536, which gives the stock 25% upside potential.The technical chart pattern is less conclusive. The chart allows both for a short-term upward and downward sloping trend canal. If MA's share price can extend over $440, the short-term down-trending canal will be dominated by the short-term up-trending canal. In that case, the stock has an immediate potential to reach up to $485. Traders who engage based on charts, will probably find other investments more promising.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
772761,24491,2012-08-02T02:16:17-04:00,,"As part of our process, we perform a rigorous discounted cash-flow methodology that dives into the true intrinsic worth of companies. In Mastercard's (MA) case, we think the firm is fairly valued at $429, about in line to where it is currently trading.For some background, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index (click here for an in-depth presentation about our methodology), which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. Essentially, we're looking for firms that overlap investment methodologies, thereby revealing the greatest interest by investors (we like firms that fall in the center of the diagram below):If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Mastercard posts a VBI score of 6 on our scale, reflecting our 'fairly valued' DCF assessment of the firm, its unattractive relative valuation versus peers, and bullish technicals. We compare Mastercard to peers Bottimline Tech (EPAY), Fiserv (FISV), Western Union (WU), and Visa (V). In the spirit of transparency, we show how the performance of our VBI has stacked up per underlying score:Our Report on MastercardInvestment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• Mastercard earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 85.5% during the past three years.• Mastercard has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 38.5% in coming years, and the firm had no debt as of last quarter.• The firm's share price performance has been roughly in line with that of the market during the past quarter. We'd expect the firm's stock price to converge to our fair value estimate within the next three years, if our forecasts prove accurate.• The firm experienced a revenue CAGR of about 10.4% during the past 3 years. We expect its revenue growth to be better than its peer median during the next five years.Business QualityMost Recent Quarterly ResultsPayment processor Mastercard reported a strong second quarter Wednesday. The firm earned $5.65 per share, up nearly 17% from the same period a year ago (and $0.07 higher than the Street expected). Revenue grew just 9% to $1.8 billion, though that was negatively impacted by currency, causing the number to fall about $90 million short of consensus expectations. Operating margins grew 130 basis points to 54.6%, but that figure still lags Visa's.Payment growth volume roughly tracked revenue growth, with total payment dollars increasing 9.4% year-over-year, to $890 billion. Even more telling, payment transactions increased 29% to 8.5 billion, as users are becoming more and more comfortable with paying for everything with plastic. The movement towards a ""cash-less"" society continues, and innovations such as Square will only increase point-of-sale acceptance. As a result of the class action merchant lawsuit against the payment network duopoly, Mastercard had to take a $13 million after-tax charge in the second quarter.Much like competitor Visa, we love Mastercard's cash rich business model and powerful network effect. The firm has generated over $1 billion in operating cash flow year-to-date. Thus, it was no surprise that the firm was able to repurchase $671 million in stock during the second quarter, and still has $1.4 billion available to repurchase shares under its current authorization.However, we prefer Visa to Mastercard, though investors often see the two as interchangeable. Visa has a more powerful brand name, in our view, better operating margins and a favorable valuation. Of course, if Mastercard were able to bring its operating margins to parity with Visa's, the firm would experience some tremendous earnings expansion. Regardless, Mastercard registers only a 6 on our VBI (our stock-selection methodology), so we'd have to see a significant pull-back in the shares before getting excited about its return profile.Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Mastercard 's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 85.5%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.8%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart to the right, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Mastercard 's free cash flow margin has averaged about 29.8% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at www.valuentum.com. At Mastercard , cash flow from operations increased about 95% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 27% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Mastercard 's shares are worth between $322.00 - $536.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $429 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 28.8 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 17 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 10.6% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 10.4%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 55%, which is above Mastercard 's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 4.1% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Mastercard , we use a 10.8% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $429 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). Afterall, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for Mastercard . We think the firm is attractive below $322 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $536 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Mastercard 's fair value at this point in time to be about $429 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart to the right compares the firm's current share price with the path of Mastercard 's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $579 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $429 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Additional disclosure: Some of the firms mentioned in this article may be included in our actively-managed portfolios."
711171,30731,2012-07-10T08:03:45-04:00,,"MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), a longstanding institution of the global electronic payments era, continues to revolutionize relationships between consumers, merchants, and financial institutions. Shares opened just below $380 levels in January of this year and closed last week just above $440. Here's why I like MasterCard as an equity investment.With 6,700 employees, outstanding return on average equity (34.43% in 2011 and 44.7% in Q1 2012), very high return on average assets (19.5% in 2011 and 25.03% in Q1 2012), EBITD margin of 43.3%, operating margin of 40.41% in 2011 and a whopping 56.88% in the first quarter of 2012, and net profit of 28.36% in 2011 and 38.74% in Q1 2012, MasterCard's financial metrics speak for themselves in justifying this company as a solid, extremely stable revenue-generating business with positive free cash flow and high future earnings potential.This year's 1Q EPS of $5.35 and net income of $682 million in the first quarter solidly beat earnings estimates from equity analysts across the board. Net revenue grew a satisfying 17%, operating margin stood at nearly 57%, and share repurchases are establishing strong support for the share price. Management has remained optimistic in its forecast for net revenue growth into future periods, and investors should have good reason to believe their estimates for net revenue growth CAGR of 12-14% for the 2012-2013 year and an EPS CAGR of > 20%.Several equity analysts put the target price for equity shares of MA at over $550 within the next year; my internal DCF analysis with a bit more conservative assumptions firmly establishes a target price at just over $466 - still representing substantial upside from today's levels. For me, the most compelling metric is return on equity for MA; while the S&P 500 had a 1Q12 RoE of 14.55%, MA's RoE was 31.8%. Gross profit margin is at 60%, cash flow is incredibly strong, and the company is in a beautiful position as industry consolidation continues at a fast pace.In fact, P/E of 27.73 demonstrates the extent to which the market believes in the earnings potential of MA equity shares; compared to peers such as Visa Inc (NYSE:V) with P/E of 29.25, Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN) with P/E of 14.47, Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS) with P/E of 21.14, Discover Financial (NYSE:DFS) with P/E of 8.19, Wright Express Corp (WXS) with P/E of 16.73, and a whole host of others, MasterCard is right at the top when it comes to future earnings convictions among investors.When it comes to earnings per share, though, MasterCard demonstrates why it is far and away the best global payments and technology company in which to invest today. EPS for MA is at $15.92; EPS for Visa Inc. is at a relatively paltry $4.28. DFS has an EPS of $4.31, Global Payments has an EPS of $3.02, and Wright Express has an EPS of $3.71. No other payments company comes close to MasterCard's levels of earnings per share, and that is a primary reason I am bullish on the equity shares of MA.Detractors of such an argument may claim that EPS reality and potential have already been priced into MasterCard's equity share price, and that this is simply not a good time to invest in the company. While investors would certainly be wise to consider arguments in support of a bearish thesis on MasterCard, such as a continued global economic downturn, consumer privacy concerns among sector competitors, and increasing levels of scrutiny in the closely related financial sector, in my opinion the preponderance of the evidence is in favor of the bullish case.Investors who still are not convinced may care to examine other peers such as Fiserv Inc (NASDAQ:FISV), Alliance Data Systems Corp (NYSE:ADS), Total System Services Inc (NYSE:TSS), Computer Sciences Corp (CSC), Genpact Ltd (NYSE:G), Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP), Paychex Inc (NASDAQ:PAYX), Cass Information Systems (NASDAQ:CASS), Euronet Worldwide (NASDAQ:EEFT), MoneyGram Intl (NASDAQ:MGI), and Western Union Co (NYSE:WU), and determine for themselves which organization has the strongest relative position in this growing sector.On top of all of this, MasterCard is well known for having had one of the world's most recognizable advertisement campaigns. In that spirit, one equity share of this solid company with pristine ratios at market close on 7/6/2012 would have cost you $441.63. One January 2013 MA 450 call today would cost you $34.90. The premium on one weekly 440 put contract would garner you $4.75. Establishing a long position on MasterCard at current price levels, though, could indeed be a priceless opportunity.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in MA over the next 72 hours."
646171,20568,2012-06-08T05:41:42-04:00,,"Recently, MasterCard (NYSE:MA) announced that its Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of its Class A common stock worth approximately $1.5 billion. The new share repurchase program will be effective after the company is done with its earlier $2 billion share repurchase authorization that was approved by the Board on September 14, 2010 and April 12, 2011 respectively.Until the end of April, MasterCard bought almost 304,600 shares for approximately $106 million since the fourth quarter of 2011. As of May 31, the company had $270 million remaining under its previous share repurchase authorization.The initiative taken by the company to proactively return value to its investors accrues from its ability to generate strong cash flow. As on March 31, 2012, MasterCard's net operating cash flow grew 20.2% year over year to $427 million, its cash and cash equivalents stands at $3.68 billion with no long term debt obligation. MasterCard's trailing 12-month return on investment (ROI) of 31.78% stands significantly ahead of the sector average of 1.20%.The shares of the company currently trade at $419.98 (as on June 6, 2012) exhibiting an increase of 11.78% from the previous day's closing price. The spurt in the company's share prices can be attributed to the recent announcements made by the company as well as favorable market conditions.The latest announcement of paying a cash dividend of 30 cents per share to holders of record of its Class A common stock and Class B common stock on August 9 further boosts investors' confidence on the stock.However, it is to be noted that other peers in the industry are almost equally proactive in this respect. During the first quarter 2012, MasterCard's close competitor American Express Co. (NYSE:AXP), also known as AmEx, announced that its Board of Directors sanctioned the repurchase of almost 150 million shares from time to time.This came as a replacement for the company's prior 200 million share buyback program that had about 38 million shares remaining for repurchase. AmEx also projects to buyback shares worth $4 billion in 2012 followed by another $1 billion in 2013.MasterCard retains a quantitative Zacks #3 Rank, which translates into a short-term Hold rating. Also, we maintain a long term Neutral recommendation on the stock."
560721,24063,2012-05-04T12:49:11-04:00,,"By Renee O'FarrellCredit card company MasterCard (NYSE:MA) reported its quarterly performance on May 2. The company's EPS swelled almost 25% compared to the same period last year, coming in at $5.36 and beating analyst estimates of $5.28. The increase was powered by an increase in the number of shoppers in Latin America, the Asia Pacific and the Middle East and the company's recent acquisitions of international processing system DataCash and global prepaid card manager Access Prepaid Worldwide.MasterCard CEO Ajay Banga said:The company also has a lot of hedge fund interest, including from some of the top fund managers in the world. Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global had almost $426.32 million in the company at the end of December after upping its stake by 50% during the fourth quarter (check out Viking Global's top picks). Tom Russo's Gardner Russo & Gardner, Chase Coleman's Tiger Global Management Llc and Jean-Marie Eveillard's First Eagle Investment Management are also fans of the company.In spite of all the positives, shares in MasterCard still fell that day because investors were expecting stronger performance. According to Barclays, ""MasterCard shares rose 5.9% in the week leading up to earnings, as analysts predicted a strong quarter."" Barclays analyst Darrin Peller explained the phenomenon, saying that, as a result, the higher expectations were already priced in. However, that doesn't mean that MasterCard is a bad pick. In fact, investor bearishness dragging the price down is actually a good thing for those buying in right now.MasterCard went from almost $456 a share at the close of trading on May 1 to $440 on May 2. Last year, the company earned $18.70 a share, beating analyst consensus estimates of $18.58. Analysts are expecting MasterCard to earn $22.01 a share this year, rising to $25.91 a share next year. At this rate, the company is priced at roughly 16.98 times its future earnings. MasterCard's forward price to earnings ratio is marginally on pace with the rest of its industry, which averages 17.09 - but, I think this is a relatively low rate given its high expected growth and analyst expectations of its earnings growth, especially when looking at the competition.Rival Visa (NYSE:V) is currently trading at $122 a share. Analysts are expecting strong growth for this company too. They expect the company will earn $5.98 a share this year, rising to $7.00 a share next year, which makes its forward price to earnings ratio 17.43 - a slight premium to its industry. American Express (NYSE:AXP), which recently traded at $61 a share, is priced lower at almost 13 times its forward earnings but it doesn't have nearly the estimated growth of Visa and MasterCard. Analysts expect American Express will earn $4.33 a share this year, rising to just $4.79 next year. The future is even more bleak for rival Discover (NYSE:DFS). It is trading at $34 a share. Analysts are expecting its earnings to fall from $4.06 a share last year to $3.97 a share this year, dropping to $3.83 a share next year.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

I was looking for a bounce in this area, or at least strong resistance.I placed the short strike just above the lower Bollinger band. My broker's option analysis tool said I had an 73.8% probability of max profit. This is a little more aggressive than I like to get but the technicals were solid.Trade:Sold MA Apr 12 385/380 put spreads for ($6.20-$5.21) x 100 x 2 spreads = $99 premium received(Click to enlarge)3/8/12Two days later the stock popped up to ~419. Using the upper trendline in the chart above for resistance, I sold credit call spreads to form an iron condor with my put spreads. I was looking at a probability of max profit of 87% with this trade.Trade:Sold MA Apr 12 455/460 call spreads for ($1.73-$1.27) x 100 x 2 spreads = $92 premium received3/26/12The stock hit the 20-day sma again and bounced. Decided to use this opportunity to repurchase the put spreads with the intention of redeploying them to higher strikes.Trade:Bought to Close (BTC) MA Apr 12 385/380 put spreads for ($0.73-$0.63) x 100 x 2 spreads = $10 cost vs. $99 credit = $89 profitNote that this $89 profit was against $1000 in margin and achieved in 20 calendar days. That's almost 375% annualized.(Click to enlarge)3/27/12Well the very next day I got the pullback I was looking for. Again used the new breakout area of ~430 as support.I placed the short strike underneath the lower Bollinger band, and around where the 50-day sma would be shortly. Also stayed underneath the trendline from the post-earnings move. OptionsHouse says an 87.4% probability of max profit. Could have gotten a little more aggressive with this one but I was happy with my 10% ROI, especially having already taken a profit and having call spreads on means I didn't need to use up any additional margin.Trade:Sold MA Apr 12 405/400 put spreads for ($1.96-$1.46) x 100 x 2 spreads = $100 premium received(Click to enlarge)4/4/12I added to the put side of the iron condor I had on. The rising trendline continued to hold, though it flattened out a little with the lows on 3/30 & 4/2. There was also high call OI at 425, so I looked for stock to end up somewhere close to that on April opex. Probability of max profit was at 88.4%.Trade:Sold MA Apr 12 405/400 put spreads for ($1.64-$1.21) x 100 x 3 spreads = $139 premium received(Click to enlarge)4/10/12Again I added more to the put side of the iron condor. Trendline was still intact, but continued to flatten. I felt confident being that flatter trendlines are more likely to hold anyway. Also, stock was showing no signs of pulling back. I was, however getting nervous that the call spreads would be in danger.Trade:Sold MA Apr 12 405/400 put spreads for ($1.74-$1.29) x 100 x 5 spreads = $225 premium received(Click to enlarge)4/17/12Closed all the spreads out with the stock at ~438 for a total profit of $522. That's almost 94% of the max possible profit. I always feel it's better to take the money and run than risk holding for another 3 days just to save the 34 bucks and commissions, especially with the market being so chaotic at that time.Trade:Bought MA Apr 12 put spreads for ($0.24-$0.21) x 100 x 10 spreads = $30 cost vs. $464 credit = $434 profitBought MA Apr 12 call spreads for ($0.17-$0.15) x 100 x 2 spreads = $4 cost vs. $92 credit = $88 profitCombine this with the $89 profit from the initial trade, and I made a total of $611 against $5000 in margin for a 12% ROI in about 40 calendar days, or 187% annualized. And the whole time I had better than 80% chance of it being a winning trade.(Note that commissions are not taken into account in any of these trades as they will vary greatly depending on your broker.)Now here is a setup for Visa (NYSE:V) that I'm looking at:The stock sold off hard even after beating earnings recently. Quite a lot of that going on lately. Similar entry as in Mastercard. Lost the rising support trendline from February. Prior to this it was putting in new all-time highs every few weeks.Going to wait and see what happens next week. Should the stock regain the trendline and start trading back in the channel, I'll be looking to sell the 110 puts and buy the 105s. Probably won't be enough premium left in May options so I'll price out June spreads.(Click to enlarge)Disclosure: I am long MA. Long MA via credit put spreads.

567021,27151,2012-05-07T16:33:37-04:00,,"On Monday, Mastercard (NYSE:MA) announced that 17 smartphone models were certified to participate in its PayPass Ready program. The program, which is designed to integrate smartphone devices with near field communication capabilities, has certified these devices with hopes of a smooth transition into MA's mobile payment system. The transition would be critical for consumers because it would allow them to simply move their smartphone near or capture a payment without having to swiping their actual credit or debit card. These transactions not only add an inherited level of consumer protection but a way for customers to pay their bills in a seamless way without the hassle of a contract.The added level of security within MasterCard's 'Ready Pass Program' gives them a competitive edge over such products as Google Wallet, which has run into user based security issues for its parent company, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). Until Google can work all of its kinks out, MasterCard will still carry the supremacy in this marketplace.Coming in a close second to the supremacy of MasterCard, is long time competitor Visa (NYSE:V). Visa has recently certified 8 smartphones to run its mobile payment interface called payWave, however certain issues such as distance come into play. Currently consumers can only be up to four inches away from the payWave reader and at times the reader still doesn't pick up the transaction.MasterCard is the clear frontrunner is the battle for mobile payment processing, and stiff competition is literally nowhere in sight. If you're an investor looking to take advantage of the mobile payment processing industry, a long position in MasterCard is your best bet. The company has great fundamentals and a proven track record within the space. MA currently trades at a P/E ratio of 27.51 making it a pretty affordable play, even though the stock trades at about $427/share. As for its competitors, Visa and Google happen to be great long term plays, however betting on the near term success within the mobile payment processing space of either company is just simple pre-mature.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

A number of banks, as well as credit card network American Express (NYSE:AXP), have reported that credit metrics have improved in recent months. Moreover, American Express and another credit card network, Capital One (NYSE:COF), both reported significantly stronger than expected Q1 results.

JP Morgan raised its target on MasterCard today to $57 from $440 , as it believes that the company's volume trends have remained strong. The firm maintained an Overweight rating on the shares. Similarly, on April 9, Stifel Nicolaus hiked its target on the stock to $505 from $440.

The actual results are typically released between 8:00 and 8:10 a.m. EST and will follow with a conference call at 9:00 a.m.Outliers & StrategyMasterCard shares recently hit all-time highs ($462.34 high on 04/27/2012), thanks in large part to the improving U.S. consumer spending backdrop. Note that MasterCard finished higher the day after earnings for six consecutive quarters.MasterCard is expected to report earnings of $5.30 per share (range is $3.10 $5.49) on revenue of $1.73 bln, a y/y increase of nearly 15%. (Source: Yahoo! Finance). EPS have topped estimates by an average margin of 8.4% over the previous eight quarters.Last quarter, MasterCard posted EPS of $4.03, WELL ABOVE the estimate of $3.91, triggering a nearly 7% rally in the share price. This will be a tough act to follow and with the stock near an all-time high, MasterCard shares are vulnerable to any missteps.MasterCard's closest rival Visa (V), is slated to report its quarterly earnings after the closing bell. The market backdrop and expectations are equally positive for Visa ahead of its earnings.US Bancorp (USB) reported back on April credit card loan growth was up 3.1% sequentially, while credit volume growth rose 9.8% from 4Q 2011 - positive news for the credit card issuers (MasterCard & Visa).Recent News· 04/24: Jefferies raised its 1Q 2012 EPS estimate from $5.28 to $5.31 ahead of its quarterly earnings release, according to a post on StreetInsider.com. The price target was increased from $436 to $521. The Buy rating is maintained based on valuation, earnings visibility, and a manageable regulatory and legal backdrop.· 04/09: According to a post on Benzinga.com, Stifel Nicolaus raised its price target on MasterCard from $440 to $505. The firm also reiterated a Buy rating, based on valuation, market share gains and solid spending trends.· 04/05: Oppenheimer raised its price target on MasterCard from $400 to $475, according to a post on Benzinga.com.

Sentiment in the name is also high, with 25/35 firms carrying Strong Buy/Buy ratings ahead of the release. After recently breaking through the 20-Day SMA near $450, there is little resistance at these levels. The same level is the first crucial support in the event of a pullback, followed by $430 (just above the 50-Day SMA), and $420. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com)SummaryMasterCard shares are at all-time highs ahead of the 1Q 2012 earnings release, based on a more favorable and certain regulatory climate, an improved consumer spending backdrop in the U.S., increasing market share, and higher loan volumes from the major banks. The positive backdrop is also reflected in the overwhelmingly positive sell-side sentiment surrounding MasterCard in recent weeks. With that being said, the shares could be vulnerable at these lofty levels. MasterCard is expected to report earnings of $5.30 per share on revenue of $1.73 bln, a y/y increase of nearly 15%. Anything less could be seen as a major disappointment in the context of the recent advance. For MasterCard shares to extend the recent advance, it would take surprisingly strong numbers to underpin further gains.

461551,24491,2012-03-27T15:49:30-04:00,,"As part of our process, we perform a rigorous discounted cash-flow methodology that dives into the true intrinsic worth of companies. In MasterCard's (NYSE:MA) case, we think the firm is fairly valued at $406 per share, slightly lower than where it is currently trading. Our report on MasterCard and hundreds of other companies can be found here.For some background, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index (click here for an in-depth, narrated presentation about our methodology), which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best.If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. MasterCard posts a VBI score of 6 on our scale, reflecting our 'fairly valued' DCF assessment of the company (it falls within our fair value range), neutral relative valuation versus peers, and bullish techinicals. We compare MasterCard to its peers: Visa (NYSE:V), Bottomline Tech (NASDAQ:EPAY), Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV), and Western Union (NYSE:WU).Our Report on MasterCard(Click to enlarge)Investment Considerations(Click to enlarge)Investment HighlightsMasterCard earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 85.5% during the past three years.The company looks fairly valued at this time. We expect the firm to trade within our fair value estimate range for the time being. Though it would require quite the drop from current levels, if the firm's share price fell below $305, we'd take a closer look. Our process makes sure that we are buying the best companies and the best risk-adjusted prices.MasterCard has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 38.2% in coming years, and the firm had no debt as of last quarter.The firm's share price performance has trailed that of the market during the past quarter. However, it is trading within our fair value estimate range, so we don't view such activity as alarming.The firm experienced a revenue CAGR of about 10.4% during the past 3 years. We expect its revenue growth to be better than its peer median during the next five years.(Click to enlarge)Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. MasterCard 's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 85.5%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.8%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)Cash Flow Analysis(Click to enlarge)Firms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. MasterCard 's free cash flow margin has averaged about 29.8% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At MasterCard , cash flow from operations increased about 95% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 27% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that MasterCard 's shares are worth between $305.00 - $508.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $406 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 27.3 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 16 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 10.2% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 10.4%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 54.6%, which is above MasterCard 's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 3.6% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For MasterCard , we use a 10.8% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $406 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for MasterCard. We think the firm is attractive below $305 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $508 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate MasterCard 's fair value at this point in time to be about $406 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of MasterCard 's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $548 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $406 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.(Click to enlarge)Pro Forma Financial Statements(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

According to their fact sheet they processed 23.1 billion transactions last year with a gross dollar value of $2.7 trillion. The number of transactions is significant because that translates to just over 2.6 million per hour. They claim to have the capacity to process 160 million per hour. Therefore, not a lot of cost increase to significantly increase their revenue stream.Consumers will continue to use credit and debit cards as well as make electronic, Internet and mobile payments, such as Google Wallet, all of which can be processed by MasterCard. Thus, the market is promising.Fundamentally, MA has increasing revenues, net income, free cash flow and has no long-term debt. Their valuation statistics are at or above their industry. They have grown via acquisitions of late. The only blemish on its otherwise stellar income statement is the litigation settlement with Discover (NYSE:DFS) and American Express (NYSE:AXP) in 2008. G&A expenses are contained via cost control measures according to their 10-K and latest 10-Q.Technically, MA has recent primary support at $358 and a secondary level at $345. There is resistance at $385. The stock fell below its 100-day EMA on Friday, Jan 6 and settled at $342.92. However, in looking back over the past several months since the August market decline, almost every time the stock has found a cyclical low it has bounced back 6-11%. It also has a relatively low beta of 0.51.(Click to enlarge)Now, with all that said, I am a trader and not an investor. I look to take high probability of success credit trades that last only 4-6 weeks. I also use cash-secured naked puts to enter stock positions, and if assigned, use covered calls until I can exit the position at a profit.I have a Jan. 2012 340/345 bull put that I entered on 12/22/2011 when the stock was at $371.07. My short strike was 7.6% below the current stock price and further represented a 0.73 standard deviation margin. Historically, the price had only travelled the distance of the current price and my short strike, within my trading horizon of 29 days, 16.8% of the time since 2006. So, I had about an 83% probability of success on this trade.I am trading 3 bull puts (6 total option contracts) and entered the trade with a $0.65 credit - total $195. Because of its recent decline, I can exit for about a $2.30 debit or a $1.65 loss. Implied volatility has increased from 29% to 33% making the options even that much more expensive. So do I get out?Since I am a trader and not an investor, technicals are my primary source of decision-making information. Based on the aforementioned bounces after cyclical declines and that the stock has a low beta, I am going to hang in there for a while longer. First of all, I have been trading MA for several months and have some winners already booked. Secondly, this is a defined-risk trade, my maximum loss is $1,305, which would not be pleasant, but also would not wipe me out. Thirdly, theta is eating the extrinsic value each day and the longer I wait, assuming it does not penetrate my long puts, I may even be able to exit at break-even or a small profit. And, I am looking for the bounce and if accomplished, my options expire worthless and I keep my $195.The point of this exercise is to allow the reader to enter into the decision-making and emotional tug-of-war of a trader in essentially real-time. It is easy to state that one should ""just hang in there"" or ""exit the trade at a loss and move on"" until you are staring at the decision in the face.For anybody interested, I will post in the Comments section my periodic decisions and emotional trauma until I either exit or Jan expiration.Disclosure: I am long MA.

The company provides a variety of services in support of the credit, debit, prepaid and related payment programs of approximately 22,000 financial institutions and other entities. The company offers, manages and processes:MasterCard generates revenue by charging fees to customers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related services and by assessing customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on the cards. In 2010 more than 23 billion transactions with gross dollar volume of $2.7 trillion were processed. There are currently more than 975 million MasterCard branded credit and debit cards. Graph 1 gives an overview of the increase in transactions in the last 5 years. imagesGraph 1: Transaction Overview (Million Transactions)MasterCard has grown significantly in the last 5 years. The stock price increased from less than $50 in 2006 to around $370 today. In comparison, the S&P500 hasn’t moved at all in the same period. Graph 2 gives a good indication of how extraordinary the stock has performed.Graph 2: MasterCard Stock Price Vs. S&P500 The opportunity for future growth remains enormous. Cash and checks account for around 85% of the world's $15.7 trillion of total global payment transactions. This is a huge number of payment transactions that can still be converted into electronical payments. Secondly, the company is aggressively moving into e-Commerce and mobile payment solutions. Cash is useless when buying online… This is a huge opportunity to take advantage of the e-Commerce trend.MasterCard’s margins and return on equity are impressive. EBIT margins are around 50% and ROE is more than 40%. Stockholder equity has doubled over the last 5 years and free cash flow has more than tripled (graph 3). The dip in 2008 is the settlement of litigation charges for $2.5 billion, impacting performance for that year. When a company can grow equity with more than 20% a year and get a return on that of more than 40%, then you’re looking at real growth potential.Graph 3: Equity And Free Cash Flow TrendThe company requires very little capital to grow. Free cash flow is almost equal to operating cash flow. In 2010 the operating cash flow was $1.697 billion, while free cash flow was $1.636 billion. A lot of cash is available to return to shareholders or can be used for growth opportunities. The company has a return on tangible capital of more than 50%. The balance sheet is strong with zero debt and $3.6 billion in cash. On top of that there is $1 billion approved by the board for stock repurchases.MasterCard is not cheap. The current stock price is around $380 and has a forward P/E of around 17. Using the discounted cash flow method with a 10 year growth rate of 9%, terminal growth rate of 0% and a discount rate of 10% gives us an intrinsic value of around $328. MasterCard is a great holding to have in your portfolio. I expect the stock market to remain volatile in the coming months. Wait for the dips to buy into it.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in MA over the next 72 hours."

Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 3.6% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Mastercard, our model uses a 10.8% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the company's fair value at about $344 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Mastercard. We think the company is attractive below $258 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $430 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the company, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Mastercard 's fair value at this point in time to be about $344 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the company's current share price with the path of Mastercard 's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $466 per share in year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $344 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial Statements      Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

And the yield on the 10-year Italian bonds closed above 7%. The last eurozone countries whose bonds closed at 7% were Greece, Ireland and Portugal. The market considers these countries to be credit risks. If you have bad credit, you’d pay 30% or more on your credit card. But a sovereign nation has the ability to tax its citizens. So the chance for a total loss is remote – which is why it’ll pay a comparatively lower rate.But even at a low 7%, Italy can’t pay the interest on its bonds. At this rate, as more of the debt rolls over at a higher interest rate,  it will eventually have to default on its debts. The European Central Bank will make some half-hearted effort to bail out Italy and save the Euro. But in the end, the Federal Reserve will have to step in to save Europe. And it will.The Federal Reserve will print money to buy up Eurozone bonds. This monetizing of debt will eventually result in massive inflation. Regular readers know I’ve been talking about inflation for a while.I’ve been moving my assets in to gold coins, silver, and globally-diversified undervalued large cap stocks like Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Johnson and Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A).So who else is going to benefit from looming inflation? Credit card companies like Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA). These companies provide transaction-processing services. Unlike the banks that issue these credit cards, they bear no risk if the credit card holders default. They’re more like a toll booth on a bridge that collects a fee each time someone drives through. But unlike the toll booths, which charge a fixed dollar amount, these companies charge a percentage of the transaction amount.As the amount of money in circulation increases – and the prices of things goes up – they’ll collect more money for doing the same thing. Unlike other service companies, they don’t have to even explicitly increase their fees. Since it’s a percentage, it will automatically adjust upwards. And if the Euro actually does collapse, travelers to Europe are more likely to use their credit cards for purchases. This is more convenient than exchanging currency at every border.I looked at four stocks in this sector: Visa, Mastercard, Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) and American Express (NYSE:AXP). Visa and Mastercard have significantly greater global appeal and penetration. And between these two, I liked Mastercard more.Over the past five years, its revenue and free cash flow have been steadily increasing. It’s currently selling for a P/E of 20 and a Price/FCF of 18.27.As Warren Buffett demonstrated with his purchase of Lubrizol (LZ) this year, paying 20 times free cash flow is a fair price to pay for a domainant company. But unlike Lubrizol, Mastercard isn’t the market leader.  It’s second-place to Visa. But Visa’s cashflows have been somewhat erratic, and its stock is a bit too pricey.So Mastercard is a little expensive for my taste. I prefer to buy stocks at a discount. It’s on my watchlist – I’ll pick it up if it trades below 15 times FCF.Disclosure: none."
399801,24676,2012-02-29T05:46:31-05:00,,"Wow, what a run. As one looks at the market today, you can't help but see any number of stocks at or near their fifty-two week highs. While many traders and investors have missed this rally, and some are still looking to short, most market participants would agree that it is getting increasingly harder to find value in the market. With many stocks up 30% or more in the last five months alone, it's hard to find stocks that likely have significant near-term upside.In this environment, with most stock prices reflecting the improving macro-economic environment, I think you have look at companies that offer above average growth prospects. While many growth and momentum names like Apple have had monster runs, I think the question now should be about value. Some companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), and others will always generate enough attention to continue to move higher if the news is positive. Long-term though, valuation is often more important than momentum. Stocks that have had big runs may continue to move higher, but the market will likely pay closer attention to valuations as stocks continue to hit new highs.As Warren Buffett likes to say, the market votes in the short-term, but weighs in the long-term. Given how far a number of stocks dropped prior to the recent rally, I still believe that value still exists in the market. Today I think the best value in the market is in the finance sector. In particular, I like the credit card issuers. To me MasterCard (NYSE:MA) offers the best value and strongest future growth prospects of any name within this sector.At first look, MasterCard has had a monster run. The 1 year chart shows that shares have more than doubled over the last year.However, when you look at the 5 year chart you can see that MasterCard has really not moved up that much on an annual basis since 2008. MasterCard shares bottomed at around $150 a share around March of 2009, after the broad market sell-off. Shares of this company also sold off again at the beginning of 2010 on the uncertainty surrounding how the new Dodd-Frank legislation might impact their debt and credit business within the U.S. Today, MasterCard currently trades around $400 a share. If you look at the 5 year chart, you can see that MasterCard has really only gone up about 10% a year, to get to $400 from the $300 level it reached in 2008.While obviously consumer spending levels were higher in 2008 than they are today, MasterCard issues and process cards; it takes no credit risk. Also, the company was not hit very hard by the consumer protection provisions of Dodd-Frank that gave the federal reserve significant authority to curtail debit and credit card fees that comprise a significant portion Visa's (NYSE:V) and MasterCard's revenues. The federal reserves limit on fees that these companies can charge was much higher than what most analysts expected, and these companies have really rallied pretty consistently since this decision was viewed as regulators taking a more pro-industry stance.Still, MasterCard has seen its shares double in the past year, so it is worth asking if there is value investing in a company whose share prices are up over 100% in such a short-period of time? I think you can, and to me the value today in MasterCard is all about the company's business model, and how it is distinct from other retail and finance companies, as well as MasterCard's larger peer, Visa.While Visa has very large exposure to the U.S. debit market, which relies mostly on small businesses to pay their fees, MasterCard is more levered to credit card fees, and the company gets more of its revenues from international markets. MasterCard is also much smaller than Visa. Today, MasterCard's market capitalization is just about $50 billion, while Visa is nearly 60% bigger at around $80 billion.Most of the financial regulation up to this point has been far less burdensome than some in the industry feared. The fees Visa and MasterCard charge to small businesses are the most susceptible to unfavorable future regulatory developments since they primarily affect middle to lower income businesses. Visa has significantly more exposure to this market than MasterCard.So what else is so unique about MasterCard's business model? One distinct and very big advantage that MasterCard and Visa have over nearly every other retail or financial name you can think of is huge free cash flow. While the retail industry is traditionally a capital intensive business, MasterCard has few significant annual expenses. The company currently has $5 billion, or 40 dollars per share in cash, and no debt. Also, just this past year, the company generated nearly $3 billion in free cash from its increasing annual revenue that has grown at 15-20% each of the last several years.Given the strength of MasterCard's balance sheet and its significant and growing free cash flow, the company will likely enact a robust buyback program and raise its dividend sooner rather than later. MasterCard's borrowing rate should also be very low for years to come. The company has already enacted a significant buyback program from several years ago, and I would expect management to only continue if not increase efforts like these.Also, despite the company's significant exposure to Europe and the weak state of the U.S. consumer, MasterCard has still been able to show year-over-year EPS and revenue growth of 18-22% each of the last several years. Given that about 20% of the company's revenue is free cash flow, it seems more than reasonable to think this high growth name with little real competition outside of Visa would justify a growth multiple of around 18-22x an average estimate of next years earnings.And here, again, with estimates rising significantly just in the last couple days, analysts seem behind the news. The average estimate for next year's earnings is now at roughly 26 dollars per share. That means MasterCard is currently trading at roughly 15x next years average earnings estimate despite having a 15-20% growth rate and nearly 40 dollars per share in cash.If we conservatively value MasterCard at 20-22x next years average earnings estimates, giving the company a small premium for the huge free cash flow it generates, we get a stock price of between 520-570 dollars a share. Most analysts have moved their revenue estimates up as well, and further upwards revisions are likely.To conclude, while companies like Apple, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C), continue to get all the attention, the best stocks to trade or invest in may be elsewhere. While MasterCard is not under the radar, this company has not gotten the attention of other bigger names in stronger performing sectors like the technology sector. Today, consumers are increasingly switching to plastic and most financial regulatory fears are concerns of the past. With consumer spending likely to increase over the coming years and the move to plastic accelerating, MasterCard should have years of strong growth ahead.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
306486,24802,2011-11-09T05:40:27-05:00,,"""There are some things money can't buy. For everything else, there's MasterCard."" That is the slogan of MasterCard (NYSE:MA), one of the world's 2 dominant payment networks. Just as a MasterCard is a great thing to have in your wallet, MasterCard stock is a great thing to have in any portfolio.MasterCard is benefiting from a fundamental shift in the way the world conducts business. The world is shifting to electronic forms of payment, and business is becoming increasingly global. MasterCard is well-positioned to benefit from both these trends. Over the past year, shares of MasterCard have risen by over 42%, compared with a rise of 2.87% by the S&P 500. The shares have been depressed for most of the year by the overhang over debit card interchange fees, and once those were resolved, the stock took off. However, we think that stock still has room to run, given its strong fundamentals, which we profile below.Investors often make the mistake of thinking MasterCard is a financial company, given its role in the financial system. Yet, MasterCard is a technology company, enhancing the flow of business worldwide. The company reported record EPS of $5.63 in Q3, on record revenues of $1.8 billion, a 27% rise year-over-year. Purchasing volume, a key metric, rose 17.2% to $628 billion. Though the company acknowledges slow economies both in the US and Europe, that is not stopping MasterCard from investing aggressively in its business. The company recently wrested the debit card business of Huntington Bank (NASDAQ:HBAN) away from Visa (NYSE:V), a key win for the company. The company is seeing huge growth in not only emerging markets, but also here at home. On the conference call, CEO Ajay Banga noted that,Shares of MasterCard have been held back by fears of a reduction in consumer spending. But we think that misses the fundamental reason behind the success of MasterCard. A secular shift to debit and credit cards is occurring, and even if overall consumer spending declines, it is more important that they spend using MasterCard products. MasterCard is poised for further success, due to the following:MasterCard, like so many firms, has had questions asked about its operations in Europe. While there are some analysts that understand that the economic malaise in Europe does not always mean a lack of success in the continent, many analysts cannot decouple the crisis from secular trends. The very first question on the Q3 conference call was about the company's European operations. Robert Napoli, of William Blair & Co., asked about Europe, saying that he'd,Not all analysts can seem to grasp the fact that macro-economic events do not always affect a company's bottom line. CFO Martina Hund-Mejean answered the question, noting that growth in both debit and credit segments was at double-digits. She took care to highlight that that part of the company's success, aside from its strong operational capability, is the secular shift occurring from cash and checks to electronic payment platforms. That shift is happening no matter what kind of economy Europe or the world at large is in, and that is a fact investors must remember. At the end of the call, MasterCard highlighted the fact that cash ""is not free."" It costs, on average, 1.5% of GDP for central banks to print, secure, and distribute cash throughout the economy, and it costs both merchants and consumers. A shift towards electronic payments will decrease these costs. MasterCard not only has strong fundamentals, but strong financials as well. Its operating margin for the first 9 months of 2011 was 54.6%, up from 53.2% a year ago, and the company has publicly stated that it will keep margins above 50%, despite heavy investments across all of its divisions, as well as acquisition expenses. Unlike certain companies that sacrifice profitability for business investments (Amazon), MasterCard is able to balance the needs of maintaining current profitability and investing to increase future profits. The company has a fortress balance sheet, with $4.4 billion in cash and investments, and no debt. This works out to $35 per share.MasterCard has been using cash on all fronts, including investments, buybacks, and dividends, all while its cash on hand rises due to its high cash flows. The company bought back $77 million worth of stock this quarter, and has $879 million left in its current repurchase program. We think that given the company's strong financials, the buyback program will be renewed. MasterCard also pays a dividend, that while small at the present, should grow over time. The stock currently pays a dividend of 15 cents a share, for a yield of 0.16%. MasterCard is undervalued at current prices. Earnings have been growing at an annualized 48% pace over the last 5 years, and revenues have grown by 13.5%, highlighting the profitability of the MasterCard model. Cash flow has grown by 39.6% annually. Despite consistently posting record profits, MasterCard trades at a P/E of just over 20, and a forward P/E of 17. We think that this is too cheap. And analysts agree. Argus and S&P see the stock at $400, while JPMorgan and CLSA see it at $435. Deutsche Bank is at $415, and Jefferies is at $401. Credit Suisse sees it at $430. Though the Reuters average price target is $388.38, we think that will rise as more analysts go through this most recent quarter and see that the company is poised for great success. MasterCard is transforming the world of payments and is changing the way business is conducted worldwide. The company is one that few merchants can be succesfull without, and we think that the stock is one few investors should avoid.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

295533,22561,2011-09-23T09:33:33-04:00,,"I set up an EDGAR online screener to find stocks paying a dividend soon. I don't want to look at all the stocks that pay a dividend, so I filtered the results based on the following:Investors can read about many dividend capturing strategies; most of them work better on paper than they do in practice. I tried just about everything over the years, and I learned quickly it is better to use a sim account first.Now, I use a few methods that produce consistant results. In this article we will go over an upcoming dividend that I may capture with a minimum amount of risk. The criteria that I use is that I must be able to sell a call option in either the front or first back month that is in the money, and with enough premium that I will not mind getting exercised early (which happens often and can be a good thing if the trades are executed correctly).This is one of my favorite and easy-to-understand methods of making gains through options and dividends. Although much of the gains will come from dividends, it should be noted that, in my experience, the option decay can provide a return. This is especially true in lower-yielding stocks. MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE:MA): Strategy:In combination with my buying the stock and after checking company updates, offer to sell the October $270.00 strike call for $3.08 over the intrinsic value. The option may get exercised early for a gain. If not, after qualifying for the dividend, I will look to close out the covered option with a gain of about about $2.55.This trade is much more about the option premium that can be gained than a dividend. If I was already willing and wanting to buy the stock, I would move forward. Without wanting to own the stock the small yield is not worth the downside risk, in my opinion. The dividend adds to the option premium when the yield is this small.The current trailing-twelve-month (ttm) P/E ratio is 21.1 The forward P/E ratio is 18.8. The current book value per share is 43.03. For the same fiscal period year-over-year, revenue has improved to $5.54 billion for 2010 vs. $5.10 billion for 2009. The bottom line has rising earnings year-over-year of $1.85 billion for 2010 vs. $1.46 billion for 2009. The company's earnings before income and taxes are rising with an EBIT year-over-year of $2.75 billion for 2010 vs. $2.26 billion for 2009.At $331.93, the price is currently above the 200-day moving average of 274.62, and above the 60-day moving average of 319.96. Looking at the price movement over the last month, the stock has moved higher in price 4.85%, with a one-year change of 57.14%. Compared to the S&P 500, the year-to-date difference is 64.00%.Remember, you must buy a stock at least three business days before the record date (at least one business day before the ex-dividend date) to qualify for a dividend.My last step (completed before making a trade on the same day) is to check company announcements and news sources for possible events that may cause the stock price to move. This is especially important during earnings season.I research the different call options and calculate the expected probabilities based on Beta, Bid, Offer, Volume traded the current day, open interest, and time value/implied volatility. The options offer some level of protection from down moves in the stock, and provide revenue to cover the times that the options do not fully cover down moves in the stock. Income is not needed from the option premiums, so a break-even from premiums received/stock losses ratio is a win.I use a proprietary blend of technical analysis, financial crowd behavior, and fundamentals in my short-term trades, and while not totally the same in longer swing trades to investments, the concepts used are similar. Nothing in the article should be considered investment advise, but you may want to use this article as a starting point of your own research with your financial planner.

As of 10/10/11, Mastercard has increased 45.38% year to date, outperforming the -4.99% return of the S&P 500. A brief summary of the current market sentiment for Mastercard follows:As shown in the chart below, Mastercard has trended upward in 2011. The Bollinger Bands (90 days, 3σ) show that Mastercard has had a floor of $200 for most of 2011 based on a 3σ / 99.7% confidence interval.Click to enlarge: Therefore, an attractive option strategy to take advantage of Mastercard's recent low-end trading range is a short calendar put consisting of:· Short April 12 Put at $175 strike price· Long January 12 Put at $175 strike priceThis strategy would yield a premium of $2.64 if executed at the April 12 bid and the January 12 ask. If executed at the mid-quote, then the premium would increase to $3.38. Based on my ThinkorSwim margin requirements, this trade would require an initial margin of $1,958.40.

318064,25159,2012-01-08T05:36:14-05:00,,"MasterCard (NYSE:MA) has had a strong run since its IPO at about $50 a share in 2006, since then rising more than 600% to today’s share price of $352. It is easy to understand why everyone was excited about it; even Warren Buffett jumped on board. However, at these prices it seems extended and is due for a technical pullback after its strong 2011. Here are 6 points I looked while researching MasterCard and its close competitor Visa (NYSE:V):Valuation: MasterCard’s current P/B ratio is 7.5 and it has averaged 8.4 over the past 5 years with a low of 5.5 and a high of 17.0. MasterCard’s current P/S ratio is 7.0 and it has averaged 5.6 over the past 5 years with a low of 3.7 and a high of 7.6. Visa’s current P/B ratio is 3.2 and its current P/S ratio is 9.1. The trailing valuation metrics do not have a clear bias about MasterCard’s current valuation metrics and when compared to Visa.Price Target: The consensus price target for the analysts who follow MasterCard is $400. That is upside of just 12% from MA’s current stock price; this very limited upside given to MasterCard by Wall Street analysts suggests that it is close to fair value.Forward Valuation: Analysts project that MasterCard will earn $21.72 a share in 2012. The stock’s current price is about $352 which leads to a forward multiple of 16.2. Its close competitor is trading at a forward P/E multiple of 17.4. EPS growth expected is 16.5% for MasterCard and 17.2% for Visa. Visa’s revenue is projected to jump 9.7% while MasterCard’s revenue is projected to grow 12.6%. It looks like Visa has a lot more operating leverage while MasterCard has more growth opportunities. Overall, though, the valuation metric is about the same for both companies, suggesting that there is no market mispricing based on market comps.EV/EBITDA: Another good multiple to look at in order to take the full capital structure into consideration is EV/EBITDA . MasterCard is trading at an 11.6 multiple while Visa is at 11.5.Earnings Estimates: Mastercard has beat EPS estimates handily its last 4 reports. The smallest beat was 12 cents while the largest was 81 cents. This bodes well as it shows that Wall Street hasn’t caught up to the company’s earnings power.Price Action: MasterCard has been on a tear and has risen almost 100% over the past year. Short term, it looks like it has run into some resistance in the $380 area as after it set a new high in early December, it wasn’t able to eclipse that at the end of the month and has tumbled all the way to the $352 area. It is sitting just below its 50 day moving average right now, which has proven to be good support over the past year. imageConclusion: The metrics suggest that MasterCard is fairly valued. With the run it has had over the past year, it is probably worth waiting for a drop in the stock. An entry price closer to $300, where there is strong support, would provide a better entry price. A cheaper earnings multiple will provide a bigger margin of safety. The growth still looks like it is there but it is slowing down.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
286911,22172,2011-08-12T00:30:28-04:00,,"By Timothy LuttsAs to the market, it stinks.If you want to take the rest of the month off and go fishing, play golf, or read some good books, I understand.On the other hand, there’s always wisdom to be gained from studying  stocks, even in times like the present, when a lot of your assets should  be sitting in cash.Now, human nature says the best way to get rich at times like this is  to buy something that’s just fallen a lot, and ride the rebound.  But  trusting human nature in the stock market is usually dangerous, and I  know from experience that this is an extremely risky gambit; all too  often, after you buy that stock, it goes down even more!My favorite way to hunt at times like this is to look for stocks that  are holding up extremely well.  Those are the stocks in which there are  very few motivated sellers, stocks that have such support that every  share offered is quickly snapped up at current prices. And when the  pressure comes off the broad market, those are the stocks most likely to  soar!One example is MasterCard (NYSE:MA).You know the business.  It pulled in $6 billion in revenue last year, and 58% of that was from outside the U.S.It grew revenues 9% last quarter and earnings 24% and analysts are looking for earnings growth of 26% for all of 2011.And it’s still a rather young stock!MA began trading in mid-2006, peaked with the broad market at 320 in mid-2007, and bottomed with the broad market late in 2008.Since then it’s been working its way back to that old high, and for  the past month it’s been knocking on the 320 level, trying to break out  to new highs. Last Wednesday it did break out after issuing an  excellent earnings report, but got dragged down by the market.  Still,  the stock is within spitting distance of new highs and I think it’s  only a matter of time.Supporting this reasoning is the fact that the stock is a far better value  now than it was when it first hit this level four years ago. Earnings  in 2010 were up 146% from 2007 and this year they’ll be higher still.Just last month, Roy Ward, editor of Cabot Benjamin Graham Value Letter,  added MA to his Wise Owl Portfolio.  His Maximum Buy Price is 306;  buying under that level gets you a Margin of Safety.  His Minimum  Sell Price is 435."

Consumers wouldn't be happy about having to pay fees in order to help the card networks and banks compensate for the revenue they stand to lose as a result of the amendment, adds Wells Fargo. Meanwhile, a number of research firms have had mixed outlooks on MasterCard in recent weeks. On April 15, Susquehanna downgraded the company to Neutral from Positive, citing valuation. Conversely, William Blair assumed coverage of the company with an Outperform on April 11, and Credit Suisse wrote on March 30 that the stock's risk/reward ratio was favorable."
270333,24242,2011-05-17T10:31:41-04:00,,"In a 13F filing on May 16, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) declared owning 216,000 shares of MasterCard (NYSE:MA). This represents a $54 million investment -- relatively small for Buffett. However, this is significant since it is the first time Buffett has owned shares of the company.Large institutional investors such as Buffett report holdings to the SEC each quarter under Form 13F. Buffett has special permission from the SEC to withhold some purchases due to the effects on the stock price when it is reported that he is buying. Many investors follow these filings and attempt to invest where the ""pros"" are investing.We do not know the price that Buffett paid for these shares. I don't particularly recommend buying a stock simply because Buffett or anyone else does. (In that case, it would be much more simple just to buy shares of Berkshire Hathaway.) However, this interesting purchase got me thinking about whether MasterCard would be a good investment.Despite certain headwinds, MasterCard is up almost 30% in the last year. Since going public in 2006, shares are up a more than respectable 521%.[Click to enlarge]MasterCard weathered the financial crisis remarkably well, considering its depth and severity. MasterCard has had relatively steady rising revenue and net income for the five years since it began trading. Shareholders have benefited, considering the S&P 500 is up only 5% over the same time frame.MasterCard is making strides to continue its growth trajectory. The company is investing in the areas of prepaid cards and mobile payments. MasterCard recently entered into agreements with Airtel Africa and the Standard Chartered Banks to link subscribers accounts to a virtual MasterCard number. In the most recent quarter, 60% of net revenue was generated outside the United States. Non-U.S. growth continues to outpace growth within the U.S.MasterCard isn't over-valued. It trades at a forward P/E of 16.42. This isn't bad, considering MasterCard has grown earnings at an annualized pace of 48% over the last five years. Cash flow has grown at an annualized rate of 40% and revenue, almost 14%. In fact, MasterCard seems to be fairly valued. As Buffett says, he would rather buy a good company at a fair price than a fair company at a good price.Value AnalysisWhen you think about it, MasterCard does seem to be a typical Buffett stock. The company isn't capital-intensive when you compare it to the large amount of cash generated. A measure I look at often is the Capex/Cashflow ratio; for MasterCard, it is only 0.09.In addition, new entrants into the credit card sector aren't likely. The sector is virtually controlled by MasterCard, Visa (NYSE:V), and American Express (NYSE:AXP), another Buffett stock. In other words, MasterCard has a wide moat.MasterCard faces headwinds, particularly an odd provision of the financial reform bill. The Durbin amendment, named for Senator Dick Durbin, will essentially cap all debit card interchange fees at about 12 cents. These are the fees that the card companies charge each time a debit card is swiped. Visa and MasterCard argue that this cap is below their costs for conducting transactions. If enacted, the card companies will likely raise or initiate fees in other areas to offset the revenue loss. This would be terrible for consumers and Congress is beginning to realize this. Changing or repealing the Durbin amendment may be one of the few bipartisan acts we see coming out of this Congress.With its growing international revenue, MasterCard seems to offer a unique growth opportunity for investors. If there are significant changes to the Durbin amendment, MasterCard likely has a long growth runway ahead of it. In addition, a pick up in job growth here at home would be a huge benefit to MasterCard. Buffett made a small investment in MasterCard and investors with his time horizon might benefit from following the Oracle on this one.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The consensus estimate is $4.22 for EPS and $1.55B for revenue, according to First Call. As the economy slowed last quarter, MasterCard may have been negatively impacted by decelerating consumer spending. The credit card network also faces possible future headwinds from a possible increase in interest rates following a potential downgrade of U.S. government debt. In addition, the recently launched Consumer Financial Protection Bureau could issue new regulations that may negatively affect MasterCard's business.

275405,24558,2011-06-17T08:48:29-04:00,,"MasterCard (NYSE:MA) is one of those companies everyone knows about, particularly after their famous ad campaign, ""... for everything else there is MasterCard."" I see their ads everywhere, but for some reason, never thought about investing money in MasterCard. Then, the other week, I read that Warren Buffettt had initiated a stake in the company, so I decided to delve into their financials to see if I could see what he saw that was attractive. What I realized was that MasterCard is an international growth story with solid fundamentals. It also has many of the characteristics of a Buffett investment: I am not going to detail MasterCard’s business, because most people know what they do. If you want more information operations, just check out their website. This article is going to highlight the areas above. GrowthIf you are Warren Buffett and managing the amount of money he is, in order to invest a dollar today and have it become two dollars in the future, you need to invest in big growing companies. If you read through the financials of MasterCard, you will see that despite its size, MasterCard is an international growth story. Take a look at the charts showing GDV since 2007, taken from MasterCard’s 10K reports. Note: GDV stands for Gross Dollar Volume. According to MasterCard, ""GDV represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made and cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks."" Essentially, GDV is the gross amount of transactions processed around the world by Mastercard. 2007 (Click to enlarge)2008 (Click to enlarge)2009 (Click to enlarge)2010 (Click to enlarge)With the exception of 2009, due to the economic downturn, the international growth has been blistering, and I do not anticipate a change in this trend either, although U.S. sales do seem to have leveled. The astounding part of this is that 60% of the GDV in 2010 is internationally driven. Safe and secure international growth is what Buffett is after and it looks like he found it. Lastly, check out the earnings estimates below (from moneycentral.com). Not too shabby.(Click to enlarge)MoatNot only did Buffett find international growth with MasterCard, he is also getting a nice little moat. It is difficult to imagine any company knocking MasterCard, Visa (NYSE:V), or Amex (NYSE:AMX) off their game. From here on out, it is a market share play and the market overseas is huge. Although there is regulatory risk with these companies, it is difficult to imagine life without them and their services. What would you do without a credit or debit card? Cash? Checks? No thanks.  Strong Brand/Franchise Buffett is famous for finding good deals on large companies with strong brands/franchises. I think this is mainly because Buffett sees value in a brand due to the fact that accounting standards do not generally allow companies to value their brands on their balance sheets, because advertising and marketing costs are treated as expenses. Therefore, assets are understated on the books of companies with the best and most recognizable brands in the world. Buffett knows that strong brands drive sales and not just for years, but decades and lifetimes. If it is an internationally known brand, even better! MasterCard has a strong brand and a trusted brand. It is globally known.Theme/trendBuffett tends to be a theme based investor, carefully studying trends. There are two trends that Buffett is harnessing with MasterCard. One is international growth and development. The other is a move to a global society with less cash. If you read the latest annual reports, there is no doubt that MasterCard is positioning itself for this trend. The other brilliant thing about Buffett is that he uses big picture logic to reduce uncertainty and extrapolate outcomes. Think about it, if the trend is to go cashless, there are only a handful of companies that can make this happen. Even if the trend does play out as quickly as he thinks, he still purchased a great company at a good price and he just has to wait. If you are investing in chip technology companies, anything can happen.  The outcome with MasterCard is relatively more certain. This makes MasterCard a safer investment especially considering that MasterCard is not as expensive as many of the stocks whose future growth is much more uncertain. Visa, MasterCard, Amex are going to facilitate the international growth and cashless trends and will make all the money. FundamentalsMasterCard has impressive fundamentals that meet the Buffett standards when it comes to returns, efficiency, etc. Below are charts taken from moneycentral.com. Returns(Click to enlarge)Management Efficiency(Click to enlarge)I am mainly focused on returns on equity and returns on assets. In my mind, these two items are the biggest determining factor as to whether a company has a moat and good management that can benefit shareholders.Good Company at a Fair Price  Since Wall Street is obsessed with trading, this often creates really great opportunities for long term investors. I believe this is the case with MasterCard. There is regulatory uncertainty as a result of fees such as interchange fees that could impact MasterCard’s business. As a result, Buffett was able to buy shares in a good company at a fair price. I am somewhat nervous over the regulatory issues myself, but at the end of the day, deals are usually struck by politicians and lobbyists do what they do, and an agreement is usually worked out. In conclusion, I am considering purchasing MasterCard stock to add to my portfolio of relatively safe investments with good growth potential. I feel the stock could fluctuate a bit, but overall, it is a safe enough investment. When I die someday, chances are pretty good that MasterCard will not only still be in business, but be MUCH bigger and more valuable than it is now.  Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Analysts are looking for EPS of $3.04 on revenue of $1.42B. The consensus range is $2.83-$3.46 for EPS, and $1.35B-$1.49B for revenue, according to First Call. In a note to investors on January 25, Oppenheimer recently offered a bullish assessment of the company. According to the analyst, MasterCard's fundamentals are still strong, as the company's purchase volume, transaction and cross-border trends continued to be healthy during Q4. The firm, which views the stock as ""highly attractive,"" expressed optimism that MasterCard's multiple would expand significantly when the controversy over the Durbin amendment is resolved. The Durbin amendment is legislation that has forced the Fed to set strict limits on the fees that MasterCard charges to retailers who accept its debit cards. Even if Durbin's legislation is not overturned, Oppenheimer believes that MasterCard can generate EPS growth in the high teen to low 20% levels. In addition to the Durbin amendment, MasterCard faces a threat from cellular phones equipped to make purchases. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) recently announced that it will allow its customers to use a variety of mobile devices, including RIMM (RIMM) and iPhones, to pay for their drinks, and other retailers could soon follow suit. MasterCard recently announced that it would team with Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) to develop mobile payment systems in Latin America, but investors may look to determine whether the credit card issuer is moving quickly and comprehensively enough to deal with the competitive threat from phone makers and carriers."
238725,20568,2010-11-26T00:36:00-05:00,,"This week, MasterCard Inc. (NYSE:MA) entered into a new three-year credit facility worth $2.75 billion, thus replacing a prior $2.0 billion credit facility that was supposed to expire in April 2011. The new credit facility will expire on November 22, 2013. While the majority of credit facility lenders are customers or affiliates of customers of MasterCard International, the terms of the agreement remain undisclosed.In April 2008, MasterCard’s unsecured revolving credit facility had been extended to April 2011. This facility, which had been initiated in April 2006, has now been replaced by the new one, with a revised expiration date of November 2013. The available funding under the previous credit facility was worth $2.5 billion through April 2010 and then decreased to $2.0 billion as of November 22, 2010.MasterCard was in compliance with the covenants of the previous credit facility and had no borrowings under it in the past one year. Since early this year, however, the company has been mulling to replace this revolving credit facility.Estimate Trend RevisionOver the last 30 days, 14 of 28 analysts covering the stock have decreased their estimates for the fourth quarter of 2010, while 10 upward revisions were witnessed. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is operating earnings of $3.06 per share, which would be up by 25.9% from the year-ago quarter.The higher number of downward estimate revisions for the third quarter indicates a likelihood of negative trend in the performance of the stock in the near term.With respect to earnings surprises, the stock has been almost steady over the last four quarters, with three positive surprises. The average remained positive at 6.17%. This implies that MasterCard has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.17% over that period.The downside potential for the estimate for the fourth quarter, essentially a proxy for future earnings surprises, currently stands at 0.33%.We believe that with the above-average earnings growth over the past four-five quarters have helped MasterCard improve its balance sheet position. However, it appears that increasing regulatory compliance and litigation costs amid increased regulations in the card payment processing industry and minimal scope of increasing cash flow requires the dependence on additional resources.Moreover, with the equity market appreciation, MasterCard is also gearing up to tap new business opportunities in its debit portfolio while also seeking to expand through competitive advantages from prime rivals such as Visa Inc. (NYSE:V). Hence, a revolving unsecured credit facility remains a modest alternative although its adverse impact could be quite intense."

MasterCard competes with Visa (NYSE:V) and American Express (NYSE:AXP). Below we look at the four most important division driving our $293 price estimate for MasterCard, which is around 17% ahead of the current market price.Rise of Mobile Payments a Catalyst The number of mobile payment users have been rising fast with 351  million users in 2009 which is estimated to reach 1.06 billion by 2014  at a compound annual growth rate of 20.5%. Global mobile payments  transactions are expected to rise to $1.13 trillion in 2014 from $37.4  billion in 2009, at an annual growth rate of 98%. [1] We expect this to benefit card companies like MasterCard, Visa and American Express.The 4 Most Important Divisions for MasterCard1)  Transaction Fees – represents 32% of the company’s stock valueMasterCard acts as a transaction processing service for its customers. All transactions made using MasterCard branded cards are authorized, cleared and settled by MasterCard. MasterCard also provides customers its network and technical infrastructure to carry out transactions in a fast and easy method. In exchange for these services, MasterCards charges its customers a transaction processing fee.2) International Fees – represents 29% of the company’s stock valueA major part of MasterCard revenues come from the fees it levies on cross-border transactions. A cross-border transaction is a transaction where the card holder’s country  is different from the merchant’s country. MasterCard levies a cross-border fee and a currency conversion fee for any transaction made outside the card-holder’s country.3) Assessment Fees – represents 21% of the company’s stock valueAssessment fees are charged to the to the card issuing bank. They are based on the gross dollar volume for a specific time period. The rates vary depending on the nature of transactions that generate GDV and by region.4) Services Fees - represents 9% of the company’s stock valueFor our analysis, we have included acceptance development fees, warning bulletin fees, consulting and  research fees and other fees such as penalty fees, hologram and publications fees as services fees.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"

Net income for the reported quarter was $518  million, up 14.6% from $452 million in the prior-year quarter.Results improved over the prior-year quarter due primarily to better  pricing, an increased number of processed transactions and reduced  operating expenses, which drove the operating margin higher. However,  increase in rebates and incentives and the flattish growth in number of  processed transactions were on the downside for MasterCard.Total revenue increased 4.7% year over year to $1.43 billion, above the  Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.41 billion. On a constant currency  basis, net revenue increased 7.3% over the prior-year period. The  increase was primarily due to a 7% favorable pricing changes, a 0.6%  growth in the number of processed transactions to 5.8 billion and a  15.4% increase in cross-border volumes. Gross dollar volume increased  8.5% to $685 billion during the reported quarter. As of September 30,  2010, MasterCard issued 1.6 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded  cards.Total operating expenses decreased 4.1% year over year to $662 million.  Currency fluctuation contributed 1.5 percentage points to the increase  in the expenses. The overall decrease was primarily attributable to a  6.7% decrease in general and administrative expenses. While advertising  and marketing expenses increased 4.7%, depreciation and amortization  expenses remained flat. The operating margin for the reported quarter  came in at 53.6%, up from 49.4% in the year-ago quarter.MasterCard's effective tax rate for the reported quarter was 32.3%, marginally down from 32.9% in the year-ago period.As of September 30, 2010, MasterCard’s net operating cash flow was  $1.03 billion, down from $1.09 billion as of September 30, 2009. At the  end of September 30, 2010, cash and cash equivalents increased to $2.48  billion, long term debt reduced to $1 million, retained earnings  increased to $2.52 billion, while total equity was higher at $4.84  billion from December 31, 2009.Business UpdateDuring the reported quarter, MasterCard enhanced its global debit  portfolio with new agreements that include Sovereign Bank, Chevy Chase −  now part of Capital One (COF) − and Delta Air Lines (DAL)  in the U.S., Barclaycard in Germany and Qatar Islamic Bank. The company  also signed a memorandum of understanding with China Union Pay and got  into an agreement with Singtel, one of the larger mobile operators in  Asia, thereby expanding its presence in emerging growth markets and  channels.Further, on October 22, MasterCa rd completed the acquisition of  DataCash Group plc for about $526 million, expanding its e-Commerce  merchant gateway presence in Asia and Australia to European countries  and other global high-growth emerging markets.Our TakeMasterCard’s results have outshone its prime competitor, Visa Inc. (V),  which reported its fiscal fourth quarter earnings of 95 cents on  October 27, 2010. This came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  but came in substantially ahead of 74 cents reported in the year-ago  quarter.MasterCard benefits from strong secular demand growth, meaningful  international exposure, high barriers, excellent pricing power,  risk-free balance sheet and impressive operating leverage. Also, the  above-average earnings growth, strong competitive position and leverage  to an eventual economic recovery will result in a relative valuation  premium.However, we are concerned about MasterCard’s resilience and ability to  raise prices, the detrimental effects of the Consumer Protection Act in  the U.S., and scope for increasing cash flow. Hence, the cautious  outlook over the near term justifies our Neutral recommendation."

From that sharp plunge, a new pattern has begun to develop. It is not a bearish pattern, but instead is a potential bullish flag. I have drawn the flag in yellow.This pattern won't become active unless the price breaks out, this week or early next, above the $251.50 area. That is the top of the pattern currently. Keep in mind that as the lines of a bullish flag slope downward, it is actually possible for the pattern to remain viable, and trigger at a lower level in the future, as long as price remains within the bounds of the flag. The upside potential for the pattern would be smaller in that case as well. The measuring implications don't change based on the breakout level.If the pattern were to become active this week, the upside potential for the bullish flag is to the $280 area. This is shown by the light blue vertical line. We have to keep adjusting the line downward to follow the lower bound of the flag next week, which would shave roughly a dollar from the objective.The pattern would be broken and voided as a pattern if price were to break down below the $240 area. That would be well below the current bottom of the pattern. Again, as a bullish flag slopes downward, if the pattern remains potential but not active into next week, the area below which the pattern would be voided will also go down, placing it below $239.Disclosure: No positions"

Net  income for the reported quarter was $455 million, up 24% from $367  million in the prior-year quarter. Results for the reported quarter improved over the prior-year quarter  due primarily to better pricing, an increased number of processed  transactions and higher operating margin. However, higher operating  expenses as a result of increased fixed costs were on the downside. Total revenue increased 13.1% year-over-year to $1.3 billion, primarily  due to 5% favorable pricing changes, 4.6% growth in the number of  processed transactions to 5.4 billion and a 10.9% increase in  cross-border volumes.

The increase was primarily  attributable to an adjustment to the balance of deferred taxes that was  recorded in the first quarter of 2009.

Richard Haythornthwaite, Chairman of the MasterCard Board of Directors anointed Ajay Banga as President and CEO, effective July 1, replacing Robert W. Selander, who has been MasterCard’s chief executive officer since March 1997. The appointment was expected. Ajay Banga's employment contract included a special multi-million dollar fee just in case he was not appointed by the Board. He also immediately becomes a member of the Board of Directors. The real issue is what course will the new pilot plot for investors. CEOs are similar to quarterbacks on NFL football teams. They make or break the team. There is precious little information about his intention or initiatives. There is precious little information about what the board sees as the future. We do know one thing: the field is cut-throat competitive. What does MasterCard have to offer that Visa (NYSE:V), American Express (NYSE:AXP) and others are not already offering?Trying to figure out MasterCard is like guessing what the Vatican will do. If you see too many consultants being hired for high level strategy, look out. If you see a shoot for the moon expansion, look out. If you see no change in dividends, look out. MasterCard has a $33.9 billion market cap with an anaemic dividend yield of 0.23%. It is weak and could use much improvement.Disclosure: No position"

MasterCard manages a family of payment card brands, including MasterCard, MasterCard Electronic, Maestro and Cirrus, which the Company licenses to its customers. In December 2008, MasterCard acquired Orbiscom Ltd.Does MA make for an intelligent investment or intelligent speculation today?Starting with a base estimate of annual Free Cash Flow at a value of approximately $1,000,000,000 and the number of shares outstanding at 130,810,000 shares; Since MA has been growing rapidly, in this estimation, we use a liberal assumed FCF annual growth of 14 percent for the first 10 years and assume zero growth from years 11 to 15. Review the Free Cash Flow record here:The resulting estimated intrinsic value per share (discounted back to the present) is approximately $190.33.Before we make a purchase, we must decide (filter #1) if MA is a high quality business with good economics. Does MA have (filter #2) enduring competitive advantages, and does MA have (filter #3) honest and able management.Some industries have higher ROE because they require no assets, such as consulting firms. Other industries require large infrastructure builds before they generate a penny of profit, such as oil refiners. Generally, capital-intensive businesses have higher barriers to entry, which limit competition. But, high-ROE firms with small asset bases have lower barriers to entry. Thus, such firms face more business risk because competitors can replicate their success without having to obtain much outside funding.Growth benefits investors only when the business in point can invest at incremental returns that are enticing; only when each dollar used to finance the growth creates over a dollar of long-term market value. In the case of a low-return business requiring incremental funds, growth hurts the investor. The wonderful companies sustain a competitive advantage, produce free cash flow, and use debt wisely.Does MA make for an intelligent investment or speculation today? Time is said to be the friend of the wonderful company and the enemy of the mediocre one. Before making an investment decision, seek understanding about the company, its products, and its sustainable competitive advantages over competitors. Next, look for able and trustworthy managers who are focused more on value than just growth. Finally ask: Is there a bargain relative to its intrinsic value per share today?Great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be misappraised. In terms of opportunity cost, is MA the best place to invest our money today?Time Forward Projection:How will MA compete going forward? Keep in mind that a financial report like this is a reflection of the past and present. It may be used to project a future, but it may not account for factors yet unseen. Therefore, pay attention to competitive and market factors that may affect changes in profitability.In summary, using a Debt/Equity ratio of 0.01, MA shows a 5-year average Return on Equity of 24.2 . The resulting estimated intrinsic value per share (discounted back to the present) is approximately $190.33. Its market price is $204.3, thus the stock is not currently a bargain.Disclosure: No positions"
258965,20568,2011-03-18T09:53:34-04:00,,"Wednesday, we reiterated our Neutral recommendation on MasterCard Inc. (NYSE:MA) given the current sustainability factor. The company’s fourth quarter operating earnings per share of $3.16 came in substantially ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.05 and $2.24 in the year-ago quarter.Results for the reported quarter improved over the prior-year quarter primarily attributable to better pricing, an increased number of processed transactions, strong gross dollar volume (GDV) growth and a lower tax rate that also drove the operating margin. However, increase in rebates and incentives and slightly higher operating expenses were on the downside. MasterCard continues to drive growth through increased cross-border volumes, improved pricing coupled with consistent growth of processed transactions. Besides, GDV growth also buckled up remarkably in 2010, after declining in 2009. These signs are encouraging as they account for key revenue drivers of MasterCard’s business.Moreover, the debit card business continues to pose modest growth amid the global challenging environment. MasterCard brand mark appeared on approximately 297 million debit cards globally, growing 15.8% year over year in 2010. Going ahead, the company is expected to deliver further on this momentum once the global economy revives to its historical highs.Additionally, MasterCard enjoys a strong cash, investment and operating cash flow with no long-term debt. This not only provides an operating leverage to the balance sheet but also provides acquisition opportunities as well as scope for liability reduction, acquisitions, stock repurchase and capital expenditure that will in turn enhance the long term growth.However, the deteriorating credit quality due to the recent global crisis has adversely affected MasterCard’s credit and charge card growth. This also affects the GDV growth since consumer credit and charge programs represented 57% of total GDV in 2010, which is a significant portion. MasterCard brand mark appeared on approximately 648 million consumer credit and charge cards globally, marking a 2.4% year-over-year decline in 2010. Moreover, currency fluctuations along with higher rebates and incentives passed on to the customers and intermediaries also added to the woes. Although the GDV growth is recovering, uncertainty prevails over the consistency to significantly support the company’s top-line growth in the near future.More significantly, regulatory measures enacted in the U.S. in 2009 have taken effect after the U.S. financial reform bill was passed in July 2010. In December 2010, this consumer protection Act proposed that the interchange fee on debit transactions, charged by banks on the merchants, should be restricted to about 7–12 cents, against the average debit card interchange fee of 44 cents charged in 2009. This profound slashing will hamper revenues of the banks, which in turn will affect the card companies as banks would now try to trim the fee that they pay to use the respective card networks. The Act also proposed that merchants will now have the choice of processing transactions through unrelated networks.Such regulations may hamper the number of transactions processed coupled with the cost of such transactions, which is again a key growth component for the card companies. Moreover, a part of these costs will be shifted to the consumers, which tend to shrink consumer spending and risks a decline of transaction and payments volumes through its systems. While the actual effect of these regulations is not expected before mid-2011, the cycle of actions could turn out to be detrimental to the growth potential in the upcoming years.Nevertheless, through a strong and strategic acquisitions and alliances such as the recent acquisition of Travelex and DataCash plc coupled with the Memorandum of Understanding with China’s UnionPay, MasterCard continues to strengthen its business model. Besides, the company is also diversifying its product portfolio through innovations that include e-commerce, mobile payments and smart cards in order to realign itself to capitalize on the most promising growth opportunities from both a geographic and product development standpoints. Such long-term growth strategies are also required for sustaining competitive pressures, primarily from Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and American Express Co. (NYSE:AXP).Overall, MasterCard benefits from strong secular demand growth, meaningful international exposure, high barriers, excellent pricing power and impressive operating leverage. Moreover, the above-average earnings growth, strong competitive position and leverage to an eventual economic recovery will result in a relative valuation premium. Further, strategic acquisitions and partnerships are well poised for long-term growth. However, we are concerned about MasterCard’s resilience and ability to raise prices, the detrimental effects of the reduction in interchange fees under the consumer protection Act and consistency in expense control."
186655,20568,2010-02-04T11:08:47-05:00,,"MasterCard Incorporated’s (NYSE:MA) fourth-quarter earnings (excluding special items) of $2.24 per share came in substantially below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.47. However, this compares favorably with the earnings of $1.85 per share in the year-ago quarter. Earnings for the reported quarter included an after-tax severance charge of $0.19 per share.    The results for the reported quarter improved over the prior-year quarter due primarily to better pricing, an increased number of processed transactions and a lower tax rate. However, higher operating expenses as a result of increased personnel costs due to severance-related charges were the downside.Estimate Revisions Trend Over the last 7 days, four out of the 33 analysts covering the stock have increased estimates for full-year 2010, while none moved in the opposite direction. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2010 is a gain of $13.58 per share, which would be a 21.4% improvement over full-year 2009 earnings. The absence of estimate revisions for 2010 in the downward direction indicates a likelihood of upward pressure on the performance of the stock in the upcoming quarters. However, the reported quarter’s earnings surprise is not reflected in the estimate revisions yet. As a result, the stock retains its Zacks # 3 Rank, which translates into a short-term Neutral rating. Also, considering the current fundamentals of MasterCard, we maintain a long-term Neutral recommendation on the stock. With respect to earnings surprises, the stock remained steady over the last four quarters, with only positive surprises. The average surprise remained at 12%. This implies that MasterCard has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12% over the last four quarters. The current Zacks Consensus Estimates for the first quarter and full-year 2010 are earnings of $3.19 and $13.58 per share, respectively. The upside potential of the estimates for the first quarter and full-year 2010, essentially a proxy for future earnings surprises, currently stands at 1.3% and 2.0%, respectively. Quarter in Detail MasterCard’s GAAP net income for the reported quarter was $294.0 million, up 22.8% from $239.4 million in the prior-year quarter. For full-year 2009, MasterCard’s net income (excluding special items) came in at $1.5 billion or $11.19 per share, compared to $1.2 billion or $9.41 in the previous year.   Total revenue increased 6.0% year-over-year to $1.3 billion, primarily due to better pricing, a 6.7% growth in the number of processed transactions and a 3.9% increase in cross-border volumes. Gross dollar volumes increased 5.3% to $674 billion during the reported quarter.   Total operating expenses (excluding special items) increased 8.9% year-over-year to $830.3 million. Currency fluctuations contributed 3.2 percentage points of the increase in expenses. The overall increase was primarily attributable to a 1.6% increase in general and administrative expenses and a 25.1% increase in advertising and marketing expenses. The operating margin for the reported quarter came in at 36.1%, down from 38.2% in the year-ago quarter. MasterCard's effective tax rate (excluding special items) for the reported quarter was 35.8%, down from 46.1% in the year-ago period. The decrease was primarily attributable to a more favorable mix of earnings, a lower state tax rate and a lower provision for tax reserves. MasterCard remains well-positioned to grow its revenue and earnings despite the economic hangover. The company benefits from strong secular demand growth, meaningful international exposure, high barriers, excellent pricing power and impressive operating leverage. Also, the above-average earnings growth, strong competitive position and leverage to an eventual economic recovery will result in a relative valuation premium. However, we are concerned about MasterCard’s resilience and ability to raise prices and reduce expenses. After the market closed Wednesday, competitor Visa Inc.’s (NYSE:V) reported its fiscal first quarter (ended Dec 31, 2010) earnings of $1.02 per class A common share. Visa’s earnings were substantially ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 91 cents and prior-year quarter’s earnings of 74 cents. Following the earnings release, MasterCard shares have since fallen over 6.6%."

I was shocked by some of the offers that I saw. These cards won’t help individuals with bad credit improve their credit; these cards will only help their credit to get worse. These are some of the worst offenders.Next Millennium Mastercard (NYSE:MA)- This is a secured credit card which is supposed to allow individuals to rebuild their credit. I am normally a fan of secured cards for people with bad credit because the savings account keeps you from going over your credit limit. That is not true of the Next Millennium card. Next Millennium charges a $99.00 processing fee to open the account and a $59.00 annual fee.A Number of people have complained to the Better Business Bureau about being charged the processing fee even though they did they did not fully complete the application. Other people have complained about mailing the company money and receiving no credit for their payments. The company’s contact information is hidden which makes it near impossible to contact them about their fraudulent practices. If you ever do receive the card your interest rate is a minimum of 19.5%. Next Millennium offers no grace period which makes it virtually impossible to pay your balance down to zero. This is probably the worst secured card on the market.First PREMIER Bank- First PREMIER Bank offers the First PREMIER Bank Gold Credit Card, Centennial Card and the Aventium Card. First PREMIER’s motto is 'U + Premier' are stronger together. So let’s say you believe this and apply for a First PREMIER card. Your initial credit limit is $250 before fees. What are the fees? As soon as you receive the card you are billed for a $95.00 program setup fee, $48.00 annual fee, $29.00 servicing fee, $84.00 monthly servicing fee billed at a rate of $7.00 monthly. Add all these fees up and your available credit is $71. But when you add in the servicing fee over a full year your available credit is actually $-6.00. That’s just the beginning of the fees. If you want to schedule autodraft payments that will cost you $11. If you receive a credit limit increase, you will be charged $25. Do you want to view your account online? That will be an additional $3.95. This card boasts the highest fees of any credit card. Based on all of the fees that First PREMIER Bank charges I am surprised that they do not send the card COD.Since new credit card regulations are capping fees on these predatory lenders, they are going to lower fees and increase interest. First PREMIER is offering cards with an interest rate close to 80%. That’s just plain ridiculous. I would say its better to have no credit card then these cards."

Results were substantially ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.93. Better pricing, an increased number of processed transactions, lower operating expenses as a result of continuous cost-cutting initiatives and a lower tax rate contributed to the upside. GAAP net income during the quarter was $452.0 million or $3.45 per share, compared to a net loss of $194.0 million or $1.48 per share in the prior-year quarter. GAAP results included $6.2 million in pre-tax litigation settlement charges during the quarter. Total revenue increased 2.0% year-over-year (3.9% on a constant currency basis) to $1.4 billion, primarily due to better pricing and a 7.6% growth in the number of processed transactions which offset lower international volumes. Gross dollar volumes were relatively flat at $633 billion during the quarter, while cross border volumes were lower compared to the year-ago levels. Total operating expenses decreased 57.3% year-over-year to $690.8 million. The decline was primarily attributable to decreased advertising and marketing expenses from reduced investments and continued cost containment initiatives and a decrease in general and administrative expenses resulting from lower professional fees and travel expenses."

(NYSE:MA) may not be in the most attractive industry – the financial services industry – but its unique business remains resilient amid the economic turmoil. The company beat Wall Street expectations when it announced a 26% increase in sequential net income in the second quarter, while continuing to see positive trends in credit card transaction volumes.During the second quarter, MasterCard reported net income of $349 million, or $2.67 per share, on revenues that increased 2.7% to $1.28 billion. Meanwhile, the company’s capital and liquidity positions remained strong with $2.7 billion in cash and equivalents and $2.7 billion in equity. At the same time, its number of transactions increased 7.9% for the quarter.Despite the increase in the number of transactions, the dollar volume of the transactions was 9.3% lower for the quarter, due partially to higher transaction fees instituted in April 2009. However, MasterCard’s focus on cost-cutting led to a sharp reduction in expenses, which helped it report a 2.9% increase in net revenues and a 10% jump in operating margins for the quarter.Combating the CrisisMasterCard believes that lower revenue growth rates for the quarter reflect the impact of the present global economic environment. In response, the company focused on improving their bottom line results, and reduced their operating expenses by 23% for the quarter. These near-term changes have partially offset lower revenue growth.MasterCard plans to grow by further penetrating their existing customer base and expanding their role in targeted geographies around the world and focus on higher growth segments, including premium/affluent and contactless cards, commercial payments, debit, prepaid and issuer processor and terminal driving services.However, MasterCard and its shareholders believe that the prevailing trend within the global payments industry from paper-based forms of payment towards electronic forms of payment creates significant opportunities for growth over the longer term. Many experts continue to peg this growth in the double-digits over the next five years.ConclusionCurrently, MasterCard trades at 35x earnings and pays a small dividend of $0.15 per share or 0.29% yield. Given MasterCard’s strong position in the credit card marketplace, strong trends towards electronic payments versus paper payments, and expected double-digit long-term growth rates when the economy recovers, many experts believe that this stock is undervalued.Disclosure: No positions."

As seemingly rare events became commonplace, Nassim Taleb’s “Black Swan Theory” has gained prominence as a means to explain the unexpected. According to Taleb, a black swan event appears by complete surprise, has a major impact, and after the fact is explained by human hindsight.Given the success of hedge funds advised by Taleb during the current bear market, all investors are on the hunt for black swans. Those who correctly forecast these events, such as the national collapse in home prices, have reaped enormous rewards. Those on the other end of the trade have been devastated. It is in search of a black swan that I approach this week’s option trade in my weekly newsletter EPIC Insights.MasterCard (NYSE:MA) is a credit card transaction processor. As a middleman in the credit process, they earn fees yet are not exposed to consumer credit risk. This sweet spot has accorded them a premium valuation as credit card use has expanded.In MA’s unique position, I see opportunity. Acting in the middle of a transaction, MA takes substantial risk. When I use a local bank’s credit card at Target to buy $100 of merchandise, Target submits a claim to MA which is then paid by MA. MA then goes to the local bank and asks that it pay the $100. When the bank meets its obligation, MA eliminates its own risk. But what happens if the local bank cannot pay MA the money that was advanced to Target? At this point, MA is forced to collect from a bank that cannot pay after they have already advanced funds they do not have to Target.According to its most recent annual report, MA faces potential settlement exposure of $24 billion versus an available credit line of only $2.5 billion. If some credit card issuers face drastic liquidity issues and cannot meet their obligations, the effect on MA’s stock price would be devastating.As a potential black swan, we must recognize that the likelihood of this event occurring is very small. However, I would not deem it impossible. If it were to occur, MA’s stock price would collapse. By looking toward the option market, we can effectively create a trade that has a low probability of paying off, but garners tremendous return if it were to occur. I have chosen deep out-of-the-money puts for this trade. The January 90 puts (LKQ+MR) trade for a low price, have ample length until expiration, and a high enough strike that were the unimaginable to occur, our profits would be immense.Since the event I have described is unlikely to occur, but potentially very profitable, investors must tread carefully. Use a position size with which you are comfortable losing the entire premium. This is a trade with enormous optionality that will offer diversification to a well-rounded portfolio, but requires investors to avoid making large bets on unlikely events."

However as the credit crisis has expanded beyond the banks and now threatens a deep, consumer-led recession, MA's core franchise is under attack.  With predictions circulating of banks cutting credit lines, MA's growth will be curtailed and their earnings power will suffer.The drop in price has resulted in a clearly defined channel that has held for over 4 months.  As the market rallied last week, MA bounced off the lower end of the trading range, retested the top of the range and then pulled back.  The result is a stock at the higher end of its trading range, that has set another lower high (its 4th lower high since September) and enjoyed a 26% one week move on declining volume.  Knowing that volume should follow the trend, a stock that rises on declining volume should not be trusted.Deteriorating fundamentals, a clear technical pattern, and unsustainable moves on declining volume combine to offer an excellent short sale candidate.  MA remains a unique stock in a challenging market.  Over the past three weeks, I have shorted the shares above $142, covered at $126 and now gone short above $139.  With a clear technical pattern, all signs point to a drop in MA shares that should violate the recent intraday low of $115."

106918,22376,2008-11-20T03:04:15-05:00,,"Broadly speaking, there are two main groups of investors.  Those using fundamentals will analyze a company's business prospects, growth potential and financial structure with the hope of finding stocks that the market has mispriced.  Technical investors will rely upon chart patterns and trading activity to decide when to buy and sell securities. In the current bear market, both groups have faced problems determining the next move.  Fundamentalists have seen cheap stocks become even cheaper.  As they deployed capital, losses have mounted and frustration reigns.  With the large drop in stock prices over the past few months, technicians also find themselves in uncharted waters.  These investors find themselves looking back many years to determine what the next level of support should be.  While a down trending stock begs to be shorted, only the bold confidently sell stocks where moving averages and trend lines are far removed from the current price.This lack of clarity would lead many investors to remain on the edges and refrain from assuming risk.  However, there is great opportunity cost with such a stance.  Instead, I prefer to find stocks with a downward bias that allow me to hedge my current portfolio yet offer the comfort of a clear technical pattern.  This search brings me to MasterCard (NYSE:MA). As initially featured in my weekly newsletter here MA is a former market darling that has crashed to earth. When most felt the credit crisis was contained, MA was seen as a place to hide.  By acting as a transaction processor, MA assumes virtually no credit risk and earns a fee each time their card is used.  If consumer spending held, their business would continue to grow. This thought process led many momentum investors to pile into the stock and drove the price to an all-time high of $320 on June 2nd.  Since that point, a weak market and overvaluation have combined to drop the stock to the current price of $141.40.The drop in price has resulted in a clearly defined channel that has held for over 4 months.  Currently, the channel shows MA trading between $130-150 over the coming weeks with a downward bias that should result in a new low.  At current levels, MA is approaching the top of the channel and offers an excellent time to initiate a short position with a clear technical pattern.While I do not like jumping on trades that have moved this far in a short period of time, MA is unique.  The fact that the channel has persisted during multiple market rallies provides comfort.  Further, a well received earnings report two weeks ago pushed the price over $170 before resuming the downtrend.  Also, this latest failed rally was the third lower high since late September (9/19 - $225, 10/14 - $174, 11/4 - $170.  Lower highs are characteristic of falling markets and lead me to think MA may retest the October 27th low of $126.35.Combining these observations, MA offers unique attributes in today's market.  It faces economic headwinds that will restrain business growth, trades in a clearly defined downward channel and has been showing technical weakness with a series of lower highs.  Therefore, I view it as an ideal short sale candidate.  If the general market continues lower, we profit.  If the technical pattern holds, we profit.  Given the uncertainty in this market, I welcome the opportunity to trade with clear patterns and defined fundamentals."

Firm says they are keeping their Buy rating on the stock, as they believe the stock is still a safe haven for long-term oriented investors given tremendous pricing power, massive discretionary cost controls that should enable MA to achieve firm's Street-high EPS, and a strong balance sheet that MA should use to aggressively buy back stock. Yet, even these considerations may not be enough to overcome what could likely be near-term multiple compression in the wake of American Express' warning, coupled with increasingly negative sentiment in the broader market. The higher uncertainty within this turbulent market means that investors will be unlikely to pay the same premium they paid just a few months ago.

The eight dollar pull back in the price of oil looks to have at least set its price to trade between the $100 and $110 mark. This is only speculation as a new trading pattern has not established itself. If we were to listen to many of the energy experts, as with T. Boone Pickens, the $100 bottom is almost here. With that said, it should stimulate some growth in the US stock market as the dollar should strengthen somewhat and although there is a global slowdown, generally speaking US stocks should see upside going forward. It is even much more bearish for oil since this happened during hurricane season.One of the best stocks in the stock universe is MasterCard (NYSE:MA). I made a call on MA on theupdown.com six months ago and have seen a pop of 25.71%. I like the stock here as it has seen a sell-off since its highs of $320 a share.MA has been trading for only approximately two years and has seen unbelievable growth. If we look at the basic reasons for growth with in the company, we see that there has been growth in all the key areas. Net revenue and income, gross dollar volume, and most importantly the number of processed transactions.Naysayers will tell you that slowing global growth will adversely affect this stock, but it is still above overall trends, and technology will add to growth in the long term. Since they make their money off of processed transactions, they are not affected by the credit default environment. They also receive growth from an ever increasing middle class. As the world's middle class gets larger they have even more customers, plus people are using less cash and checks, which leads to more credit card transactions. More customers are paying via the internet and this is another space for growth. One of the biggest reasons I like MA is that, similar to Visa (NYSE:V), they are so firmly entrenched in their industry. They have a unified global structure, technology based processing platform and strong relationships. This has allowed them to become a world player and be the first to many locations. Over 50% of their revenues are from outside the US.To understand the actual size of the growth in this area, we must first disect the possibility for growth. If we are to use the United State's as an example we would first look at what the statistics are. The GDP per capita is $46,000, inflation is 3%, unemployment is 5.2%, with a population of 303 million and an average age of 36.7 years (these are approximates as per the CIA World Fact Book and US Census Bureau and may be somewhat out of date).Looking at Asia Pacific Middle East and Africa there are large areas of growth. Of this group, the areas of high income are Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia. When clumped together they have a GDP per capita of $29800, inflation at 1.8%, unemployment 3.6%, population of 232 million, and median age of 38.6 years. The upside to this group of countries is the high income, giving the population plenty of money to spend, and growth through changing the customers into cards as opposed to checking accounts and cash. They also have a much better economy with low unemployment and inflation. Their population together is a little over two-thirds that of the United States and MasterCard is growing usage.Within this division, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia have GDP per capita of $3,560, inflation is 3.4%, unemployment is 5.2%, the population is 406 million, and median age is 27.2 years. These countries also have a reasonable inflationary rate, especially when you consider the growth in these regions. The clumped populations are larger than that of the US by over a 100 million. Also they have a very young age of population, which would make them much more excepting of change with regards to how they spend their money.The biggest story is within the emerging economies. These countries comprise of China and India. They have an average GDP per capita of $1800. Inflation is 5.8%. Unemployment is at 5.9%. Their combined population is 2.445 billion. Average age is 29.1. These statistics are mind boggling. With a population eight times that of the United States, the increase in card users could be large. Even though they make less money, MasterCard charges per transaction so the amounts are not as critical. Unemployment is only seven tenths higher than the US and that is with their much larger population. MasterCard also has growth from their technologies. Europe is a good example of how they are expanding. Currently, Europe has 18 different national debit schemes. What this means is that each country has done their own credit/debit style systems. This has created a lack of continuity as each system only works with their individual cards. If a tourist from another country goes to Europe, they are unable to use their card. Also, if a European travels from country to country, some countries have only one provider and this lack of competition has limited expansion of cardholders as it is easier to carry cash.MasterCard has implemented a system that has allowed for growth in this region. SEPA allows a cardholder to travel from country to country with access to debit funds. Will increase competition and thus provide for expansion of cardholders. It will lower costs for customers, and lower barriers to have cards. SEPA is already 3% of cross border transactions in Europe. It also is 97% of domestic transactions currently that did not have competition before SEPA was implemented. They are looking to expand even more in Europe by co-branding with other domestic banks. 13 countries, including 100 banks, that have 70 million cards are currently changing to the SEPA system, which will add to the current 150 million card holders that have already switched. With respect to growth in the US, debit transactions have grown 27% on average, per year since 2002. Now 90% of US households have a debit card linking them to funds at their bank. Each of these debit cards averages 17 transactions per month. If we look at the time frame between 2006-2011, debit purchase volume is estimated to increase 74.7%. PIN usage has increased as point of sale purchases using this have increased 53% in 2007. Last year there was an increase in debit purchase volume by 24%. ATM transactions increased 19% in 2007. From 2005 to 2007, annual growth rate was 36% for debit purchase volume. Over this same period transaction volume had a compound annual growth rate of 38%. For those that believe that MasterCard's growth will slow, there are plenty of reasons to remain bullish. In 2006, global consumer payments totaled 2.9 trillion. Of this, cash was 2.662 trillion. Checks accounted for 79 billion. Electronic cards and EFT were 148 billion. Of cards and EFT, the US accounted for 57% and the rest of the world 43%. By 2010, estimates have electronic payments increasing to 279 billion with the rest of the world's share at 68%. This has the CAGR for the US increasing 9%, and 22% for the rest of the world. This equates to a global CAGR of 17%. Worldwide, 2003 had a gross dollar volume at 1.248 trillion in local currency. In 2007, that number increased to 2.277 trillion.Gross transactions have also increased dramatically over the same time period. In 2003, transactions globally were 15 billion and in 2007 than number was 27 billion. Looking at MA's projections, they see annual net revenue growth of 12%-15%, annual operating margin to increase by 3%-5%, and annual net income growth of 20%-30%. MA's growth remains intact and it remains a good stock going forward. Remember, this is not a credit story but a technology evolution that MA is spearheading. Look for MA to continue moving up.Disclosure: None"

[Bookkeeping: Reducing 2 Names] However, this went under the ""better safe than sorry"" category since this was the type of stock that got ripped the minute they open their mouth, but the other part of better safe than sorry is you miss out on some gains.Mastercard once again proved their worth and remains one of the few financials which in my book deserve to actually go up, instead of going up only because ""The Fed will Fix Everything"" thinking.Again my thesis, which I seem to be in the minority of,is that a strapped US consumer will in fact turn more to credit cards to get through the day to day. People have argued that the US consumer will just retrench totally so Mastercard (and VISA will get hurt). I believe each and every week more and more gasoline, grocery, etc type of purchases are going on cards as people fall further and further behind cost of living. I also think things that they used to do direct withdrawal such as electric and home heating bill, will be moved from ""pull from checking"" to ""pull from my credit card"". That said, perception is reality and I was worried perception of slowing US consumer would bring down this stock. Last, people forget this is truly an international play and as I have written in the past, many parts of this world are still mostly cash based societies so we have many years of ""conversion"" in those countries as we ""Americanize them"" and turn them into credit card drunk consumers. (just like us!) So I am happy I am correct on the call in this company, but unhappy I am not participating much in this move, considering I dropped 70% of my position in the last week. All you doom and gloomers got to me... Again, I got boxed out by the ""fear of dark shadows around every corner"" on this name - I admit; it stinks to see a formerly large position run without you. But you can't have everything (risk and safety) at the same time. Once the market returns to normalcy, this is a name I see back in the top tier of positions. Now I have to hope for a general market sell off to bring down Mastercard and continued drum beat of fears that have kept this name down the past month, to give me a better entry point.

This is the sixth consecutive quarter MA has topped estimates. Behind Visa, MasterCard is the second leading credit card processor. The distinction of processor is important since MasterCard, and Visa alike, earns profits from charging customers transaction related fees. MasterCard has not suffered the same fate as banks and financial institutions because it is not so exposed to rising defaults among customers, nor is it accruing millions in loan loss reserves. We would still be buyers of the stock despite the large move today as the U.S. economy, despite being slower, is expected to avoid a recession, and coupled with strong international gross dollar volume growth, the future looks strong for MA.   The first level of resistance for shares of MA is at $210.00; if the stock can break through there, it has room to move to $220.00 and then set a new all-time high above $227. On the downside, if $210.00 can not be broken, it has room to fall back to $200.00 and then $170.00.

While the proximate cause of the Firm's more aggressive view is the Company's higher long-term EPS growth guidance issued at last week's investor day, it is some of the more nascent growth opportunities cited and the discussion of relatively strong non-US volume growth which augment the Firm's confidence. SunTrust is raising its price target from $350 to $390 and is again moving 2008 and 2009 EPS estimates to the Street high. New 2008 and 2009 EPS estimates are $8.94 and $12.17 respectively, compared with prior 2008 and 2009 EPS estimates of $8.68 and $11.08. MasterCard seems ideally positioned to continue capitalizing on the global secular shift to electronic payments. While SunTrust believes this is well understood, the power of this growth driver is only now coming into focus as the Company enjoys above-trendline volume growth despite deceleration in the US, its largest single market. The Firm is also encouraged by management's goal of 300-500 basis points of annual operating margin improvement. It is its opinion that MasterCard will outperform this target over the next few years as it scales its processing infrastructure and rationalizes is operating expenses. Even longer term operating leverage of this magnitude suggests sustainable EPS growth of at least 20%, making MA one of the best growth names in the Firm's universe. Notablecalls: SunTrust is pretty much the axe regarding both MA and Visa (NYSE:V). They have been ahead of the pack for quite some time and it seems they are doing it again. With the stock technically so strong, I would expect ample upside today. Be early and be aggressive. I feel for the shorts. Truly do. MA has been a short buster lately.

(NYSE:MA) must drop the fees it charges stores for cross-border credit card purchases within six months or face fines of 3.5% of daily global turnover, the European Commission ruled Wednesday.  MasterCard Inc.'s 40-year-old transaction fee was declared illegal by EU regulators, but MasterCard wasn't fined for the breach because it informed the EU about the transaction fee. According to the Commission, the charges are incompatible with EU antitrust rules. Repeal of these fees would result in consumers relying more on cash, MasterCard said. Some 45% of European payment cards are MasterCard or Maestro logo. MasterCard Europe believes that it has strong grounds to support its decision to appeal. Forcing drastic reductions in interchange fees across Europe could delay implementation of SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area), as well as reduce incentives for payment institutions to expand into new domestic European payments markets.

Operating expenses climbed 16% to $730M, due to a 26% rise (to $264M) in advertising and marketing expenses, while general and administrative costs increased 10% to $433M due to personnel hirings and incentive accruals. MasterCard said its Board has approved an incremental $750 million Class A repurchase program. Shares of MasterCard lost 0.1% to $157.15 on Tuesday."
56719,20454,2007-12-10T02:30:29-05:00,,"Morgan Stanley was out Friday morning with a curious note on Mastercard (NYSE:MA), saying they think MA could enjoy flat to up pricing year-over-year, fueled by Visa raising prices (in connection with its IPO) and MA's strong competitive position. However, when speaking to the investment community, MA continues to maintain its position that pricing should gently fall over time. 
Partially driven by such favorable pricing, as well as a strong international growth outlook and potential for decelerating expense growth, the firm sees a favorable risk-reward on MA and maintains Overweight rating.
Notablecalls: Hmm, is this enough to push MA towards, say $210? Sure. Note that 9 out of 10 banks MSCO spoke with haven't noticed a price increase from Visa or MasterCard over the last year, even though both companies have been raising prices. 
Rather bizarre, in a positive way."
52324,20051,2007-11-01T05:00:10-04:00,,"MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is a global payment solutions company that provides a variety of services in support of the credit, debit and related payment programs of nearly 25,000 financial institutions. Through the Company's three-tiered business model as franchisor, processor and advisor, it develops and markets payment solutions, process payment transactions, and provide consulting services to its customers and merchants. The Company manages a family of payment card brands, including MasterCard, MasterCard Electronic, Maestro and Cirrus, which it licenses to its customers. MasterCard's general purpose card brands include MasterCard, Visa, American Express, JCB, Diners Club and Discover. MasterCard generates revenues from the fees that it charges its customers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related services (operations fees), and by assessing its customers based on the dollar volume of activity on the cards that carry its brands (assessments).FUNDAMENTALS:   Plastic payment providers such as Mastercard are a virtual money tree in that they make money on every transaction out there, with very little change in the margins. It's not a perfect world though. Lawsuits from large merchants are a constant threat to the profit machine, as Mastercard saw in 2003 when it lost 2.90/share after large settlement costs. However, since then the company has been able to avoid large legal costs and returned to profitability in 2004 with earnings of 1.76 share which rose 34% in '05 to 2.35/share, 45% in '06 to 3.41 and is expected to rise another 46% here in '07 (but those estimates need to be revised - looks like earnings will end up being closer to 55 - 60% higher over '06 when it's all said and done). So there you have it. Three years in a row of accelerating earnings growth and over the past year revenue growth has been picking up. With net margins (19%) and ROE (28%) spiking over the past year this is clearly a company hitting on all cylinders.  TECHNICAL: Mastercard was certainly the headliner yesterday with a 20% surge out of a cup with handle base to new all time highs. It's too bad it couldn't breakout like this AFTER the Fed announcement because I decided not to initiate any new entries so may have missed out on a good entry point in what will be a great core holding in any portfolio. That's OK.. nothing wrong with staying disciplined. If you didn't catch this one at the open and are waiting for an entry like I am, I'd look to start nibbling at 185 or lower with a small position and then add to a long term position along the way. Full Disclosure/Disclaimer: The stock of the day is by no means a buy recommendation. Please do your own research and make a personal decision based on your own tolerance for risk. I currently do not own a position in Mastercard."

However, I am still not a big fan of its valuation. A PEG of 1.88 is still a bit rich. Regarding valuation: Yahoo Finance sees about a 16.5% growth for the next five years. I think that is too low. I would use 20%, which brings the PEG to about 1.59. Still a bit rich, but more reasonable. With the use of plastic gaining momentum, this may not be a bad time to make an initial entry. If you want to be a bottom fisher, then I would wait for around 130 to 140, as there is support around those levels, and valuation would be much more reasonable in relation to the growth for the use of plastic verse cash (the one thing I really noticed when I was in Iceland a few weeks ago was the tremendous use of credit cards verse cash). Seeing how horrible the market is as of late I would not blame anyone for waiting. MA also reports on Wednesday, and if the numbers do not justify the previous run, MA may take a hit due to its premium valuation."
36322,20530,2007-05-23T14:42:06-04:00,,"Echo To All submits:   Monday, on Mad Money, Jim Cramer was pushing MasterCard (NYSE:MA), saying that at these levels it is still a good investment.  Basically his premise was that it will most likely see a short squeeze, and go up.  (And I am sitting on my couch wondering how he can say this with a straight face.)  A short squeeze does not make for a good investment.
MA is a great company, and there is no denying the importance of the service it provides.  With the use of cash decreasing and the use of plastic increasing, MA has a great business model. However, they have a of PEG 1.64.  That is pretty pricey.  MA is experiencing great momentum and valuation has nothing to do with momentum, but supply and demand do. 
Visa will become public soon, and I am sure the Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) spin off of Discover will also hit the market sooner rather than later.  With Visa and Discovery going public, the supply for stock in a credit card processing company will increase, forcing the current overpriced existing credit card processing companies to decline.  If I am not mistaken, one of Cramer’s rules is to be weary of an increase supply.
The only existing public credit card companies are MA and American Express (NYSE:AXP).  Both are experience great performance but one is grossly overpriced due to an existing short squeeze while the other one is relatively pricey for a large cap.
So while a pop in MA may most certainly happen due to a squeeze, this is a trade not an investment - but if you have the risk tolerance for such a trade, by all means, play it.
(For the record, I love the business of these companies.  If I had to choose between MA and AXP I would choose AXP. Iin fact I am waiting for a proper entry point to play AXP.)"
46804,20856,2007-09-10T09:10:00-04:00,,"When looking for opportunity in this market, I have been concentrating on stocks with a significant amount of optimism surrounding the story, and names that could be damaged by a weakening global economy.  While many companies in the financial industry stand to suffer from a lack of liquidity and tightening lending standards, most of these names have already experienced multiple contraction and the stock price may already reflect the detrimental conditions. MasterCard (NYSE:MA) is a company who’s investors do not appear to have surrendered their optimistic outlook. The stock is still trading over 30 times 2007 earnings and over 20 times expected 2008 earnings. The premium stems from excitement over the fact that the company has been able to continually beat expectations and has delivered stunning growth over the past three years. While the stock has only been public for a little over a year, the company has been active and growing for quite some time and has become a giant in the transaction processing business. Analysts appear to be in relative agreement when looking at the company’s future, expecting growth of roughly 15% over the next 3 to 5 years. One of the primary differences between MA and many other financial companies is that the firm does not have any credit risk (similar to First Marblehead (NYSE:FMD)). Banks issue the credit or debit cards to the consumers and those banks take the risk as to whether the consumers will be able to pay off the balance for their purchases. MA simply clears each transaction and receives a payment per transaction to offer its processing services. There is some speculation that a slowdown in consumer spending may not be such a big deal for the company as consumers will likely maintain a similar rate of transactions with each transaction simply representing small dollar amounts. While it is true the company does not have risk of consumers not paying, tighter lending standards will make it much more difficult for consumers to receive new cards and that will likely slow transaction growth. This dynamic is significantly different than during the last recession when the Fed made interest rates and liquidity extremely favorable towards the American consumer. MasterCard receives roughly half of its revenue from domestic transactions and is likely to see most of its growth through international expansion. China will likely provide a significant amount of additional incremental revenue during the next 18 months as the Olympic rush drives growth in this high profile area of the world. However, this phenomenon is likely priced into the shares and any disappointment in this area will likely severely dampen the excitement surrounding the stock. After 2008, it is unclear what catalyst will drive further growth and the global economy is not likely to continue the rapid pace of growth seen in recent years. In summary, I believe the risks in this name far outweigh the potential return. Even though the stock has pulled back 20% from their high, I believe a significant multiple contraction will drive prices lower. In accordance with this view, I have a short position in the stock and anticipate holding it unless significant evidence convinces me that the overall economy is in better state than originally believed.

It is their opinion that the Street continues anticipating a deceleration in transaction and revenue growth which is not in the offing. The company benefits from secular shift from cash to electronic payments at the point of sale, exposure to strong cross-border travel trends, proliferation of new payment modalities and the emergence of burgeoning international economies with little historical electronic payments volume. SunTrust argues that MasterCard is moving into ""harvest"" mode in the US. The domestic market, which will comprise nearly 50% of the company's 2007 GDV, is relatively mature. As a result, they believe the company will re-direct its advertising spend toward rapidly-growing emerging markets, which should require lower absolute expenditures. This is one factor suggesting potentially greater-than-expected operating leverage and EPS upside. Notablecalls: Looks like SunTrust EPS numbers are the new Street high.

Both August and November had positive earnings surprises that helped goose to the stock to a forward p/e of 23 according to First Call estimates. I might be early, but I've ridden this profit rocket long enough and am ready to look for better values. Prospects for continued earnings surprises? Well, Mastercard is in a business that should be competitive but is not. The big three (four, if you include Discover Card owned by Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)) have managed to keep vendor fees very high. It's amazing that they have been able to do so as they are in an information and telecom processing business. Every other information processing business has suffered margin compression. Good for them to be able to continue sticking it to retailers and keep fees high (and by proxy, their customers), but at some point this will become an endangered margin and then, watch out. I would rather bet on companies where technology expands margins rather than hope that oligopolistic behavior in the face of telecommunications advances and the internet may endanger margins.

For those who don't know the basic background, Mastercard was a member-owned association that focused on payment processing and franchising its credit and debit card brands and, later, related consulting projects. In the 1990s, it began converting to a more independent share-based business, though still owned by the same banks, and this year it took a stride toward further independence by IPO'ing the majority of the voting shares. Mastercard was the dominant US card for many years, but is now a distant second to Visa in the US and in most other markets. If you look at market share and spending around the world, in most places you'll see Mastercard or its affiliates with about half the market share of Visa and you'll see Mastercard spending about half as much as Visa on building their market. It's been a nice, tidy system for a while that has allowed these companies -- both of which are very lean and consist primarily of brand names and computer networks -- to prosper. Visa remains a private concern, though there has been talk since the MA IPO of Visa doing the same. Here's what I like about Mastercard:  Here's what makes me nervous, and has kept me from buying shares so far: I really like the credit card business in general, but the antitrust issues make me a little nervous. I haven't yet reconciled that concern with the phenomenal growth that their market is seeing as the cashless society grows, but I am looking seriously at an investment in Mastercard or in American Express (NYSE:AXP) or one of the big credit card issuers like Capital One (NYSE:COF) (or possible Citigroup (NYSE:C) or Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) ).

What hasn't been covered, though, are the seismic, industry-specific risks the company faces over the long term. We hope you brought your notebooks and pencils: it's class time. Besides the piles and piles of lawsuits that await the credit card behemoth, there is another risk to Mastercard's growth outlook over the long term: its own customers, namely banks and financial institutions (for the sake of discussion, Mastercard's ""buyers""). They've been consolidating at breakneck speed and will continue to consolidate. When buyers merge, someone's bound to lose out.    It's Michael Porter all over again: In his seminal book Competitive Strategy, Porter clearly states that as firms join hands and get bigger, they begin to wield more muscle against others in the value chain. Buyers have higher bargaining power when a market is characterized by a few large buyers and many suppliers. Buyers also wield power through what's called the backward integration threat, which is the threat that a buyer will swallow a producing agent. Citigroup (NYSE:C) can snap up a credit card company in one second; it's highly unlikely, however, for a credit card company to eat a bank. As more buyers concentrate to gain market share, the worse off Mastercard will be. Certainly, Mastercard enjoys a wide moat and it is not competeing against many other credit card companies, but the possibility of banks ""setting the price"" and killing the margins of credit card issuers remains. What this means for Mastercard is that its margins will compress as more and more financial institutions decide to tie the knot. Banks will use their size to seek the best deal, all to the detriment of Mastercard's business model. Don't get us wrong, though. Mastercard over the next 6 months is a compelling buy. There are still dozens of funds waiting in line to buy the stock, as well as throngs of analysts waiting to initiate coverage. Long term, however, we think you're better off spending your money on that coveted Angelina Jolie photo you saw on eBay."

On Thursday shares opened at $40.30 and then soared another $6 to close at $46 each. That trading action is quite baffling if you ask me. Usually where the IPO is priced tells you how strong demand is, and subsequently, how well the stock will do upon opening for trading. The $39 pricing indicated to me that the smart money wasn't very enthusiastic about the deal. Then less than 24 hours later the stock is fetching $46. If demand was that strong, they easily could have priced it within the proposed range. The conclusion I draw from this is that the smart institutional money wasn't sold on the price, but retail interest after the stock opened was strong. Following the retail crowd is rarely a good strategy, so I will put more weight into the $39 pricing than the $46 first day closing price. The stock's valuation also supports the cautious view. Mastercard earned about $2 per share in 2005, so the P/E is north of 20x, very high for a financial services company."

Company: A huge ($2.5B) IPO. Will they be a Spectacular Story? It's hard to say, since on the one hand their products have been around for a long time (no big excitement), but on the other hand they have great name recognition. 
Turning to their latest prospectus, we were surprised. We expected them to be Solid, but they are not. 
They suffered from the loss of a lawsuit in 2003 and as a result had non-recurring payments between 2003 and 2005. We'll back those charges out, but all their other costs, for an old line company, are operational. So in this case, operating income is Net Income without the lawsuit charge. The surprise is just how inconsistent that has been. From 2001-2005 their FY operating income has varied Y/Y by -18%, 224%, -31% and 31% ($116M/$142M, $378M/$116M, $260M/$378M, $342M/$260M). For Q1 2006 they had Y/Y operating income growth of 36% ($127M/$93.2M). 
They've been operating income profitable for every year from 2001-2005, but for 2006 will their operating income increase, decrease, or stay the same? We don't know, as their growth is not predictable. Blah, except for the name recognition.
Stock: MA is a very big offering, with good name recognition, and is likely to be properly valued. With the trailing 2005 operating earnings of $342M, and what they figure to be about 100M ($267M earnings/$2.67EPS) shares outstanding, that gives a trailing operating EPS of $3.42. They are shooting for a target price of $43/share, which would give them a trailing operating P/E of 13 ($43/$3.42). 
That could probably expand a bit in the marketplace, so there may be some upside, but we expected MA to be a possible long term buy-and-hold candidate, which is it is not. They are just as likely to shrink in 2007 as they are to grow. We'll probably pass.
That means that of the three big offerings in the pipeline (BurgerKing, Vonage, and MasterCard), all of which have increased their offering size during or prior to their roadshow (from $400M to $500M, $250M to $530M, and $2.45B to $2.84B, respectively), we find none of them compelling, either due to truly atrocious finances (Vonage), a private-equity unsustainable quick flip (Burger King), or being an unpredictable behemoth (MasterCard).

Highlights from the first day of trading: Initial reactions from the marketplace were disappointing. If you GoogleNews 'Vonage IPO', the 425 (at last count) related items contain a wealth of opinion from endless sources from disgruntled employees to industry and sell-side analysts. Try to find a novel thought post MasterCard's debut and you'll be hard-pressed. While there are 490 related links on GoogleNews, they all quote the same three people: Ryan Batchelor from Morningstar, David Menlow of IPO Financial and company CEO Robert Selander. Blogsearching is even more useless. Doesn't anyone else have an opinion following yesterday's first day of trading? If you do, please leave a comment below. Ryan Batchelor, Morningstar (via WSJ): ""MasterCard is a way to ride the tidal wave of growth in consumers' use of plastic. The more swipes made with that MasterCard card, the more money MasterCard makes."" Batchelor has an $80 target on the stock. David Menlow, IPOFinancial.com (via Bloomberg): ""It was already inferred that the stock was coming at a cheaper level than it should have...I'm not at all deterred by what happened with the small setback that we got over the last couple of days. The IPO market is still in good shape.'' MA's First Day of Trading"

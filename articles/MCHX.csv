It is experiencing headwinds as it transforms itself into an analytics company on the back of a declining legacy business.A few years ago, its CEO left and it had to lay off 10% of staff, but it is slowly climbing out of the ditch:Data by YChartsOne has to keep in mind that the revenue growth originates from the two acquisitions at the end of last year with Callcap producing roughly $9M in revenues last year and Telmetrics in the same order, but at least these haven't led to a deterioration in GAAP operational performance.The company is now in the process of transforming itself into a big data AI company (Q2CC):The company started reorienting its business away from its legacy Marchex Search Analytics, which allows marketers to drive phone calls from search campaigns and attributes inbound phone calls made directly from paid search ads and landing pages to a keyword.Instead of generating calls, its business is shifting to analytics in analyzing the calls for relevant data, for instance with Marchex Omnichannel Analytics Cloud, which helps marketers connect customer conversions driven from paid media channels, including search, display and video, social and sites, to phone calls made to a business. Its product offerings include:The NEXTms platform is the former Callcap, which the company acquired last year. The analytics products constitute roughly half the revenue and enjoy higher gross margins.The company isn't without significant partners, like Facebook (FB), supplying its clients its Marchex Omnichannel Analytics Cloud Platform, which is integrated on Facebook for the benefit of its customers.The reorientation towards analytics has gotten a new boost the past 12 months with the development of new products based partly on acquisitions:The Sales Edge (in its three versions) was released only in early August this year and is built on the Conversational AI platform. From the PR:It is built on the Conversational AI platform, which (Q2CC):How effective is this? We don't really know, but in principle, this could give useful information. Apart from its effectiveness, like so many AI applications, it is built on an increasing return business model.The company is leveraging its treasure trove of 1B minutes of conversational data, which is the ""raw material"" from which machine learning derives useful algorithms.If these are indeed useful, more customers will put them into practice, producing more ""raw material,"" which sharpens the algorithms, a potentially virtuous cycle.And alternative uses might also suggest themselves, like the Sales Edge Rescue platform already indicates (Q2CC):In fact, of the above three suites, it was the first to be released (in April), and it's already field tested with customer trials which can ""potentially be additive to our growth profile as we move into next year,"" according to management on the Q2CC. There is a list of features of Edge Rescue in the PR. It can even be tailored for specific verticals (and indeed, why not?)The three variants of Sales Edge do not yet generate revenue, but there are promising signs, according to management.SA contributor Donovan Jones wrote about the Telmetrics and Callcap acquisitions; both are bolstering the analytical capabilities of Marchex.We can calculate the revenue these companies generated from the 10-Q, providing the pro-forma results of operations of the company as if the acquisitions of Telmetrics and Callcap had taken place on January 1, 2018 (10-Q):If we compare these to the actual results ($20.2M in Q2 and $21.9M) of $42.1M, we get that the acquisitions produced $9.8M in the first two quarters of 2018, so in the order of $20M a year or $5M a quarter.From the 10-Q:The Q2 revenue of $26.3M is actually quite promising, as this is $6.1M more than Q2 last year, which is a pretty strong indication that its analytics business is growing nicely already, given that:Indeed, when management was asked about this during the CC, it answered (Q2CC, our emphasis):Management also said that analytics was not yet break-even, but that it had good hopes this would be achieved through growth and leverage in the ""intermediate and potentially even earlier term"" (Q2CC).For Q3:The revenue guidance seems a little soft to us, given that last year's Q3 revenue was $22M and didn't include the acquisitions.MarginsData by YChartsWith the shift towards analytics, gross margins are trending upwards while GAAP operational margins have declined a bit, but that's acquisition related.Data by YChartsAfter difficult years, cash flows have moved into the black, and given that the company has ample cash ($45.2M) and no debt on its balance sheet, it has plenty of time to rig its product and engineer a revival in its fortunes.Data by YChartsAnalysts expect an EPS loss of $0.20 this year, falling to -$0.11 next year.SA Contributor Zac Thompson argues that Marchex model is unsustainable, but we struggle to see on what that is based. In fact, we are inclined to argue the exact opposite, given that the company produces positive free cash flow and has no debt.That is, the company has both plenty of time and as well as resources to grow its analytics business, and there are some signs this is already happening with validation coming from the likes of Facebook and a large automotive company gained as a customer in Q1.What's more, there were indications in Q2 that not all of its revenue growth is from acquisitions and therefore its first-generation analytics products are already growing nicely.However, Q3 guidance is quite low, and unless this will be the result of a significant decline in its legacy business, it could alter that positive picture of growing analytics business.The company's balance sheet and cash flow would enable it to make a couple of acquisitions of the size of the last ones, provided there are good opportunities.It's too early to tell how its second generation of analytics products will fare in the market, but investors have time to find out as the shares are really quite reasonably priced without revenue from these. If these product gain traction, the upside could be significant and most of the development costs have already been incurred."
4276552,102937,2019-07-22T19:12:45-04:00,"Marchex stock tanked in 2014, declining further over the next 5 years, and has only recently started to recover due to heavy investment initiatives.
        In order to rejuvenate the company, upper management has embarked on expensive investment projects in an effort to breathe new life into the company and its products.
        These capital expenses have drained the company of its liquid assets, will not pay off, and the company will return to its 2014-2018 slump.
        Marchex misunderstands consumer trends, and its strategic focus will compound already unsustainable losses.","Marchex does not generate profits on their products and services, and it has a long history of reporting losses, with only occasional quarters showing positive signs. Recognizing this problem, Marchex has incurred significant debt to both bridge the operating revenue deficit, as well as to invest in new innovations and strategic initiatives which they hope will turn things around. The reality however is that Marchex will continue seeing declining revenues, only now they will witness dramatic increases of expenses due to their new initiatives. Investors should actively avoid this company, if not initiate a long-term short position as the company heads towards probable bankruptcy.Marchex, Inc. (NASDAQ: MCHX) is an analytics company dealing with mobile advertising. The company focuses primarily on providing business-to-business products and services to other companies that rely on consumer phone calls to make sales. Its products serve as AI catalysts through media outlets that help businesses acquire new customers over the phone, while also connecting them through popular search engines and other media channels. It also provides advertising solutions for small businesses by selling call advertising products as well as search marketing and other lead generating avenues. Marchex gathers data on text / voice communications between consumers and business to develop and enhance their AI products, then markets those products as a way for business to maximize their advertising investment returns by helping them acquire more customers over the phone and through the internet. Below is a brief summary of their main products, as detailed in their last annual report:Marchex Call Analytics - an analytics platform for enterprises that depend on inbound phone calls to drive sales, appointments and reservations. Marketers can use this platform to understand which marketing channels, advertisements, search keywords, or other digital marketing advertising formats are driving calls to their business, allowing them to optimize their advertising expenditures across media channels. Marchex Call Marketplace - a mobile advertising network for businesses that depend on inbound phone calls to drive sales. This service offers advertisers the ability to deliver calls to their businesses via ad placements across various mobile and online media channels. It leverages analytics for tracking, reporting and optimization. Advertisers are charged on a pay-per-call or cost per action basis. Marchex Speech Analytics - a product that can enable actionable insights for enterprise, mid-sized and small businesses, helping them understand what is happening on inbound calls from consumers to their business. Marchex Speech Analytics leverages our proprietary and patent pending speech recognition technology. Marchex Speech Analytics incorporates machine and deep learning algorithms and AI-powered conversation analysis functionality that can give customers strategic, real-time visibility into company performance in customer interactions.Local Leads - a full service advertising solution for small business re-sellers, such as Yellow Pages providers and vertical marketing service providers, to sell call advertising, search marketing and other lead generation products through their existing sales channels to their small business advertisers. There are a few smaller products and services offered by Marchex, but the above represent their bread and butter. The center piece of Marchex's business model revolves around customers calling businesses in pursuit of purchasing goods or services. Upper management at Marchex believes that consumers contacting businesses do so with high purchase intent, as evident by the results of a Forrester Consulting research study in 2017 which concludes that customers that call businesses both spend more and have a higher retention rate than customers that contact businesses through other means, or through customers that were contacted by the business directly through solicitation. With the rise of the smart phone, Marchex has focused its efforts on mobile communications. The mobile advertisement marketing has been rising steadily over the years, and Marchex believes that advertisers will continue utilizing performance based formats on mobile devices as they did on desktop and laptop computers prior to the smart phone taking off. Additionally, Marchex anticipates that the demand for businesses to connect customers over the phone will result in calls and texts becoming the main standard for mobile advertising. As advertisers shift their budgetary considerations to accommodate for the growth of mobile channels, Marchex believes the market for analytics will grow as well.One key component driving Marchex's business designs is the idea that telemarketing, telecommunications, and the internet interface are all inherently different, and attempting to compare traffic data from one to the other is like trying to compare apples to oranges. Unlike internet-based marketing with impressions and behavior tracked and measured in digital format, calls and texts take place offline and demand unique technical capabilities and expertise to accurately asses. To realize the benefit of call and text marketing, advertisers need technology that will allow them to capture and understand the characteristics of a call and text before, during, and after contact with business is made. This technology in turn will enhance the return on investment in their marketing efforts, or so Marchex believes. Marchex has strategically placed itself and deployed its capital resources to supply mobile analytics products to advertisers and businesses based on the belief that we are currently undergoing a marketplace revolution with the marriage of the internet to the cell phone. Though they are not necessarily incorrect in this view, Marchex has misunderstood the extent to which mobile marketing has altered consumer behavior, and they have overestimated the importance of their own products. With the ability to carry computers in our pockets, business and consumer transactions is increasingly taking place on-the-go rather than behind a desktop at home or in the office, but the transition is not occurring as fast as Marchex believes it is, and they have recently unleashed a deluge of capital investment in product development and analytics initiatives that are not necessarily ahead of their time, per se, but will not realize a profitable return, simply because the demand for their products are not as high as they forecast, which is due primarily to their misunderstanding of consumer and business trends.Mobile search and calls from mobile search are growing. Marchex understands this and has built its products around this key trend. What they fail to consider is that mobile marketing will not increase indefinitely, nor will it even hold the same growth rates that have inspired Marchex's recent capital investments. In early 2015, internet usage from mobile devices stood at roughly 31%. Increasing dramatically over the next two years, internet access from mobile devices accounted for more than half of all internet usage by late 2017, a significant increase in such a short time frame. Indeed, people were using the internet more on their phones than on computers at home, but the rate at which people accessed internet on their phones versus the computer plateaued in 2018, the same year that Marchex shoved their chips to the center of the table believing the rate would continue upward. Surprisingly, the trend has even started to reverse in late 2018 / early 2019, with less people accessing the internet on their phones. It is unknown whether or not the trend will now shift more towards people accessing the internet on their computers or return to the growth trends of people accessing internet on their phones going forward, but one thing is certain: it is absolutely critical for Marchex that the trend reverts back once again to people using the internet more on their phones than on their computers, though even then it is unlikely that Marchex's products will fulfill the demand they have anticipated. The below illustrates the trend of internet users on their phones versus computers:source: statistica.com 2019 studyMarchex has taken the importance of mobile internet usage for granted, but that is where they have focused their competitive efforts. Over the last few years, Marchex has shifted its focus to address what they perceive to be a large opportunity to help businesses accelerate sales through improving interactions with consumers over the phone and through text communications, indicating that they believe mobile phones and mobile internet access will increasingly dominate our business and consumer decisions, even though research has shown that this trend is slowing down. Even though consumer mobile usage has grown significantly over the last decade, Marchex is trying to connect dots that may no longer be there by providing services that tailor online marketing efforts to increase the likelihood that consumers will contact businesses via phone and text. Its primary product, the call analytics technology, is specifically designed to help conquer the challenges created by trying to bridge the gap between digital marketing and successful sales-resulting phone calls. Despite the consumer trends, Marchex has stated to shareholders that it will continue innovating on its analytics technology by expanding and investing in AI, speech analytics, data science, and machine learning technology, all of which are designed to facilitate phone-based business to consumer sales. Marchex will also continue expanding its range of communication channels analytics by developing new AI-based speech and conversational products, call tracking and monitoring products, and mobile display ad impression measurement products. All of these initiatives require consumers to increasingly rely on mobile internet usage as well as mobile business contacts. Worse yet, Marchex has stated their intent to continue pursuing merger and acquisition opportunities despite the fact that they are over-leveraged and cash strapped. 2018 was a big year for takeovers. They acquired Telmetrics, Inc. for call and text tracking, and they acquired SITA Laboratories, Inc. for additional call monitoring synergies. They also acquired Callcap, another leading call monitor company. These acquisitions came with a hefty price tag, and the potential returns are uncertain given the nature of consumer behavior in relation to the reliance on such behavior by Marchex's business model and the motive behind these acquisitions. By year end 2018, Marchex had an accumulated deficit of $252 million. The company has for the most part realized net losses on an annual basis, and it anticipates that this will continue into the future as costs mount, strategic initiatives expand, and acquisitions continue. Marchex hopes that it can attract more advertises with its products by hiring additional personnel and increasing focus on sales, but it must first actually demonstrate that its products can yield positive returns for the businesses and advertisers that buy them. If the company cannot generate new revenue growth opportunities and manage its own expenses, it will continue suffering losses and may never reach a state of profitability. source: TD AmeritradeAdditionally, Marchex faces an enormous threat of the loss of its existing customers. A relatively small number of distribution partners account for the bulk of Marchex's product distribution. The loss of one or more of these would hasten Marchex's demise, and may prove terminal in its own right. More than half of the company's revenue is derived from 5 key business partners, with a larger number of smaller partners making up the remaining half. One company, Dex YP, is Marchex's largest customer and accounts for nearly a quarter of all revenue. It is worth noting that DexYP, a privately held company, is operating under a loss as well:source: DexYP annual statement 2018Due to how much of Marchex's revenue is derived from such a small number of players, the company's counter-parties enjoy substantial negotiating leverage against Marchex. The company's clients have such substantial purchasing power over Marchex that they can usually dictate terms of the business arrangement and then reassess them annually. These terms could include steep product discounts, adding costly features to the products, and penalties for failure to adhere to either.Going forward, Marchex will need to find new customers to pitch their products to, and given the shift in consumer behavior away from the stated purpose of those products, such a feat is becoming increasingly unlikely. If the mobile advertising market develops more slowly than Marchex anticipates, or declines all together, Marchex will suffer catastrophic harm and will incur significant losses. Studies have shown that the mobile advertising market is not evolving in the same patterns as Marchex anticipated when they began their series of acquisitions and product innovations, indicating that a significant portion of Marchex's already diluted investment portfolio will not yield positive returns, an almost always fatal combination for a company that does not realize profits. Furthermore, Marchex relies heavily upon gathering large quantities of consumer phone numbers through its partnered marketing firms in order to test its products and create quantifiable metrics. If guidelines laid out by the Federal Communications Commission should change and make it more difficult for companies like Marchex to operate, the impact on those companies' business operations will be severe. Given how leveraged Marchex is in an evolving market that isn't going their way, it stands to reason that the future is dim. Marchex will continue to lose money in the future, and any number of catalysts could hasten their demise, while the catalysts that could turn things around are few and unlikely to occur. Marchex needs more business partners to use their products, an entire consumer behavior market tendency to shift in another direction, the continuation of certain factors in an ever-changing environment, and a way to reduce expenses relative to its strained revenue stream. The cards are stacked against Marchex, and an investment at this point after the stock has enjoyed a 7 month run-up would be questionable at best."

We are making this week's edition available to all readers. To find out more about PRO+, please click here.By Dan StringerOne subset of small and microcap companies consists of true operating companies that are generating revenues and/or cashflow. The opportunity usually comes from the fact that these companies have simply not yet gotten on analysts' or institutional investors' radars. Often these companies do not need to raise money on a regular basis, so there is no incentive for institutions to provide coverage. Sometimes these companies are overlooked because their businesses are not headline-grabbing or glamorous.Going back in time, early in 2015 I highlighted Photon Control Inc. (OTC:POCEF) after the company had posted nice growth and grown a very sizable cash balance to offer a margin of safety. Photon's business is designing, developing and distributing various optical sensors to several different industries. The company was posting ever increasing revenues and margins while retaining its cash flow, but the market hadn't discovered it yet. The company was trading at an EV to Earnings of just over 6x with its EV to EBITDA well below that. This was similar to private company multiples because the company was small, under-covered (it is Canadian-listed and headquartered) and in a relatively boring industry. As the company continued to execute, the market began to revalue the stock and recognize that these products were part of the Internet of Things megatrend.Data by YChartsIt clearly took some time, but eventually the business gained appreciation from investors with shares up 300% from that point. The subsequent sell-off took place after the company became more dependent on the very cyclical semi-conductor industry after a couple of management team changes. This week I am highlighting several opportunities in operating companies that have similar potential to re-rate with strong underlying businesses.Author Jim Zimmerman highlights OTCQX:IEHC, a small cap manufacturer of specialized printed circuit board connectors and interconnects. The company has been in business for 78 years and has only one major competitor, making it a very sticky business. The valuation is very low at just 6.5x EV/EBITDA which gives a lot of potential for the company to re-rate.The company is unique in that it has just 2.4m shares outstanding, which is why its share price is optically high ($22+) but its market cap is just about $50m. This makes it somewhat illiquid with a very small float of shares outstanding. The Offerman family owns 40% of the shares, making them a very invested owner. The company did a small special dividend last year of $0.25 but based on the author's view there seems to be a lot of potential to increase this. I could see this continuing as a means of compensating shareholders, though likely not as a regular dividend. The company's customer list is very strong. It is hard to find companies like this, so I could see a re-rating occurring, especially if the company makes a move with its cash balance, either via acquisition or in increasing its shareholder yield. Investors should watch what the company does with its cash balance, especially if it continues to post strong earnings and cash generation.Marchex (MCHX) is nowhere near as clean an opportunity as IEHC is. The company is in the process of transitioning between a legacy search analytics business it is running off and transitioning to its higher growth call analytics business, which it has augmented with two recent acquisitions. Author Shareholders Unite posits that although its earnings metrics may not be there yet, the company is generating positive cash flow and its margins are steadily increasing, reflecting a good takeup by the business. This is difficult to determine when looking at the results on the surface, as the two businesses largely offset each other, which has been the case at MCHX.I tend to agree with the author that the company is likely through the worst of its operations, having incurred integration costs with the acquisitions as well as handling the spool up of its new business. Shares have been in a strong downtrend though, and I would like to see some stabilization there. The market is likely looking for positive earnings to go with the increased sales levels. Many companies are now getting punished if sales growth is not bringing the commensurate profit growth that should come with scaled up operations. In my opinion, it is a little early to get involved but is worth monitoring as the company could easily return to substantial profitability without the market realizing it yet due to its recent lagging performance. Small caps can be punished for longer due to the lack of coverage and public analysis available.Mining stocks are certainly an acquired taste for many investors. I like the space as it gives a lot of potential for asymmetric upside returns, from exploration to development to production. GoGold (OTCQX:GLGDF) is substantially less risky than most as it has a profitable producing mine at Parral that, combined with the cash the company has on its books, appears to have value in excess of the current market capitalization.I agree with the author that this margin of safety separates GoGold from most other miners. They recently acquired an additional property Los Ricos that has historical gold findings that will help guide the company's exploration. With good finances, GoGold should be able to avoid a lot of dilution as it can fund its exploration through its operating business. These drill results can be potential catalysts to re-rate the Los Ricos portion of the business, while GoGold can also potentially re-rate if gold and silver prices continue their uptrend. I like that GoGold gives a lot of downside protection given its cash flow, which could improve results as well. Investors do need to watch the cost per ounce metric; if these start to creep up, either through inflation or operational issues, it could impact the base performance level. Like most small and microcaps, earnings will be the focus in the near term as it will take some time for the Los Ricos drill program to start generating results.Author Andriy Blokhin gives a very detailed breakdown of Natural Grocers (NGVC) in this Top Idea. It is positioned in the growing organic food market, which is only gathering steam as people's eating habits get healthier. The company has been rapidly expanding its footprint but has been slowing the pace in recent years. Blokhin is correct in that much of the cost of expansion has already been reflected in the company's business (like with Marchex), so reducing the pace of expansion should lead to improving operating results, which appear to have borne out in recent years. The company trades at a cheaper valuation than that of its other competitors but if it can improve its margins with fewer growth initiatives, it could end up being a real bargain.I tend to agree with the author here; the due diligence supporting his case is very thorough and doesn't rely on the acquisition potential as a prime driver. Management seems to be really on the ball with how it is managing the company and if it can improve the operations even more, there is a potential that earnings could propel a re-rating of the company to be in line with its peers. It will be worth watching company margins, which should improve with less ramp up costs; if these don't improve, it could be a concern for investors hoping to benefit from an earnings bump combined with a multiple expansion.All these companies are focused on improving their operations, in industries that are largely not ""buzz-worthy."" Their focus on improving the core business, rather than growing sales or expanding for the sake of it, will help to stabilize and improve their earnings profile. In the small cap space, eventually investors reward this behavior, though it can take time.Please give these authors a follow and if you have any comments for me, please don't hesitate to leave them here or send me a DM.

4355483,23806,2020-06-24T17:32:57-04:00,MCHX's $25 million enterprise value is less than its past two years' product development investments.MCHX is viewed as technological leader in its space.Net cash represents 60% of its market cap and it's been FCF positive in the past two years.Covid-19 slowdown does not detract from long-term investment thesis in conversational analytics space.,"Marchex Inc. (ticker MCHX) is in the final innings of transitioning its business from a pay-for-leads online marketplace model to a conversational analytics company. It is now the leading company in the emerging call analytics industry having grown organically and through acquisitions. While roughly half of the company’s revenue is in its steadily declining legacy marketplace business, our focus is exclusively on its conversational analytics software platform. According to eMarketer research, we are now spending more time on our mobile devices than in front of our TVs. We increasingly push a call button on our mobile phones to initiate some type of potential purchase.From the company’s 10K: “Marchex Speech Analytics includes customizable dashboards and visual analytics to make it easier for marketers, salespeople and call center teams to realize actionable insights across a growing amount of call data. According to a February 2018 MarketsandMarkets report, the speech analytics market is expected to grow from $941 million in 2017 to $2.2 billion by 2022.”The company’s current market cap is roughly $70 million. It has $44 million of cash on its balance sheet (and no debt), leaving an enterprise value of roughly $25 million, an absurd valuation given the company’s IP, customer list, long-term secular trends and industry M&A. MCHX has spent $35 million in product development over the past two years alone to enhance the capabilities of its conversational analytics platform. Net equity is 75% of total assets, further underscoring a capital structure unencumbered by liabilities. What are the odds that the company isn’t worth the past two years’ product development expenditures? Quite low in our opinion, thus providing free upside optionality.MCHX is a controlled company. Insiders control 75% of its voting shares through their 100% ownership in the company’s 4.7 million A shares. Combined with their 3.2 million B shares ownership, insiders own a healthy 17% of the company’s economic interest. We believe co-CEOs Russell Horowitz and Michael Arends are highly capable, dedicated and motivated leaders. Mr. Arends spoke at a Roumell Asset Management investor conference in 2017 when we were previously invested in the company.Shares outstanding at March 31, 2020:The Pivot from Marketplace to Conversational AnalyticsThree years ago, one of the nation’s largest tire service manufacturers/service brands, we believe Firestone/Bridgestone (FBS), tested out MCHX’s analytics software in fifty of its roughly 2,200 stores. MCHX’s cost-of-goods lies in purchasing a large volume of phone numbers from carriers, which are then embedded into the customer’s advertisements. MCHX’s 70% gross margin is an industry leading margin because of its size; it can onboard acquisitions and immediately increase profitability because of its purchasing power with carriers. We estimate that competitors (which are all privately held) have 60% gross margins.In addition to allowing customers to measure the efficacy of its various ads (which advertisements – both on and offline - are generating the most phone calls and ultimately sales), it allows the company to increasingly drill down in more granular ways. MCHX’s R&D spend is in developing tools, increasingly powered by A.I., to determine lost sales opportunities. Brands like FBS receive millions of incoming telephone calls each year. Imagine being able to determine which keywords are the most predictive for completing a sale? Imagine those special keywords (whatever they might be for that business) occur on a call in which a sale is not consummated? In this instance, MCHX’s software provides an “alert” to the FBS sales manager tagging this call as a high probability sale if it’s followed up with a second call, offering the right tire or substitute tire.Incoming calls are the lifeblood to a business like FBS. If MCHX can measure the efficacy of its ads, reduce dropped calls, fine tune sales messaging and provide real-time alerts to lost but hot leads, FBS wins big given the impact of moving the needle on such large call volumes. In fact, MCHX is providing analysis of telephone calls in much the same way online software tools seek to drive engagement and ultimately sales. After a six-month pilot, FBS rolled out MCHX’s software to 100% of its stores across North America. The home office can view call activity on a daily basis, focusing on specific regions all the way down to the individual store level. It’s basically a “numbers and minutes” business; customers are charged per phone number and per minute of telephone time.However, MCHX is increasingly becoming much more than a “numbers and minutes” business. It is moving into deep analytics with the ability to rescue sales by giving clients the ability to act on what are deemed “lost opportunity” calls, resulting in emerging pricing models. In 2019, the company began to introduce quantitatively new and innovative products reaping the dividends of a multi-year R&D program. For instance, Sales Edge, introduced last year, ”…incorporates artificial intelligence-based functionality within the product suite that can help enable businesses to understand customer conversations in phone calls and via text, in real-time and at scale, and can help enable businesses to learn how to optimize the sales process in order to take the right actions to win more business. These solutions can arm businesses with the data-driven intelligence they need to deliver on-demand and personalized customer experiences.”Going forward, MCHX will be experimenting with a variety of ways to monetize its data offerings. For example, a client may want to simply pay for certain keywords, like “tires” or “brakes”. The company possesses a tremendous amount of real-time data. How the company optimizes the monetization of its data is not altogether clear. We believe the talent exists inside the company to figure it out. To be clear, MCHX does not license outside A.I. software; it has developed its own in-house IP (its ultimate “anchor” asset) and now owns 30 patents and growing.Unfortunately, after a major, and successful, push into the automotive industry, that industry shut-down as a result of Covid-19. MCHX secured a large contract with GM after a long and extensive bake-off a year ago. In this case, Marchex is sole conversational analytics software platform for the OEM’s sales channel and is also recommending it to its dealer body. To be clear, GM is now making MCHX’s software available to its dealers, but cannot require them to sign up. GM is known for being among the most tech-savvy of auto companies, so its selection of MCHX for its dealerships is noteworthy. The GM contract is not exclusive; MCHX has a dedicated sales team exclusively focused on expanding its presence in the auto industry.To appreciate how cheap MCHX’s market valuation is, in our view, one only has to look at its net cash and the sum of its recent acquisitions (within the past 18 months) as compared to its current market capitalization:You could discount the company’s recent acquisitions by 50%, plus its net cash, and you would equal its market cap. Looked at another way, the company spent $35 million on product development in 2018 and 2019 versus a current enterprise value of roughly $25 million. In other words, MCHX’s business is effectively being valued at zero. Thus, the investment thesis, at its current price, is that the company’s leading conversational analytics technology platform, and 1,300 plus customer relationships, are not worthless. Pretty straightforward and simple.The Sonar acquisition is worth highlighting. Sonar, a messaging/sms-based software platform, provides the ability to track, analyze and engage consumers in a preferred communication channel. Texting is the fastest-growing method of communicating with customers, in certain industry verticals. For example, a car salesperson often moves the sales conversation to texting using his/her personal smartphone, and as a result goes “dark” to the dealership. If the sale doesn’t materialize, and the salesperson moves to another dealership, he/she effectively “owns” the sales lead and the dealership has lost a lead. This is a significant pain point in the industry and a key weakness of many of the Auto-focused CRMs. MCHX is now uniquely providing conversational and texting analytics and consumer engagement solutions to its primary verticals enabling the customer to maintain ownership and control over both the phone and texting environments, two of the primary means consumers engage with businesses via mobile phones. We understand that Sonar is having a materially positive impact on the company’s number of use cases and will likely be a key driver of the company’s growing product suite.Opus Research Report on Conversational Commerce and Call Analytics In its April 2020 industry report, Opus Research (founded in 1986) evaluated eleven solution providers who are “…starting to define an emerging opportunity called Conversational Intelligence. They offer tools, services and platforms to help transform raw transcripts or call recordings into a source of insights and business intelligence to inform marketing, customer support, product development and operational decisions.”The report states, “Businesses have stepped up investment in technologies that improve the conversations they carry on with both prospects and customers. They are successfully leveraging their investment in speech and text analytics, natural language processing and machine learning in order to extract meaning and recognize the intent of each individual.”The eleven companies analyzed are rated on four factors:MCHX is the highest rated company in the report. The company was judged to have the widest breadth of conversational analytic capabilities. The next highest rated company, privately-held Invoca, with an estimated $50 million in revenue and also possessing an enviable client list, did a capital raise in December 2019. The estimated Invoca pre-money valuation of $225 million compares to MCHX’s current enterprise value of $25 million (with TTM revenue of $105 million; $52 million in 2019 analytics revenue). You read that correctly. The average 2020 conversational analytics revenue estimate (two sell-side firms cover MCHX), is $44 million. Invoca Raises $56M to Help Marketers Turn Conversational Insights into RevenueOpus’s research report describes MCHX’s key differentiating attributes:Key Differentiators:• Advanced AI models and signals built on a large-scale conversational data set of 1+ billion minutes of consumer-to-business conversations processed annually.

John Roswech was hired as Chief Revenue Officer in December 2019. John was previously Executive Vice President of Criteo Brand Solutions for Criteo SA, which had previously purchased HookLogic, where he served as the Chief Revenue Officer. In March 2020, the company hired Ryan Polley as Chief Product and Strategy Officer. Prior to joining Marchex, he was most recently Chief Product Officer at Kargo, a mobile technology and advertising company. Ryan previously served as Senior Vice President of Product Management and Strategy at Rubicon Project. We believe these hires signal that company’s key R&D investments are ready for prime time.Why is MCHX’s stock so cheap? Covid-19 dramatically reduced the number of billable minutes among the company’s customers, particularly in automotive, health care and hospitality verticals. Second, the company recently did not make the cut for inclusion in the Russell 2000 index and, therefore, we believe an estimated 3 million shares needed to be sold from index-tracking funds. Third, it’s a controlled company. Edenbrook Capital, LLC owns 19% of the company and has been a persistent accumulator of the stock over the past several months.Call minutes will return as businesses dependent on telephone calls are opened up. What is unmistakably clear, however, is that MCHX’s value proposition is growing, despite current revenue headwinds. The company will surely burn cash during this business slowdown; perhaps net cash bottoms at $30 to $35 million. We believe the company will manage its op-ex prudently during this period. Our view is underscored by the fact that the company has generated cash during the past two years despite heightened product development expenses. MCHX generated roughly $5 million of operating cash in each of the past two years and $3.5 million of free cash flow, also in each of the past two years.Handicapping 2020 results is very difficult, providing the opportunity to exploit a mispriced software platform, in our opinion. The two Street reports (dated May 2020) indicate an average Adjusted EBITDA of negative $8.5 million for 2020 and revenue of $88 million (split evenly between call analytics and marketplace business lines). Our thesis is not dependent on trying to estimate 2020 results.MCHX’s reported customer concentration (YP accounts for 28% of revenue) is somewhat misleading in that it is the result of its legacy, and steadily declining, marketplace business, which we find uninteresting. Our focus is exclusively on MCHX’s analytics business, where the company has invested heavily, and represents future value.SummaryFurther underscoring MCHX’s compelling valuation is the recent acquisition of fast-growing Voci Technologies for $59 million, or an estimated 6x revenue. Medallia acquires voice-to-text specialist Voci Technologies for $59MMCHX trades at less than 1x its call analytics revenue and as indicated earlier, is the market leader, according to Opus’s recent 50-page plus industry report.With a cash-rich balance sheet, cutting-edge technology in a growing software space, significant inside ownership and a strong owner/operator mentality, MCHX is significantly undervalued with little downside from current levels, in our opinion.One final note. We believe MCHX’s board and management are serious about creating shareholder value. The company could instantly unlock value by collapsing its A & B shares, thereby eliminating the sizable control discount. While we do not believe such a change is currently on the table, we believe MCHX well understands this option and that it will be considered, among other value-enhancing strategies, in order to unlock shareholder value. Most importantly, we believe that the conversational analytics space is increasingly “hot” (despite the setback created by the coronavirus’ effect on telephone call volumes) given long-term secular tailwinds per the capabilities AI is introducing into the space. We expect M & A in the sector to pick-up in the intermediate term. Importantly, we believe founder Russell Horwitz (Executive Chairman, CEO) and Mike Arends (CFO and Office of the CEO) are exceptionally capable individuals possessing a clear sense of their mission to maximize shareholder value.In his May 12, 2020 report, Northland’s Mike Lattimore summarized MCHX’s prospects, underscoring our view that the company is priced to a worst-case scenario providing optionality to anything scenario exceeding “worst-case”.Upside: Call analytics grows 50%+ organically and garners a 10x revenue multiple while rest of business is stable. Stock reaches $18 then.Downside: Marchex loses a large customer and call analytics growth is under 10% while burning cash.Stock trades in $1-$2 range.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

(NASDAQ:MCHX) was founded in 2003 and is headquartered in Seattle, Washington. Marchex operates two business lines. Marchex Search Analytics is the company’s legacy business (often referred to as its marketplace business). It provides a product for search marketers that drive phone calls from search campaigns, as well as attributes inbound phone calls made directly from paid search ads and landing pages to a keyword.The company’s primary focus is on its second business line - emerging mobile advertising analytics software products. Its products include Marchex Call Analytics, an analytics technology platform that provides data and insights to measure the performance of mobile, online, and offline advertising for advertisers and small business resellers, and Omnichannel Analytics Cloud, which provides marketers the ability to quickly see which media channels are driving high-value phone calls so they invest in the right media. In short, the company’s legacy marketplace business was helping customers generate phone calls while its analytics business is helping them better understand the origin and quality of their phone calls.Investment Thesis: MCHX is a technology company with a rapidly declining marketplace business that is offset by an emerging analytics/measurement business to track offline activity generated by online advertising. There are many industries still dependent on phone call traffic, particularly ones with long tail annuity-like customer income streams, i.e. insurance, cable companies, etc. It is our understanding that the company’s call analytics business provides the largest suite of products and is the best platform in the marketplace.Moreover, we believe the company is highly focused on managing its legacy business decline and even considering a possible sale of this division. The company is focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and has publicly indicated its expectation to be EBITDA break-even by the end of the second quarter.The company’s current market capitalization less its cash (100% domiciled in the US), leaves an enterprise value of less than one year’s product development expenditures (and making it a rare ""net-net""). These expenditures, roughly $90 million in total over the past three years, have been almost exclusively associated with building out and developing its analytics products. Additionally, the company’s cash burn rate is small.The Math:43 million shares (5 million A shares and 38 million B shares)Price: $2.63Market Capitalization: $113 million2017 Estimated Year-End Cash: $95 million (Assumes 2x the cash burn rate of 2016 of $5 million)Enterprise Value (EV): $18 millionProduct Development Expenditures to Build New Call Analytics/Measurement Tools:How MCHX makes money. MCHX makes money – in both its marketplace and analytics businesses – on a per call basis. There are internal discussions to test out a subscription model. The company notes that “Today, mobile is primarily what we do.”Supporting evidence that the company’s emerging analytics/measurement tools are worth substantially more than the embedded $18 million EV in our view:Why it’s Cheap?"
2507325,52922,2014-09-20T10:50:59-04:00,"The short thesis has played out at Marchex, with the equity declining ~66% since July.Re-cut of the Allstate pricing has served as the catalyst, supporting the notion that Marchex's offerings are non-differentiated.Marchex price action reflects the perils of investing in businesses with significant customer and vendor concentration.","On September 18th, 2014, Marchex Inc. (NASDAQ:MCHX) (""Marchex"", ""MCHX"", or the ""Company"") released an 8K, which subsequently resulted in a decline in the equity value of ~45% for the day, or ~66% since the short was originally recommended this past July. Although the business is most likely worth no more than its net working capital of roughly ~$100MM, I believe it is prudent to take a majority of gains off the table.The 8K noted a reduction in FY14E call-driven revenues, and importantly, the wind-down of its third-largest customer Allstate (NYSE:ALL), which comprised roughly ~13% of revenues. Allstate sought to transition to a fixed-fee model versus the current variable rate. The Allstate account was consistently touted as a prime example of MCHX's transition and strong product offering, yet we believe today's price action by the market is more than warranted, as the Allstate decision highlights and supports three key points of the short thesis:One item which I did not put enough importance on was the actual potential of a re-cut of the Allstate deal, which I originally thought was a lower-probability outcome. Nonetheless, when you operate a business with significant customer concentration, slim margins and that trades at a lofty multiple, it is no surprise to see such violent swings in the equity value (and key drivers we look for in short sale opportunities).Generally speaking, whenever a company's equity value is halved in one day, it is the value investor's gut reaction to take a glance. Although I think it is prudent to take short gains off the table, I do not believe a long position in MCHX today is warranted, given the poor quality of the business and the management team's reputation. This is a particular issue when it comes to the issuance of equity/dilution of shareholders and the value destruction from the numerous strategy shifts over the years (yet, I would be interested in the business at a valuation at or near net working capital). The situation in Marchex reminds me of a recent quote from Charlie Munger at the Daily Journal (NASDAQ:DJCO) Annual Meeting, ""Back in 2000, venture-capital funds raised $100 billion and put it into Internet startups - $100 billion! They would have been better off taking at least $50 billion of it, putting it into bushel baskets and lighting it on fire with an acetylene torch."" To conclude, the situation at Marchex has played out eerily similar to the quote above.For reference, the original short thesis is as follows (updated comments in bold):"
4220458,101421,2018-11-09T12:51:38-05:00,"Marchex has acquired Telmetrics for up to $13.6 million in cash and RSUs.Telmetrics provides enterprises with a real-time call and SMS/text tracking and analytics system.For MCHX, the deal promises to bolster their conversation analytics offering, which is showing enticing growth prospects.","Marchex (MCHX) announced it has acquired Telmetrics for up to $13.6 million in cash and RSUs.Telmetrics operates as an enterprise call and SMS/text tracking and analytics company.MCHX is gaining additional enterprise offerings that are complementary with its existing call analytics solutions as well as exposure to new customer verticals.If management can take advantage of the new capabilities to further bolster its offerings in the conversation analytics space, the deal may be a significant growth driver in 2019.Mississauga, Ontario-based Telmetrics was founded in 1990 to enable, track and analyze consumer interactions to increase engagement and return on advertising spend.Management is headed by CEO Andrew Osmak, who has been with the firm since 2016 and was previously Managing Partner at Leverage Capital.Below is an overview video of the company’s platform:(Source:Telmetrics)Telmetrics’ primary offerings include:Major customers include DexYP, National Bank of Canada, Autotrader, Yelp, and Web.com.According to a market research report by Markets and Markets, the global contact center analytics market was valued at $710 million in 2017 and is projected to reach $1.5 billion by 2022.This represents a strong CAGR of 15.9% between 2018 and 2022.The main driver for this expected growth is the high demand for better customer experience management solutions.The customer experience management segment is expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period.Major vendors that provide call center analytics include:Marchex disclosed the acquisition price and terms as $10.1 million in upfront cash, potential payments of up to $3 million based on the achievement of certain revenue and OIBA (Operating Income Before Amortization) targets over the two 12-month periods following the close, and $0.5 million in RSUs and options to certain employees of Telmetrics.MCHX said it expects Telmetrics to ‘contribute $1.25 million in core analytics revenue,’ in the partial fourth quarter. For 2019, management believes the acquisition will be accretive on a non-GAAP basis.A review of the firm’s most recent quarterly results indicates that its revenues were flat, but core analytics revenues, which are relevant to the Telmetrics deal, were up 8% sequentially.Management is seeing ‘favorable trends...from the early adoption by large brands of our conversation analytics solutions. We’re seeing favorable results from customers utilizing solutions built off of our proprietary speech technology. Given the growth and margin profile as well as the stickiness of these products, we plan to increasingly optimize resources to support our areas of greatest growth potential.’ [Italics mine]As Marchex Executive Director Russell Horowitz stated in the deal announcement,In the past 12 months, MCHX’ stock price has dropped 8.1% vs. the S&P 500 Index increase of 4%, as the chart below indicates:(Source:Seeking Alpha)Marchex acquired Telmetrics for its enterprise call/text tracking and analytics capabilities.It’s ‘Smart Number’ service is used by enterprises to collect and analyze SMS/text conversations with their customers in real-time.Telmetrics has customers in the vertical categories of auto, digital agencies, local aggregators, and online directories.So, the deal for Telmetrics increases Marchex’ footprint in these new customer verticals, enabling increasing cross-selling opportunities.Since announcing the deal, MCHX stock is up 5.7% on increased volume, so it appears investors like the deal in addition to the recent upward trend of the stock.If management can quickly integrate Telmetrics’ technology into its offering and continue to innovate, especially around its conversation analytics offerings, the combined deal may be a significant growth driver for MCHX in 2019."
2748365,29301,2014-12-12T06:30:00-05:00,"The loss of its largest customer in September has crushed MCHX shares; down nearly 70% from its July peak.A depressed valuation, cash-rich balance sheet, share repurchases and a 2%+ dividend yield should limit downside from here.Plenty of upside when management demonstrates that the business, ex-Allstate, is adding customers and is returning to growth.","After briefly passing $12 per share in July 2014, MCHX shares have crumbled nearly 70% due to the abrupt loss of its largest customer, Allstate. Management credibility has also suffered considerable damage that isn't likely to be easily repaired. While investors wonder whether the loss of a 30% customer is truly an isolated fiasco - as management claims - or the start of something worse, the implied valuation of the core call advertising business at the current MCHX share price is so undemanding, investor sentiment so bad and expectations so low that even modest evidence that the core business is intact and progressing could produce a sizable stock price recovery over the next 12 months.The customer loss was painful and jarring, especially since the perception among investors until then - supported by management and the company's financial performance in the first half of 2014 - was that the Marchex call advertising platform was maturing into a valuable service with reliable, recurring revenue and strong customer retention characteristics. Neither was management's explanation of the episode terribly satisfying; that the customer demanded a fixed fee arrangement with downside risk for Marchex to the prevailing performance-based metric that is more prevalent in the digital world. Management indicates that no existing customer has a similarly structured agreement.Further, the impact of the mess was especially rude for those investors who purchased 6.2 million shares (including some unloaded by management) in an underwritten follow-on offering at $10.50 per share in early April. Less than six months later, the company lost nearly half of its value in a single day. Thus it seems likely that few who bought on the deal still hold the stock, suggesting a whole new crop of investors will need to be cultivated for the stock to revisit prior levels.Yet amid the wreckage, we think significant value remains and that patient investors will be rewarded. The call advertising business is moving beyond its obscure niche, is well suited to a world increasingly oriented to the smartphone and Marchex's tens of millions of dollars of investment in the platform provides a competitive and first-mover advantage.At $3.80 per share and using 42 million shares, MCHX has a market cap of $160 million, which includes:That's right; you can buy a unique, profitable, $140 million top-line ad tech business (projected 2015 revenues) that is returning capital to shareholders and may become an acquisition target someday at an enterprise value of about $30 million.The uncertainty about what remains of the business post-Allstate is the primary drag on the stock, of course, and the company's agreement with its white label partner, yp.com, expires in mid-2015, representing another risk hurdle. But we arrive at $140 million of call advertising revenue by subtracting $50 million of presumed Allstate business from management's 2014 guidance of $168 million and adding 20% organic growth (it was closer to 30% in 2014). While the MCHX call advertising business is not the high-margin ad business of a Facebook or Google - partner payments consume 70 cents to 80 cents of every revenue dollar - it's a decent one nonetheless with a few dozen enterprise customers, a white label business for small, mostly local advertisers and a strong pipeline, according to recent management comments. Using the same 9% EBITDA margin that the business is expected to produce in 2014 - which may be a bit low due to the fact that Allstate was a lower margin customer - yields $13 million of 2015 EBITDA.Those numbers imply EV/Revenue and EV/EBITDA valuation multiples of 0.21x and 2.35x, respectively - cheap even by distressed ad tech standards. The low valuation combined with a 2%+ dividend yield and a recently announced share repurchase plan should provide a floor for the stock. We think MCHX shares are worth at least $5 today based purely on asset value (i.e., invested capital) and considerably higher when investors see evidence that the call advertising business is resuming its upward trajectory."

That strategy may work, but it needs a stable or growing stock price to continue to incentivize potential targets, otherwise, MCHX will need to pay for acquisitions with all-cash.The firm has only two covering analysts.

Highlights of the most recent quarter:When we originally wrote-up MCHX, we estimated that the company would burn $10 million in 2017; it now appears that the company will be FCF break-even this year and will begin generating cash next year. As a result of the company’s increased liquidity visibility, we expect some type of capital return as was alluded to on its call, i.e. a possible special dividend or stock buyback.Management is executing on its plan to cut costs, streamline its focus on analytics and results are coming in sooner than we expected. In its most recent quarter, the company was both operating cash flow positive and FCF positive. Of the 30 new clients recently announced, we believe the vast majority are analytic customers and include several “big names.”Investors should understand that MCHX does not compete with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) or Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) but in fact are lifted by each company’s growth in ad-spend. Every Fortune 5000 company works with an independent analytics tool to evaluate its spend and MCHX has the tools increasingly demanded by online advertising (and/or service calls) geared toward generating phone calls.For instance, MCHX is now providing an auto OEM with the ability to determine what percentage of its calls are service versus sales calls, something this company could not previously do. In speech recognition, MCHX’s solution is not a B to C technology competing with Siri or similar tools but rather is adopted specifically to solve particular enterprise customer demands. MCHX is integrated into both FB and Google’s platforms.On September 15th, we hosted Marchex’s Mike Arends (CFO and Office of the CEO) and Trevor Caldwell (VP Investor Relations and Strategic Initiatives) at our annual Investor Day where we discussed the company’s growing opportunity in call analytics software."
320102,21961,2012-01-17T16:44:47-05:00,,"Marchex (NASDAQ:MCHX) is an interesting company because it is well positioned in a nascent industry, which showed solid growth over the past few years. Marchex could experience explosive usage adoption as click to call spreads with the growth of smartphones. In addition, MCHX has a non capital intensive business model, which generates cash. Let's have a more precise look at the Marchex business and B class of common stock.Business Description and Current StatusMarchex delivers call- and click-based advertising products, analytical tools, and solutions to large advertisers and local businesses. The company operates with distribution partners and owns its own proprietary network of web sites. According to the most recent 10-Q filed November 2, 2011,  3rd-quarter 2011 revenue increased 64% year over year to $39.9 million from $24.2 million in the same period during 2010. Nine-month revenue in 2011 increased 55% to $107 million from $69.6 million in 2010. Operating profit for the three and nine month periods in 2011 increased to $2.5 million and $7 million from losses in 2010 of $.5 million and $4.7 million last year.All of the operating profit gains came from the sale of assets of $7 million over the nine months in 2011 and $2.5 million in the most recent quarter. The bottom line is operations are currently breakeven without asset sales to create profitability. Nine and three month net income for 2011 is .05 cents .03 cents per diluted B share.Looking at the composition of revenue between distribution partners and Marchex's own network, in the most recent quarter distribution partners make up 34,820/39.862 or 87% of total revenue. The partner network percentage increased from 74% in 2010 (17,999/24,194). In the nine-month period, the percentages were 91881/107703=85% in 2011, up from 49,894/69,590=71.69% in 2010. In both periods, proprietary network revenue declined. For the nine-month period in 2011, revenue dropped by 20% and 19% in the most recent quarter. Clearly, the company relies on its distribution partners for the vast majority of its revenue and growth, a trend that became more apparent as 2011 evolved and will most likely continue in the future.From a competitive standpoint, Marchex competes with larger search companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Yahoo (YHOO). According to a Comscore Media Metrix December 2010 Search Report, Google and Yahoo account for 67% and 16% of all online searches in the U.S. Marchex relies much more heavily on distribution partners for placement of call and click based advertising than these larger companies. A positive development in the most recent quarter was an announced agreement with CityGrid Media (formerly Citysearch) of IAC Interactive (NASDAQ:IAC), another very large network of users and advertisers.   Growth InitiativesHistorically, Marchex has used acquisitions as a way to help accelerate its growth. On April 7, 2011, the company acquired 100% of Jingle Networks, a mobile, voice, search, and advertising solutions provider. MCHX paid $59 million, which consists of $16.5 million in cash, $7.6 million in stock, and future payments of almost $35 million. The future consideration are divided into $17.6 million owed one year from the closing of the transaction and $18 million due 18 months after the purchase. As of the date of the addition, Jingle Networks had $11.4 million of revenue and $3.6 million of losses during the prior nine-month period ended 9/30/2011.Revenue in the United States accounted for 95% of total revenue in the most recent quarter. Canada provided the remaining 5% of total revenue. Marchex is currently expanding operations in the U.K. and Ireland.ValuationWith almost 36 million fully diluted B shares outstanding, with the current stock price of $5.10, the current market capitalization is $183.6 million. In the most recent nine months, operating cash flow totaled $13.1 million. If we divide this by three and come up with a yearly figure for operating cash flow, we get 13.1/3=4.36*4= 17.5 for yearly OCF. The valuation would come out to 183.6/17.5= 10.49 x OCF. If we use EV/EBITDA as our valuation basis, in the most recent earnings report, MCHX announced full year 2011 adjusted EBITDA would come in at close to $23 million. Total net cash on the balance sheet is $35 million so the calculations would be 183.6-35=145/23=6.46x EBITDA. However, MCHX owes $35 million for the balance of the Jingle purchase, so if we say the company uses its cash for the rest of the Jingle buy, the calculation looks like 183.6/23= 7.98 x EBITDA.Other ConsiderationsMarchex has $85 million of Goodwill on the balance sheet, with $50 million coming from the Jingle Networks acquisition. 2012 will be a year to test if the buy accelerates revenue, operating profit, cash flow, and net income growth. If not, at the end of 2012, the $50 million of goodwill will need to be examined for impairment and a possible write down.In addition, as of 9/30/2011, Marchex had a deferred tax asset of $46 million on the balance sheet, which it expects to realize. If it cannot use these assets, the company would have to adjust net income or shareholder equity in the period the determination is made.Of more importance is the issue of two classes of stock the company uses. There are 9.85 million Class A shares and almost 24 million Class B shares. The four founders of Marchex control 100% of all A shares, which have 25 votes per share. The class B shares have one vote per share. As a result, the founders control 91% of the combined voting power of all shares outstanding. Minority shareholders are completely dependent on these four individuals to make good strategic and operational decisions for the future benefit and growth of the company.The company does pay a small dividend, which is not supported by current operating income. The dividend has been paid from selling existing assets, typically domain names.Decision TimeMarchex has a business model that uses acquisitions to fuel growth in an industry experiencing increased adoption. It is dependent on growing its distribution network with large partners, which it has done a good job with. If an investor believes click to call and click-based advertising in the mobile space will continue to experience accelerating adoption rates over the next 5-10 years, Marchex represents and interesting possibility.Disclosure: I am long MCHX."

(NASDAQ:MCHX) (""Marchex,"" ""MCHX,"" or the ""Company"") with a 12-18 month price target of $6 per share (using bullish assumptions) versus its current price of ~$12. This would imply a 50% gain to the short with a reasonable valuation scenario pegs the equity value at ~$3 per share.This past April, it was mentioned in Greenlight Capital's Q1 letter the arrival of a second tech bubble, for which they implemented a ""bubble"" basket consisting of expensive tech/momentum stocks. Marchex is a prime example of a company that should belong in such a basket. Although the Company has been in existence for over 10 years, a couple of strategies/businesses later, Marchex and its Management team have positioned themselves well in taking advantage of the second tech bubble, as the stock is up over 100% in the past year with no material change to its underlying profitability.On March 26th, Marchex priced a secondary for 5.7MM shares, split evenly between the Company and selling shareholders/founders or $28MM in proceeds to the Company (8.5% increase in shares outstanding). After reviewing the Company's most recent prospectus and filings, it is evident that the Company is being misperceived by the market as a high-growth tech company, while in reality it is a low-margined advertiser, which competes against AND relies on Google, Microsoft and Yahoo. As of 07/08/2014, MCHX has a market capitalization of ~$520MM and enterprise value of ~$485MM.The thesis is predicated on the following attributes, which make the Company a highly attractive short at current prices:Bull thesis - The consensus bull thesis has been predicated on the following data points:Also note that the add-back of stock-based compensation ($10MM - $15MM per annum) is a key variance between the sell-side/bull projections and the short thesis. Unless analyzing the Company for the purposes of a debt investment, adding back large, recurring stock-based comp expense is asinine for equity investors, as although it is a non-cash expense, equity owners are gradually getting diluted.Company OverviewMarchex was founded in 2003 originally as a platform to roll-up companies that help facilitate business between online merchants and consumers. Starting out, the Company focused on cash flowing assets that specialized in paid online searches such as ah-ha.com and TrafficLeader, before shifting into the domain business. Today Marchex operates two distinct business lines, (1) call advertising business which it entered through the purchase of Voicestar; and (2) Archeo, its legacy domain business.The call advertising business offers three distinct offerings:The Company's legacy domain business generates revenue from (1) advertising sold for parked domains; and (2) the sale of domains. Marchex entered the domain business with the acquisition of Name Development Corp. in 2004 and accumulated over 100k domains for roughly $200MM. After attempting to spin-off the business a couple of years ago, today Marchex is essentially engaged in a slow liquidation of the business unit. The segment generates lumpy revenues, and at best we believe this asset would fetch between $50MM to $125MM in the private markets.Porter's Five Forces AnalysisScenario Valuation AnalysisBase CaseThe base case portrays a scenario of top line growth and EBITDA in-line with sell-side estimates. Below are the assumptions used in the base case scenario:Upside CaseThe upside case portrays an aggressive five-year plan for the Company, which is materially above sell-side estimates. Below are the assumptions used in the upside case scenario:Stress CaseThe stress case portrays a realistic case in which EBITDA margins do not expand and growth is slightly below sell-side estimates. Below are the assumptions used in the stress case scenario:Intrinsic ValuationFree Cash Flow to the Firm (""FCFF"") was one method used to determine the intrinsic value for all three cases. The Company's terminal value was calculated using both the perpetuity growth and EBITDA exit multiple methods, 3.0% and 13.0x, respectively, for the base case, 4.0% and 20.0x for the upside case, and 2.0% and 8.0x for the stress case. Note that these multiples and assumptions are highly optimistic, and realistically business value is most likely somewhere between the stress case and base case.Since Marchex consists of two separate businesses, it is appropriate to view back-test valuation through a Sum-Of-The-Parts methodology. For the call advertising segment, we assume MCHX can generate ~$10MM in EBITDA excluding stock compensation on a go-forward basis and we apply a range of estimated private market values to the Company's domain business. It is evident that the SOTP valuation also supports our DCF outputs, signaling significant downside exists. Please see the following:Catalysts to Value RealizationRisks & MitigantsConclusionAlthough the bull thesis worked well two years ago when the name could be purchased at a double digit FCF yield combined with an event, i.e. the spin-off of the domain business, which has since been cancelled. Today, the situation is vastly different as the current valuation offers investors no margin of safety in a highly competitive business with a poor financial profile.Please consult your financial, legal, and/or tax advisors before making any investment decisions.

Shares recently fell to a 3 year low after reporting results which missed expectations and issuing a disappointing outlook for the next quarter. Marchex owns a portfolio of over 200,000 domain names. This includes a large number of zip code domain names like 90210.com and domains with semantic or type in value like debts.com or newyorkdoctors.com. They were one of the earliest public companies to invest in domain names for the purpose of monetizing direct navigation traffic. In late 2004, they purchased a portfolio of over 100,000 domain names from Name Development Ltd. for $164.2 million. Initially, most of their domain names were populated with generic pay per click advertising landing pages. They have recently moved towards turning their locally targeted domain names into basic websites with local content. Is this the right move? There are three basic options for monetizing domain names: Marchex's most recent move seems like a half-hearted attempt at the third option. Their developed websites basically still seem generic since they all follow the same cookie-cutter format, and the content just seems like yellowpages.com information with some extra tweaks. At the end of the day, the websites don't bring anything unique to the table. By trying to come up with a monetization strategy for a huge batch of their domains at once, I think Marchex is overlooking a greater opportunity. In focusing on locally targeted domain names, they have basically devoted their efforts to creating websites for the long tail of their domain channel. [How many people type in 06483.com?] What they should be doing is focusing on their best domain names and trying to create individualized websites with unique value propositions and the potential for becoming popular destinations. In other words, instead of creating 100,000 bad websites, create 100 good websites. MCHX 1-year chart"

In addition to providing a great history of the company and its founder, the article also mentions Open List. This is the technology that Marchex uses to pull together relevant content from around the web to automatically seed 100,000 different websites. I had mentioned in an earlier post that the resulting websites don't seem all that useful.The article also brings forth a comparison of the profitability of a domain parking company and Marchex. Marchex's largest acquisition was for a portfolio of domain names that made $18 million a year of profit on $20 million of revenue. As a whole, Marchex recently made $220,000 profit on $134 million of revenue. If Marchex's development strategy does not start to yield incremental traffic and revenue, all they have done is created a domain name parking company with way too much overhead and a compromised revenue model.A recent article in Forbes on Demand Media, presents an interesting contrast and an alternate model for development. Demand Media recently raised an additional $100 million of financing at a $1 billion dollar valuation. The company has also acquired a huge portfolio of domain names. As opposed to Marchex's strategy of thinly developing thousands of websites at once, Demand Media has been focusing on a small group of 50 highly targeted websites. They have grown the sites by adding social networking elements and real content. Visitors to the sites find engaging information and have a reason to keep coming back. As long as they can successfully replicate this model across their domain portfolio, I think they've found the winning formula.   Disclosure: none"
36702,20404,2007-05-29T06:51:31-04:00,,"GoClick was acquired by Marchex (NASDAQ:MCHX) some time ago. Legend has it that GoClick’s founder was quite the customer service guy, but now being a part of a publicly traded search company with a market cap of $500M, Marchex has to make GoClick churn out more of everything: more clicks, more revenue, more profits. And apparently, more mindless PR drivel. That translates to more risk. GoClick was the one company I had spent the most online marketing dollars with, partially because they allowed me to come up with numerous keyword-based campaigns at low costs. As such, this was largely a seemingly low-risk turnkey solution. Or so I thought. At first, things seemed fine. Considering the 20 or so things I do at my company, I was not monitoring this daily, or weekly. Rather, once a month I’d check in. And when I did, I’d get a top-level view of things… That all changed in April 2007 when I unearthed GoClick’s major click fraud issue. There’s no need to hide that. I emailed GoClick and Marchex documented proof of it which led to a conversation with their VP of Advertiser Services Scott Greenberg, but ultimately their reaction was arrogant, followed by one month of inaction, which led me to write this post. The Jig is Up  By late April, 2007, Google had proven too rich for my blood, my low CPC tests with Mamma.com and AdOn were concluded and as such, the only source of paid clicks was GoClick. Unlike Mamma and AdOn - who would funnel all of their traffic through one URL, such as partners.mamma.com in Mamma’s case - GoClick was more transparent. Looking at Google Analytics, I saw that initially their traffic came from sources such as searchportal.information.com and landing.domainsponsor.com, but that progressively it included sites like myspace-junk.info. By the time you read this, myspace-junk.info is long gone into the annals of web history, which is fitting because these sites stink and the intermediaries that profit from them like GoClick - or their parent Marchex - are no better. Individually, sites like these did not send massive amounts of traffic, but cumulatively they did. According to my analysis using Google Analytics using a sample period, up to 40% of GoClick’s traffic came from such sites. [click to enlarge]      Not All Parked Domain Name Sites Are Created Equally   At first glance, you sort of think such a site is nothing more than a domain parked URL that people accidentally land on, but come on, it’s one thing to go to atorney.com (instead of attorney.com), but theadopt.info? Who types that? We’ve all heard about the billions dollar industry built on people’s inability to spell. It goes like this:  But, in my analysis/investigation. Something was off. Who mispells theadopt.info? From there, I cross-referenced about 20 or so of these websites and did a Whois to see exactly who the page belonged to and more importantly, how long it was up and running. What did that reveal? A perfect, typical example:  []    Marchex’s Eastern Europe Unit?  Turns out that most, if not all, of these websites were set up very recently in Eastern Europe. Some had disappeared, but others, like theadopt.info are alive and well. I don’t blame our boy Vasily Petrov for doing this, but I certainly blame, and I’m sure the courts would, companies like Marchex for turning a blind eye. When you consider that it’s been a month since these sites are up, you have to ask yourself: does Marchex encourage this? The Big Picture  I also think that online advertising has enough momentum and a bright future not to have to resort to this. Yes, I am talking about the companies that Valleywag first talked about, like Orbitz, Bolt, and mainly a site like Heavy.com, which seems to hellbent on positioning itself as an uber cool and advertiser-friendly place. If indeed Valleywag is correct in its assertion, then this is anything but cool. Who’s To Blame?  Then again, when a VC like Polaris comes by and plunks $20M in a company like Heavy.com, or when a company like Bolt sees new upstarts zoom past it, or when Orbitz can’t get clients as quickly as Expedia or Travelocity, maybe it’s not their fault. Maybe it is the system. Bull. I don’t exactly try to pass for a holier-than-thou bloke but the instant I saw what was up I I encourage everyone involved to do the same. Such tactics make us all look bad, and give offline marketers and publishers a great tool against us."
49065,20536,2007-10-08T04:15:00-04:00,,"Marchex Inc. is an Internet search and media company focused on local search, local content, and direct navigation. Marchex owns and operates a portfolio of over 200,000 Internet domains. Marchex has a market cap of about $485 million, $54 million in cash and no significant long term debt. The trailing P/E is about 500 (the company is just barely profitable) and the forward P/E is estimated at about 24. Although Marchex has a promising portfolio of domain names and the company has consistently grown revenues year over year, profits have failed to impress and the stock has dropped from its post IPO high of $24 to its current price near $11.50. Until recently, most of Marchex’s domains have been “parked” with the pages serving up pay per click ad pages with little or no content. Last spring Marchex re-launched over 100,000 new websites with local content. Although most of these websites still lack individuality, the creation of value added local websites is certainly a step in the right direction. In May of 2006, Marchex acquired OpenList, a local information service designed to help consumers find, rate, and review local businesses. Marchex plans on using OpenList content combined with content from partner sites such as opentable.com, contractors.com, healthgrades.com, and judysbook.com to populate its network of local sites. Marchex recently announced that organic traffic growth at the 100,000 local sites integrated into the OpenList network has increased 20% in the last 3 months. Although operating profits have failed to impress investors, Marchex generates a healthy amount of cash with 2006 operating cash flow of nearly $32 million. Most of this cash has been used to create and improve the Marchex network of local websites and to make strategic acquisitions. As seen by the recent traffic growth for the Marchex network of sites, these investments are starting to pay off. Although the initial surge in traffic is promising, the Marchex sites could really start to shine as user created content increases. The local sites operated by Marchex will become more useful and traffic will increase as user created content in the form of reviews and message boards starts to grow. Although Marchex’s stock has performed poorly since its IPO, at Wall Street Mayhem we think Marchex shares are currently undervalued. As the value of domain names continues to appreciate, Marchex’s portfolio of 200,000+ domains could already be worth more than the companies’ market cap of $485 million. However, the real potential for Marchex is in the growth and development of its local network of websites. Local on-line ad spending is expected to reach $25 billion over the next decade. If Marchex can continue to improve its network of local websites, the company is well positioned to become the market leader in local on-line advertising. The sheer number of websites operated by Marchex makes the creation of value added websites a difficult task. In order to obtain sustainable traffic growth, Marchex must create sites that draw repeat users instead of relying on traffic from direct navigation. However, considering the current market cap, we think Marchex is a relatively low risk stock considering the underlying value of the Marchex domain portfolio. If Marchex succeeds in creating a large network of value added user friendly local websites, the stock could soar. If Marchex fails, the break up or buyout value of Marchex would still be close to the current market cap due to the value of the domain portfolio.

8019,20141,2005-12-05T04:36:10-05:00,,"An ICANN board member, Joi Ito, has brought up some interesting topics on his blog about parked domain monetization. He describes a practice call domain tasting. Essentially, anyone can register a domain, determine if it earns money and get a refund after five days if it doesn’t perform to their liking.
I think domainers have a right to register domains. I don’t think they should be able to do it with no risk and no cost. Domains are a public good and no one should get a free ride.
Should we let people buy government land at low prices, check for oil or gold and get a refund if they don’t find any? How about buy unused spectrum at low prices, if they can’t find a valuable application for it – return it to the government? Perhaps the government should sell bonds and if interest rates go up allow people to get their money back?
I think domainers have legitimate businesses, but the loophole regarding refunds does not make sense to me. ICANN could just change the rules to not allow refunds. But maybe a better way would be to charge a small fee to return a domain? Or perhaps a lower price for a shorter window - $1 to register for 30 days.  The wackiest idea might be to auction off expired domains and use the money to fund  advanced ICANN projects.
I think the bigger problem with domainers may be that in the drive for growth they sometimes engage in sketchy behavior to drive traffic – search engine manipulation for pages that only have ads or irrelevant traffic arbitrage. You can see examples of how Marchex has been using Google and their partners to drive traffic to Yahoo ads."
62874,20569,2008-02-04T04:52:47-05:00,,"I subscribed to a newsletter from the Motley Fool not too long ago and received a copy of their Stocks 2007 publication. One of the companies highlighted, Marchex (NASDAQ:MCHX), purchased more than 100,000 domain names in 2006 for over $150 million. After this purchase, the company owned well over 200,000 unique URLs on the this world wide web. Well, this got me to thinking, as there are only so many usable configurations of letters and numbers that might be suitable for such a thing. I wondered, how much can a portfolio of 200,000 domains be worth? We'll get to that in a moment. For the time being, Marchex has parked the vast majority of their sites and littered them with some pay-per-click ads. To be sure they're not the most appealing destinations. But so what. They have 200,000 of them. Try lasvegasvacations.com or airbag.com to get an idea. So, as is rather a lot like me, I wondered further: If Marchex paid $155 million for about 100,000 URLs and their current inventory numbers around 200,000, is it fair to reasonably infer that the entire portfolio could be currently valued at around $350 million? Seems reasonable. And the company holds $37 million in cash in its deposits. And the market cap of the entire enterprise? $325 million. So the land (so to speak) is worth $350 million and the $35 million in cash is good for, well, $35 million but the company as a whole is valued at $325 million? Plus there's a 1% yield and revenue for 2006 clocked in at $127.8 million... Hmm... These numbers indicate there could be some room for upwards growth. Consider my interest piqued in the Marchex story."
8020,20141,2005-12-01T04:49:07-05:00,,"Why has Marchex’s stock price not withered like the rest of the tier two search stocks? This graph shows MCHX, INSP, MIVA, LOOK, and INCX over the past twelve months:   Marchex has increased dramatically while the other players have withered. Two likely reasons: 1) Smart domain acquisitions have masked deterioration in the rest of their businesses 2) Quarterly acquisitions make it confusing to analyze the stock The other search players have seen their stocks swoon when the market realizes that they are shrinking, not growing. If investors get a clearer picture of Marchex’s pro forma revenue numbers, MCHX’s stock price may wither like the rest of the tier two search players. MCHX Value on a Comparables Basis Let’s assume that MCHX has not overpaid for acquisitions that the domains and other acquisitions are worth what they paid for them (just this year!) - $164.4 mil for name development, $20.5 mil for Pike Street, $30.6 mil for Industry Brains and $12 mil for new domains for a total of $227.5 million. Since I see no difference between the rest of MCHX (Enhance / GoClick / TrafficLeader) and the other tier two players, I will use revenue comps (since only INSP is making money).   Applying the aggregate revenue multiple of these comparable tier two players (1.24X) to the TTM revenue of for Enhance/GoClick/TrafficLeader ($62 million) one would arrive at an implied valuation of $76.6 mil for this part of the business. Add that to $227.5 mil from acquisitions and $5 mil in net cash to get $309 mil valuation. Divide that by 38.3 mil shares outstanding to get a value of $8.07 per share. For giggles, if you use INSP as a comp against all of MCHX (the closest full company comparable since INSP owns traffic too), you get a value of $4.35 per share. Amazingly, Marchex’s enterprise value of $890 mil (using the 10/30/05 close of $23.4), makes MCHX more valuable than INSP, LOOK, MIVA and INCX combined! Maybe MCHX will go shopping or file a secondary! Full disclosure: I own puts on MCHX shares at various prices at the time of writing."
8012,20141,2006-02-28T04:08:42-05:00,,"Marchex (MCHX) management released earnings last week and seemingly continued to convince investors that they run a growth business. While their direct navigation top-line growth was intriguing (see marketing analysis below), Marchex is overvalued and I predict their stock price will correct. Below are some of the red flags from the press release and conference call. (See the fulll MCHX conference call transcript). The press release (and the business press too) proclaims that revenue was up 117% for the year. However, if you look deeper, you can see that pro forma revenue (including all the acquisitions) was only up 35% for the year and a even smaller 27% Q4 over Q4. Revenue growth is not robust and is decelerating. For the businesses MCHX started the year with (Enhance, Goclick and Trafficleader) revenue was up only 9% Q4 over Q4 – going from $15.1 million in Q4 2004 to $16.4 million in 2005. The Q4 over Q3 was a paltry 2% in those businesses – what happened to the famous Q4 bump? See my posts on their slow growing old businesses and lack of overall organic growth. High PE with modest growth? Pro forma revenue is projected to grow 19-27% from 2005 to 2006 ($105 mil growing to $125-133 mil). That is pretty low growth rate for a company trading at EV/FCF ratio above 50. If you take Q4 on a run rate basis (4x 29.8 mil = $119.2 million), growth will be in the 5-12% range - hardly the growth rate of Google or Yahoo. Theoretically, it should be easier to grow a business off the smaller revenue base that MCHX has. See my post on their cash flow ratios. One million shares of dilution! Another quarter and another million shares in dilution. Shares outstanding went from 38.3 to 39.3 million from Q3 to Q4. That is over $20 million in value dilution. Marchex didn’t even have $30 million in revenue yet shareholders suffered over $20 million in dilution. Eye-popping marketing growth! Q4 sales and marketing expenditure skyrocketed by 261% year over year and 59% over Q3 Marketing as a percentage of reported revenue has doubled from a recent 7.3% to 14.7%. If you look at the businesses they acquired this year, the numbers are even more dramatic with marketing as a percent going from basically nothing to 22.4% of revenue from new businesses. Management has indicated that they have been purchasing sponsored listings to drive traffic to their direct navigation domains. This arbitrage window should close as CPCs rise on the terms MCHX is buying. Is MCHX basically buying short term revenue growth?  I own puts on Marchex shares at various prices."

MCHX is returning cash to shareholders in the form of a 3.5% dividend yield at the current stock price and a share repurchase program that has retired 30% of outstanding shares since 2007.For investors with a 12-month investment horizon, we believe that MCHX shares are significantly undervalued. A compelling case can be made that the company is worth $6 per share today and as value is unlocked from Archeo and the profitable core business makes further gains in the attractive mobile advertising segment, a share of MCHX today could be worth $7 of two companies by the end of 2013.Let's assume that Marchex proceeds with a spin-off of Archeo in the first half of 2013, though it's possible that the announcement puts the assets in play and stimulates an offer that Marchex cannot refuse. Either way, let's discount Horowitz's subtle ""nine digit"" suggestion by at least 50% and put a $50 million value on Archeo. The NewCo looks to be on a pace to generate $25 million of revenue and perhaps $6 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2013, assuming an incremental few million dollars of expenses attributable to being a standalone public company. But Archeo will probably trade more based on asset value than cash flow, given that it's likely to be liquidating the domain portfolio over time.We think the distribution to MCHX shareholders may be .25 shares of Archeo for each MCHX share, suggesting 8.2 million Archeo shares outstanding. A $6 share price would value Archeo at $49 million. But probably not for long since it's likely that Archeo will pay a 60 cent per share annual dividend, indicating a 10% yield. It seems plausible that as Archeo's story is communicated, assets are liquidated and a 10% yield attracts income investors, the Archeo share price would rise. Looking out a year from now at perhaps an $8 share price for Archeo, the yield would be 7.5% and its market cap $65 million. In that case, if current MCHX shareholders hold their distributed Archeo stock, the value to current MCHX shares, including Archeo dividends in 2013, will be about $2 per MCHX share.Marchex's core call advertising and analytics business will likely generate $110 million of revenue and $11 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2012 and we think double digit growth is achievable in 2013. Projecting $126 million of revenue and $17 million of adjusted EBITDA next year seems reasonable - management has said it believes 20% EBITDA margins are the longer term objective. Much of the company's cash generation is free cash flow as the business requires very little capital, there is no debt to service and contingent payments associated with a 2011 acquisition are now completed.As a valuation comparable, Millenial Media operates in an adjacent space in the mobile advertising segment and carries a $1+ billion enterprise value with a revenue base about twice that of Marchex and only slightly higher 2013 adjusted EBITDA expectations (though with faster growth than Marchex). Millenial's valuation looks rich at about 5.5x annualized Q3 2012 revenue but if we use a blended valuation estimate for Marchex of just 2x annualized Q3 revenue and 9x 2013 adjusted EBITDA, that yields $184 million or about $5 per MCHX share.As further support, Marchex has $45 million of deferred tax assets on its balance sheet and a intellectual property portfolio that could appeal to an online advertising giant like Microsoft, Yahoo or Google someday.Using $5 per share for Marchex's core mobile advertising and analytics business plus $2 per share for the Archeo spin-off yields $7 per MCHX share in 12 months, well above the current price. That's too wide a gap for a company in a growth industry and whose value proposition is becoming clearer.Disclosure: I am long MCHX. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

A clearer explanation:Marchex purchased Name Development Lts. from Hong Kong based UltSearch. UltSearch buys up expired domain names that have strong incoming links and traffic, and then signs up those domains as search affiliates.

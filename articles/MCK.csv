4371751,67113,2020-08-31T14:11:25-04:00,The company posted a $2.77 earnings beat in Q1 on the back of a strong showing in June.Momentum is expected to continue in Q2 and Q3.Bullish crossover of the long-term moving averages. More upside needs to confirm the buying signal.,"In June of this year, McKesson's (MCK) 10-month moving average crossed above its 50-month moving average. As we can see from the chart, this buying signal has been pretty trustworthy in past times. An additional bullish sign would be a visible upturn of the 50-month moving average.We have been long this stock from time to time but are at present without a position. Our stance may change now as a result of the opioid settlement which brings transparency to the situation with respect to settlement payments. Why? Well, considering the inflation which will undoubtedly occur in drug prices going forward along with McKesson's robust cash flows, the drug distributor should easily be able to absorb these payments which will be spanned out over a number of years.McKesson finished its fiscal first quarter at the end of June this year and results were announced on the 3rd of August last. Although the top- and bottom-line were down in Q1 this year compared to the quarter of twelve months prior, one just has to look at Q2 (EPS of $3.81) projections to see momentum is definitely with McKesson at present. If the distributor can hit this number, it would be a $0.21 beat over Q2 last year. The $3.81 projection incidentally has increased by around $0.60 per share over the last 30 days alone (Clear momentum).CEO, Brain Tyler stated on the latest earnings call that because of this growing momentum which began in the latter part of June, guidance would be raised for the year to the $14.70 to $15.50 range. McKesson's delivery prowess along with the clear demand for its products was clearly seen in the first quarter especially in the pharmaceutical & specialty solutions in the US.Trading at close to the $154 mark, McKesson's valuation especially its earnings, sales, and cash flow multiples remain attractive. The forward non-GAAP earnings multiple came in at 10.15, the forward cash flow multiple at 10.05 whereas the forward sales multiple came in at 0.10.Firstly, with respect to sales, McKesson's 5-year average multiple for this metric is 0.15 meaning its sales are 33% cheaper at present than the average over this time frame. Despite operating through the teeth of the pandemic, McKesson is expected to report a 3.3%+ increase in top-line sales this fiscal year followed by 5% the following year.Why is this significant given the firm's present valuation? Well, apart from expecting a reversion to the mean type event which will price the shares higher, cash flow should increase meaningfully. Over the past four quarters, for example, MCK generated $3.36 billion of operating cash flow and only $580 million was used for investing purposes. In fact, the lion's share of this cash flow was given back to shareholders in the form of buybacks ($1.277 billion) and dividends ($293 million). Yet, still, there was a surplus of cash ($917 million) to add on to the balance sheet.What does this mean going forward? Projected earnings and sales growth are going to increase the net worth of the firm due to McKesson not being a capital-intensive firm. In fact, future acquisitions should be able to be paid from the company's strong cash flows which again stacks the odds in favour of the long-term investor (increasing assets). This demonstrates the leverage of the firm spinning off $3-4 billion of operating cash flow with no significant outgoings other than shareholder commitments.In our opinion, considering the big three distributors in this industry control almost all the market, we do not see disruption in this space any time soon. Furthermore, in the latest quarter, McKesson reported a debt to equity ratio of 1.47 and an interest coverage ratio of 5.62 and operating income still is 10+ times the net interest expense on the balance sheet. Therefore, even if the firm were to encounter adverse trading conditions over the near term, we believe there is plenty of buffer here in the financials to be able to weather any potential downturn.Therefore, to sum up, a solid buying signal for us would be to see that 50-month moving average turn up. We may have to wait for this though due to stocks definitely overdue for a trip down into an intermediate cycle low. Let's see what the second quarter brings."
4351230,105703,2020-06-01T07:32:56-04:00,"McKesson is the largest of the 3 drug distributors and has entrenched relationships with healthcare providers.During the pandemic, its recession-resistant business model provides investors with safety and comfort.McKesson is poised for strong risk-adjusted returns with strong forecasted growth in healthcare spend and active share buybacks.","McKesson (MCK) operates a mission critical healthcare distribution business that can survive and thrive regardless of difficult macroeconomic conditions. McKesson shares have bounced back from its COVID-induced low of $112 back in March but are still currently undervalued. With a market-leading position and continued strong revenue growth coupled with a low valuation, MCK is poised to reward shareholders with low double-digit annual returns in the coming years.McKesson (MCK) is a 187 year-old healthcare company based in Irving, Texas, and is the biggest of the ‘Big 3’ pharmaceutical distributors, with the other two being AmerisourceBergen (ABC) and Cardinal Health (CAH). Perhaps one overlooked fact is that it is ranked #7 on the Fortune 500 list due to its massive revenues through being a leader in healthcare supply chain management, retail pharmacy, healthcare technology, community oncology and specialty care.Its 80,000 employees enable McKesson reach one-third of all US pharmacies and a significant number of health systems. McKesson also has 275,000+ SKUs of branded and private label medical surgical supplies. If you have family or friends who work in hospital, there is no doubt they interact with McKesson products on a daily basis.Source: Company WebsiteI like the fact that McKesson is well-positioned to ride the wave of expanding healthcare spend for at least the next decade. According to CMS, national healthcare spend is projected to grow at an average rate of 5.5% per year through 2027, and reach an astounding $6.0 trillion by 2027. This puts healthcare spend on pace to grow 0.8 percentage point faster than the US GDP, with health share of GDP expected to reach 19.4% by 2027.In other words, whether we like it or not, within a decade, 1 out of 5 dollars in the economy will flow to the healthcare industry that McKesson operates in, and I believe dominant firms such as McKesson will leverage their economies of scale to capture a disproportionate share of that growth.Healthcare has been one of the most resilient sectors during the COVID pandemic. While banks, hospitality, restaurants, and airlines have taken a beating and have yet to recover, the healthcare sector has bounced back faster than the market. As seen below, the Fidelity MSCI Health Care Index ETF (FHLC) has outperformed the S&P 500 by nearly 8% over the past 6 months.Source: Yahoo FinanceMcKesson’s business showed strong resilience and even benefited from a surge in pre-pandemic demand with strong Q4 revenues growing 12% YoY. Full-year 2020 revenues were not bad either, growing 8% YoY. However, profitability did not grow at the same pace, with operating income growing just 1% YoY for Q4, and 2% YoY for the full year.Source: Q4’20 Investor PresentationThe wide gap between Q4 revenue growth of 12% and operating income growth of just 1% was due to COVID, which resulted in a higher mix of lower margin PPE gear, a pronounced decline in higher margin specialty provider volumes primarily in the non-oncology markets, and one-time costs to support front-line workers and employees during the pandemic. This one-time cost appears to be a smart and necessary move by management, and it’s good to see that the company took active measure to support employees and front-line workers as they navigated through these challenging times, as the CEO Brian Tyler noted during the conference call:What’s encouraging is that demand for high margin oncology products remained stable despite a drop in doctor’s office visits, reflecting a continuation of critical patient treatments during the pandemic. In addition, the company is starting to see early signs of stabilization in its key business lines as CFO Britt Vitalone remarked on the conference call that volumes have begun to stabilize in the pharmaceutical and retail businesses.Besides solid revenue growth, what I like most about McKesson is its active share repurchase program. In FY 2020, the company repurchased $1.9 billion worth of shares, enabling it to retire 9% of its share count, with $1.5 billion of remaining authorization. Including dividends, the company returned a total $2.2 billion to shareholders that was safely covered by $3.9 billion in free cash flow.At the current PE of just 10.8, every dollar that goes towards share repurchase contributes a 9.3% earnings yield. Coupled with a low but growing dividend yield, McKesson’s recession-resistant business offers at least low double-digit annual returns.A key risk that comes to mind when evaluating the drug distributors is the cost of opioid litigation. Full-year opioid-related costs were $232M, including $150 million in litigation costs and $82 million in settlement costs. While future settlements are uncertain, the company has more than sufficient free cash flow to cover these costs with mid-point 2021 guidance of $2.5 billion in FCF.Another risk factor is intense competitive pressures in the drug distribution business, as evidenced by the low margins. However, the big 3 players have well-entrenched relationships with hospitals and pharmacies, and I believe low margins actually serve as a defensive moat by helping to deter new entrants from entering the market due to the massive economies of scale required to make the business profitable.McKesson operates a recession-resistant business that has survived and thrived during SARS, H1N1, and the Great Recession. The company’s latest results reinforced this belief with strong revenue growth and profitability. I believe that shares are undervalued at the current price of $156.86 with a PE of just 10.8.I estimate the company is worth at least $174 per share, putting it at a PE of 12. This would make it in line with its smaller competitor AmerisourceBergen, and equates a one-year 12% total return including dividends with compelling risk-adjusted potential for low double-digit annual returns thereafter."
4337215,102404,2020-04-13T08:07:41-04:00,McKesson's revenue probably won't be affected neither by COVID-19 nor by the upcoming recession.The company's debt levels are a little high and the company is still facing opioid charges with potential high fines.But McKesson is undervalued right now - even if we assume high fines due to opioid charges - but might drop lower in this market.,"Last week we covered three different companies so far and tried to analyze what effect COVID-19 as well as the upcoming recession might have on the business model. While McDonald’s (MCD) might probably be hit more severe (despite its takeaway and drive thru business), the other two companies – the retailer Target (TGT) as well as the supermarket chain Kroger (KR) – will probably see at least stable revenue. Both companies probably won’t be affected much by the negative consequences of COVID-19 as well as the global recession.This week, we continue our series with a company from the healthcare sector, the pharmaceutical distribution company McKesson (MCK), which we also covered in the past – lastly in August 2018, when I asked Mr. Market why he punished McKesson. And to forestall the conclusion of this article already: like many other companies from the healthcare sector, McKesson probably won’t see huge negative impacts from neither COVID-19 nor the recession.(Source: Pixabay)All these articles will follow the same structure and focus on four different aspects that seem to be very important right now:(Source: Author’s own work)McKesson is a pharmaceutical distribution company and is also providing health information technology, medical supplies and care management tools. About 1/3 of all pharmaceuticals used each day in North America is delivered by McKesson and it is also the 4th largest pharmacy chain with more than 5,000 retail pharmacies. Additionally, McKesson is the number one distributor in oncology and key specialties.Not only are pharmaceuticals but also medical equipment are necessary all the time despite the current state of the economy. Considering the hoarding tendencies for pharmaceutical products and the increased demand hospital and other healthcare facilities might have right now, McKesson could even see increased revenue in the next few months. Almost all the products and services McKesson is offering are essential for people – especially in this crisis.While many other companies either offered an updated guidance (and in most cases a lower guidance) or withdrew the guidance (as they are not able to make reasonable assumptions about the business in the next few quarters), McKesson hasn’t provided any update so far due to COVID-19. The company only updated its guidance on March 17, 2020 due to the completion of the Change Healthcare split-off. McKesson is now expecting adjusted earnings per share for 2020 to be between $14.67 and $14.87 (even a few cents higher than before).When looking at Seeking Alpha Earnings Revision, the consensus for revenue stayed more or less the same during the last few months. At the end of January, analysts were expecting earnings per share of $14.57 and now they are expecting even $14.80 for the full fiscal year. Analysts are not always right and often too optimistic (and for most companies, the expectations – despite downward revisions – are still not reflecting the negative effects of COVID-19 in my opinion), but for McKesson we can be pretty confident that the company won’t be affected much by COVID-19 and the consequences that come with lockdowns and social distancing.While social distancing and the closing of stores or restaurants will not really affect the business of McKesson, we also have to look at the upcoming recession and how this will affect the business of McKesson. Overall, McKesson can be described as recession-proof – similar to many other companies operating in the healthcare sector.When looking at the last two recessions and McKesson’s performance, we see pretty stable numbers. During the last recession – the Financial Crisis in 2008 – McKesson could increase its revenue every single year and even in 2010. The worst year for McKesson in that time – revenue still increased 1.9%. Net income fluctuated a little more. In 2009, net income declined 16.9% and in 2011 – two years after the recession – net income declined 4.8%. Due to the aggressive share buybacks of McKesson, earnings per share declined only 11.1% in 2009, and in 2011, EPS declined only 1.1%.And the picture is pretty similar when looking at the next-to-last recession (during the Dotcom Bubble). During this recession, McKesson could also increase its revenue every single year with impressive growth rates. In the years between 2000 and 2004, revenue increased in every single year with a CAGR in the double digits. The picture for net income is a little different. In 2000, net income was $724 million and one year later, McKesson lost $48 million and it took until 2006 before McKesson could reach the net income from 2000 again.When looking at past numbers, we can be pretty sure that McKesson’s revenue will be stable or even increasing as McKesson’s business is pretty recession-proof and the company will see a high demand for its services even during economic downturns. However, we can’t rule out the possibility of net income decline or EPS decline in a recession as past numbers are indicating such a scenario.Although McKesson will probably see stable (or even growing) revenue despite COVID-19 and the upcoming recession, the financial health is still an important aspect we should pay attention to. On December 31, 2019, McKesson had $2,065 million in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet, which seems to be enough for McKesson to provide liquidity – assuming that revenue will not really take a hit from COVID-19 or a recession.When looking at solvency, we have to focus on the debt and borrowings the company has. McKesson has $2,109 million in short-term borrowings and $1,007 million in short-term debt. Additionally, McKesson has $6,734 million in long-term debt. When comparing the total debt and borrowings to the total equity of $6,385 million, we get a D/E ratio of 1.54 for McKesson, which is quite high. We can also compare the total debt of McKesson to the operating income, which was $3.3 billion in 2019 and $2.8 billion in the last four quarters. When using the operating income, it would take about 3 years for McKesson to repay the outstanding debt, which is acceptable. As long as revenue will stay stable, we should not really be concerned about McKesson’s financial health.But in case of McKesson, we have to look at another important point, which might have a big influence on the balance sheet and financial health of the company: the pending lawsuits regarding the opioid crisis and the probably high fines McKesson and many other companies are facing. The pending lawsuits have taken a back seat as COVID-19 is dominating all news, but McKesson will have to pay several billions in fines in the next few years and we have to take that into account. In February 2020, it was reported, that twenty-one states rejected an offer from McKesson, Cardinal Health (CAH) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC) to pay $18 billion over 18 years. For McKesson, this would mean $6 billion in settlement payments (and $333 million to pay annually). Obviously, some states want the settlement to be between $22 billion and $32 billion, which would mean $10.66 billion for McKesson in the worst case. Alternatively, the states want the money paid faster than over 18 years.In my worst-case scenario, I would assume that McKesson has to pay a higher amount in a shorter time frame. We assume that McKesson has to pay a total amount of $10 billion stretched over 10 years.In a next step, we are trying to calculate an intrinsic value for McKesson. For 2020, management is expecting a free cash flow to be between $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion. The free cash flow of the last twelve months was $3,125 million. As basis for our calculation, we use the midpoint of the company’s own guidance ($2.9 billion in free cash flow) for 2020.For the years going forward, I assume only 3% growth for free cash flow from 2021 till perpetuity, which is a very moderate calculation. When we are looking at past numbers, McKesson increased revenue 7.23% annually over the past ten years, and when looking at revenue since 1980, it grew even with a CAGR of 11.00%. Over the last few years, the GAAP EPS fluctuated quite heavily and it is difficult to calculate an average growth rate. But until 2016, net income increased with a CAGR of 10.7%.Additionally – as mentioned above – we have to include the fines McKesson will have to pay in the foreseeable future and have to subtract $1 billion every year for the next 10 years. Using these numbers (and a 10% discount rate) leads to an intrinsic value of $165.42. As in all the other articles, we calculate with a margin of safety of 20% and this leads to an entry point of $132.34 for McKesson.Although McKesson seems to be undervalued right now – even when considering high fines as result from the opioid charges and slow growth rates in the future – the stock declined similar to the overall market.Data by YChartsThis is especially surprising as McKesson should perform pretty stable in the next few quarters despite COVID-19 and the upcoming recession. While it is possible that net income might decline, revenue should stay at least stable or even increase. In my opinion, the company’s debt levels as well as the high levels of uncertainty about COVID-19, the economy in general and how high the fines will be, are pushing the stock down. And this is creating a great buying opportunity – although I think the stock could drop a little lower and reach its lows of December 2018 around $100.(Source: Author's own work)Stay safe, stay healthy, don’t panic!"
4332162,67113,2020-03-16T09:49:47-04:00,We liquidated in early February.Q3 momentum flowing into Q4 will increase earnings here meaningfully.Long-term fundamentals remain very solid here.,"We exited the vast majority of our equity positions at the beginning of last month. One of those stocks was McKesson Corporation (MCK). The primary reason why we exited our positions was because stocks have become far too stretched above their respective moving averages and technical divergences were beginning to appear. Our decision was purely valuation-based and not fundamental in nature. In fact. McKesson's third quarter numbers again exemplified a strong company once more.The question now is where this stock will bottom going forward. What we do know at present in practically every market (due to the coronavirus outbreak) is that every company involved in the supply chain of healthcare is under major pressure at present. McKesson being an international player will do very well due to how market conditions have changed over the past few weeks. We believe we will see this demand come through in the company's fourth quarter numbers as well as guidance for the following fiscal year (2021).Guidance for this year (2020) was already increased back in January to approximately $14.70 per share. We now believe this number will be beaten as Q3 momentum will now continue in spades into the fourth quarter.Considering where this stock has come from in recent years, the main metric we are looking for in quarterly earnings reports is sustained top line growth. Why? Because shares, for example, topped out at well over $200 a share back in 2015 as we can see in the long-term chart below. McKesson's current share price comes in at a mere $132 a share. However, revenues, for example, are up approximately 9% on average per year over the past five years. Yes, margins have slipped substantially over this time period but gross margins, for example, have stabilized somewhat over the past 24 months.Consolidated revenues grew in the third quarter by 5% over the same period of 12 months prior. This growth led to gross profit increasing by 4% as US Pharma & Speciality Solutions drove sales forward. Operating expenses were up 3% in the quarter but McKesson continues to work hard in bringing down its costs. Over a sustained period, savings on operating costs will be aimed to be reinvested back into the business (grow sales) or drop to the bottom line. The recent deal with Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) to service customers in the German market is an example of how McKesson wants to drive investment going forward. This should be good news for long-term investors.We remain laser-focused on McKesson's sales multiple which comes in at a very attractive 0.11 at present. Remember its five-year average is 0.17. McKesson will probably grow sales by another $12 to $15 billion next year. We expect the sales multiple to rise accordingly over time.With respect to our long-term view of McKesson, nothing has changed. McKesson essentially operates in a monopoly with the other two major distributors and we do not see this changing any time soon. They control 90%+ of the market between them. Therefore, straight off the bat, we see stability in this market as all three of the firms due to their similar size should be able to control their margins (small as they are) in a manageable way.Furthermore, due to the sizable free cash flow McKesson generates ($3.12 billion) over the past four quarters alone, we find it difficult to see how sustained mid single-digit top-line growth cannot be achieved over the long term. Remember, by March of next year, management expects to deliver annual pre-tax savings of up to $500 million. Trends like these will do wonders for cash flow and investment over the long term.Therefore, to sum up, it will be interesting to see where McKesson shares finally bottom over the next while. So many quality companies are going to be on sale if elevated volatility in equity markets continue. Besides the volatility though, there are a lot of moving parts going on at McKesson at present such as the opioid trial as well as the split-off of SpinCo. Both though are minor issues. We remain focused on the big picture in MCK and intend to add in due course."

Click here to find out more »Though a number of concerns have developed in recent years, McKesson (MCK) still possesses strong competitive positioning and enviable future prospects. The headwinds facing the company have been exaggerated by the markets such that McKesson has been undervalued for years and will soon revert back toward its intrinsic value.A brief background on the pharmaceutical distribution industry will explain the position distributors hold in the pharmaceutical supply chain and why MCK leads its peers. Further analysis of the major headwinds facing MCK and its industry will show that those headwinds have been exaggerated. Due to these exaggerations a simple valuation will indicate that McKesson is undervalued and provides meaningful upside potential based on only reasonable assumptions, while displaying little downside under pessimistic assumptions.McKesson provides pharmaceutical and medical supply distribution, as well as some other specialty solutions, to companies across the healthcare supply chain in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Their pharmaceutical distribution segment represents most of their business and operates as part of an oligopoly with peers Cardinal Health (CAH) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC) that controls over 90% of pharmaceutical distribution in the U.S. McKesson itself delivers over 1/3 of all prescription medications in the North America and does so with a 99.9% accuracy level.McKesson Revenue by Category -- Source: Created by author using 10k dataIn order to compete, distributors have continuously consolidated through acquisitions in order to minimize their initial drug sourcing costs. This process has improved their buying power and economies of scale, resulting in a highly concentrated market of distributors. It is this reason that MCK is currently positioned most competitively among its two major peers; they provide the largest volume of drugs and have higher overall profits. Higher volumes allow them to take lower margins on their core business to undercut their peers, while tangential business units offering higher margins enable them to better withstand short-term pricing pressures.McKesson vs. Peers -- Source: Atom FinanceThis position that MCK currently holds should remain intact under current market conditions because they continue to effectively deliver their products with current sourcing volumes. In this way MCK offers similar, if not superior service to its customers and is protected from losing its cost advantage as competitors have no more access to industry consolidation. Therefore, MCK appears to hold a competitive advantage on price that is unlikely to degrade.Threat of AmazonThe threat of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) entering the distribution and retail pharmacy market poses a risk of disruption for all distributors. Their purchase of online pharmacy PillPack in 2018 created the concern that they would fully enter the market and fundamentally change the landscape as they have done in many other areas. On the news, MCK's shares immediately fell 6% to near $130. While it is difficult to ascribe how much a specific concern is incorporated into a stock price going forward after its news, it seems that many believe the threat of Amazon will cause MCK to lose value over time. While the details of this concern are too much to fully investigate here, intuitive thinking on the subject indicates little likely effect to MCK's prospects.The initial costs and economies of scale required for distributors dissuades others from entering the drug business, though Amazon could be an exception because of its infrastructure and delivery capabilities currently in place. While it is unlikely that they would take substantial business from traditional pharmacies via the direct to consumer model, as those pharmacies can and have easily copied the it, there is still the possibility that Amazon could build retail pharmacies and deliver their own products.If Amazon did build out pharmacies they would become a peer to others in the industry, although with some theoretical cost advantages if they deliver their own products. Still, they would not have the scale that other wholesalers currently enjoy and may face the realization that the effort does not create much of an advantage -- similar to how Walmart (NYSE:WMT) gave up its attempt to deliver its own pharmaceuticals.As Amazon develops their drone delivery systems it is also feared that they could cut out most of the brick and mortar requirements traditional pharmacies have, thus gaining a substantial cost advantage. This seems unlikely to completely avoid having stores and would not be carried out in a vacuum; other pharmacies and distributors would compete in the same way with improved technologies. In this way, companies would morph their operations to meet the changing landscape -- accordingly, McKesson has already begun to make investments in drone technology.In any scenario the best case for Amazon is that it becomes a peer in the industry many years in the future. Expected tailwinds for the industry continue to be an aging population in need of more pharmaceuticals and continued drug development to treat more conditions. Accordingly, pharmaceutical spending is expected to rise near 5% in the coming years such that McKesson will continue to grow even if a new market participant arises. In order to account for this scenario MCK could be expected to grow at a slower pace than is currently expected -- the valuation described later assumes 4% overall growth for five years and in line with inflation thereafter.Regardless, Amazon's intentions are still not known and they may not even attempt to materially compete in the sector. Though, once Amazon does move forward with their true plans, which should be revealed soon as they make more public decisions, McKesson will benefit from the reduction in uncertainty.Political LegislationAnother concern for the pharmaceutical industry overall is if legislation will limit profits. It is well known that medical costs have risen far beyond normal inflation and that the U.S.' lack of pharmaceutical pricing restraints has resulted in domestic drug prices being substantially higher than foreign prices. The debate on if and how to bring down drug prices certainly impacts the pharmaceutical industry, but drug distributors seem to be more protected in the battle than the market realizes.The problem for many people is that they believe drug creators earn excessive returns, indicating to them that consumers are gouged as they are unable to access competing drugs. In a GAO analysis of Bloomberg data (page 25), the largest pharmaceutical companies earned profit margins near 20% -- on par with the largest software companies and well above market averages.Whether the U.S. decides to limit drug prices in some way, spur competition for generic drugs by allowing importation, or do neither should not substantially impact drug distributors. Distributors earn operating margins below 2% and have total returns on invested capital in the mid-teens, indicating that they do not earn excessive profits. Any decision to limit drug prices will allow MCK and other distributors to renegotiate sourcing deals in order for them to continue to earn high enough returns to stay in business. The supply chain would not be able to function if these distributors' margins fell much more, while the companies creating drugs could function without their excess returns.Beyond renegotiation, it is evident that distributors would also not be substantially hurt if only branded drug prices are limited or their patents shortened. These products account for most of MCK's pharmaceutical revenue, but only a small portion of profits. Therefore, while renegotiation could still occur short term impact would be minimized on the bottom line. In addition, if more drugs are pushed to become generic sooner McKesson would benefit from the increased competition between manufacturers.Uncertainty still lies in drug importation, where it has been proposed that states be able to purchase drugs from places like Canada. Interestingly, a recent request was denied by Canadian companies to import to Florida. The companies made note of drug shortages and contractual boundaries for drug sales. This is to say that these companies have agreements with manufacturers not to take drugs from a cheaper market to sell in a more expensive one. In most cases the drugs are the same in any country, but companies charge different prices due to varying regulations.In a recent earnings call, MCK's CEO spoke briefly on importation and the efficacy of this possibility to have safe and secure drugs. As one of the few companies in both the U.S. and Canada with interest in the matter MCK has a unique perspective. The CEO's hesitations seem to indicate the plan is not supported by MCK, but the vagueness of his position makes it uncertain.If importation does occur, the entire supply chain would likely need to be modified and drug pricing would have to change. This development cannot be accurately forecasted, but due to previously mentioned factors the distributors should be the least affected.While drug distributors should be least impacted by further legislation of pharmaceuticals it is unclear exactly to what extent they could be affected. The worst case could be that government lowers ROIC to near opportunity costs of capital, but even then MCK's bottom line would not likely be impacted that much. While I calculate ROIC to be in the mid teens for MCK, based on roughly $21 billion in invested capital and over $3 billion in adjusted after tax operating profits, that includes their higher margin areas outside of drug distribution. The pharmaceutical segment would likely be the only area restricted and thus overall profits would not drop as significantly as would be expected.The greatest concern for distributors is how much they will have to pay for their role in creating the opioid epidemic. Some estimates put liability on the three main distributors at $100 billion, but there has been a recent proposal agreed upon by many states' Attorney Generals for $18 billion paid over 18 years. If a comprehensive settlement comes in near this recent proposal MCK's stock wills surge.In their most recent earning's call MCK's CEO acknowledged that their share of a recent $250 million settlement with two Ohio counties was near 38% and that going forward other shared settlements would mimic that portion. Given the $18 billion proposal, MCK's share would be just under $7 billion. Assuming there will be some further negotiation and smaller settlements, total liability can more conservatively be estimated near $10 billion. If the 18 year timeline is kept this indicates yearly impact to MCK at just over half a billion dollars and total impact at a present value of roughly $5 billion with a 9.5% discount rate.In order to see how much liability is currently priced into the stock, a basic valuation of normal operations is necessary. Levered free cash flows for MCK were roughly $3.4 billion in 2019 FY, which is on par with normalized historical figures.Price Multiple -- Source: Image created by authorThe formula above helps investors decide what multiple to place on a company's stock. If MCK grows their cash flows at 4%, 'g' in the formula, with similar ROIC to historical averages near 16%, its current market cap/FCFE multiple should be 12.5X when using a 10% discount rate for equity, 'r' in the formula. Therefore, market value before opioid liability can be estimated at near $42.5 billion.Based on this simplified valuation metric and MCK's market cap at $27 billion, current expectations place opioid-related liabilities and other concerns near $15 billion at present value vs. reasonable estimates near $5 billion. The DCF analysis below displays assumptions for a similar valuation.MCK DCF Analysis -- Source: Created by author using 10k dataAt the low end, assuming cash flows are below current levels and opioid related costs are higher than displayed here, MCK still seems to be worth more than it is currently priced at. While other assumptions such as the long-term growth rate and discount rate could be different, it seems that these assumptions are well within the reasonable range. In fact, the discount rate is likely to be lower than the range provided as calculated by many investors due to how low borrowing rates are currently. Still, these rates will surely go up and thus the assumptions provided should be more accurate for long-term holdings. At the same time, it would be easy to imagine that should opioid settlements be finalized soon many market participants will value MCK much more than is projected here.In addition to being underpriced by the market, MCK's quality management indicates a more concrete expectation of exceptional future results . Based on the company's willingness to return capital more so via share buybacks than dividends, per share value growth could increase beyond the assumed rates. MCK chooses to buy back more stock when market prices are depressed (shown below) -- if this continues shareholders will benefit on a per share basis beyond how well operations progress.Data by YChartsFurther indication that management has the best interest of shareholders in mind is in their ability to keep debt levels low. Despite the fact that the cost of debt is at historic lows, MCK has avoided loading up on debt like many other companies. At net debt under $7 billion they can currently cover all debt obligations with less than three years of cash flows. This aspect will protect shareholders in times of reduced cash flows such as recessions, though as a distributor who delivers constantly needed medicine they are far less impacted by economic pull backs.Given this information, once a settlement is finalized the market will reprice MCK stock to align with its intrinsic value. Reversion has already begun as MCK just recently revised its 2020 FY earnings forecast to $14.60-$14.80 -- since then the stock has rallied 9%. MCK is owned mostly by institutional investors, many of whom make their decisions based on more short-term projections from sell side analysts. Therefore, once analysts see less uncertainty from opioid liabilities they will revise their estimates and the stock will surge.Overall, MCK appears to be a well managed company with long-lasting competitive positioning that indicates a safe buy at current prices. Market quotes are at the low end of reasonable valuations, where most of the uncertainty is already priced in. Provided that investors customize their own assumptions, the argument laid out here indicates that MCK should rally to anywhere between roughly $175 and $200+ after opioid lawsuits are closed out. I welcome all comments and discussion."
4337932,105352,2020-04-16T07:56:39-04:00,The company has recently updated its guidance for 2020 as a result of completing their Change Healthcare split-off.Management is still committed to returning capital to shareholders via buybacks and dividends.We estimate McKesson's intrinsic value at $205 per share.,"This is going to be a brief article explaining why investors should consider an investment in McKesson (MCK) as a speculative buy.For the past 5 years, the company has been caught in a storm of bad news and that is has been reflected in their share price performance, reaching a high of $240 in 2015 to a low of $110 at the beginning of 2019, while trading sideways throughout last year.There are lots of unknowns and uncertainties right now going around McKesson. Most notable headwinds are the pending Opioid litigation, the amount of disruption Amazon can cause by entering the pharmaceutical distribution business and deflationary generic drug prices.In November of last year, Citron Research published a short report on McKesson. The bear thesis sets the downside at $80, or 38% lower at recent prices. The report suggests that recent court decision ordering Johnson and Johnson to pay initially $570M (with an Oklahoma judge lowering the fine by 107M) for the harm caused to the state of Oklahoma related to the opioid crisis and tried under the legal theory of public nuisance, which the author argues could be also be used against McKesson. If that is the case, the short report estimates possible fines of $100B. Still, there is a general consensus about the importance of McKesson in the supply chain, and the company has the resources to sustain a highly probable huge fine. Once dust settles and business as usual resumes at McKesson, we think there is a good risk/reward opportunity for long-term investors.McKesson is one of the three biggest pharmaceutical distributors in the U.S, sharing the market with competitors AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health. The three companies controlling 90% of the distribution market in the U.S.They are also within the top 10 biggest corporations with last year's revenues of $214B. They play an essential role in distributing drugs to retail pharmacies like CVS and Rite Aid, and to mass merchants like Walmart along many thousands of independent pharmacies and hospitals within the U.S, Canada, and Europe. The company distributes branded and generic drugs and has recently begun expanding its medical-surgical supplies offerings to healthcare providers in the U.S.Putting aside the uncertainties about pending litigations, McKesson is performing well. The company reported Q3 numbers in February, showing revenue of $59.2B with a growth of 5.3% for the quarter, beating revenue estimates by $70M. Revenue growth was attributed to increasing prices in branded drugs while they are offsetting the softness in generic drug prices by better sourcing scale coming from their Walmart joint venture formed in 2016:The company has recently updated its guidance for 2020 as a result of completing their Change Healthcare split-off. Management has now guided for adjusted EPS to a range of $14.67 to $14.87 from $14.60 to $14.80 a share. Last year's adjusted EPS came in at $13.57 per share. If management hits their target that would imply an 8% growth in EPS at the midpoint.Other notable news related to their operations was an alliance with Walgreens Boots Alliance to create a German Wholesale venture, in which McKesson will have a 30% ownership interest. The JV is set up so both companies could enjoy more efficiencies and economies of scale in their German markets. The company also extended its relationship with CVS for another three years, which is a big milestone, considering that CVS is its largest customer accounting for 18.4% of total sales.From a capital structure point of view, McKesson has a debt to market equity ratio of 28%, with total debt (which includes financial debt, operating leases, and pension obligations) of $9.9B. As of this writing, McKesson’s market cap stood at $23.5B and its enterprise value at $30.5B.McKesson’s debt to EBITDA ratio stands at 2.3 times, which is a comfortable level. With an interest coverage ratio of 11 times, McKesson has a strong financial position.The company pays a dividend of $1.58 per share and its current dividend yield is 1.23%, below peers AmerisourceBergen (1.8%) and Cardinal Health (3.8%). However, McKesson has been aggressively buying back its own shares. From 2015 to their most recent quarter, the company has reduced its share count from 225M shares to 176M shares, or 22% in a five year period, and still has $1.5B left under their repurchase program. Management is still committed to returning capital to shareholders via buybacks and dividends. Shareholders can expect an average total return of 7%, not counting any growth in dividend payments, which has been growing at a 9.5% rate over the last 5 years.For the past 10-years, McKesson has generated a total of $27.1B in FCF, of which $12.8B has been distributed to shareholders for a payout ratio out of FCF of 45%.The company has plenty of liquidity with $2.1B in cash on their balance sheet, $4B in a revolving credit facility and $1.9B in commercial paper which they use for working capital purposes.When Amazon bought PillPack for approximately $753M in 2018, they signal their entry into the pharmaceutical distribution market. Accordingly shares of companies within the industry dropped with the news.We believe Amazon is going to struggle in their attempts to disrupt the industry. The three companies dominating the industry can only get above-average returns on capital because of economies of scale. The industry is characterized by having diminutive operating margins, which means returns are achieved by having high turnovers. McKesson’s inventory turnover has averaged 12 times for the past 10-years. A new entrant would need to achieve scale through similar inventory turns, but high inventory turns is a result of sales, and to achieve sales, you need to have strong purchase power with drug manufacturers (high volume, better prices). The clearest example of how difficult it is breaking into the industry is the decision of Walmart to join forces with McKesson instead of building their own supply network.So, the question then becomes how much will it cost Amazon to reproduce the scale needed? Keeping in mind they would need to build new warehouses specializing only in storing pharmaceutical products and adapting to a highly regulated environment, while not becoming profitable until reaching enough scale. This also assumes that the big three companies are going to stay passive while they wait for Amazon to take market share. We see the probabilities of Amazon becoming a significant player in the industry as slim at best.We think McKesson should trade at a more normalized P/E ratio of 14 times, which is their 10-year average P/E multiple. If we use management guided EPS number of $14.70 at their midpoint guidance, we get a value per share of $205. With a recent price of $133, that implies a 55% upside scenario.We recommend investors to read the short report by Citron Research. They put a target price of $80 per share assuming what we believe is the worst-case scenario.That would leave us with a scenario in which the possible upside is a 55% gain compared to a 38% loss. Not amazing odds but it makes a compelling case for starting a speculative buy position in McKesson.We are in the camp of business as usual at McKesson once the dust settles. The strong competitive position of the company and the reliance on the health care industry for distributors such as McKesson puts the odds in favor of a good outcome."
4314696,105526,2019-12-31T11:56:37-05:00,Recent analyst meeting was encouraging - management remains on track with its FY20 targets.Upside potential from the simplification strategy.Negligible EPS impact from a Change Healthcare split-off limits near-term dilution risk.But negative sentiment on the drug supply chain is likelyto weigh on the multiple; remain neutral.,"McKesson (MCK) recently provided a timely set of updates to its business, strategy, and financial guidance at its Sell-Side Analyst Meeting. Though there was nothing incrementally new, management's positive tone in reiterating its confidence in the FY20 outlook, combined with its proven ability to drive growth in strategic areas - most notably in its differentiated specialty capabilities - should go a long way toward reassuring investors about the company's ability to deliver long-term value to its shareholders.Nonetheless, near-term uncertainties (for instance around branded price inflation, generic deflation, and a challenging regulatory landscape), are likely to weigh on the multiple; though there are opportunities to unlock value via cost savings and a tax-efficient Change Healthcare stake disposal, I believe the stock offers little upside at these levels.A BriefWhile reaffirming its previously issued FY20 financial guidance, MCK's management, in its Investor Update, emphasized its proven track record in enhancing competitiveness and delivering growth over the long-term. Specifically, its strategy to drive growth and increase shareholder value can be split into three broad buckets:Source: Sell-Side Analyst Meeting PresentationThe company reiterated that it abstains from providing quarterly guidance because of the variability in the timing of certain line items that impact year-over-year quarterly results but tend to balance out over the course of the year. In particular, the Q1 to Q2 progression is being impacted by the following:Management also did not address the market dynamics in the longer term, but if historical trends are any indication, larger customers will likely continue to gain share at the expense of independents, implying continued divergence between the top-line and operating income growth.FY20 Financial GuidanceMCK reaffirmed its FY20 guidance for adjusted EPS, the guidance for segment-level revenue and EBIT growth, as well as the guidance for cash flows. Along with a clarified growth outlook across segments for FY20, I think it was noteworthy that adjusted operating profit growth is expected across each segment. Further guidance details are as follows:Encouragingly, management will continue to deploy capital in a disciplined manner, primarily through share repurchase - in the first half of FY20, MCK returned $1.4 billion to shareholders in the form of repurchases. Meanwhile, the remainder will be allocated to strategic growth, i.e., investment spend and M&A.Source: Sell-Side Analyst Meeting PresentationThough MCK has been less acquisitive in recent years, management remains interested in growth M&A aligned with the company's strategy, particularly if an acquisition can help advance strategic initiatives like building out its specialty and manufacturer services capabilities, where it has a differentiated position. Also worth noting was management's disclosure that potential opioid settlements and the Michigan litigation will have no impact on MCK's capital deployment strategy.There has also been steady progress on the cost-saving front - MCK remains on track to achieve expected gross cost savings of $400-500M by the end of 2021. Thus far, management has unlocked cost-savings of $45M in the first half of this fiscal year. A portion of these savings has been taken to the bottom line, with the remainder reinvested back in the business.Source: Sell-Side Analyst Meeting PresentationMeanwhile, consistent with prior commentary, the divestment of Change Healthcare is on track for the end of FY20. There was no word on the call regarding the specific approach management will take for the divestment, but the emphasis seems to be on providing tax-efficient returns to shareholders.One of the MCK's key strategic initiatives is building out its specialty and manufacturer services capabilities, where it holds market-leading positions. Specifically, the company is making investments into the specialty oncology and manufacturer services areas, given both have been identified as key growth drivers.Source: Sell-Side Analyst Meeting PresentationOn the distribution side, MCK has solid growth, but the issue here is that the largest customers (which carry lower margins) are outgrowing the rest of the portfolio. A similar phenomenon is seen with retail pharmacy, driving the faster pharma segment revenue growth relative to operating margins in FY20.On the manufacturer-services side, the company has some differentiated capabilities through its US Oncology Network and recent acquisitions, most notably CoverMyMeds and RxCrossroads. Through these assets, the company can work with manufacturers to help get their drug prescribed, enable patient adherence, and even assist in patient recruitment for the clinical trial process. The company is likely to continue to lean into manufacturer services to capture a greater share of the rapidly growing specialty drug market.Following the IPO of Change Healthcare, MCK has further reduced its Change Healthcare ownership stake (by ~$1.2B in 2Q20), with a full divestment likely by the end of FY20. Given the focus on tax-efficiency, one option could be a ""split-off,"" with MCK exchanging Change Healthcare shares for its own. Assuming equity income from Change Healthcare contributes ~ 10% of total MCK earnings (~$260 million) in FY20, removing Change Healthcare's after-tax earnings and retiring an implied ~17M shares through a potential split-off transaction would imply minimal (<1%) EPS dilution.Estimated Accretion / Dilution to MCK EPS from Change Healthcare Split-OffSources: Company DataI believe MCK stock is worth ~$155, based on a ~10x multiple on FY21 recurring EPS of $15.47. The ~10x target multiple is in line with the stock's historical average trading range, though I expect there is risk to the downside here considering the current overhang on drug supply chain sentiment, which I feel is likely to persist in the near-term.While the near-term uncertainties around branded price inflation, generic deflation, and the regulatory landscape remain, the sell-side meeting was encouraging as execution appears to be on track. These downside risks are, I believe, somewhat mitigated by the targeted cost savings and accretive use of cash flows. On balance, I believe the fundamental outlook for the drug distribution industry, in the long run, remains positive with a number of tailwinds, e.g., the aging US population, and increased utilization of prescription drugs. MCK looks set to unlock earnings growth via margin enhancement opportunities going forward, with the Change Healthcare divestment set to unlock further value for shareholders. While I believe the stock could move higher from here, at a $155 target, the upside seems limited, in my view; thus, I am staying on the sidelines."
4309226,102711,2019-11-26T12:27:47-05:00,"A gradual but accelerating shift in product mix from branded to generic drugs will adversely affect future earnings growth and profitability. Overall sales are substantially up year on year, but.Organic growth opportunities appear limited in an industry that has reached a certain degree of maturity, but inorganic growth via acquisitions remains a likely catalyst for further sales increases and.Legal issues continue to dog the company, as a motion to dismiss a class action lawsuit related to generic drug price fixing was dismissed, adding to an already challenging legal.","Higher and higher concentration of lower-margin generics over branded drugs in a shift toward an increasingly unfavorable product mix. Operating margin has taken a sizable hit in recent quarters, thanks to that revenue mix shift. Specialty drug pricing helped to soften the blow of generic price deflation. For example, sales of biologics are a main driver of revenue growth thanks to the inelasticity of pricing and the continued rise of chronic diseases and related healthcare. Simultaneously, there is a deceleration of branded drug price inflation. There is even continued softness in European markets, thanks to less negotiating power and more stringent price controls.Margin compression resulting from a shift away from premium pricing of branded drugs towards the relative bargain of generics, puts a real crimp on profitability. It is important to note, however, that McKesson remains in a strong competitive position, in a highly concentrated industry, with relatively high barriers to entry. Despite the current headwinds, McKesson remains the largest drug distributor in the world and benefits from significant advantages of scale and valuable existing relationships that would be difficult for any new entrants to match.Mergers and acquisitions have traditionally been a key driver of growth at McKesson, and thanks to a maturing industry, will likely have to do so more and more to boost any future growth. The company differs from peers in that it also often chooses to “make vertical acquisitions” and keep as many services in-house as possible, rather than contract out certain aspects of the pharmaceutical and medical product supply chain; MCK essentially has endeavored to become a sort of one-stop shop for such services.The main part of McKesson’s business is driven by “drug pricing, drug mix (generics vs. branded drugs), and volume,” according to Soo Romanoff at Morningstar. The consolidation in the industry, namely with its retail pharmaceutical provider customers such as CVS, has afforded increasing customer leverage, and therefore led to less and less favorable negotiations on the pricing of its services, further pressuring profit margins. McKesson is now sufficiently large to the point that inorganic growth through acquisitions will likely outpace any organic growth through rising sales. In such a highly-regulated and cost-intensive business, scale is important, and McKesson is well-positioned due to its sheer size, existing relationships, and even its layers of vertical integration. Interestingly, “in the past decade McKesson has invested approximately $20 billion between capital expenditures ($4.7 billion) and acquisitions ($15.3 billion) in order to strengthen its position in a mature industry,” says Morningstar.Scale definitely helps, but an uncertain drug pricing environment and growing customer leverage limit potential growth. As such, operating margins have remained in a state of decline in recent years, and are highly likely to decline further. One area where the company sees cause for some optimism, however, is in the nascent and expanding “telehealth” market, where McKesson is a key player, according to MarketExpert24. “Telehealth” is the “utilization of advanced data and correspondence innovations,” i.e. the integration and coordination of various aspects of healthcare and related services, including those related to drug distribution. Competitors in that growing space include Medtronic Inc., Cisco Systems, GE Healthcare, Allscripts Healthcare, Siemens Healthineers, and Honeywell, to name a few.Second quarter (2Q19) results showed an overall revenue increase of 9% year over year, thanks largely to growth from its U.S. Pharmaceuticals and Specialty Solutions segment, reflecting some resilience to industry-wide pricing deceleration of branded drugs and showing particularly higher sales volumes from a specific “retail national account customer,” per an article from BusinessWire. Losses of $3.99 per diluted share stemmed from an impairment related to the divestment of its involvement in ChangeHealthcare. Excluding such one-time charges, earnings per share were $3.60, which is actually flat YoY, reflecting continued challenges presented by margin compression, despite the aforementioned increase in sales.Another factor helping to prop up per share earnings is the continued commitment to a strong capital return program to shareholders via share buybacks and dividend increases. While this is admittedly a shareholder-friendly policy, generally speaking, it can also help to mask decelerating or even stagnant earnings growth, as the shrinking share count helps to somewhat inflate EPS figures. Pay special attention to any debt-funded share repurchases, or a high dividend payout ratio that lasts for more than just a couple of quarters. That can be a worrying sign that corporate stewardship is a bit directionless, and executives may be at a loss as to how to generate sustainable profit growth. For most of its history, McKesson’s capital return program has been well covered by earnings, while its financial health and liquidity have been strong, but a somewhat deteriorating balance sheet and strained profitability of late do raise some concerns, called into open question by The Wall Street Journal.McKesson finds itself an increasingly less-efficient operator in a mature industry with relatively few opportunities for game-changing growth drivers. It may be the largest player, but whether or not it is the best-of-breed (vs. Cardinal Health or AmeriSourceBergen), is somewhat doubtful. Suspect operating efficiency and flagging profitability vs. its peers present challenges that management will need to address amidst the backdrop of continued legal difficulties for McKesson specifically, and the industry more generally.Note: There is a class action lawsuit currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California which recently survived a motion to dismiss. The suit alleges that executives at McKesson made materially false claims about “the company’s financial performance and its generics business,” calling into question the firm’s corporate governance and how much stock investors should put into any seemingly rosy projections of future profit and sales growth, suggests PRNewswire. McKesson’s suit relates to the fact that executives kept shareholders in the dark about a generic drug price fixing scheme. While the San Francisco judge accepted that said executives were aware of the scheme, he flatly rejected the notion that they were an active participant in orchestrating it. Rather, according to this article by Bloomberg Law, McKesson was a passive player “participating in a limited way” through pricing via its distribution operations."

The company will benefit because it has bagged the vaccine distribution contract from the U.S. government.","A global leader in the U.S. healthcare and pharmaceutical supply chain, McKesson Corporation (MCK) operates a low-margin, high-volume business. The company is expected to witness a solid rise in volumes in Q4 2020 because it has partnered with the U.S. government on vaccine distribution. However, two issues are lurking around the bend: (A) a forthcoming goodwill impairment charge in Q4 2020, and (B) an opioid settlement of $6.9 billion that can disrupt its profits and operating cash flows.The good news is that the company is adequately geared to manage the forthcoming hits. Here is an analysis:MCK has $12.5 billion of goodwill and intangible assets in its balance sheet as of June 30, 2020. The company employs a market approach and a discounted cash flow (DCF)-based income approach to value goodwill.Image Source: MCK’s SEC FilingMCK has realigned its operating structure and it will have to assess the impact on goodwill because of this change. Additionally, the company has changed its goodwill impairment testing date from January 1 to October 1. So, MCK’s net income can be hit by an impairment charge in Q4 2020. The company estimates that the goodwill of its McKesson Canada operating unit, which was valued at $1.4 billion as of March 31, 2020, is at risk of material impairment.The impairment will drive down profits but will not impact MCK’s cash flows. It is at best a short-term sentiment-negative.U.S. states have filed opioid-related lawsuits against major drug distributors and are seeking $21.14 billion in compensation from three drug distributors, including MCK. As of March 31, 2020, MCK was a defendant in 3,000 such legal proceedings.Image Source: MCK’s SEC FilingIn October 2019, a proposal was floated that MCK’s opioid-related liability be settled at $6.9 billion, payable over 18 years. Talks were continuing as of June 30, 2020.If the states agree to the proposal, MCK will face a cash outflow of approximately $383 million ($6.9 billion/18) per year. The liability could be higher if its arm is twisted.Let’s take a look at how MCK’s annual cash flows can cope with this outflow:Image Source: Seeking AlphaThe company has generated more than $4 billion in operating cash per year between 2017 and 2019. Its TTM operating cash flows as of June 2020 dived to $3.36 billion because of the pandemic’s impact on the supply chain.The annual cash flow numbers indicate that MCK can easily absorb the opioid-related hit.With a Forward Price–Earnings ratio (GAAP) of 11.61 as compared to the sector median of 33.90, a low TTM Price–Earnings–Growth ratio of 0.43 as compared to the sector median of 0.82, and a super-low TTM Price–Sales ratio of 0.12, MCK seems reasonably valued at $154.32 as of September 3, 2020.The company earns a 13.84% return on common capital and a 9.94% return on total equity and is a sector outperformer in these crucial areas.The company’s long-term debt was $7.4 billion as of Q2 2020 as against an additional paid-in capital of $6.7 billion and retained earnings of $13.38 billion, implying a very healthy debt–equity ratio.Impairment of goodwill is a non-cash charge and is not likely to dampen investor sentiment in a big way when it is booked in Q4 2020.Though the opioid settlement will drain the operating cash flows somewhat, the company can easily manage the outflows if its current proposal is accepted by the states. In fact, a settlement will be regarded as bullish because it will kill uncertainty.Other than these riff-raff hits, MCK seems like a slow and steady performer that will get bumper vaccine distribution business in Q4 2020. The sentiment around the stock is likely to receive a boost as the vaccine distribution day gets closer, and it can outperform by the end of October 2020. Also, MCK consistently pays a dividend and repurchases stock.*Like this article? Don't forget to hit the ""Follow"" button above!"

At its lows of around $115 a share, we were holding a paper loss temporarily, but now, our position has firmly returned back into the black. In the company's latest second quarter, McKesson announced an earnings of $3.60, which was an earnings beat by $0.01. Top-line sales came in at $57.62 billion, which again was a beat by some $2.56 billion.When we went long McKesson many moons ago, there was plenty to like at the time. For one, McKesson had a keen valuation, low debt, and growing revenues, along with aggressive buybacks. Remember growing earnings is the number one reason why stocks rally on wall street, and growing sales is the number one reason which enables sustained earnings growth. Although growth had slowed significantly at the time, we believed that the risk justified the reward when one considered the valuation we were able to pick shares up at.Sales growth returned with vengeance in Q2 as McKesson reported almost 9% top-line growth. Although shares may look fairly valued from an asset standpoint at present, the present sales multiple of 0.1 looks very attractive.When our value plays bounce back aggressively, we always try to ascertain where would be a good level to start liquidating our holdings. Therefore, from this standpoint, let's go through some of McKesson's technicals and financials to get a read on how expensive we believe shares are at present.On the long-term chart, we can see that McKesson now seems to have negated the long-term potential descending triangle which was potentially in play since the 2015 top. Recent share price action has propelled shares above both the 50-month moving average as well as above that monthly trend-line. Furthermore, we have a convincing crossover on the MACD indicator with the crossover taking place well below the zero line.Long-term charts are essential, in our opinion, for long-term investors. In fact, the upmove shares have enjoyed over the past 11 months or so has resulted in long-term momentum finally turning bullish. That bearish multi-year trend-line should now act as a support. Suffice it to say, the long-term trend seems to have finally changed at McKesson.Margins are tight in this industry. However, instead of focusing on the razor-thin margins, investors would do good in focusing on the robust cash flows McKesson is consistently able to generate. Over the past four quarters, McKesson has generated well over $3 billion in free cash flow. Investors got paid handsomely out of these cash flows over the past 12 months through over $2.2 billion in share buybacks as well as over $300 million in dividends. The amount of shares outstanding has now dropped to around 180 million, which is really impressive, considering where the float was just 3 short years ago. Suffice it to say, we see no adverse tailwinds here.On the income statement, gross profit continues to grow and has been able to fund those operational costs. Since McKesson continues to run a strong balance sheet, interest expense is well under control. Furthermore, earnings growth is expected to come in around 7% this fiscal year and then grow to $15.40+ the following year. Suffice it to say, we do not see how shares can not keep rallying from present levels.To sum up, we do not see any apparent reason why we should lighten our position in MCK at present. Shares definitely have momentum on their side. Let's see what Q3 brings."

Compared to the healthcare sector, the company's growth prospects are not very attractive. Nonetheless, I believe the valuation is so inexpensive at the moment it more than compensates for the lower expected growth. Over the last 12 months, McKesson's stock has surged by over 26%. However, this is just a rebound from a previous decline. When looking at the last three years, it's clear MCK has under performed both the market and its sector. Data by YChartsOver the last three years, the market and the healthcare sector have delivered returns almost five times larger than MCK's stock, despite the company delivering solid results over these years. Going forward, I expect this trend will revert and MCK will outperform both indicators. In the last 10 years, MCK has achieved a revenue growth of over 105%, while the cash from operations increased by 51.96%. At the moment, the company generates an astounding $222 billion in revenue each year. This places them at the top of the list of health care companies by revenue, ahead of companies like UnitedHealth Group and CVS Health. While being such a large company can complicate certain operations, it also allows the company to take full advantage of economies of scale. By being so large, they can have extremely low margins and still generate significant income. Data by YChartsOver the last 12 months, MCK has generated $3.6 billion in operating cash flow. This means that if the company could replicate these results in perpetuity, and we discounted these cash flows at a 10% rate, the company should be worth $36 billion. This is 31% greater than the current market cap of $27.5 billion. This is clearly a very simple calculation that does not account for several factors. Nonetheless, the intention is to show that the company is generating large amounts of cash from its operations that more than justify the current valuation. Data by YChartsIn terms of margins, the company has been seeing slight declines. The pharmaceutical wholesale industry is very competitive, and margins are usually very tight, so it's no surprise that MCK's margins are so small. As I mentioned before, revenue grew twice as fast as cash from operations. This could mean that the company has been prioritizing revenue growth over efficiency, resulting in lower margins. As long as the shrinkage of margins is more than compensated by larger revenues, the company should be fine. However, at some point the growth will slow down and the company will need to increase margins in order to continue increasing earnings. To gain some insight into how management will handle the problem mentioned above, we can read their latest 10-Q report. In it we can see that, in an effort improve efficiency, collaboration and cost competitiveness, the company started to relocate from San Francisco, California to Irving, Texas on April of 2019. This move will take some time, as management expects the relocation to be completed by the start of 2021. I believe this is a good move with an eye towards the future. In a few years, this change of location could translate into huge savings for the company, along with increased margins and income. It will take some time, but I believe this move will pay off in the medium term. At the moment, MCK stock offers a 1.07% yield. This might not seem like great value, but the average dividend in the health care sector is just 1.13%. In comparison with others in the same industry, MCK seems to offer a competitive yield. (Taken from Seeking Alpha's Dividend Scorecard)For those that still feel the yield is not high enough, I would tell them to be patient since the dividend could potentially increase significantly in the next few years. First of all, MCK's dividend has grown for over 12 years, and the last five years the growth rate has been 10.66% annually. This means that, if the company can replicate this growth the over the next seven years, the dividend would double. Second of all, the payout ratio of the company at the moment is just 11.41%. This means that management could theoretically multiply the dividend by five, taking the yield to 5.35%, and still have 42.95% earnings available for buybacks or reinvestment. In terms of value, MCK looks like a great investment. The company's TTM P/E is almost half of the sector average, which could indicate the company is undervalued. This relative undervaluation is even more pronounced when looking at P/Op. Cash Flow, which is 62% lower than the sector. This implies that the market is valuing MCK's earnings at a steep discount. (Chart made using Seeking Alpha's Valuation Metrics)MCK's valuation is clearly cheaper than the sector average. However, this could be due to higher growth prospects in the sector compared to MCK. To take into account growth prospects in the ratios, we can look at the PEG (price/earnings to growth ratio). The PEG ratio enhances the P/E ratio by adding in expected earnings growth into the calculation. Analysts expect MCK's earnings to grow around 6.91%, while they expect the sector to grow at a much higher 11.5% next year. Since the PEG ratio for MCK is 27% lower than the healthcare sector, it imply's that the low valuation of MCK more than compensates for their lower expected growth. That is, MCK's PEG ratio is considerably lower than the healthcare sector despite having lower growth prospects, because their P/E is extremely attractive. McKesson has many problems. The company's growth prospects are not very positive, and margins haven been slowly shrinking over the last few years. Nonetheless, I believe the company is still undervalued.The company's P/E and P/Op. Cash Flow are less than half of their sector, and their PEG ratio indicates their inexpensive valuation more than compensates for the low expected growth. On top of that, the company is on the process of relocating, a move than should cut costs and improve efficiency. For these reasons, I believe MCK still provides a good value to investors."
4285796,104183,2019-08-15T05:12:58-04:00,"McKesson's stock is up nearly 25% this year, the first sign of relief for shareholders in several years.The company's recent quarterly earnings were strong, with double-digit EPS growth.A potential settlement could be struck in the coming months with respect to the opioid crisis, relieving the stock of a key overhang.","McKesson (MCK) reported FY 2020 Q1 earnings last week and by all accounts, it was a solid report. The company showed stable revenue growth and strong earnings growth, resulting in raised guidance for the full year. With an inexpensive valuation and a strong current income component, primarily driven by buybacks, this stock has been a difficult one to own the last few years. Fundamentally, the pressure on the business stemming from the opioid crisis in the U.S. has been the core reason the stock has fallen. Should McKesson see a near-term resolve to these issues, I think this is a stock that could rally considerably.Source: ForbesThe company posted a solid quarter for revenue growth and non-diluted EPS saw strong double-digit growth at 14%. The company was able to raise full-year guidance, which I really don't want investors to take lightly. Given the heightened market risk the last couple of weeks with respect to trade disputes, tariffs, and general volatility with earnings season, this is quite a positive to see. The new full-year guidance calls for FY20 adjusted earnings to be $14-14.60 per diluted share. This is a modest increase from the prior guidance of $13.85-14.45/share.To break the top-line gains down, let's look at the composition from a segment standpoint. The company's Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, which is its domestic drug distribution segment, posted revenue growth of 8% and EBIT growth of 11%. This is a razor-thin margin business, as is the European Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, so it's quite encouraging to see EBIT growth of this magnitude. Within the European distribution segment, revenues were down just 3%, but the more noteworthy item is that EBIT fell 53% on a YOY basis. This unfortunately doesn't look to be a one-off issue, but rather the company credits the weak retail pharmacy environment in the United Kingdom as the cause of the materially lower EBIT.In the company's third and final segment, Medical-Surgical Solutions, revenues were up 12% on a YOY basis, with EBIT growing 27%. That helps to offset some of the pressures in the United Kingdom in the European distribution segment. Additionally, this is the company's highest margin segment at 8.4%, which is encouraging that it is the fastest-growing from a profitability perspective. It was also surprising to see earnings grow 14% on a YOY basis, considering the higher tax spend on a YOY basis.Source: Investor PresentationMcKesson has been a difficult stock to own these last few years. Drug distributors have been under significant pressure from numerous avenues with respect to their role in the opioid epidemic. Rather than belabor points that are already well-known, the point now is to figure out what the remaining consequences are and is this a quality stock to add to your portfolio, cognizant of the risks. Most recently, the company, Cardinal Health (CAH) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC) have proposed paying $10 billion to settle all claims related to the opioid crisis.The issue here is that we don't know if a deal will get done with the attorney general or not. There are quite literally thousands of lawsuits lined up against these companies and many others, so a one-time deal with the attorney general could prove to be highly beneficial to the company. Apparently, McKesson hasn't made a settlement offer, so we'll presume for the time being that discussions are ongoing. The estimates for settlements for the entire complex of opioid manufacturers and distributors range from $30-100 billion. According to Bloomberg, the rebuttal from the National Association of Attorneys General countered with a $45-billion entire settlement.The proposed settlement for all of these companies will be paid out periodically rather than a lump sum, which helps in terms of the company's balance sheet flexibility and keeping liquidity high. Even if McKesson's fine was $3 billion paid out over 10 years, this is a company that reported over $3.6 billion in free cash flow last fiscal year, which makes the potential payments largely affordable. I think if McKesson's own fine started to be in excess of $7-8 billion, causing a 20-25% reduction in free cash flow, there would be adverse impacts; however, I don't see that happening given the number of parties at fault and the prior estimate ranges provided.One of the key developments during the quarter was the IPO of Change Healthcare (NASDAQ:CHNG), one of McKesson's JVs. Change filed for an IPO back in March and McKesson currently owns 58.5%. Right out of the gate, CHNG performed well, with the first trading day seeing a rise to the $15/share mark; however, it's now hanging around the low $13/share level. With a market-cap of $1.65 billion, the 58.5% equity interest is considerable for the company and provides McKesson optionality, more than anything.In future quarters, if the company wants to sell down the stake to raise cash, boost liquidity, or go after a growth opportunity, it has a direct source to do so. Despite the somewhat poor trading performance (it's still early days), the contribution to McKesson is quite substantial. In FY20, the company expects adjusted equity earnings to be $250-270 million for the JV. That's reliable cash flow that the company can use to supplement its own earnings and offset any potential pressures during a given quarter.Source: StockChartsThere was a balance of positives and negatives during the quarter, but this stock has been a really inconsistent performer because of the fundamental backdrop. The company is primarily focused on buybacks rather than a dividend, which tells us management prefers to be opportunistic, rather than commit to a higher, sustained dividend. I also believe that a settlement with the opioid cases will open the door to a higher dividend. The stock currently yields 1.17% and during the quarter, the company did increase the dividend by 5% to $0.41/share, but it isn't significant enough for investors to buy this on the basis of finding quality current income stocks.With that in mind, McKesson is unique in the sense that it utilizes ASRs or accelerated stock repurchase programs, where a large sum is authorized to be purchased on a timely basis, creating a short-term yield spike for investors. It's unfortunately not consistent and difficult to model for, but provides a free option for investors that are holding the stock for the long term. On a fiscal YTD basis, the company has repurchased $684 million worth of stock via a $600 million ASR and the remainder under a standard authorization, which equates to about 2.6%.On a calendar YTD basis, the company has repurchased $1.4 billion, which equates to an annual yield of approximately 10.8%. When we couple that with a 1.1% dividend yield, the stock starts to hold one of the most compelling value propositions in the sector, let alone the market. The question remains, however, how reliable is this and what would future buybacks look like in terms of size?The company has used ASRs numerous times before, most notably in 2018 three times in the amounts of $250 million, $400 million, and $500 million. The company still has a normal authorization, which currently has a capacity remaining of $2.8 billion, which represents a yield of just over 10%. However, that is not on an annual basis and there's no expectation that a considerable volume of shares will be repurchased in the short-term.The chart below is a 3-year view and I wanted to show this long-term chart because the stock has been a rather poor performer the last couple of years. Momentum has seemed to turn around considerably since the start of the year and the stock has taken over its 200 DMA.Source: StockChartsThe valuation is also largely supportive for investors. The stock trades at an undemanding 9.8x forward earnings, assuming the company is able to hit the midpoint of its new guidance. It's rare to find stocks trading below 10x forward earnings, let alone 20x these days. I believe the cheapness of the stock will come into full view for investors as soon as an opioid settlement is reached. Without that, I think the stock is severely challenged in re-rating.McKesson's business has been challenged in years past, in part because of the increased litigation risk due to the opioid epidemic. The stock isn't expensive in the slightest and shares have become more responsive as a settlement may be close. The company, despite numerous competitive pressures, has also managed to grow earnings at a double-digit pace and that should give investors the confidence they need to be long ahead of a settlement."
4275265,67113,2019-07-16T15:40:06-04:00,We flagged another breakout attempt last month.McKesson's long-term bearish trend has finally changed.Market timers should be getting interested at these prices.,"We have been long McKesson (MCK) for quite some time now. Price continued to go south after our purchase, which obviously put more strain on that particular position. Moreover, this position makes up a high-single digit percentage of our portfolio due to how bullish we continue to be on this company. Suffice it to say, any significant bullish move in the share price over the next few months would result in a significant positive change in our portfolio.This article is all about the psychology of support and resistance on a technical chart. McKesson had been consistently printing lower highs and lower lows since 2015. The lowest point we witnessed in the share price was Christmas Eve last year when MCK shares bottomed along with US equity markets, in general.Since then, though, price has managed to break above resistance at about $135 a share. We believe (due to the successful breakout) that this area now should become strong support for this stock.As the weekly chart shows above, price made multiple attempts to get above $135+ a share over the past 10+ months. Finally, we got a breakout above this level last month, which has ramifications for how the share price should trade going forward.For example, because of the uncertainty surrounding this sector regarding government policy, sentiment had been bearish in McKesson for a considerable period of time. So, basically, since that multi-year top back in 2015, the market participants in McKesson had ranged from the bulls to the bears to the uncommitted. Many times, investors who do not hold a position at a given point in time (be it long or short) have the underlying on their watch list as they wait for the stock to either top or bottom.We obviously were and are in the initial camp as we have been long for a few years now. However, many longs (who trade more over a short-term basis) would have since liquidated their positions due to the pattern of sustained lower lows.If we bring in the above chart to just show the area of trading below the dotted line (what was one resistance but now should act as support), we can ascertain the following.But what does all mean from a psychological point of view? Well, now that we have a successful breakout (and a change in trend), bearish traders would have most likely bought back their positions to limit any potential losses. We (long-term buy and holders) continue to hold our positions. However, investors and traders on standby, who were maybe waiting for this convincing trend-change to take place, can now enter here on the long side with less risk and place stops if needs be.Market timing is very difficult in investing, but the odds look high here that McKesson shares can remain above support. What once was resistance looks like it now will become long-term support. This stock is expected to report well over $14 in earnings per share this year. Although currently paying out a 1.1% dividend yield, we expect the pay-out to increase meaningfully over time due to how robust cash flow generation has remained. Remaining long."
4262245,67113,2019-05-09T18:51:12-04:00,Company reports an earnings beat for Q4.We look at the charts.Volume increase now finally coinciding with bullish price action.,"We have been long McKesson Corporation (MCK) more or less since the inception of the portfolio. We discussed in recent commentary why we remain long this stock. Apart from the attractive valuation Mckesson has at present, one just has to look at the firm's current key metrics and compare them with 2015, for example, when shares topped out at close to $240 a share.Within the past four years, McKesson has lost almost half of its market cap. Yet, its sales over the past four quarters, for example, (MCK finishes its fiscal year in March) of $213 billion come in around $34 billion ahead of what the company reported in 2015. Yes, margins have been declining in the industry in general, but, yet, current operating profit of $3+ billion is practically on par with the same metric in 2015.We have consistently stated that as long as the firm's price to book and sales ratios remain attractive, the firm's profit margins should take care of themselves. McKesson beat fourth quarter earnings estimates yesterday (08/05/2019) which rallied the stock-price almost 5%. Shares have tacked on more gains today. Taking this up-move into account, let's take a fresh look at the charts, starting with the long term (20 years) to see if we can gain any technical insights from the latest earnings beat.The long-term chart looks bullish for a number of reasons. The reason why we first like to go to the 20 years is that long-term monthly charts can give us a perspective of where price is coming from. Furthermore, anything out of the ordinary with respect to how McKesson trades, for example, should only really show up on short-term charts. This is why only looking at the daily charts can sometimes not be accurate as ""randomness"" may come into play. The long-term chart, however, in our opinion, puts randomness to bed as fixed trends should have been well ironed out by then.On the long-term chart, we have a strong upward trend where we have strong support at around the $70 mark. Obviously, this support level will increase as the years' pass, but it should not be broken. Shares topped out in 2015 and have been trapped in a coil since then. The important point here is that the trend-lines are converging. This triangle pattern usually ends up playing out as a continuation pattern which should mean an eventual close above that upper trend-line. Furthermore, we have divergences taking place against price on the RSI momentum oscillator which is also bullish. Moreover, the MACD looks like it is about to cross over. This key indicator has not been this depressed since the year 2000 which again demonstrates how oversold this stock looks at present.When we go on to the weekly chart, we see that the divergences are far more transparent. Volume and momentum are excellent predictive indicators. When divergences appear, it usually means a change in trend is afoot. As the chart illustrates, momentum to the downside has been softening and buying volume continues to increase.The daily chart shows strong volume inflows and price is now obeying. The next meaningful level of resistance for McKesson should come at around the $135 level and then something more substantial at the $150 mark. This latter resistance level is the upper trend-line on the long-term monthly chart that we discussed earlier.We flagged in a previous article a buying signal in MCK when its 4-day moving average moved above both the 9- and 18-day. Short-term traders can remain long until we have the opposite (4-day below the 9- and 18-day).To sum up, we believe long-term investors who have been long this name for a considerable period of time will one day have their day in the sun. The monthly and weekly charts remain bullish. Will revisit once more once shares get through the $150 mark."
4272697,67113,2019-06-28T14:17:38-04:00,Shares look like they are going to try to break above resistance once more.Divergences evident on the technical chart.We will not trade this due to how significantly undervalued we believe shares remain.,"McKesson Corporation (MCK) at $133 a share is up now up over $20 a share or just under 18% since the start of the year. Although shares have rebounded nicely so far this year, we still remain a tad underwater on our existing position. We still maintain though that higher prices are coming.We wrote a piece on McKesson early last month and stated that the next major landmark price-point for the share-price would be the $150 mark. Shares have risen approximately 2.34% since that piece.Because of how undervalued this behemoth is at present, our objective is to hold MCK indefinitely at this point. As our readers will know, however, we also trade many securities over a shorter time-frame. Whether we use swing plays or implied volatility plays, we always aim to take advantage of all possibilities at hand.Therefore, let's go through why we see this stock as a long-term investment as well as how one could possibly trade this stock over a shorter time-frame.As the chart illustrates above, the momentum RSI indicator along with volume continues to diverge against price-action. This usually means a sustained long-term change in direction is usually in the offing.Mckesson presently trades with a cash flow multiple of 6.5 and a book multiple of 3.5. Why then do we believe these numbers will end up being ultra cheap in the long run?Growth obviously is paramount when evaluating a potential value play. In McKesson's latest fiscal year, top-line sales topped $214 billion and EPS came in at $13.57 a share. This present year, we expect to see sales of almost $221 billion along with earnings per share of $14.13. Incidentally, similar growth rates are expected in 2021. We just do not foresee growth slowing down substantially for a number of reasons.Over a shorter-time basis, the triangle which has been playing itself out really should demonstrate to investors the amount of upside potential MCK shares have at present. If price can close above that upper trend-line, then we would believe that shares would realistically have $20 to $25 per share of upside potential. Short-term investors could place a limit buying order right above that trend-line so one could catch the full extreme of the breakout.Therefore, to sum up, we see no reason at present to alter our long stance in McKesson. The company continues to generate expansive cash flows which can be used to bring down debt even more, acquire other companies, reduce the number of shares outstanding, and even grow that dividend. Buying a low-priced stock which is spinning off well over $3 billion a year in free cash flow immediately stacks the odds in our favor. We believe if Mckesson can keep on increasing its top and bottom lines appropriately, then share price appreciation has to follow. Remaining long."
4247566,105080,2019-03-13T06:36:36-04:00,"Three reasons for McKesson's stock decline.With Democrats winning the House, gridlock should create a more stable political environment for healthcare.McKesson benefits from high barriers to entry.","The following segment was excerpted from this fund letter published by ValueWalk.We first discussed our investment in McKesson (NYSE:MCK) in our mid-year letter to investors. The stock continued to decline (almost without fail) into year-end. Whenever this happens, we naturally wonder what we are missing. With the stock trading at single-digit multiples, the risk of overpaying for the business appeared minimal. But of course, we needed to understand why it was cheap. In our view, MCK was down for three reasons:I. Industry concerns around drug pricing and the political environment;II. Uncertainty regarding Amazon's (AMZN) entry into the healthcare supply chain; andIII. Potential liability from the opioid epidemic. So, the question then becomes, can we identify a catalyst to change investor perception? The short answer is ""yes.""With Democrats winning the House, gridlock should create a more stable political environment for healthcare. Meanwhile, continued earnings growth and free cash flow generation should ultimately convince investors that the sky is not falling, and as a result, multiples should improve. And any settlement for less than the eye-popping headline risk of $100 billion should quell investors' worst fears about the company's opioid liability.Despite the ongoing headline risks, we believe that pharmaceutical distributors are among the most attractive, high-quality distribution businesses one can own. While drug prices may fluctuate in the short term, the long-term outlook for prescription drug growth will almost certainly increase the number of scripts sold in the US.McKesson benefits from high barriers to entry in the form of regulatory hurdles, rational competition between the top three distributors (who account for 90% market share), and demand growth that shows little sensitivity to economic conditions. Yet, investors are valuing the stock at a significant discount to the group, despite returns on capital far above the profits generated by other distributors."
4249877,95206,2019-03-19T19:56:19-04:00,"McKesson has a strong competitive position with barriers to entry from scale, expertise, buying power and thin margins which will allow it to protect its return metrics.Potential health care industry changes, opioid related challenges and Amazon will impact other areas of the pharmaceutical space more than distribution, or will be immaterial longer term.Even with zero growth in free cash flow and a 9% WACC, McKesson offers significant upside, making it a buy right now – we have continued to accumulate the shares.","McKesson (MCK) dominates pharmaceutical distribution along with its peers Cardinal Health (CAH) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC). The oligopoly offers investors strong barriers to entry, and in McKesson’s case, adequate value creation to consider an investment. Investors do need to take certain negatives into account such as customer concentration, complex financials and average capital allocation, but these should inform position sizing rather than prevent investment. The stock price has been crushed by a myriad of industry concerns including structural health care changes, downward pressure on drug prices, opioid related challenges and potential new entrants such as Amazon. But these concerns will not have a material negative impact on pharmaceutical distribution over the long term. In the short term, they have largely affected McKesson’s stock price, and therefore the current valuation offers an excellent chance for investors to pick up a value-creative company at an attractive valuation. Keep on buying McKesson.McKesson delivers pharmaceutical and medical products and business services to retail pharmacies and institutional providers like hospitals and health systems throughout North America and internationally. The company also provides specialty pharmaceutical solutions for biotech and pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as practice management, technology and clinical support to oncology and other specialty practices. In addition, McKesson delivers a comprehensive offering of healthcare products, technology, equipment and related services to the non-hospital market - including physician offices, surgery centers, long-term care facilities and home healthcare businesses. The company is 185 years old and had revenues of $208.4 billion in 2018.Source: McKesson 2018 Investor Day PresentationThe healthcare industry in the US seems to be under pressure from every angle. People from politicians to consumers want more transparency and lower prices and some are taking a shotgun approach when placing blame for rising healthcare costs. Structural changes may very well be needed, but who is really at risk if fundamental changes are implemented? Common sense would indicate that the ones profiting the most now are the ones with the most to lose. So who is profiting the most now?Source: Pembroke Consulting; The Wall Street JournalThe above graphic makes it quite clear that it is not the wholesalers (like McKesson) that are taking the biggest piece of the pie. There simply isn’t much money to save by squeezing the distributors in this equation. How would the government reduce distribution costs for example? Perhaps by regulating the industry like some utilities? That would mean limiting a distributor’s return on invested capital to something around 10%, which is exactly where it is now. So there just isn’t much fat to trim.It’s the drug makers, pharmacy-benefit managers and pharmacies that have more to lose, which investors should consider when looking at companies like CVS (CVS) or Walgreens (WBA). Wholesalers also provide a necessary service that can’t be eliminated or even reduced much. Drugs have to physically get from the drug maker to the consumer somehow. So we can change how prices are set or how drug innovation is compensated, but McKesson’s infrastructure will still be needed regardless, and their margins and return on invested capital make it clear that there is little excess to be trimmed from their financials. The wholesaler area may very well be the safest area of healthcare currently.Pricing pressure in the pharmaceutical industry has presented challenges for McKesson. And in the short term, lower drug prices could create some turbulence in financial results for distributors. But it is not something to be worried about longer term. Part of the wholesalers’ revenue is based on list prices for drugs, currently. Thus, lower drug price inflation has dampened growth for distributors. But short-term concern about drug price-related pressure misses the point.The reality is that distributors like McKesson operate in an oligopoly and provide an indispensable service. They also have razor-thin margins as things stand. Any change to drug pricing policy or elimination of rebates (that would potentially lower drug list prices) would simply lead to a renegotiation of distributor contracts with other pharmaceutical industry participants. Distributors will not accept any significant pressure to their tiny margin over the long term, and they have the oligopoly power to insist on necessary changes. So lower drug prices might lead to new contract structures or business models for the distributors, which could arguably take some time to put in place, but ultimately McKesson and other wholesales will still get their cut.Just think about the alternative. Distributors are squeezed leading them to earn less than their cost of capital, and they go out of business. Nobody gets their drugs. Impossible. Distributors will be compensated for the service they provide, even if compensation is no longer tied to pricing.Nobody likes headlines having anything to do with opioids these days. And distributors have received a heavy dose of scrutiny. But let’s review a distributor’s roll in the industry. Wholesalers like McKesson move FDA-approved drugs that have been prescribed by licensed physicians to DEA-registered pharmacies. McKesson does not deliver more than pharmacies order, and does not ship to pharmacies that are not licensed by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). So McKesson is working within a highly regulated framework and is not directly involved in the patient relationship or in determining what prescriptions are written. As distributors often say in their defense, they are just middlemen.They also only ship legal prescription drugs. The increase in overdose deaths in the US is due largely to abuse of illegal drugs, and not the prescription medications that distributors deliver. That doesn’t mean there isn’t a link, but it does make it a bit of a stretch to put the blame directly on wholesalers.However, distributors like McKesson do have some responsibilities related to the reporting of suspicious shipments to the DEA. And it is in this area that McKesson has had issues. In January of 2017, the Department of Justice announced that McKesson had settled, for $150 million, civil claims that from 2008 to 2013 the company had failed to warn the DEA about the large number of suspicious orders of highly addictive painkillers it had shipped to certain parts of the country. But McKesson has tightened control and compliance related to these responsibilities and now has about 40 individuals dedicated to McKesson’s controlled substance monitoring program as well as new technology and analytics to identify suspicious orders. And both the DEA and McKesson say they are working together productively now.McKesson also received a warning letter from the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for allegedly failing to identify, quarantine and investigate drug shipments that had been tampered with. The issue is more related to supply chain security than opioids themselves. And considering the company’s 99.996% accurate fill rate, quality control is unlikely to be a major problem. On a related note, it’s important to remember that opioids represent a small portion of McKesson’s business, with the entirety of controlled substances (not just opioids) being just three to four percent of McKesson’s total revenue according to the company.We are not lawyers by any means. And there will certainly be ongoing legal expenses related to opioids. But we hardly see this topic toppling the company.We will not spend much time on this topic in this piece as we have written extensively on this topic in previous posts, but we repeat that we do not view Amazon (AMZN) as an imminent threat to McKesson. We believe Amazon's main goal in pharmaceuticals is likely to build consumer relationships in retail rather than disrupt distribution. Its move into the retail pharmacy business through its acquisition of PillPack means Amazon is competing directly (or threatening to) with other pharmacies, creating a disincentive for any other pharmacies to work with Amazon. The existing oligopoly is anyway blocking most of the market share from Amazon’s grasp. The only real immediate concern is more related to McKesson’s customer concentration and the possibility that a player like Amazon acquires one of McKesson’s major customers and then steals its distribution business.Our conclusion is that McKesson is now trading well below its intrinsic value and that the multitude of threats facing the company will prove to be transitory or largely irrelevant. Structural changes will not ultimately affect the main distributors as they provide a necessary service in an efficient and effective manner. Drug pricing dynamics may create short-term turbulence, but McKesson’s strength and oligopoly positioning will allow it to protect its margin. The opioid crisis is catastrophic, but not for McKesson. And Amazon is unlikely to present a real threat to McKesson anytime soon.So the business is safe, and can be purchased at an attractive price. We might agree that the existing threats could provide some headwinds to growth in a bearish scenario, so we conservatively model low growth for McKesson. In fact, even with zero growth in free cash flow over the next decade and a 9% WACC, we get substantial upside. Multiples support the conclusion that McKesson is cheap. A single digit PE and a double digit free cash flow yield look quite nice for a company that reliably provides a return on invested capital around 10%. We don’t provide a full fundamental analysis here, but readers can review our comprehensive piece on the company if interested.Arguably, the share represents one of the best deals in the market for a company that is largely detached from the economic cycle (something we look for these days). Good quality at a great price. The share price may have trickled up a bit since we started writing this piece, but we initiated a position in the company at about $135 per share and increased our position at around $117 per share. So we say keep on buying McKesson."
4249316,67113,2019-03-17T13:59:05-04:00,Shares are still heavily undervalued.We expect a sustained rally.We will not be selling once price meets our breakeven.,"Our McKesson (NYSE:MCK) position has been a laggard in our portfolio for quite some time now. Despite managing to rally aggressively out of its December low last year, shares came right back down towards the $110 mark before printing what we hope will end up being a final bottom here. The problem though with depressed stocks is that they can take their time to return to rallying mode. McKesson at present trades with a book multiple of 2.5 and a cash flow multiple of 7.5. These numbers are significantly below the industry and McKesson's five-year averages.We believe at present there is a strong possibility of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern playing out on the technical chart. Sometimes in technical analysis, traders can make the error of seeing what they want to see instead of observing the cold harsh truth of the price action on the chart.Therefore, from that note, let's take a look at the chart to see if McKesson really is undergoing an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern at present.A head-and-shoulders pattern (either normal or inverse) consists of two shoulders (red arrows) and a head (blue arrow). The black trend line drawn above is called the neckline. This trend line needs to be closed above in order for the multi-month pattern to be completed.Although that rising trend line can be taken as a sign of market strength, it still is roughly $20 a share from the current share price. That is a long time to wait for a buy signal. What we need from McKesson over the near term is for last week's low to hold. This is imperative as it is crucial to the reversal pattern potential playing out.Volume also needs to up the ante in McKesson. In reversal head-and-shoulders patterns, volumes should gradually increase from the head. The head as we can see in the chart above took place on the 24th of December last year. Buying volume is definitely up since that point, but we need more of it to be confident that this particular pattern is being played out.With the S&P having confirmed its daily cycle low last Friday, now is the time for McKesson buyers to start stepping in. For existing investors who are underwater on their positions, we would recommend patience. So often, we see investors selling their shares way too soon once the share price comes back to more or less the original price paid. It seems to be that the longer the downturn (position in negative territory), the more likely the investor sells quickly once the share price rallies back somewhat. What may add to this bias is McKesson's below-average dividend of $1.56 per year or 1.31%.However, the dividend is not the only way shareholders are getting paid by this company at present. The amount of shares outstanding has come down by almost 90 million shares over the past decade. This is something shareholders many times overlook when evaluating a position in their portfolios. It isn't a surprise therefore to see earnings expectations slowly drift upwards as the float comes down. Over time, we believe these growing earnings will definitely move the needle with respect to the share price.Furthermore, sustained strong buybacks and strong growth in the dividend look likely due to how management is allocating its capital. Over the past five years, free cash flow never came in below $2.5 billion in a fiscal year. In the company's latest fiscal year (which ended in March 2018), the firm bought back $1.7 billion of its own stock and paid out $262 million of dividends. This total of $1.97 billion came out of free cash flow kitty of $3.76 billion. No problems here, with these financing activities being covered by free cash flow.Therefore, to sum up, we would urge long-term holders to wait at least until $137 is closed above. Why? Because that is the level on the neckline which would bring in a lot of technical buyers. We would expect a strong trending move to take place if that key resistance level can be closed above. Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it's how we behave while we're waiting. Don't cut yourself short here by selling too soon."
4233784,67113,2019-01-16T14:21:53-05:00,Profit margins have been plummeting.Sales and assets continue to rise.We continue to see an undervalued stock here.,"We have consistently stated that even if there is a serious disruption in this sector, McKesson (MCK) has enviable logistics, procurement, and distribution assets at its disposal. These assets and expertise give this stock significant downside protection, in our opinion, as they would be continued to be used in some shape or form. We believe McKesson has pivoted well in recent times in the face of fierce pricing pressures. The company took action and restructured by reducing overhead and by beefing up its numbers with Albertsons and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).Although McKesson shares have rallied more than 10% over the past 3 weeks, we remain underwater on our position. In this article, we are going to delve into McKesson's declining profit margins. Profit margins in this sector have always been razor-thin, so the recent decline in this metric as far as McKesson is concerned would definitely not have gone unnoticed. Currently, McKesson's gross margin and operating margins have declined to 5.4% and 1.4% respectively. These numbers may look poor on the surface but profit margins are not the be-all and end-all of a successful business as long as other key metrics stack up. Let's discuss.Currently, McKesson is increasing its top-line revenues at a run rate of about 3% per year on average. This number may be below the 5%+ ""3-year average number"", but despite the price squeeze we have seen in recent times, the appetite definitely still seems to be there for revenues to grow consistently. From rising revenues, the objective is to accomplish rising operating income which again the company is achieving.Operating income over a trailing 12-month average currently comes in at almost $3 billion. This key metric over the past decade has almost tripled whereas top-line sales have only doubled throughout that time frame. We also like that the firm's free cash flow coverage has remained very consistent over the past decade. This is the first part of the equation regarding McKesson. The firm has a proven track record of converting sales into profit and then into cash.Assets, though, are what essentially grow sales every year. Growing assets are the foundation of every successful business. This is where the price to book ratio comes in which basically informs us about how much assets we are getting from our investment. With McKesson's market cap now coming in at around $23.7 billion, the current price to book ratio is hovering around 2.5. This is right on the industry average but well below McKesson's 5-year average of about 4.2.This may be oversimplified, but this metric is where investors who are sitting on the fence should be focusing their attention on. Historically, whenever McKesson's book multiple was this low, share price gains always came in the aftermath. Why? Because the company continued to increase its assets which later resulted in more sales. Assets can increase on a balance sheet if rising sales give way to rising profits and cash which can then be used to buy more assets. Presently, the numbers and forward-looking projections are suggesting that this successful cycle is not at risk of changing anytime soon in McKesson.Remember, as long as the sales and book multiple stack up, we should not have to be overly concerned with McKesson's profit margin. The firm's current sales multiple which is slightly higher than 0.1 is at its lowest level over the past decade (sales though are rising). The book multiple as stated is well below its historic averages (company assets continue to rise in dollars).We believe these key metrics will gradually rise over the next year or so which should result in margins following suit. The scale of this company, as well as the bullish fundamentals in the pharmaceutical and specialty drug areas, should result in a bounce back in the share price of McKesson before long. Remaining long."
4228767,67113,2018-12-17T13:26:15-05:00,"This company looks likes a solid value play.It remains out of favour with the market.The company, though, is still expected to grow.We foresee a long-term bottom here in the near term.","We have been long McKesson Corporation (MCK) for quite some time now and continue to sit on a paper loss. Shares closed below $117 a share last Friday which was a sizable 5%+ down-move for the day. When uncertainty or fear grips a company, we invariably go back to the fundamentals to ascertain whether the sustained downtrend in the share price will continue.The fear of an encroaching disruptor such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) into this space along with more specific company internal events has resulted in McKesson losing around half of its market cap over the past 3 and a half years. However, let's compare present numbers to that of 2015, for example. Revenues have actually grown from just over $179 billion in 2015 to almost $211 billion over the past four quarters. Operating income has only dropped by $135 million over the same time period. Now just think about that. Revenue is up over the past 3 years and operating income is down only 4% in the same time frame, yet the share price has been literally cut in half due to growth concerns.Sometimes, though, severe pricing pressures (which McKesson has undergone) can result in a far leaner company model going forward. We believe McKesson responded as well as they could; for example (to the loss of the Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) business) by beefing up their existing business with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Albertsons (NYSE:ACI). Furthermore, laser focus around cost cutting led to lay-offs and the sale of the firm's hospital and health IT business to Allscripts (NASDAQ:MDRX). A lot of the ""fat"" you feel has vacated operations which should keep McKesson's operating income elevated in our opinion. Let's look at the firm's current valuation below.Currently, the firm has a book multiple of 2.4 and a cash flow multiple of 7.2. Both are well under the average multiples this industry currently trades at. A low cash flow multiple is always desired if the unexpected was to happen. If the economy was to tank or if pricing pressures were to persist, having plenty of cash invariably means that one has a far better chance of managing the situation. McKesson's float is now well under 200 million as a result of strong buybacks over the past few years. These buybacks are the result of strong free cash flow which the company continues to generate.Analysts who cover this stock expect earnings to grow by mid-single digits over the next few years (fiscal year ends in March). McKesson's forward earnings multiple is currently 8.3. The industry average is over 21. Therefore, it is pretty obvious the divergence between the declining share price and rising earnings will not continue. Soon enough and as long as McKesson can deliver what is expected, we expect the market to come to its senses about this stock.Currently, McKesson has $9.3 billion of equity on its balance sheet. Its market cap is $22.8 billion. By dividing the book value into the market cap, we get a book multiple of 2.45. What does this number actually mean and why is it important? It basically means that for every $1 we invest, we get $0.41 in assets. Now assets mean everything in this industry. From distribution to logistics to warehousing, company assets basically fuel the sales cycle every year. Company assets on the balance sheet at present equate to just over $61 billion. The amount of assets which the company reports on its balance sheet has increased by about $36 billion over the past decade. Sales under the same time period have more or less doubled. Therefore, it stands to reason that as assets increase, top line revenues also increase. Well over the past 10 years, the market cap of this company on average has been 3.4 times more than the book value of the company. Furthermore, we are including 2008 numbers in this calculation. Just a return to its average here would give us a market cap of $31.62 billion which consequently would give us a share price of $162.To conclude, we feel this stock has all the hallmarks of a solid value play. The disconnect between the declining share price and growing earnings will ultimately result in the market repricing this stock upwards. Remember it is the assets the company has which is the source of real value here. Whatever way this industry gets run in the future, those assets have proved themselves time and time over. Moreover, at present, one can buy those assets on the cheap. Remaining long."

McKesson delivers 1/3 of all medications used daily in North America.McKesson business case is quite simple. It connects buyers and sellers and at the same time benefit from difficult-to-match scale advantages. U.S. drug distribution is a mature industry with three players - McKesson, AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC), and Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH). Based on data from Bloomberg, McKesson has generated in the last 5 years $17bn of FCF. During that period, average FCF was around $3.4bn. Today, the market cap is close to $23bn and based on estimates (next 5 years), we can expect that McKesson will generate cumulative FCF ($14bn) near to 60% of its market capitalization.McKesson faces some challenges in its European business (increased competition in France and reimbursement cuts in the UK were in excess of historical levels and greater than the company had planned for on its fiscal 2019 guide). Furthermore, there has also been some customer turnover and repricing of contracts that make the market nervous.There are short-term challenges and McKesson is in the process of offsetting these headwinds. In the UK, McKesson continues to evaluate its footprint and cost structure to stabilize the business, all led by a newly-appointed president. Also, McKesson has established cost-saving target of gross pre-tax annual run rate of $300-400m by end of FY21.We can see that McKesson has hired underwriters for an initial public offering of Change Healthcare that could value it at as much as $12bn, including debt (source Reuters article). In that case, the potential IPO of Change Healthcare could unlock value for shareholders.As humans, we are usually focused on things which have a bright future (huge markets, high growth potential, technology-based and etc.), but somehow we skip industries which are less attractive. In McKesson's case, market shows consistent growth as the population ages and requires increasing and specialized array of drug treatments. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the estimated total amount of retail pharmaceutical spending in the U.S. is close to $400bn. The majority of this spending flows through the operations of the major three pharmaceutical distributors. The U.S. healthcare industry should continue to grow in the mid-term period. Total market sales CAGR 2017 to 2022 should be around 5%.Some of the factors that could cause McKesson business strategy to fail: (i) weak macroeconomic environment in the US and international markets; (ii) failure to anticipate changes in the market environment (new customer requirements); (iii) failure with M&A policy; (iv) during 2018, sales to the ten largest customers accounted for approximately 51.7% of the total consolidated revenues (sales to the largest customer, CVS Health, accounted for approximately 19.9% of the total consolidated revenues); (v) less able to negotiate price terms with suppliers due to the fact that in recent years the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation (the ten largest suppliers in 2018 accounted for approximately 41% of McKesson's purchases); (vi) legal judgments, fines, penalties, or settlements and etc.In addition, I would like to mention that McKesson has total debt of $7bn, which seems sustainable at this moment, but we should be careful. The other two risks come from a failure to anticipate and proper response to competition and failure to adequately allocate capital.It is the question what to look when you talk about multiples. I believe Jeff Bezos gave the best answer in its annual letter in 2004. At the beginning of the letter, he said:Therefore, based on data from Bloomberg, McKesson has generated a positive FCF each year since 2009. On average for the next 5 years, average estimate of FCF is around $2.8bn (from Bloomberg). At the same time, McKesson's management gave an estimate for 2019.If we assume the FCF for the next year would be at the level between $2.8-3.0bn, then McKesson trades at a price to free cash flow multiple of 7.9x. The company has some debt, and in that case, enterprise value to free cash flow multiple is around 10.3x.In addition, McKesson estimates adjusted EPS of $13.20 to $13.80 per diluted share in fiscal 2019. If we use a mid-range point, that translates to P/E ratio of 8.6x.Looking at the Bloomberg multiple estimates (P/E and EV/EBIT) for 2019 and 2020 and comparing them with last 5-year average, we can conclude that McKesson is trading below its average level.If we remove ourselves from noise and market volatility and focus on the big picture, then we can see that McKesson has only two major competitors, provides critical services, and benefits from an aging population that will increasingly consume drugs. Valuation-wise, the company seems to trade at reasonable multiples with the capital allocation tilt to share buybacks. Furthermore, we can see Baupost Group has increased its stake during Q3 2018 and McKesson now accounts for around 2.3% of the portfolio."

Click here to find out more »Over the past few years McKesson's (MCK) stock has periodically afforded investors the chance to buy a high-quality business, which operates in an oligopoly with attractive returns on capital, for bargain prices. The stock has recently traded at these levels and seems poised to again offer an opportunity for long-term investors to take advantage of short term noise. The rest of this article outlines the industry background, business fundamentals, as well as a valuation that provides investors with a substantial margin of safety.McKesson operates as one of three main players in the wholesale pharmaceutical distribution industry alongside AmerisourceBergen (ABC) and Cardinal Health (CAH). Overall, pharmaceutical sales in the U.S. benefit from a number of long-term tailwinds, namely:An aging population, specifically individuals age 65 and older. This group represents the fastest growing segment of the population and also the largest consumer of healthcare and pharmaceutical products and services. Per AmerisourceBergen's 2019 10-K, this segment is expected to reach 65 million in 2023 from ~50 million today.Ongoing introductions of new pharmaceutical technologies and drug therapies. Pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to pour billions into R&D to develop drugs to fight new and existing ailments, and the spending is only expected to increase over time.The drug distributors specifically stand to benefit from an increase in generic pharmaceuticals being introduced to the market. Amidst a continued governmental push to lower the cost of healthcare in conjunction with several prominent branded drugs experiencing patent expiration over the coming years, generic drug volumes are expected to rise. While McKesson's revenues are hurt by an increased volume of generic drugs, profit margins are higher on generics leading to a net benefit in profitability if generic drugs grow in relation to their branded counterparts.All of these factors, discussed in more detail in AmerisourceBergen's 2019 10-K, contribute to an estimated 4%+ CAGR in pharmaceutical sales through 2023.While these tailwinds favor the industry over the long-term, there are a few areas of uncertainty hanging over the industry which have caused depressed valuations over the past few years.First, drug manufacturers, distributors, and pharmacies are subject to ongoing litigation related to the well-publicized opioid crisis. While the key industry participants appear to be nearing a settlement, questions regarding the size (and timing) of the payments have created an uncertainty that Wall Street abhors. There has been a push in recent years to lower drug prices leading to a reduction in reimbursement rates. This has led to margin compression for McKesson and other distributors. As a result, operating margins have decreased from 2.9% in 2014 to around 2% currently.These factors have been the primary drivers leading McKesson to trade at valuations normally reserved for troubled businesses in cyclical industries - providing an excellent entrance point for investors willing to wait through some of the short-term noise.McKesson possesses a number of desirable characteristics which comprise a sizable moat for the business.Entry barriers are high in the pharmaceutical distribution industry given the low operating margins. McKesson has consistently generated slightly less than 1.5% net income margins. They have been able to generate such healthy returns on capital due to their scale. Replicating this scale from a new market entrant would require accepting heavy losses for years, which is one of the primary reasons the space has become an oligopoly between the three major players.Another factor inhibiting entry into the space is governmental regulation and the associated complexity. Drug distributors have stringent traceability, quality, privacy, and other requirements imposed by the DEA, FDA, DOJ, and others. Complying with and managing these mandates require expertise and infrastructure that are difficult and time-consuming to replicate, further discouraging new entrants.Furthering their moat, distributors serve an essential purpose in the drug industry. Moving an extremely high volume of regulated product between manufacturers and pharmacies is a complex but important aspect of the pharma industry. Pricing pressure and lawsuits aside, McKesson's services are needed and can be thought of as the ""plumbing"" of the drug industry. Distributors have faced periods of major uncertainty before (especially in the early 2000s with ""channel stuffing"" becoming a point of emphasis) and have adjusted and continued to drive profitability amidst a shifting landscape.Because of these advantages, McKesson enjoys attractive economics. Ongoing capex is very low in relation to operating cash flow (~$4B of operating cash flow vs. $400M in capex for 2019) and the business is able to operate with low working capital levels (less than $1B) leading to consistent returns on tangible equity of over 100%.Warren Buffett has often described his ""ideal business"" as a company who requires very little capital and earns high returns on that capital. McKesson certainly appears to check this box. John Huber of Saber Capital Management recently published an article discussing the advantages of benefiting off of others capital investments, noting: ""Getting the benefit from someone else's debt without having to pay interest on it or pay it back is a great business model."" McKesson has essentially benefited from the billions of dollars pharmaceutical manufacturers have spent developing drugs and the billions of dollars pharmacy companies have invested in building locations to dispense the drugs to consumers. To be sure, Huber is citing software companies such as Microsoft who have and continue to grow at a much faster clip than McKesson from this phenomenon, but the dynamic and resulting economics are still highly attractive.After adjusting for nonrecurring events and non-cash expenses McKesson has consistently generated increasing levels of free cash flow. Note the rolling 7-year trend below in operating and free cash flow growth (from December's analyst meeting). This positive trend comes amidst a time of significant uncertainty and challenges in the industry as discussed above, which bodes well for the business when questions from some or all of the factors discussed above subside in the drug and healthcare industry.Figure 1. McKesson Cash Flow Trends. Source: McKesson December Analyst MeetingDespite generating healthy growth in operating cash flow, the business does not require significant capital to be reinvested. This, combined with the fact that drug distributors operating at near negative working capital levels explain the attractive return on tangible capital. For the last fiscal year, McKesson generated over $3.5B in free cash flow on less than $2B of tangible invested capital (net working capital + PP&E).Also of note, it's not as if the business generates exceptional returns on equity due to its use of excessive leverage, as McKesson sports an investment-grade balance sheet. The company has a little over $7B in long term debt with just under $4B maturing within 5 years, all extremely manageable levels given the levels of cash consistently generated.Historically McKesson has followed a blended approach between investing in growth M&A and returning capital to shareholders. The slide below from the December analyst day illustrates the last couple of year's capital allocation mix:Figure 2: 2017-2019 Capital Allocation. Source: December Analyst MeetingOver the past decade McKesson has spent roughly 40% of operating cash it has generated on share repurchases and dividend payments. Based on history investors can expect around a 5-6% total shareholder yield between buybacks and dividends over time. Particularly given the recent valuation of the shares (discussed below), I would expect and be pleased to see a continued focus from management on emphasizing share repurchases. History would support this as a likely continued priority going forward.Below is a comparison of McKesson's current (as of the end of 2019) valuation on a number of different measures compared to its average since 2009. Note these items are normalized for non-recurring items and significant non-cash charges that in my view aren't representative of an ongoing operating environment.Table 1: Historical Valuation Measures. Source: Created by Author Using Data from 10K FilingsBecause of swings in working capital due to the timing of inventory fluctuations in the distribution space, I find the most appropriate and easiest valuation measure for the business to be on a pre-tax earnings basis (adjusted for non-recurring and significant non-cash expenses).Clearly McKesson has earned exceptional rates on historical capital invested in the business, but to get a sense of forward-returns, I'll take a look at what returns on incremental invested capital (I-ROIC) have been over the past 10 years. McKesson has retained roughly $24B (cumulative operating cash flow + net debt issuance since '09), and has generated $2.3B growth in operating cash flow (normalized margin) over the same period. This corresponds to roughly a 10% I-ROIC, not bad. They have retained about 60% of earnings in the business, which leads to an expected compounding rate in intrinsic value of ~6.0% (I-ROIC x reinvestment rate) over the long term.Table 2: Return on Incremental Invested Capital: Source: Created by Author Using Data from 10K FilingsSo in a base-case, I would expect my returns to roughly mirror the company's historical compounding rate + benefit from dividends and buybacks. Any change in multiple (which I think is very likely) would be the cherry on top. See the table below for an outline of expected returns over the next five years.A note on the valuation multiple: to me, a business that operates in a highly regulated oligopoly, which is likely to grow faster than GDP for years to come, and that earns well above-average returns on its invested capital is worth at least the market average. To be conservative I'll use 13x pretax earnings as a benchmark. This aligns with the average over the last decade. If you exclude the last two years when the stock has traded at a discount to its historical valuation because of the reasons cited above, the average price to pre-tax earnings is closer to 15x.This analysis assumes that the company is revalued from its recent ~8x price/PTE (roughly $137/share) to the historical ~13x price/PTE over the next 5 years and that future dividends + buybacks average the same percentage of market cap as the last 10 years (5.4%).Table 3: Forward Returns. Source: Created by Author Using Data from 10K FilingsThe business is currently guiding for adjusted operating profit to rise 3-5% this year, which is below the historical compounding rate, but given all of the near-term headwinds mentioned above this is not surprising. Given the continued expected growth in the pharmaceutical market and aging population, the cost savings initiatives underway at the business (mentioned below), and a normalization in reimbursement rates and generic vs. branded drug mix, I don't have any reason to believe over the long-term the business can't continue to compound at roughly its 6% historical rate. Of course I could be wrong, but even if the business compounds at half the historical rate (3%), maintains the shareholder yield (5%), and correspondingly is valued at 10x pretax earnings, net returns would be roughly 12% per year over 5 years, still satisfactory for me.The most attractive part of the investment in my view is the margin of safety. In a scenario in which pretax earnings decline 2.5% per year, share count remains flat, and pretax multiple remains around 8x, the investment would essentially be dead-money to slightly negative. In other words the risk of permanent loss of capital seems remote. This appears to be a classic ""heads I win, tails I don't lose much"" scenario.Of course the investment does not come without risks, which stem from the two major uncertainties in the drug industry discussed above.Opioid SettlementAn opioid settlement far exceeding what the market has priced-in is certainly a risk. While this is a possibility, and it appears a settlement between the three distributors, two manufacturers and the states of around $50B is what lawmakers are looking for. This likely entails a roughly 50-50 split of cash and future commitments to pay for health care, law enforcement and other costs related to the epidemic. Assuming the liabilities are shared roughly equally between the five parties (this may not ultimately be the case) this would equate to about a $10B liability for McKesson. Given the companies cash on hand and excess debt capacity, combined with the likely extended payout of the settlement, the business could comfortably handle a liability of this size.I think it is unlikely the settlement is materially higher given the advanced talks the company is currently in combined with the fact that McKesson is simply a distributor and not a manufacturer/marketer of opioids, who presumably would face an outsized brunt of an increased settlement. Nonetheless this risk is something with which an investor needs to be comfortable.Also, in my opinion it's likely that as soon as the settlement has been finalized, McKesson will be re-valued higher (even if the settlement is slightly worse than anticipated) simply due to the fact that the uncertainty, which Wall Street abhors, will be cleared up.Margin PressureAnother risk is gross margin compression gets worse and the business doesn't realize the modest growth it is guiding towards.It's feasible that reimbursement pressure (from political initiatives or other factors) or muted drug price inflation weighs further on gross margins in the coming years and suppresses the EPS growth that the management team is targeting. I think if this is the case it's unlikely to be too deep or prolonged given drug distributors already operate with low-single digit percentage margins, and there will come a point they cannot be squeezed further. They provide an essential service not easy to replicate in the drug industry, and even if margins are cut in half (a draconian scenario in my opinion) the current valuation provides enough margin of safety to limit any significant extended erosion in share price. The business is actively pursuing productivity and cost improvements to offset the impact of margin compression in its wholesale distribution segment and has made early progress against its targets. The company is in process of simplifying their operating model and consolidating SG&A, and has already delivered $50M of savings for H1 2020.As noted, the current valuation is essentially a no-growth valuation which further limits downside against this risk.Capital AllocationA third risk entails management's ability to effectively allocate capital. Capital allocation is a risk given the high levels of free cash flow generated annually. If management makes poor acquisition decisions, fails to buyback the stock at attractive levels, or makes a change to the dividend policy, the returns could suffer. Given this analysis looks back over the last decade and judging by managements commentary on capital allocation, I don't have any reason to believe their attitude will differ dramatically than in the past, which is what my assumptions are predicated on.Short-term uncertainty affords long-term investors the opportunity to buy a shareholder-friendly business that generates attractive returns on capital and operates in a growing industry protected by moats at a significant discount to intrinsic value. Given the stock has run up in value a bit in recent days, to me at a price of $137 (levels McKesson has recently traded for and which the analysis was based) or less I would be a willing buyer with an adequate margin of safety.McKesson may not be as likely to provide the home-run returns that some of the more speculative investment options could deliver, but on a risk-adjusted basis nearly 11 years into the current economic expansion cycle, buying a good business with expectations of high-teens to low-twenty's returns and a limited downside is highly attractive to me."

In this report, I’ll summarize the risk and reward in an investment thesis and show the value investing perspective on this. Value investing focuses on the value of the underlying business, and when the stock trades with a margin of safety to that, it is a buy. So, let’s see what has Seth Klarman been buying.MCK is a company that distributes drugs. Can there be a better business, especially if it is legal? It had $208 billion in revenues in 2018 and operating cash flows of $3.8 billion. It delivers 1/3 of all prescription medicine in North America.Source: MCKWe all know the population is aging, and there is nothing that can be done in relation to that. Perhaps an interesting trend to invest in, and MCK certainly gives us exposure to that. We have to see how big of a moat their business has and whether, and how much, it will be affected by the various Amazons etc. entering the field.Source: MCKIt is important that they can invest in growth but also reward shareholders. We will see later about the return on capital.Source: MCKBut before that, let me compare the bull and bear thesis.Let’s start with the value investing bull thesis as a few value investing funds have opened a position in MCK.The main investing thesis is that the stock has declined from a high of $240 to the current lows, while the business fundamentals haven’t changed.Source: CNN Money MCKOn the fundamental side, revenues have been growing steadily and doubled over the past 10 years (line 1). Gross margins and operating income have been relatively stable while the dividend has tripled (line 2). Alongside dividends, the company had extra cash to do buybacks as it lowered the number of outstanding shares by 27% over the last 10 years (line 3), but at the same time, it doubled its book value (line 4). Operating cash flows have been increasing (line 5) while the business doesn’t really need much capital to grow as the capital spending is just 15% of the operating cash flow or less (line 6). All the above brings lots of free cash flow that can be used to reward shareholders (line 7). From this point of view, MCK has all the characteristics of a great business.Source: MCK MorningstarWhen such a great business can be bought at a fair price, value investors jump in. The current market cap is $24.5 billion, while the free cash flow over the last 12 months has been $2.7 billion for a price to free cash flow ratio of 9. Also, if I sum up MCK’s free cash flow over the last 9 years, it equals its current market capitalization.Source: MCKThis means that if we assume MCK to have the same business results over the next 9 years as it has had over the past 9 years, investors would get their money back in 9 years and still, after 9 years, own the business.I’ll use Netflix (NFLX) as an example of a company that has negative free cash flows and that is not able to reward shareholders. It is definitely an exciting stock, offering huge growth, but the business model is not amazing, and it is not a cash-producing business yet. Value investors prefer boring, cash-printing businesses and avoid exciting growth stocks.Source: NFLX MorningstarAnother positive for MCK is its scale; owning 1/3 of the medicine prescription market in North America is a big deal. It has contracts with CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) mail order, Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Albertsons (NYSE:ACI) etc. Further, 3 companies control 90% of the pharma distribution market. MCK, AmerisourceBergen (ABC), and Cardinal Health (CAH). It would be extremely costly for new entrants to build what these 3 companies have built, their distribution networks, warehouse efficiency etc.When it comes to great businesses, return on invested capital is key. MCK has had an ROIC of around 12% over the past 10 years. If the company continues to do that, you can expect its value to compound at that rate. The funny thing is that by investing at the current FCF valuation, you are close to paying a fair price for this.Source: MCKTotal shareholder returns in 2018 have been $1.9 billion. On the current market cap, that is a yield of 7.7%. This is what you can expect in the future if the valuation remains where it is. But if the ROIC continues to be at 12% and the growth continues, that can only grow.MCK’s long-term debt is just $8 billion, on $3 billion of operating cash flows per year.Source: MCK MorningstarDespite the buybacks and dividends, the book value has doubled over the past ten years and is currently at $47.73. With $13.16 of free cash flow per share, the return on book value is a staggering 27%. Compound that over time and we can only imagine where will MCK lead shareholders if things continue as they are now. However, there must be something wrong with the company too. If not, the stock price would be at $240 as it was a few years ago.There have been some headwinds lately that have put pressure on the business and consequently on the stock. As Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) acquired half of Rite Aid’s (NYSE:RAD) stores, MCK lost part of its revenue, and there have been major pricing pressures in the industry that have affected MCK’s profit growth.Further, the complete drug industry is shifting, and there is more pricing pressure from payers. It is inevitable that MCK will feel the pain of this industry trend, but, as with any other business, there are always risks; if MCK manages to mitigate those risks by increasing efficiency and cost savings, it will continue to do well for shareholders.Two other concerns are Amazon (AMZN) and the opioid epidemic issue. We know what has Amazon been doing to retailers over the past decade, and when a player like that acquires a company like PillPack, it is a good time to be concerned.Source: CNBCThe market significantly reacted to the above, but we have to keep in mind that PillPack had revenues of $100 million in 2017, which is not much compared to the $208 billion for MCK.Now, let us assume the worst-case scenario, that AMZN becomes a big player in the industry. How long is it going to take it to become a significant player there? We have seen it acquire Whole Foods, but did it immediately impact other grocery stores and their business results? Of course, not.Further, the population is aging, both in the US and in Europe where MCK acquired German drug wholesaler Celesio in 2013. So, let’s say AMZN takes 3% of the market year by year over the next 10 years. It will end up owning 30% of the market. However, we can expect the market to unfortunately grow at 5% per year.Source: MCKSo, MCK could end up growing at 2% per year even if AMZN becomes the dominant player in the industry. However, the market’s growth is an issue that is also putting pressure on MCK due to the opioid epidemic. Before discussing that, let’s say that MCK doesn’t grow at all over the next 10 years. This would mean that its free cash flows would be around $25 billion, which is the current market capitalization. Whatever value is left after 10 years, it would be a bonus to those who invest in MCK today. And that is why value investors have been buying MCK. The cash flows are the value, while the future potential is the margin of safety. In case of further stock price declines, someone would probably snap it and bring it private.If you are an opioid distributor, your goal is to sell as much as you can. This can create a distorted picture of what is actually good for the patient or not. The daily doses of opioids in the 20 most populous countries show a staggering statistic. If the US or Germany would fall to the Japanese average, revenues for MCK would decline significantly.Source: QZJust as a note:Source: The Lancet Commission on Global Access to Palliative Care and Pain ReliefI am personally fortunate that since my wife has taken care of my nutrition over the past 7 years, I have not taken any kind of pill. So, if my wife gets famous, that is another risk for MCK.I really don’t like the big pharma and the way they go about promoting what they make. If the same amount of money would be spent for promoting eating broccoli, people would live much longer. However, I also have a responsibility to show the best risk reward investments out there to my investment community and consequently also invest in the best businesses out there.When it comes to what to expect from investing in MCK, the first thing we have to keep in mind is the 7.7% investors yield in the form of buybacks and dividends. Further, the capital that gets reinvested will probably yield 12%, and the market will grow probably at 3-5%. This means that MCK’s revenues will probably double in the next 10 years and profits too. This would bring the stock to double over the next 10 years in addition to giving you a yield of 7.7%. The return from the stock doubling would be 7% that in addition to the 7.7% shareholder yield gives you a return of 15% per year if it remains business as usual for MCK.If the market calms down, the current concerns become mere overreactions, and the price to cash flow goes to 15, the market cap could quickly jump to $45 billion, which implies an upside of 87%.On the downside, there will probably be some fines, more negative sentiment etc. That might put significant pressure on the stock but not on the long-term business, something to keep in mind.I am going to look at it a bit deeper, listen to the conference calls, see about my negative feeling for the pharma sector in general and then also compare it to other potential investments."
4250616,67113,2019-03-22T20:02:38-04:00,Long-term volume has been diverging from price for going on 3 years.Momentum indicators are also diverging on the long-term chart.Remaining Long.,"There is no denying that value investing is difficult. Growth investing is popular because one can hop on the existing trend and take advantage of the momentum. Value investing is all about going against the grain and investing when sentiment surrounding the particular investment is extremely pessimistic. Value investors need an awful lot of confidence in their stock picks, plus buckets of patience in order to be able to ride out what could be months if not years of depressed prices. Having the stomach and patience to withstand a market, for example, that is going vertical can be very difficult because one can believe that they're missing out on potential gains.Valuation is secondary in growth investing as it is all about following the trend. The most important thing is that one doesn't get caught at the top. As long as one can control greed (plus also have someone to sell your shares to before the inevitable top comes), then one can be successful in growth investing.The very opposite of this approach is to remain invested in the stock which continues to make lower lows. We have been doing this for some time now specifically with our McKesson (MCK) position. As the chart shows below, shares have been in a sustained downtrend since mid-2015. However, we are determined to stay the course for the following reasons.As we can see from the chart above, McKesson's on-balance volume (OBV) has been rising convincingly over the past few years despite the drop in the share price. We believe that volume precedes price. Suffice it to say, McKesson's chart at present is showing that downward pressure is losing its momentum. If the downtrend were to continue, for example, selling volume should be much heavier than buying. Long-term volume numbers are clearly diverging from price, which, in our opinion, means a trend change eventually will come to fruition.We have divergences also on the RSI oscillator indicator, for example. The recent 2018 lows dropped to lower prices than the 2016 lows. However, the RSI did not follow price to new lows. This is the second divergence we see on the long-term McKesson chart which leads us to believe that the trend change will eventually come.When the trend change actually comes (which basically means when we start making higher highs again) can be very difficult to ascertain. The daily chart at present is giving a buying signal when we use the triple crossover moving average strategy. When we insert the 4-day, the 9-day, and the 18-day moving averages on the chart, we can see that the 4-day at present is now trading above the other moving averages.This has traditionally been a buying signal as it confirms that the trend has changed (at least on a daily setting). Obviously, the moving averages on the chart are off a daily setting, so the pending potential up-move in the share price may not be the start of a long-term trend change just yet. However, higher weekly and yearly highs can only commence after higher highs on the daily chart. Therefore, considering that stocks more than likely printed a multi-year cycle-low last December means McKesson should be able to ride the tailwind of rising equity prices here.We have consistently stated that the enterprise McKesson is involved in will not go away anytime soon. Even if a direct model came to prowess over the next decade, for example, valuable assets such as logistics expertise and distribution operations will continue to be adopted. The sheer scale of McKesson's operations should keep competitors at bay, especially when you consider the ultra-thin margins in this industry.To sum up, MCK has been a very difficult hold over the past 3+ years. Equities, in general, have marched forward whereas McKesson has seriously underperformed. We continue to believe, though, that a more sustained trend change is coming in the not too distant future. Remaining long."
4203868,103890,2018-09-04T10:03:59-04:00,"In this article, I will take a quantitative approach to analyzing MCK. This piece will solely focus on the numerical value of the business from three different perspectives.MCK has fallen from $244 a few years ago to a 52-week high of $179 to a current price of $130. From overvalued to undervalued.Despite potential for about a 25% return when including the small dividend, there are some strange things going on - namely regarding the book value and EPS mismatch.","McKesson's (NYSE:MCK) stock price has been hovering in place for quite some time now. In this piece, I will assign my fair share value for McKesson from two different perspectives: FastGraphs analysis and Discounted Cash Flow Analysis, while also analyzing their book value.McKesson has two core business segments, which they identify as McKesson Distribution Solutions and McKesson Technology Solutions. Their Distribution Solutions segment consists of three main sections: North American Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services (PDS), International PDS, and Medical-Surgical Distribution Services. Their North American pharmaceutical distribution and services business is the largest pharmaceutical distributer in the United States. Their Technology Solutions segment consists of their equity investment in Change Healthcare and formerly consisted of Enterprise Information Solutions (EIS) business, which they sold for $169 million on Oct. 2nd, 2017.Looking at FastGraphs, we can see that the company is trading well below its earnings line. If we were to take the normal P/E and multiple it by the current earnings, we would get a price of about $220 per share. If we simply take a look at what the price should be given its earnings and earnings growth, we see a fair share price of about $190.SourceIn order to determine a company's equity value, the most standard methodology is a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. Many modelers will base their assumptions on what they expect the company will do, however, here at DocShah Economics we apply what the company has historically done. Each assumption used to power the DCF has been rooted in the historical performance of MCK going back almost a decade. For example, if we take the average revenue growth going back to 2009, we arrive at 7.43% (however, revenue jumped by 30% in 2015, so we must normalize that to a statistical mean of each of the other years. In doing so, we 'normalize' the one time large gain to what is a more accurate representation of their revenue growth). In doing so, average revenue growth since 2009 has been 4.91%. MCK's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is 9.76%.Many investors forget that operating leases, while an ""off balance sheet activity"" is still debt and thus, must be accounted for (pun intended) in calculating cost of debt, and subsequently WACC. Our conservative terminal growth rate is set at 2%, simply to keep up with inflation (for an interesting read on that subject matter, take a look at this piece I wrote on my blog.The summation of their discounted future free cash flows amounts to $40,134 million. From there we must subtract out debt, which is comprised of $6,751 million (long-term debt), $1,129 million (short-term debt), and $2,650 million (present value of operating leases). We add back the cash on hand, $2,672 million and subtract out minority interest $253 million to arrive at an equity value of $32,023 million. Then, we finally divide by the outstanding shares to arrive at a fair share price of $160.30.To justify the current share price of $130, revenue would have to grow at 1.3% per year. I find that scenario highly unlikely given the historical performance of MCK. And just to be cute, if you fancy ""what if"" scenarios… let's unnormalize 2015's revenue growth and make 7.43% the revenue growth per year. If that is the case then MCK would be worth $184.81.Furthermore, I baked into my valuation a shift towards higher taxes in 2021 (35%) because I like to be conservative in my valuations. So, if you were wondering if we were to have a change of political parties in 2020 and the corporate tax rate got hiked up again, I have got you covered.However, if we want to be as liberal as possible and were to hold a 25% corporate tax rate, using the 7.43% growth, the fair share of MCK would be $220.53 per share.MCK's Price/Book value is 2.64. This signifies that if you were to buy the business today, immediately liquidate all assets, and pay off all liabilities, you would only get 37.88% (1/2.64) of your money back. That's not a great margin of safety. However, McKesson's P/B ratio is better than its two biggest competitors, Cardinal Health (CAH) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC), which come in at 2.66 and 6.28 respectively. For comparison's sake, take a look at the article I wrote on Dick's Sporting Goods and their P/B value.In addition, MCK's Dividend CAGR since 1999 is only 4.3%. Management has recently picked up the pace in regards to raising dividends at a faster rate - since 2009, MCK's Dividend CAGR is 12.51%. Their dividend payout ratio is an incredibly low, 10%. With a 1.20% dividend yield and a miniscule payout ratio, there is lots of room for the dividend to exponentially grow. However, as of now, it offers a weak return, which may not align with your investing strategy. As a result, taking this approach shows that the company does not have a large margin of safety and does not offer much compensation in terms of dividends at least for now.McKesson's EPS CAGR since 2010 is 11.92%, while their book value CAGR in that same time period is only 6.39%. And if that wasn't enough to raise in eye, consider this: McKesson's CEO John Hammergren has drawn controversy for his exorbitant salary and bonuses - much of which derives from stock options. MCK had 271 million shares of common stock outstanding in 2009. Fast forward to 2018 and they only have 199 million shares of common stock outstanding. Companies buying back stock because their shares are undervalued is nothing to fear. Companies buying back to stock to artificially boost their EPS and value of executive stock options is something to fear.Furthermore, if we go to the DEF14A for MCK, released in conjunction with the annual proxy statement, we can find executive compensation information. MCK increased its Performance Stock Units (PSU) 25% in regards to its long-term incentives (LTI).SourcePSU are restricted stock awards granted in units as opposed to shares (each unit typically represents the same value as one share of stock) given to executives only if certain goals are met - one of which could be earnings per share targets. Could one possible explanation be that MCK has bought back 72 million shares in order to boost the value of the performance stock units and pay higher compensation to executive officers?That to me explains one possible reason why EPS grew (and subsequently stock price - CAGR of 9.94%) so drastically over the years, but that growth did not carry over to the book value. The logic goes something like this - if earnings grow dramatically, that money gets invested back in the company, which leads to more growth - higher book value. If earnings are not being converted to more earnings, then cash is effectively being squandered somewhere in the chain or EPS is being manipulated and there is no real earnings growth, just a decrease in outstanding shares.I threw a lot of numbers out there so let's quickly recap starting with FastGraphs:DCF:My goal was to present the case where MCK is undervalued. Stock prices tend to follow EPS growth, but we want organic earnings growth, not artificial growth from fewer shares.I believe in the current economy of cheap money and low rates that MCK has upside to $160 and most likely beyond given their historical track record of revenue growth. However, with that being said, we are investing in businesses, not ticker symbols. One should feel comfortable that management has the shareholders' best interest in mind. I think readers have to continue to dig deep with MCK and determine if it is the right fit for them. Hopefully this article sheds some light on McKesson's fair value.

4218275,103425,2018-11-05T13:16:45-05:00,"Over the past year, McKesson has faced significant volatility; much appears to be caused by headlines.It's an established firm with a wide moat and is widely considered undervalued.McKesson has two major problems, and it has control over neither.","McKesson (MCK) and its peer group have been negatively impacted by fearful investors concerned about the barrage of headlines suggesting recurring headwinds for the company. These fears can be substantiated, and may serve to prolong the historical disappointment McKesson has been for longer-term investors.Based on many metrics and calculations, McKesson may seem undervalued. However, to conclude that the 3-year divergence is short-term irrationality, short term must be defined. As the time frame for irrationality extends, sentiment becomes a precedent and a necessary factor in any investment thesis. This has become ever-more apparent under the headline attacks it currently faces. If fears cannot be substantiated, sentiment may quickly change. In other words, value is only a static characterization ceteris paribus. A tweet or a headline may not change the value proposition. A change in its market environment and reputational damage require the value proposition to be reexamined.This perspective works both ways. Amazon (AMZN) is widely considered overvalued by fundamental terms, but confidence surrounding future growth prospects supports its continuous fundamental valuation premium. I particularly enjoyed the exercise in this article by Kwan-Chen Ma, demonstrating a quantifiable premium that justifies Amazon's current/future valuation.Over the last four years, McKesson returned -40%, and it proceeded to fall below $120 after its 2Q revenue miss, when POTUS proposed a pricing index for Medicare. It's declined ~18% over the last year. The headlines in the chart consistently show two fears for prevailing sentiment:It's not just McKesson, though. The price performance of AmerisourceBergen (ABC) and Cardinal Health (CAH) suggests an industry-wide, negative attitude. Despite the divergence of the three companies' stock prices, each exhibits similar reactions at virtually all reference points. AmerisourceBergen has clearly fared the best, whereas Cardinal Health fared the worst.One may not know exactly when fear will abate or if these headwinds will prevail in affecting the long-term viability of the drug distribution business, but we can allocate capital to more stable industries with potential for a better return.It's no secret that McKesson lives with tiny margins. 5% GM and 0.9% pre-tax margin provide limited room to deal with market pressures, competition, and enhanced regulation.First, retail felt the seismic shift and fear that everything would then be sold online as Amazon grew into the retail behemoth it is. Next, it was grocers, as Amazon came in to cut Whole Foods' margins. Now, it's pharmacy. Amazon has repeatedly clarified its intentions, as it acquired PillPack for direct-to-consumer operations. It has distribution scale and customers that want easier pharmacy transactions. Realists doubt Amazon's ability to disrupt the big 3 distributors.McKesson may be insulated from Amazon. However, investors have to deal with fear because it affects stock price. For those not concerned about Amazon's entry, the question is when will the fear abate?The various stocks above are all related to retail in different ways. Kroger (KR) is primarily grocery. Target (TGT) is more of a general merchandise store. L Brands (LB) is fashion-oriented. Realty Income (O) is a REIT with various retail clients. TJX (TJX) is a discount fashion and home goods retailer. With the exception of TJX, the e-commerce fears seemed to grow between mid-2015 and mid-2016. While the fear persists in some stocks, some have recovered as early as mid-2017. Amazon, and the subsequent threat of Walmart's (WMT) attempts at competing, shook up the brick-and-mortar landscape for as long as two years. For the long-term investor, two years of underperformance with reversion could be tolerable. However, the S&P (SPY) gained 17% over the time period Target was suppressed. Where was the better place for your money? Hindsight is 20/20.Politicking is understood to be irrelevant to long-term stock performance, but consistent policy rhetoric and regulation can affect price action long term. Defense and financial stocks post-2016 election exemplify this principle. When international tensions rise and aggressive threats are made, the former sector prevails. When deregulation is projected, the latter stocks prevail.Healthcare is another good example. I wrote about Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI) being negatively impacted by long-term policy changes, and that autonomous-driving-related stocks would bear similar effects once the technology evolves enough to be seen as problematic. Although I did not write about the problems social media companies contributed to, Facebook (FB) is facing government scrutiny and new legislation over consumer data privacy. The company's financial health is reflecting these challenges and the stock is facing ongoing suppression.Two factors may mute a direct comparison of McKesson and the healthcare/social media/autonomous driving/utilities regulation:As a final example of government involvement and its effect on stocks, regulated utilities are considered safe havens in volatile markets because they have government-defined markets and are permitted to grow as needed. The government involvement doesn't necessarily hurt the stock as a valuable holding, but it certainly impacts how the stock is viewed. Given the mandated markets of regulated utilities, perhaps it would be more beneficial to view McKesson as a utility in your investment evaluation.Government scrutiny and actions change market dynamics, and they have real effects on stocks. The nearing midterm elections may create incendiary rhetoric and continued unsatisfactory performance. While Republicans and Trump have insisted that health care is too burdensome and have moved to reduce drug pricing, those issues cross party lines. Even a change of power in Congress would yield little relief on pharmaceutical stocks.Historically, McKesson's reputational concerns have surrounded its shareholder friendliness and its CEO's pay.Despite raising its dividend 14.7% after 1Q, it still lags its peers in terms of yield. This is even more substantial when comparing the price performance of ABC.CEO John Hammergren has notoriously made a lot of money since taking the job in 2001. For FY13, he took home $51.7M in total compensation, which was subsequently reduced to $25.9M for FY14. In 2015, he still made The Motley Fool's top 3 most overpaid CEOs. After 78% of shareholders voted against his compensation package, the board reduced his pension fund by $45M (from $159M). In addition to his pension, Mr. Hammergren totes a severance package totaling $300M. The compensation plan was again rejected in 2017, only supported by 26.5% of shareholders. As a result of the non-approval, the board is reducing Hammergren's pay by $1.95M for FY18, altering the incentive plan metrics, and linking future pay to opioid distribution risks. Simply Wall St. compared Hammergren's pay package to a group of other large companies and found that it's still above the median pay. Considering the stock performance over the last three years, it's generous. Fortunately for Mr. Hammergren, he has a comfortable severance package, but it's certainly not shareholder friendly.On November 1, 2018, McKesson announced that John Hammergren was set to retire in March of 2019. The stock sold off to the tune of ~3-4%. Given McKesson's other reputational risks, it's uncertain that a new CEO will aid stock price performance.Two high-profile acquisitions have increased interest in the effect of pharmaceutical middlemen. The Cigna (CI)/Express Scripts (ESRX) and CVS (CVS)/Aetna (AET) mergers have come with numerous reports of the effect of Pharmacy Benefits Managers (PBMs) on prescription prices.Ohio found that PBMs were billing Medicaid 8.8% more than private pharmacies for all drugs, and 31% more on generics. The state plans to start with fresh PBM contracts in 2019, emphasizing transparency and regulation, with mandates for pass-through pricing structures, as opposed to the current spread pricing structure. The change is estimated to save $16M in prescription costs.Bloomberg uncovered other data in an analysis of 500 different dosages and formulations of 90 different drugs. Medicaid insurers spent $4.2B on drugs, of which PBMs made $1.3B.The concerns don't seem to be isolated to Ohio. Take this comparison to Indiana (from Bloomberg):Iowa and Kentucky are undergoing similar investigative reports, skeptical of the lack of transparency.Numerous representative bodies in New York want to block the CVS/Aetna deal over drug pricing concerns. Independent pharmacists have reported volatile and unpredictable reimbursements from PBMs. I don't want to debate PBMs because it actually doesn't matter from an investor perspective. Of what the politicians convince their constituents, matters. In the end, the lack of transparency, the opaque benefits, and the truth matters little. All that anyone needs to see is that there's an added cost between the insurers and the pharmacy, and it can be cut. If you're interested, this is a broad piece with some fair points both ways.While McKesson doesn't operate a PBM, it functions as a similar middleman, making a spread on the end cost of the drug. It also provides services to PBMs. At the end of 2017, McKesson bought CVS Health's services unit RxCrossroads, now called RelayHealth. Its pharmacy solutions connect retail pharmacies to PBMs, physicians, government, and manufacturers. RelayHealth includes software for PBMs, ProPBM.The opioid epidemic is measured in pill volumes, prescriptions, lawsuits, and deaths. Below are a few statistics about opioids that may imply a uniquely American problem. They establish a basis for companies to be proactive in the well-being of its end-consumer. It's also another factor of McKesson's reputational damage.General Opioid/Drug StatisticsThe table below compares the countries that prescribe the most opioids. Hydrocodone is not prescribed in most countries due to its addictive properties, but it's the favorite in the U.S. It was a schedule III drug (can be refilled <6 times without a new prescription) in combination with other drugs (i.e., Vicodin: hydrocodone and acetaminophen). Hydrocodone Combination Products (""HCPs"") were reclassified schedule II in 2014. Fetanyl is popular in Germany because it's cheap and can be administered via patch.In total, the U.S. prescribes opioids more than the developed countries to which it's being compared. Yes, blame has been laid on doctors. Everything from lawsuits to music videos have damaged reputations of doctors who legitimately seek to alleviate the pain of their patients. Surely, doctors can't be the only ones to blame.Epidemic Statistics2016 statistics from the Kaiser Family Foundation. *The statistics may include deaths from illegally obtained opioids.Most of the statistics suggest that companies involved should have held some suspicion of unusual orders, and profiting off of social demise and addiction is (perhaps appropriately) looked down upon. It's easy to see how opioids could affect the stock. Can it claim willful ignorance? Could it be considered criminal facilitation? That's not for me to decide. The stock price will react anyway.McKesson has established an effort to aid in the relief of the opioid epidemic since the release of the 60 Minutes episode, including:Some are inherently skeptical about the effects of those efforts after the similarities to efforts from tobacco companies. Similarly, some legal personnel aren't convinced the hundreds of lawsuits will be effective in exacting change. One thing that stood out to me was the congressional testimony. As expected, all executives admitted to feeling terrible about the problem, but begrudgingly just tried to do business. When asked if their companies contributed to the crisis or failed to maintain effective controls in the past, only Joseph Mastandrea, CEO of Miami-Lunken, said ""yes"". Miami-Lunken has since closed. Its insurer wouldn't cover the costs of the DEA investigations and lawsuits. Smaller companies are unable to withstand the headwinds facing the industry, but will the Big 3 prevail or just endure prolonged suffering?Should the market return to all-time highs, McKesson should see recovery. It would be reasonable to resume its ~$135 range that occurred after Amazon's PillPack acquisition. However, the stock reacts (quite violently) to negative headlines, and will suffer political scrutiny. McKesson's margins are not robust enough to juggle its business and its shareholders, while the government throws darts at anything that incurs unnecessary costs. Given the apprehension in the market, the long, underperformance of value stocks, and the headwinds outlined above, McKesson is not the place for your money.This theory was part of my motivation to reduce my concentration in FANG stocks, particularly Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook. The reallocation is ongoing. I recently sold McKesson to put money into stocks with fewer headwinds. My biggest concern is the focus on drug pricing coinciding with midterms. The effort to reduce drug prices will continue should Republicans maintain control, but it may become a larger effort should Democrats take control as they seek success in a split government. In managing risk and repositioning my portfolio for volatility, I'm cutting losers to build cash for other positions.**Pain relief is absolutely necessary and opioids have safely provided many with such relief.

4195530,103970,2018-08-06T21:05:57-04:00,"The last 2 years earnings do not accurately show the real value of this company.
        Can this mammoth company with precise efficiency maintain its tight margins?
        Pressure from Amazon, stalled medicine price increases, and litigation raise more questions.
        Is this company a good play for long-term dividend investors?
        Factual evidence tells about the real value vs. stock price.","McKesson Corporation (MCK) is considered as one of the most efficient medical distribution companies that somehow has been growing even with super tight margins. But new pressures like Amazon entering its industry is causing shareholders to worry. In addition, pharmaceutical companies have stalled price increases, which affects McKesson’s ability to grow earnings. Finally, the company faces litigations over blame of being a catalyst for the opioid drug epidemic in USA.These are real concerns that will have significant effects for the company and industry, but this article will focus more on the facts and will reveal that MCK is not the same stable and consistent investment that it was in the past. We’ll also look closely at its real value compared to stock price. The conclusion will aim to help short-term investors make a more educated decision, while other patient, long-term investors might still be satisfied with holding it long term.A fast way for me to get an overall understanding of the condition of the business is to use the BTMA Stock Analyzer’s company rating score. It shows a score of around 66/100. Therefore, McKesson isn’t considered to be a good company to invest in, since 70 is the lowest good company score. McKesson has high scores for 10 Year Upward Price Per Share, Return on Equity, and Ability to Recover from a Market Downturn. It has average scores for EPS history. Lacking categories are Return on Invested Capital and PEG Ratio.These findings could indicate that McKesson might be a somewhat difficult business to predict since it is not showing good scores in many categories.Before jumping to conclusions, we’ll have to look closer into these categories to see what’s going on.(Source: BTMA Stock Analyzer - company rating scores)Let’s examine the price per share history first. In the chart below, we can see that price per share has experienced most of its growth after the economic crisis, from 2009 to 2015. But for the past 3 years, the share price average has mostly decreased. But overall, share price average has more than doubled over the past 10 years.(Source: BTMA Stock Analyzer – Price Per Share History)Looking closer at earnings history, we quickly see that earnings growth has been very steady from 2009 - 2016. But the past two years earnings have deviated dramatically from the consistent past. These recent inconsistent earnings make it much harder to accurately estimate the future growth and value of the company.So why was the EPS in fiscal 2017 so high? If you look closer into the financial statements of the company, you'll realize that this EPS of $22.73 is misleading. The Q4 of 2017 shows that the EPS was elevated due to a one-time transaction related to McKesson's recent merger and acquisition activity. Therefore, after removing this one-time transaction benefit, the adjusted EPS for the year is $11.61.Why is the EPS so low in fiscal 2018? You may have to dig even deeper to find out a more realistic earnings number for 2018, since there were several adjustments needed. After making these adjustments, we can use $12.62 for 2018 EPS instead of $0.32. Or if we want to be even more conservative for valuation purposes, we can use the normalized diluted EPS of $8.63.Adjusted Earnings per diluted share of $12.62 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018, excludes the following GAAP items:(Source: BTMA Stock Analyzer – EPS History)Since earnings and price per share don’t always give the whole picture, it’s good to look at other factors like the gross margins, return on equity, and return on invested capital.The return on equity history is fairly good for 2014 – 2016. But like earnings, there are huge deviations in years 2017 and 2018, because ROE is based on net income (or EPS) which we needed to make adjustments for.(Source: BTMA Stock Analyzer – ROE History)In the next table below, I’ve shown the difference between ROE using diluted EPS and the ROE after we’ve made the adjustments to 2017 and 2018 EPS. You’ll see that the adjusted ROE is now more consistent to the past ROE of the company. The adjusted data indicates that ROE has decreased in the two most recent years.Return on Invested Capital also faces the same discrepancies for 2017 and 2018 that we’ve seen with the EPS and ROE. Therefore, if we focus more on years 2014 – 2016, we can see more consistent data. Overall, these numbers are a bit lower than I’d like to see for ROIC. I’m interested in consistent ROIC of 16% or more.(Source: BTMA Stock Analyzer – Return on Invested Capital History)McKesson’s Gross Margin Percent history shows that margins have been getting worse over the past 4 years and that the company operates on very tight margins of around 5-6%. In reality, I’d like a company with consistent margins over 30%. The main reasons why McKesson has been able to make consistent profits with such low margins is because the company is massive and very efficient with its distribution system.(Source: BTMA Stock Analyzer – Gross Margin Percent History)From this factual data and when considering the adjustments that we needed to make, we can see that MCK has been a mostly consistent company over the past 10 and 5 years. The company is showing some signs of decline in the past 1-2 years. There is also weaknesses such as low gross margins, mediocre return on invested capital, and decreasing growth.(Source: BTMA Stock Analyzer – Misc. Fundamentals)Looking at other fundamentals involving the balance sheet, we can see that the debt-to-equity is at a good level, especially for a company of this size.McKesson’s Current Ratio of 1.01 is acceptable, telling us that it still has enough assets to pay off short-term debts.According to the balance sheet, the company seems to be in a healthy financial position.The Price-Earnings Ratio is not displayed here because of the low diluted EPS of 2018. But when considering the latest forward PE Ratio from Morningstar and Zack’s, it’s somewhere around a PE Ratio of 9. This is lower than the 5 year and 10 year average PE ratio of around 18 to 20. This tells me that the market may have MCK undervalued when considering the current forward PE Ratio to the past average PE Ratio.In regards to dividend history, I’m first interested in knowing if the payout ratio is sustainable. At this time it’s around 6%, which means that there is still lots of room to grow the dividend. However, the payout ratio has not been consistent and MCK has a history of buying back stocks, which contributes to higher payout ratios.If we look only at the dividend yield, we see a range of .46% to 1.08%. This stock pays out a small dividend and the dividend is inconsistent. Therefore, it’s not an ideal stock for dividend investors that want a stable and consistently growing dividend income.When looking at the Buyback Yield, we see that MCK returns more value in the form of share buybacks rather than dividends. But sometimes buybacks don’t make sense, as according to Warren Buffett:“There is only one combination of facts that makes it advisable for a company to repurchase its shares: First, the company has available funds -- cash plus sensible borrowing capacity -- beyond the near-term needs of the business and, second, finds its stock selling in the market below its intrinsic value, conservatively calculated.”In the example of MCK, the company does have available funds of cash plus borrowing capacity beyond the near-term needs of the business. And from the view of a share price chart over the past 5 years, the worst times to do share buybacks would have been when MCK was climbing highest in stock price. This would have been around 2014 and 2015. If we look at the dividend chart above, we can see that this was a time when MCK was buying back the least amount of shares. Then when share price was near 5 year lows in 2017, MCK was buying back the most amount of shares. Therefore, it seems like MCK has done a good job of returning value to shareholders through share repurchases because they execute the buybacks when the stock has a better chance of selling below its intrinsic value.If I were currently interested in buying MCK now for the dividend, I would be trying to buy when the dividend yield was highest relative to its past. From the chart below, we can see that the dividend yield is near its highest point relative to the past 8 years. Therefore, it could be a good time to buy now if my priority is a better than average return through dividends.Overall, the dividend situation with MCK is below average. First of all, the low dividend yield is not very attractive. The company has been inconsistent with its dividend yield growth. The good points are that the payout ratio has room to grow, the dividend yield is at a high when compared to the past, and the company returns value to the shareholders through well-timed share repurchases.This analysis wouldn’t be complete without considering the value of the company vs. share price.For valuation purposes, I will be using diluted EPS normalized of 8.63. I chose this because it will provide a more conservative valuation and be more in-line with the growth patterns of the past than the diluted EPS of only $.32. I’ve used various past averages of growth rates and PE Ratios to calculate different scenarios of valuation ranges from low to average values. The valuations compare growth rates of EPS, Book Value, and Total Equity.In the table below, you can see the different scenarios and in the chart, you will see vertical valuation lines that correspond to the table valuation ranges. The dots on the lines represent the current stock price. If the dot is towards the bottom of the valuation range, this would indicate that the stock is undervalued. If the dot is near the top of the valuation line, this would show an overvalued stock.According to this valuation analysis, MCK is slightly undervalued in multiple categories.This analysis shows an average valuation of around $136 - $137 per share.According to the facts, MCK seems to have a decent financial balance sheet, its dividend situation is below average, and the stock is slightly undervalued according to its proven track record, but it is overpriced when considering future forecasts. MCK’s most recent 2 years of earnings and adjustments with accounting make it more difficult to analyze and value. This confusion and disruption of its typically stable earnings data may deter investors from investing in MCK. Here is a recap of the pros and cons.CONS:PROS:“Over the next five years, the analysts that follow this company are expecting it to grow earnings at an average annual rate of 7.08%. This year, analysts are forecasting earnings increase of 5.63% over last year. Analysts expect earnings growth next year of 7.69% over this year's forecasted earnings.”(Source: McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) Forecast Earnings Growth)If you invest today, with analysts’ forecasts, you might expect at best about 7% growth per year. Plus we’ll add the current 1% forward dividend. This brings the annual return to around 8% and this is probably a best-case scenario.Here is an alternative scenario based on MCK’s past growth:During the past 10 and 5 year periods, the average EPS growth rate was about 12%. Plus the average dividend yield was about .64%. So we’re at a total return of 12.64%. But we also need to consider that the share price today is back down to the same level of 5 years ago. In addition, the pressure to prevent medicine price increases, and litigations against McKesson may also drag down the share price further. Therefore our annual return would likely be less than 12% even if earnings growth continued to be somewhat similar as in the past.If considering actual past results of MCK, which includes affected share prices, and long term dividend yields, the story is a bit different. Here are the actual 10 and 5 year return results.10 Year Return Results if Invested in MCK:Initial Investment Date: 08/05/2008End Date: 08/05/2018Cost per Share: $57.46End Date Price: $126.21Total Dividends Received: $8.88Total Return: 135.10%Compound Annualized Growth Rate (OTCPK:CAGR): 9%5 Year Return Results if Invested in MCK:Initial Investment Date: 08/05/2013End Date: 08/05/2018Cost per Share: $123.46End Date Price: $126.21Total Dividends Received: $5.52Total Return: 6.70%Compound Annualized Growth Rate (OTCPK:CAGR): 1%From these scenarios, we have produced results from 1% to 9%. I feel that if you’re a long-term patient investor and believer in McKesson, willing to sweat through expected changes and pressures of this industry and its competition, you could expect MCK to provide you with around a 10% annual return if you wait for the right time to sell. But for the short-term swing trader or impatient investor, MCK’s pressures and pessimism could take a long time to pass and the investment might not be worth the risk.As a comparison, the S&P 500’s average return from 1928 – 2014 is about 10%. So in a best-case scenario with MCK, you could expect to have similar results as an S&P 500 index fund. But you’d be less diversified and invested in a company that has added risk at this time.Considering the more conservative approach, you’d do significantly worse than investing in the S&P 500 index fund.For me, the choice is certain. I would take an objective look at this company and realize that my money could be better invested in more consistent and profitable investments at this time. That being said, once things settle down with McKesson and its industry, I’d be interested in re-exploring this company.Thank you for reading.

4197017,102404,2018-08-09T11:10:39-04:00,"Mr. Market has punished McKesson for three years and the stock is in a downtrend, which is the result of negative sentiment surrounding the stock and the whole sector.The horrible GAAP results, the slightly declining margins, and the opioid crisis are reasons why investors can be concerned, but no justification for the current valuation.The wide moat due to the distribution system, the growth potential of the medical sector, and the low valuation make McKesson a clear buy.Management is investor-friendly, and by increasing the share buybacks right now, management is proofing to act responsible.","Dear Mr. Market,You probably don't know me, but I am watching you every day and watching almost all of your moves. Sometimes I am quite annoyed by you, and sometimes I am thankful for the buying opportunities you provide. We have learned that you are here to serve us and not to guide us, but the time has come for a few harsh words: You need to stop bullying McKesson Corporation (MCK) as the stock has suffered enough and its valuation doesn't reflect the intrinsic value of the business at all.In the following open letter, I will show why McKesson is a real bargain at current prices and why the decline over the last three years is completely exaggerated. I have to admit that there are a few reasons for concern when watching McKesson (like the GAAP results or the development of margins), but the more important arguments speak volumes why McKesson is a growing, wide-moat company that is extremely undervalued right now.I really don't want to psychoanalyze you too much, but thanks to Professor Benjamin Graham who wrote extensively about you and where you obviously spent countless hours on the couch, we know a lot about you - and it is not flattering. You are highly irrational, driven by emotions and have huge mood swings between euphoric and extremely depressed. Right now, you are euphoric about the US stock market in general, we know you love Amazon (AMZN) and you idolize it as the greatest company ever existed. And even though many of us regularly point out that you are nuts you find countless ways to justify the current valuation of Amazon. A few weeks ago, Amazon announced it will acquire PillPack - a small pharmacy delivery start-up most investors probably never have heard of before - and once again Amazon's stock climbed even higher, but other companies like CVS Health (CVS), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) or Rite Aid (RAD) got severely punished.Trying to understand you is not easy: One the one hand, we have companies like CVS Health or McKesson that are able to grow at least in the mid-single digits and are valued with a P/E ratio slightly above 10 or even below 10. On the other hand, we have Amazon - a company that might be able to grow more than 20% for several more years but is valued with a P/E of almost 300. But maybe it is not our job to understand you, instead only be thankful for the opportunities you provide. Investors can profit the most, when strong emotions and sentiment as well as misjudgment rule the stock market. Stocks can be hyped and extremely overvalued, but stocks can also be almost hated and extremely undervalued. You can make a decent amount of money by investing in stocks, even if they trade at fair value. But really high return rates - like Warren Buffett generated - are only possible due to buying stocks at the point of absolute fear, panic and with depressed prices.Mr. Market, I already told you that I don't understand your obsession with Amazon, and although I think you once again became much too euphoric about the PillPack acquisition, I can understand you a little. I get that companies like Walgreens Boots Alliance, Rite Aid or maybe even CVS Health Corp got punished as these companies are mostly pharmaceutical retailer and could be affected by Amazon entering the market. CVS Health is generating about 40% of its revenue from pharmaceutical retail and Walgreens Boots Alliance is mostly a pharmaceutical retailer and the retail sector is currently under pressure with some major shifts going on. And despite the fact, that pharmaceutical retailers are a special segment in the retail market, these companies still have to adapt - even McKesson as it has more than 16,000 owned and banner pharmacies. But the core business is delivering prescription medicine - the company delivered 1/3 of total prescriptions in North America and McKesson is not really a pharmaceutical retailer. Considering these facts, I don't understand why the company gets discounted on every new piece of information about Amazon entering the pharmaceutical retail sector.Like I said, I am trying to understand you my friend and I have to admit that I can comprehend a few of your concerns. If we look at the GAAP results of McKesson, the company had to report a loss of $0.69 per diluted share and 2018 was also a horrible year as the company could only report earnings per share of $0.32. When looking at the GAAP numbers, McKesson seems to be in deep trouble right now, but first of all we have to point out that in 2017 the company reported a GAAP EPS of $22.73, and secondly, we have to think really hard if the non-GAAP numbers don't make more sense in this case, and as non-GAAP results, the company is expecting an EPS of $13.00-13.80.We can also point out, that McKesson's gross profit margin declined in the last few years from 6.37% in 2015 to 5.43% right now. Operating income margin also declined from 1.74% in 2015 to 1.40% right now. We can also point out that McKesson is only expecting a free cash flow of $3 billion for 2019, while last year's free cash flow was $3.8 billion. These are numbers that make investors not extremely happy, but is in my opinion no reason to be particularly concerned and definitely no reason for the sell-off we witness in the last years.A last issue is the opioid crisis that is affecting McKesson among other companies. From a medical and social point of view, it is a disaster and a big problem that can't be ignored any longer. But as investors we probably have to fear some fines and one-time losses, but nothing that will affect the long-term perspective of the company. And if we are being narrow-minded and just look at the issue from an investor's point of view, we have to conclude that it won't be a problem that should reflect itself in the quarterly and annual income statements.Mr. Market, there might be a few small points to be concerned about, but a list of reasons why you are wrong. McKesson is operating in a growing market and has a wide moat protecting its business, the company is deeply undervalued and rewarding investors in a responsible way - by share buybacks at the right time and a dividend that can be increased in the years to come.Growing market and wide moatMcKesson's core competence is distribution services between manufacturers and providers, pharmacists and patients. And the global healthcare market is growing. About 3% annual growth is expected for the next 5 years in Europe, 4% growth is expected in Canada and 5% in the United States. And for special pharmaceuticals - one area McKesson is particularly focused on - the expected growth potential lies between 7% and 10% annually for the next 5 years. Healthcare is representing almost 18% of US GDP and is expected to grow in the years to come.(Source: McKesson Investor Day Presentation)Considering these facts, one doesn't have to be surprised about companies like Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon entering the market. I know, these are the companies you love so much, Mr. Market, but McKesson has decisive advantages. First of all, distribution services in the healthcare segment are the core competence of McKesson while Google, Apple and Amazon are certainly operating outside their circle of competence. I know that you trust Amazon so much and assume Jeff Bezos can enter every segment, but trust me: McKesson is the superior company when it comes to medical and healthcare distribution and the company has a very wide moat. Apple, Amazon and Google may all be great at what the companies are doing, but none of the three is a distribution company.And although Amazon can be described as a company at the intersection of retail, technology, logistics and distribution, the company is primarily a retailer or technology company and no distribution company. And delivering pharmaceuticals and medical supplies is quite different from selling books, clothes or diapers, and therefore it will be difficult for Amazon to enter the medical distribution segment. And it is also rather unrealistic that pharmacies will diminish completely in the next few decades. Of all the different retail segments, drugs and pharmaceutical products are probably one of those products people purchase only after consulting a specialist before ordering. Additionally, the target audience for drugs and pharmaceutical products are older people, and these are probably not the people who mostly order online (this might change in one or two decades). The need to deliver drugs quickly and cost effectively will not change over the next one or two decades. And companies with a great distribution system like McKesson will have an advantage over other companies due to the distribution system.ValuationI don't know many companies on the New York Stock Exchange right now that are as undervalued as McKesson. For the first quarter of 2019, McKesson reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.90, and according to the company's own guidance for the whole year 2019, diluted adjusted earnings per share between $13.00 and $13.80 are expected. This leads to a forward P/E ratio between 9 and 10 while the P/E ratio using last year's earnings per share is 10 right now. For me, the P/E ratio only comes into play when using stock screeners and searching for picks, and although I don't use it often, I would consider wide-moat stocks as interesting when the P/E ratio is 20 or below and at about 15 we usually have a bargain.But as we can see by the huge differences between the GAAP diluted earnings per share ($0.30) and the non-GAAP diluted earnings per share ($12.62), this is probably not the best number to use. For intrinsic value calculations, it makes much more sense to use the generated free cash flow instead of earnings. For a simple calculation, we need three basic ingredients: a free cash flow, a growth rate and the number of outstanding shares. We will calculate with 203 million outstanding shares, although McKesson will reduce that number over the next few years due to an extensive share buyback program (see next section). As growth rate, we assume a moderate 3% growth for perpetuity. For a company with a wide moat, 3% has to be called moderate as 4-5% seems to be more realistic. And finally, we use the expected free cash flow for 2019, which is about $3 billion and therefore significantly below the free cash flow the company generated in the last two years.You see, Mr. Market, I already used very conservative numbers in my calculation, but I still get an intrinsic value way above the current stock price - $211. I really don't want to insult you (and you are often right about stocks), but regarding McKesson, you are really nuts as the stock might easily be worth twice as much as it is currently trading for.Share buyback programAfter McKesson already reduced the number of outstanding shares in the past from 223 million in the business year 2017 (on average) to 208 million in the business year 2018 to 202 million right now, it announced another $4 billion share repurchase program in May 2018. The board of directors believes that the company's shares are an attractive investment opportunity, and with a current market capitalization of $25 billion, the company could buy back about 1/6 of outstanding shares.Usually companies buy back shares at the completely wrong time and initiate share buyback programs preferably after the stock market soared for many years and the company's own stock reached several record levels. It speaks for McKesson's management team that it is using its free cash flow to buy back shares right now as the stock is extremely undervalued. When the stock rises again, the company can reduce its share buyback program again and maybe focus more on other ways to invest in the business - and if that is not possible, it can increase the dividend in the years to come.DividendMcKesson is currently rewarding its shareholders by paying a dividend, but with a dividend yield slightly above 1% right now, the stock is not really interesting for dividend investors. But McKesson raised its dividend about 15% a few days ago, and we can expect that the company will keep raising its dividend in the years to come. Compared to the adjusted earnings per share, the company is paying out only a fraction of its earnings as dividend. The payout ratio right now is only slightly above 10% with potential to increase.McKesson has different possibilities to reward its shareholders and invest the generated cash wisely. As I already mentioned above, I think it is a clever decision to use cash for share buybacks right now. But in the future, there might be better ways to reward shareholders. As long as McKesson can invest in its own business and generate the highest growth rates by using the money for acquisitions and expanding the business, that is the way McKesson should use its cash. If McKesson can't grow its own business or doesn't find potential acquisition targets, it can still increase the dividend at an even higher pace as right now because higher payout ratios are definitely acceptable (up to 50%). Most rewarding and most realistic is a third way: McKesson can increase its dividend in the years to come (double-digit raise) and will invest most of generated cash back in the business to grow, and as long as the share price is down a share buyback program makes a lot of sense. A combination of all three (dividend, share buybacks and investing in the business) is the way how investors profit the most.(Source: Own Work)In my last article I came to the following conclusion:And thanks to Amazon that announced a few weeks ago that it will require PillPack which led to declining stock prices for many distributors and retail pharmacies and the generally negative sentiment for the medical and pharmaceutical distribution sector, McKesson is currently only a few dollars above $120 - my preferred entry point.Usually an investor has to decide between low valuation and great business with a competitive advantage (protected by an economic moat). McKesson Corporation is one of the very rare examples right now, where an investor can get both. And not only will we get a high-quality company at a very low price, but McKesson might also become an interesting pick for dividend investors in a few years as it has the potential to grow its dividend at very high rates for a very long time.I like to end with conciliatory notes. Mr. Market, I am quite thankful for the buying opportunity you currently provide, but I strongly urge you to rethink your opinion about McKesson as the company has been punished enough and its stock deserves to enter an uptrend once again.Sincerely yours,Daniel Schönberger"

Together, these three companies form an oligopoly and control over 90% of the distribution space. Distributors are likely the least complicated cog in the pharmaceutical wheel. They essentially just move drugs from the manufacturers to the retail consumer, although it is much more complicated than it sounds considering the need to work with a multitude of manufacturers and thousands of retail pharmacies. Piles of regulations and special shipping needs like refrigeration make the process even more challenging. But in the end, the distributors get paid for moving product from point A to point B and don’t get as involved in the complicated world of insurance contracts, price setting, rebates and copays that the other industry participants grapple with more directly.The more pure distribution role also results in wholesalers taking a smaller cut of the overall gross profit in the supply chain as demonstrated by the graphic below.Source: Pembroke Consulting; The Wall Street JournalThe distribution role, with its small piece of the overall gross profit pie and reliance on volume, lends itself well to scale and consolidation. The larger the scale of a distributor, the bigger the buying power and negotiating strength with drug manufacturers and potentially retail pharmacies. Huge volumes also help ensure efficient distribution networks with specialized warehouses and appropriate route density. The advantage of scale has pushed the pharmaceutical distribution industry into an oligopoly with just three efficiently run wholesalers with razor thin margins dominating the space.The pharmaceutical industry has recently faced uncertainty with discussions of health care reform in the US and drug pricing pressure. While these potential reforms will likely impact other areas of the pharmaceutical space and create some volatility, they are somewhat unlikely to revolutionize the distribution space as there simply isn’t much fat/profit to cut from the industry and the function of moving product from manufacturers to pharmacies is necessary and highly efficient. If much profitability is squeezed from the three big incumbents with their low single-digit net profit margins, they simply won’t be able to operate sustainably.Overall, the backdrop in the healthcare space is supportive with demographics and population dynamics driving a base level of growth. Distributors should at least benefit from volume growth in the overall healthcare market.Source: McKesson 2018 Investor Day PresentationMcKesson has a strong competitive position in its industry and enjoys many of the benefits of being part of an oligopoly. We will walk through the barriers to entry that the company enjoys.Scale and expertise: McKesson works with a multitude of drug manufacturers and then distributes their products to thousands of pharmacies across many geographies on a timely basis, while also dealing with items such as the related accounts receivable collections. The US alone has nearly 60,000 pharmacies and McKesson delivers about a third of all prescription medicine in North America with over 78,000 employees worldwide. It is a huge distribution machine. Individual drug manufacturers want nothing to do with the hassle of dealing with thousands of pharmacies or the capital expenditures that would be necessary to build out distribution infrastructure that would anyway be less efficient than McKesson’s. Pharmacies also don’t want to deal with a multitude of manufacturers and invest in a distribution network that would lack the scale and efficiency of McKesson’s network. McKesson’s massive distribution setup with effective route density and efficient warehousing cannot be matched without material capital and inventory expenditure, and even then competitors would struggle to find the volume to achieve acceptable asset efficiency. McKesson, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen dominate about 90% of the market in a clear demonstration that scale wins in this industry.Regarding expertise, distributing pharmaceuticals is not the same as distributing normal retail goods. Many drugs require refrigeration and others are controlled substances with significant regulation (often different in various geographies). For example, certain drugs (think opioids or narcotics) can’t be commingled with general merchandise. General distributors cannot just tack on prescription pharmaceutical products to their existing infrastructure which is also partially why the three big specialists control the market. McKesson has waded through all the regulations in all the geographies and has built up an effective and efficient infrastructure. Warehouses are often highly specialized to distribute drugs and shipping times are extremely quick. And McKesson has a 99.98% order accuracy so there isn’t much room for improvement in that category.So the sheer scale and expertise of McKesson’s operations certainly keep out drug manufacturers and pharmacies and essentially all other potential entrants.Enormous buying power in generics: Related to the scale argument is the logic that large distributors like McKesson create barriers to entry through their ability to buy huge quantities of generic medications from manufacturers, allowing them to achieve discounts not available to smaller purchasers. McKesson has in the neighborhood of $60 billion of revenue coming from generics. Peers have even more. That is a huge figure to achieve for a single distributor or pharmacy. The barrier for most is that they simply won’t be able to achieve acceptable profitability while being competitive because McKesson can buy at discounted prices and they cannot. Competitors would have to have other motivations than direct profitability.Razor thin margins: With net margins in the low single digits, there isn’t much fat to cut from this industry. Tiny margins seem like a bad thing, but they act as a barrier to competition. Competition usually enters where there are high levels of profitability which are then competed down. In McKesson’s industry, there just isn’t much to compete away. The thin margins essentially keep other players out, especially when they realize how difficult it would be to achieve the scale necessary just to get a percent or two of profit. It just doesn’t make sense to try.Pricing dynamics: Aggressive pricing is often a way for new entrants to grab share in an industry. But the pharmaceutical distribution industry doesn’t offer much chance to compete on price. As mentioned, profit margins are razor thin so there is not much advantage to be gained without being significantly loss making over a long period. Perhaps more importantly for the greater pharmaceutical landscape, many consumers are essentially price insensitive because their insurance companies cover the payment for medications with the exception of their copay. It gets complicated as some consumers ultimately pay for insurance, but there is little direct price feedback to an insured consumer that would push them to change their buying habits based on cheaper distribution.Market share and brand: Market share is related to scale, buying power and margins and might be the highest barrier of all for new entrants. We could have incorporated it into essentially all the other sections of this report, but decided to break it out to help highlight its importance. The reality is that it is intertwined with the other barriers to entry. The pharmaceutical industry is an established industry with strong, dominant players across all segments. In distribution itself, McKesson and peers Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen control about 90% of the industry. Controlling a large chunk of the market means scale, critical customer relationships and buying power. All those have a material impact on profitability and the ability of competitors to steal share. There simply isn’t much market share available that can be profitably stolen by new entrants which prohibits the building of volume, buying power and attractive profitability in distribution. Big players would also have some switching costs to changing distributors and simply won’t take the risk of going to a smaller player with little brand power or reputation. A large acquisition or series of acquisitions in other parts of the supply chain might be an unlikely way around this barrier.There has been extensive discussion of Amazon (AMZN) expanding in the pharmaceutical space, but we do not view Amazon as an imminent or potentially catastrophic threat to McKesson currently. For more detail on the potential threat from Amazon as one of the few companies that might potentially clear some of the barriers to entry, see our extensive article on the topic here.In conclusion, McKesson has a strong competitive position and several material barriers to entry which should protect the company from nearly every threat. Large acquisitions or continued consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry should be monitored however.Profitability, capital efficiency, and returns on investment:Source: Thomson ReutersMcKesson’s razor thin margins are apparent when looking at the net income margin which essentially fluctuates around 1%. There is quite some noise in the company’s financial statements with many adjustments between GAAP and non-GAAP results and items such as acquisitions which investors need to filter through, but a general consistency of operating profitably exists. McKesson’s return on equity (ROE) levels look quite attractive (with exception of one-off issues in 2018), but those levels were buoyed by substantial debt. The result is that return on invested capital levels (ROIC) are not quite as attractive, but the company still creates value over time with ROIC around 9-10%. Our ROIC calculation is also quite conservative when considering items like goodwill in the capital base and unadjusted returns to some extent. Other calculation methods might achieve a more generous result. While the ROE clears our normal investment hurdles, the conservatively calculated ROIC is only adequate, which we take into consideration when determining the potential position size of an investment.Growth:Source: Thomson ReutersThere are multiple structural growth drivers in the industry which should continue to support steady low to mid-single-digit growth over the long term. Demand for McKesson’s services is largely detached from the business cycle and will benefit from an aging (and growing) US population. We model approximately 3.5% annual free cash flow growth over the next decade which may prove conservative considering the industry backdrop and historical growth rates.Cash flows:Source: Thomson ReutersAgain, we see quite some noise in several of the cash flow metrics, but cash conversion is generally solid.Source: Thomson ReutersThe company does employ a substantial amount of debt, but net debt to EBITDA essentially lands around 1x which we find acceptable considering the relatively steady profitability and good free cash flow production. The balance sheet is good, but not pristine and something to keep an eye on.Management has preferred acquisitions and stock buybacks to dividends as a way to create value for shareholders. While the acquisitions have helped McKesson become a leading pharmaceutical distributor with an indispensable role in the industry, they have also built up large amounts of intangibles on the balance sheet. We prefer to see organic growth or more attractively priced deals at least. The buybacks have been appropriate with the dividend being more residual than anything. Overall, we view the capital allocation as adequate, but do point out the excessive CEO compensation over the years as a yellow flag.McKesson is not an ideal candidate for dividend investors despite acceptable dividend per share growth over the last decade. The yield is generally quite low and is currently around 1.2% (higher than its usual range). The dividend could be considered safe considering a low payout ratio, but hasn’t been the main focus of capital allocation. Management has returned more value through buybacks than dividends and has also used considerable capital for acquisitions. Investors do get a safe base dividend, but the yield is simply too low and capital allocation is focused elsewhere, meaning McKesson is not for most dividend focused investors.We primarily use our DCF model to derive a fair value of USD 200 per share for the company.As a further valuation reference point, Morningstar has a fair value of USD 210 per share.We will again point out the considerable noise in the company’s financials, including large differences between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings. Due to the excessive noise, we focus on free cash flow in our modeling. Starting with a level near company guidance of $3 billion, we grow free cash flow around 3.5% over the coming decade. We are also using a WACC of 9% which we view as conservative. It is perhaps also interesting to note that from a free cash flow angle, the yield is currently around 10-12% which we view as attractive.McKesson has quite a few yellow or orange flags, so we will take some time to run through them. As a note, we normally avoid companies that have a number of yellow flags. We have decided to keep McKesson in the potential investment pool, but with a reduced scope when it comes to position sizing. We view the overall investment opportunity as still potentially attractive with a large enough margin of safety and note some incremental progress in concern areas.CEO pay:The McKesson CEO, John Hammergren, is overpaid. He was the highest paid CEO in the US in 2013. His total annual compensation has been over $20 million for as far back as most investors would check (despite recent reductions due to shareholder pressure). Even in more recent years, he has earned essentially twice his peers at Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen and more than most large company peers as a USA Today article recently pointed out. We have trouble rationalizing his compensation on an absolute basis or relative to peers, many of which are larger and of higher quality. The only positive point is that the compensation has been trending down with continued efforts highlighted in the company’s 2018 proxy statement.Complex financials:Complex financials can often be a symptom of less than optimal business management or performance. While not unusual for a large company, McKesson certainly excels in special adjustments. A glance at their quarterly results presentation will reveal a multiple page appendix with supplemental information and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations which span from amortization of acquisition-related intangibles to goodwill impairments to legal settlements. In the Q1 of fiscal 2019, a GAAP loss per share of $0.69 ended up being an adjusted non-GAAP gain per share of $2.90. Investors need to evaluate whether consistently complex financials with material GAAP to non-GAAP figures are a symptom of serious issues at the company.Customer concentration:CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) represents about 20% of revenue with the ten largest customers responsible for over 50% of revenue. In a space where consolidation is rampant, this is a serious risk. It does not prevent us from investing, but it is another factor that limits position size for us.Mediocre ROIC:McKesson’s ROIC is attractive, but not as spectacular when compared with the high quality companies we generally consider. We want companies to have a material gap between ROIC and the cost of capital. McKesson’s ROIC around 9-10% simply doesn’t offer much breathing room, but we will again note our conservative calculation. Of course, the consistency of the ROIC production is also important, and here McKesson also provides an adequate outcome. We conclude that McKesson is investable from this perspective, but once again find the level of this metric as a reason to limit position sizing.Intangibles on the balance sheet:McKesson has certainly built up a pile of goodwill and intangibles at over $15 billion which is significant with total assets of just over $60 billion. Material amounts of goodwill can be an indication of companies overpaying for acquisitions or simply needing to rely on acquisitions for growth in place of our preferred method of organic growth. Indeed, McKesson recently needed to write-off a material amount of goodwill, further clouding financial results. Large amounts of goodwill can also make invested capital calculations more complicated, depending on an investor’s opinion on whether they should be included or not.Buybacks combined with large executive stock compensation:Much of the CEO’s exorbitant compensation comes from stock related items. There is some concern that companies with high levels of stock related compensation might buy back stock to boost the value of stock options by affecting earnings per share. We had a look at the timing of stock buybacks to see whether or not we should be concerned about this practice at McKesson considering the overall level of CEO compensation. The following chart/analysis is not perfect (doesn’t factor in valuation directly for example), but is perhaps a simple way to look for issues with buyback timing. The comparison of buyback amounts and stock prices on a quarterly basis is somewhat comforting. We can see that the company ramped down buybacks at the end of 2013 through 2014 when the stock price had climbed considerably and then did considerable buybacks from the end of 2016 and going forward as the stock price materially declined. It would appear that management has not done a terrible job of employing buybacks in recent years.Source: Thomson Reuters; Oyat AdvisorsMcKesson combines a strong competitive positioning with acceptable value creation and some material risks. We value the barriers to entry through scale, expertise, buying power and thin margins (efficiency). But we are concerned by the only-adequate level of ROIC and key risks related to customer concentration and changing industry dynamics. An additional positive in current markets is the low level of cyclicality and the essential nature of the company’s services. Despite some of the challenges and risks, we consider the company eligible for investment. But the ROIC, complex financials and customer concentration limit our potential position size to about half of what we would apply to a higher quality company. The risks also demand a larger margin of safety compared to other potential investments. Overall, investing in a good quality, low cyclicality company in an oligopoly at a significant margin of safety still makes sense to us as long as exposure is controlled. As such, we recommend an investment in the company with the current margin of safety above 30% with cautious position sizing."

For me, trading is usually anything between 1 and 3 months depending on volatility. In investing, the time frame is usually much larger and can involve years if not decades. Warren Buffett is on record as saying that hands-off investors should simply buy an index and hold on through thick and thin. Dave Ramsey puts it another way by stating that the only way one can get hurt is if one jumps off the roller-coaster when the going gets tough.If one has time on their side, there is probably no better advice. Being ""in"" the market and letting dividends, for example, compound your capital makes 100% sense over the long term. However, what about the person who does not have time on their side? Should they be buying the market up here and ""hope"" that they will earn 7%+ annualized every year over the next 10 years? Nobody knows but this is why instruments such as high yield stocks, options trading and leveraged ETFs will always be able to create demand.One such strategy, for example, is the Poor Man Covered Call which is being touted online as a viable alternative to the traditional covered call. In the Poor Man Covered Call strategy, a long call option (usually a LEAP) is used instead of buying stock. This way less buying power is used on the trade, meaning more capital can be put to use in other areas of the portfolio. This, in my opinion, is the only advantage which is that the trader can make similar gains (much better return on investment gains) to the traditional covered all strategy. However, the disadvantages are numerous. Let us take McKesson (MCK) as our test case and explain the disadvantages I see with the Poor Man Covered Call strategy.My advice on Poor Man Covered Calls remains the same. Don't do them. Save up your capital and wait until you can do the proper strategy instead."
4182268,67113,2018-06-18T08:00:00-04:00,Full-year results fine when excluding the charge to earnings in the fourth quarter.Company adds $4 billion to buyback kitty.Remains an attractive value play.,"McKesson (MCK) reported final year results recently and there was nothing of note on the recent earnings call to suggest altering our bullish stance. We have been long this stock now since mid-2017, but shares have failed to gain much traction. McKesson seems to be caught up in the whole drug issue unfairly, I believe, which is affecting the main 3 distributors. Shares have thus far failed to take out the mid-2016 highs.Furthermore, with the international segment dragging on results for the fiscal year (especially in Canada & Europe) and pricing affecting the US pharmacy segment in the US, McKesson is embarking on a restructuring program in an effort to boost operating margins well past the 1.4% number we saw in fiscal 2018. Despite how generic drugs have come under pressure in recent times, it should be comforting to McKesson shareholders that volatility has subsided a tad this year which should in the long run help margins. Moreover, some manufacturers are really beginning to feel the squeeze in the generics line which should bring some balance to the supply situation in this business. I do not see the wholesalers getting closed out. Here are some reasons why I believe McKesson at $150 a share has significant upside at these levels.This industry is a bit of a monopoly, with 3 companies controlling the vast amount of the market. I expect MCK to bounce back. Remaining long McKesson."

According to MDM (Modern Distribution Management, provider of wholesale industry research and trends analysis), the Big Three account for about 90% of all drug distribution revenues, and in 2016 the revenue breakdown among them has been as in the chart below:Source: MDM, 2017Founded in 1833, MCK has built a solid foundation in the form of a wide and technologically advanced pharmaceutical and medical-surgical distribution network in (10K, 2017, pp.4-8):MCK has two major divisions - Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions - with operations both in North America and internationally:Source: FY2017 and FY2015 10KsThe North America pharmaceutical distribution and services sub-division is by far a major source of revenues for the company, despite the fact that its proportion has fallen during the last five years by 11 percentage points, largely due to Celesio acquisition in 2014.Being a leader with a firm distribution footing (especially so in North America) creates a natural moat to fend-off any potential competition, even the one coming from Amazon. With regard to the latter, Amazon might be enticed to enter, given the size of the industry. According to yearly surveys conducted by Healthcare Distribution Alliance (HDA) Research Foundation, pharmaceutical sales through distributors totaled $440bln in 2016:Source: adapted from HDA Research Foundation Factbook, 2017 and 2014.Also evident from the graph is the fact that a greater proportion of pharmaceutical sales is channeled through the distributors' network, thereby proving an extra impetus for sales growth.Nevertheless, half-a-trillion-dollar sales figures mask a less rosy statistic for the industry - paper-thin operating margins. According to the same survey data collected by HDA (p.11), the median operating profit margin across all the US distributors surveyed in 2016 was a mere 1.7% (1.9% in 2015 and 1.8% in 2014). This very fact makes pharmaceutical distribution business quite a questionable destination for Amazon to venture in.The narrative for McKesson that will be used in the valuation is that of a leading US pharmaceutical distributor, operating in a highly concentrated (dominated by 3 firms) and low margin industry. With assets in place due to previous investment activity, MCK requires minimal (relative to sales) capital expenditures, but may still grow through acquisitions (for example, by buying out small regional/specialty wholesalers in the US or larger players abroad). The latter is substantiated by 2017 Investor Day presentation, in which the company outlined that its capital deployment approach included internal infrastructure optimization, M&A activities, and cash return to shareholders (via dividends or repurchases). Similarly, in 2018 JPMorgan Healthcare Conference presentation, MCK indicated that investments in growth in the first half of 2018 will comprise a modest $255mln of internal investments and a substantial $1.9bln allocated for M&As.Source: Author's computations based on company's 10QsNotwithstanding a 10.8% 5-year CAGR, it is important to note that the last two TTMs have grown at slightly above 4%, on aggregate. It is on this occasion that for the next five years the forecast revenue growth rate used in the model will be 4%;Source: Author's computations based on company's 10QsSimilar to the industry, MCK's operating margin averaged a mere 1.62% for the last five years, ranging from 1.07% in TTM'2017 to 1.92% in TTM'2013 (note that TTM'2017 operating income has been adjusted downwards by eliminating a one-time $3.9bln gain from sale of McKesson Technology Solutions businesses). As a result, the target operating margin that is to be used in the valuation is 1.62%;Source: Author's computations based on company's 10QsAs can be seen, 5-year aggregate 'incremental sales to reinvestment' ratio has been 8.45, or $1 in reinvestments spent for every $8.45 in added sales. However, being largely influenced by a pop in TTM'14 and TTM'15, a 2-year aggregate ratio has also been computed, which stands at 5.45, or around in the middle of the ratios exhibited in TTM'16 and TTM'17. Since the recent history may be more reflective of what the future holds, the model will assume the incremental sales to reinvestment ratio of 5.45;Furthermore, since the sustainable growth rate is computed as:Sustainable growth = ROIC * reinvestment rateand assuming that this rate during the terminal period is equal to 2.8% (10-year Treasury rate), with an ROIC of 10% [which assumes the company will be able to sustain its competitive advantage in the long-term and achieve returns of about +3% in excess of the terminal period WACC (3% corresponds to a 70th percentile of excess returns figure amongst global firms or a 23rd percentile of only those achieving positive excess returns)], the reinvestment rate in the terminal period can be calculated as:Reinvestment rate = 2.8% / 10% = 28%;The equity component was calculated using the risk-free rate of 2.8%, ERP (geographically weighted by sales) of 5.22% and a bottom-up beta of healthcare support service companies of 0.84 levered up by the after-tax D/E ratio. The pre-tax debt component was computed using actual credit rating for MCK of Baa2 (Moody's, 2018); default spread of 1.27% (Damodaran, 2018), corresponding to the above-mentioned rating, and a risk-free rate of 2.8%: The 5-year transitional WACC of 6.96% will be linearly adjusted upwards to a slightly higher terminal rate of 7.02%, based on re-computed debt-to-capital ratio, such that beta is equal to 1.Apart from these major assumptions, I have also assumed the following:Source: 10K, 2015 and 2017 and author's calculationsThe table below presents the model results:With a value per share of $210, there is a 40% upside potential for MCK stock, which currently trades at around $150 per share. However, given the uncertainty around some of the assumptions made, the Monte Carlo simulation will be used to attempt to account for this factor:The dotted 4% line is the base-case figure, while the 11% is the 5-year CAGR;With these distribution assumptions around the parameters with the greatest uncertainty, the Monte Carlo simulation of 100,000 iterations yields the following results:As can be seen from the percentiles table above, the median value per share is about $213, close to the base-case value of $210. More importantly, the table shows that at a current price of $150, the stock seems to be significantly undervalued, with an upside of more than 40%."

I believe McKesson (MCK), AmerisourceBergen (ABC) and Cardinal Health (CAH) have all been punished as a result of a fear based selloff and political uncertainty. The resulting selloff has pushed all three of these names below their fair value and has resulted in a significant buying opportunity. My opinion towards there three stocks is indifferent, though I have decided to focus on McKesson in this article. McKesson is a corporate titan with an enormous economic moat, unrivaled buying power and an efficient distribution network. Although this pharmaceutical industry faces strong headwinds in customer consolidation and generic drug price decreases, it is still growing at a fast rate. Any headwinds McKesson faces will be matched, if not outpaced, by the increasing volume that McKesson can achieve from the growing sector. In addition, the announced consortium between Amazon (AMZN), JPMorgan (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) has resulted in a fear based selloff that leaves McKesson significantly below its fair value. For these reasons, I believe McKesson will appreciate in value to $175/share in the short term and greater than $175/share in the long term (granted the market remains bullish). McKesson is a pharmaceutical distributor, retail pharmacy owner, producer and wholesaler of surgical equipment, community oncology leader and healthcare information technology company. McKesson is by all means a heavy weight in corporate America. They are the fifth largest company on the Fortune 500 list, achieving revenues of 200B and delivering 1/3 of all drugs in America last year. Source: Fortune 500Source: McKesson Annual Report Between Cardinal Health (CAH), McKesson (MCK) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC), these three companies control between 90-95% of the drug distribution market in the US. Thus any new entrants would need to spend tens of billions in capital expenditures to match McKesson's distribution network. For this reason, only a few possible companies such as Amazon (AMZN) could viably enter the market. See this Seeking Alpha article for why I find that unlikely.In addition, McKesson's business relies heavily on successfully distributing the correct drugs to the assigned destination on time. For this reason, they have invested heavily into supply chain management technology which they know boast has given them a 99.98% order accuracy in North America. Now this may seem lack luster but when pretax margins are only 1.59% ( 20171 ), there is little room for potential entrants to compete with McKesson without achieving near perfect efficiency and developing a massive distribution network. Source: 2017 Investor Presentations1. Adjusts 2017 net income to exclude 3.94B Gain on Healthcare Technology.Generic Drug Distribution: One of McKesson's competitive advantages is its unrivaled buying power. They use this advantage to negotiate with over 500 drug manufacturers to establish extremely low wholesale prices. They then redistribute these generic drugs to a network of over 40,000 customers (US) and their own retail pharmacy locations. In fact in 2016 McKesson and Walmart partnered together, with McKesson providing the distribution network for Walmart's retail pharmacy locations. Logically, if Walmart felt as though they could provide the drug distribution at a cheaper price than McKesson then they would leverage their existing distribution network to do so. This helps solidify McKesson's competitive advantage and proves how difficult even established players can find entering the market.

McKesson has experienced 3-Year Revenue CAGR to FY17 at over 30%, and achieved revenues of 24B in fiscal 2017 for this business. Medical-Surgical distribution: McKesson has also begun selling a wide range of medical-surgical supplies. They distribute over 150,000 of these products, including their own line of products. This business represents only about 3% of their total revenue, but it continues to grow at a modest pace and the profit margins are likely higher than the drug distribution business.

McKesson's vs. peers:Below you can see two large selloffs in McKesson. The first in October was a result of missing earnings expectations and a downgrade by several firms from a buy to a hold. Most of those holds have been upgraded after strong 3rd quarter earnings. The second drop is a combination of an overall market selloff and Amazon (AMZN), JP Morgan (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) announcing a partnership to lower their 1.1 million employees healthcare costs by targeting middle men such as McKesson. A Youtube video can be found here. This is a hard threat to quantify so I will not bother. However, this partnership seems to only be a consensus by the companies that healthcare costs need to change but they have yet to come up with a solution on how to execute this idea. Thus the drop in McKesson's stock has been purely a fear driven selloff, representing a buying opportunity for investors. MCK data by YChartsMCK data by YCharts Now McKesson has been a lager compared to other drug distribution companies such as AmerisourceBergen but on a comparative basis we will see that McKesson appears to offer slightly more value. *Note that I used McKesson's adjusted PE and adjusted EPS but did not adjust AmerisourceBergen or Cardinal Health. To include my adjusted version, I have I summarized McKesson's 2017 annual report income statement into an Excel sheet and further provided a screenshot of the annual report. In the yellow bins below, I adjusted the net income to exclude the ""Gain on Healthcare Technology"" and then adjusted the income tax expense maintaining the 2017 rate of 23.4% for simplicity. We can see that a more realistic Net Income for McKesson is 2.047B and an EPS of $9.4/share. I understand my EPS is significantly lower than the adjusted EPS the company gave of $11.61/share but I decided to use caution in my analysis and this is how I conducted my calculations. Fair value:To calculate the fair value of McKesson I used a 5 year Discounted Cash Flow Model (NYSE:DCF) to discount the future value of cash flows back to their present value. Due to the concerns some have over the thinning profit margins, I included a negative free cash flow growth rate for a pessimistic view. Below I also included all the inputs I used to calculate the fair value. I developed this model and I am happy to share if wanted. I understand that DCF analysis is not an exact science and there is some ambiguity in the calculations. For this reason, I displayed a full chart that shows a wide range of discounts rates, economic growth rates (in darker shade of blue) and FCF Growth Rates. *This table highlights in green share prices over $152.65, the share price at the time of writing. Using this website, I calculated that the WACC was 7.3% but after adjusting for a one time Gain on Healthcare Technology of 3.947B dollars I found an adjusted WACC of 7.46%. Then using a risk adjusted approach to calculate the FCF, which can be found here, I calculated the following:Risk Adjusted CAGR of Free Cash Flow: 0.62%Risk Adjusted Average FCF growth Rate: 4.61%Looking at the table you can see that using either of these numbers for a FCF growth rate will give you a strong upside in most scenarios from the current share price of $152.65. I included the Average FCF growth rate because it seemed as though FCF only fell off in the Trailing Twelve Month, so it gave me a better idea of what a realistic growth rate going forward is.To give you some perspective Morningstar has fair value of $186.46 for McKesson, which would coincide with about a 0.62% FCF growth rate, a 7.46% WACC and a 3% economic growth rate as I calculated above. From a technical perspective, McKesson looks poised for a breakout. The MACD has just undergone a bullish crossover and the RSI is at 46, leaving McKesson significant room to grow before becoming ""overbought."" We can see that the formation of the recent lows at $145 have given McKesson a higher lower than its previous low of $135. Higher lows signify a bullish breakout, and this is evidenced in the chart below. We can also see that McKesson is on the verge of surpassing its 200-day SMA. If broken, this will represent another bullish trend indicator.*daily chartAs mentioned previously, McKesson was featured on a 60 Minutes episode that named McKesson as one of the contributors to the opioid crisis in America. They accuse McKesson of failing to report extremely unusually large opioid orders in an effort to increase corporate profit. These allegations were brought on by the DEA and DOJ. As you can imagine these are serious allegations that could lead to criminal charges. The likelihood of this outcome is very difficult to quantify, so I leave it too you to determine how likely it is. As you can see, McKesson faces resistance in its growth and has some publicity risk. However, when you consider the growth of the pharmaceutical industry, the demographic trends supporting the sector and the fact that on a valuation basis it is about 20% below its fair value, McKesson offers a buying opportunity on the short term and long term. *I openly encourage feedback about my articles as I am trying my best to learn as much about investments as possible.

4170834,101421,2018-05-07T14:49:41-04:00,McKesson has agreed to acquire Medical Specialties Distributors [MSD] for $800 million.MSD is a medical supply and equipment distributor.The deal is part of a continuing effort by McKesson management to respond to changes in healthcare supply and device distribution.,"McKesson (MCK) has announced an agreement to acquire Medical Specialties Distributors [MSD] for $800 million.MSD has developed a distribution network for medical-surgical and infusion supplies and biomedical services.MCK continues to acquire firms to expand its footprint and position itself as healthcare supply and device delivery extends away from hospital environments to the home.Stoughton, Massachusetts-based MSD was founded in 1984 as a distributor for medical products services to businesses and individuals.Management is headed by CEO Tom Burke, who has been with the firm since 2016 and was previously SVP and General Manager at Cardinal Health (CAH) and CEO of Novis Pharmaceuticals.Below is an overview video of MSD:(Source: TheMSDLLC)MSD’s primary offering categories include:According to a 2017 market research report by MarketsAndMarkets, the global medical supplies market is expected to reach $136.63 billion by 2021.This represents a CAGR of 6.8% from 2016 to 2021.The main drivers for this expected growth include increasing hospital-acquired infections, the rising number of surgeries, increasing incidence of diseases, growing geriatric population and demand for better medical products and solutions.Major competitive vendors that currently provide medical supply distribution include:Amazon (AMZN) was rumored to be interested in moving into the healthcare products distribution space, but no company announcements have been made.McKesson disclosed the acquisition price as valued at $800 million. Management didn’t file an 8-K and said only that it ‘expects the transaction will be modestly accretive to Adjusted Earnings per diluted share in Fiscal 2019.’It’s common now for management to reference ‘Adjusted Earnings’ effects since that is usually better looking than GAAP, so I presume on a GAAP basis, the deal is not accretive to earnings.MCK announced the deal in the context of a multi-phase reorganization effort that will cost the firm between $150 million-$210 million in Fiscal 2019.Management said the ‘initiative comprises multiple growth pillars and includes a comprehensive review of the company’s operations and cost structure, designed to increase efficiency, accelerate execution and improve long-term performance.’The firm is acquiring MSD as a notable effort to take advantage of what it believes are important trends in patient care including:As MCK stated about the MSD deal in particular,MCK’s stock has dropped on the reorg and acquisition announcements as the chart below indicates:(Source: SEEKING ALPHA)MCK stands little changed from where it was 12 months ago.

4151077,103771,2018-02-27T10:17:35-05:00,"The pharmaceutical wholesale industry is expected to keep growing.McKesson is an industry leader, and along with two other companies represent 95% of the market.According to analysts, McKesson's earnings are expected to have a CAGR of 8.67% until 2021.The company's P/E is low when compared to its 13-year median.","As I have written before, there is reason to believe that current market valuations are high. Even Janet Yellen seems to think so. Heck, concerns about current valuations are what started the sell-off that occurred at the beginning of the month (even though valuations continue to be quite high). This environment makes it very difficult for investors to find fundamentally undervalued companies that would make good long-term investments; even Warren Buffett is having trouble finding good opportunities. I think that I have found one such opportunities in McKesson (NYSE:MCK).At a time when most stocks' P/E is way above their historical median, McKesson's is actually well below. Obviously, P/E alone is no reason to buy a stock. But after further examining the fundamentals of this company, reasons to invest kept appearing. First off, McKesson is a leader in an industry poised to keep growing, and - at least according to analysts - the company is going to capitalize on this growth.Another important fact about the industry is that it is a heavily consolidated one, which means that there is very low competition and that the big players' risk is very small. Also, at a time when the economy's growth will likely slow down, the nature of the healthcare industry presents an opportunity to invest without being exposed to large losses if a recession were to happen.McKesson is the oldest and largest healthcare company in America. It serves more than 50% of U.S. hospitals and 20% of physicians, and delivers one-third of all medications used daily in North America. Its operations cover more than 16 countries. Its +36 billion dollars market cap makes MCK the largest pharmaceutical wholesaler in the US.Although McKesson Corporation provides medical supplies and care management tools, it is primarily a pharmaceutical wholesaler. As you can observe in the chart below, more than 95% of McKesson’s revenues come from the pharmaceutical distribution and services business.(By the author)Industry trends and the industry's current status give investors great insights into the future cash flow of any given company. In this regard, the pharmaceutical wholesale industry is a good place to find opportunities. The industry grew slightly more than 24% between fiscal year 2014 and fiscal year 2015. That translates to an 11.57% annual growth rate.(By the author)McKesson, with the other big two companies of the pharma wholesale industry, AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC) and Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH) have capitalized on the industry growth. Below is a graph that shows the continued and fast growth in revenue that the big three have had since 2012. (Source)It is evident on this graph that the growth rate has diminished since 2015. This, nevertheless, is not unique to the big three retailers but to the industry as a whole. Pricing pressures have forced revenue growth down, and will likely continue. According to Adam J. Fein, Ph.D, from MDM:This is mainly caused by two things. The first one is that the retail pharmacy industry is consolidating. The top pharmacies - CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD), Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX) and UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) - now account for more than 40% of the wholesalers’ U.S. distributions revenues. These are the retailers that, through more negotiating power, provide the lower margins for wholesalers.The other reason why revenue growth is expected to slow down is, as Fein puts it, thatIn other words, the big retailers are pushing the mom and pop stores to lower their prices. Evidently, the increased pressure on retailers’ margins is going to affect the wholesalers’ margins.Still, the scope of this trend should not be magnified. According to the QuintilesIMS “2017-2021 Market Prognosis,” the industry is going to grow at a capitalized annual growth rate of 5.4% in North America until 2021. This is twice the growth rate that the most optimistic forecasters expect from the United States GDP. In Europe, too, the market is expected to grow at twice the rate of the economy. Evaluate, in its “European Pharma Outlook to 2022,” expects the market to grow at a CAGR of 4.5%. So although the industry growth has slowed down, we should not expect it to slow down more than what it has.Another favorable trend to the industry is that retail chains are starting to shift away from self-warehousing in favor of direct-store deliveries from wholesalers. This means that for retailers it is going to be virtually impossible to displace wholesalers.As you may have inferred from the “big three” graph, the 426 billion dollar industry is strongly dominated by just three wholesalers who represent over 95% of its market share.(By the author)The Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) is a commonly accepted measure of market concentration. The HHI of this particular industry in the United States is 3081, per my calculations. To give you a better picture of what this means, the U.S. Department of Justice uses the HHI to evaluate potential mergers, and considers a value below 1500 to be a competitive marketplace, between 1500 and 2500 to be a moderately concentrated marketplace and anything greater than that to be a highly concentrated marketplace. A 3081 HHI value means that if every one of the big three companies gave away 10% of its revenues to all of the smaller players, evenly distributed, the industry would still be considered highly consolidated.McKesson has seen consistent growth in both revenue and income since 2005. Given its position in the healthcare industry - not very vulnerable to recessions - the company was able to grow even during the great recession. Though it seems that there is no recession close by, it is always a plus in any portfolio to have a company that is not going to suffer in a recession or in a market crash.Analysts expect it to continue growing its earnings at a CAGR of 8.67% until 2021. But what is even more interesting is that in January, 4 analysts increased their earnings forecast for the next two years, giving reason to think not only that the stock is gaining momentum, but also that in the last quarter of last year, the overall picture improved.MCK only grew about 9.76% in the last 12 months compared to the 15.3% that the S&P 500 grew, mainly because of concerns about the Obamacare repeal that would have been negative to the industry. But with the repeal out and a republican administration at least for the next three years, it seems highly unlikely that any laws with the potential to undermine the industry are going to be passed.It is also curious that in the current high valuation environment of the market (The S&P 500 P/E is 25.96 compared to its historical median of 14.69) both the future (11.78) and the current (6.77) P/E of MCK are well below its 13-year median of 17.24. The current valuation seems particularly low when we consider the analysts' forecasts for the next four years.McKesson Corporation is a well positioned company in a well-positioned industry. Nevertheless, its P/E seems undervalued when compared to industry peers, its historical median and the market as a whole. For that reason, I consider it to be a great opportunity in the current environment. Given that its fundamental business is very solid and is expected to continue growing, and that the company lagged the market despite the Obamacare repeal failure, I strongly believe that MCK is going to outperform the market this year. Its recession-proof nature, low valuation and solid fundamentals also make it a great long-term opportunity."
4184667,67113,2018-06-29T03:52:14-04:00,"Shares tumble by 6%+ due to Amazon's purchase of Pillpack.The market has overreacted, like it did with Whole Foods and retail stocks last year.McKesson will fight tooth and nail to keep the spread it is making between its providers and manufacturers.We will remain long the stock.","McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) got hammered on Thursday after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced the purchase of online pharmacy Pillpack. Both distributors of drugs such as MCK as well as retail pharmacy chains such as Walgreen (NASDAQ:WBA) fell hard yesterday on the news. The Pillpack purchase was probably the most obvious way for Amazon to enter this market (on the retail side). However, I feel the market (similar to retail) has overestimated the damage Amazon can do here.We had the same overreaction in retail when Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods was announced. However since that acquisition, most of the company's competitors, such as Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), and Target (NYSE:TGT), are well up on their lows of 2017. I feel the same will happen in the pharmaceutical sector once the market comes to its senses.We have been long MCK for the bones of 12 months and haven't really caught a break. Between the pricing pressure the company has gone through in recent quarters to also the loss of Rite-Aid volume, the waters have remained choppy for MCK. Then, shares lost another 6% on the back of this announcement yesterday.Investors need to remain patient. When events take place such as we had yesterday, it's good to take a long at the long-term financials. Why? Because it's McKesson's competitive advantages that will protect its margins or spread (which are razor-thin already) against elevated competition. Here is how the company has fared with its key financials over the past decade.As we can see from the main financials, every one of them is in a solid uptrend over the past decade. I purposely included Operating Income instead of net profits, due to the ugly $1.7 billion charge we saw in the fourth quarter in its latest fiscal year. This number has distorted the earnings a tad when compared to 10 years ago, but again, it is only a temporary charge.I think what the market is missing here is that the true end-customer is not the person on the street buying his monthly quota, but rather the government, insurance companies and also regular companies which obviously include plans in work employment contracts. These are the real buyers, not the consumers. How Amazon handles this paradigm remains to be seen. However, investors need to understand that this is not a black and white situation where the largest company with the biggest scale wins. Experience in this market, therefore, is a precursor for success, which is why we will remain long MCK, especially at this valuation.Remember, although MCK's margins are rising, gross margins are still only fractionally above 5%. This is the company's spread, and no matter how Amazon launches its attack on the drug market, McKesson will fight tooth and nail to defend its patch. It can do this a number of ways. The company could hypothetically ""lease"" its infrastructure to the manufacturers and also do deals on the selling side with the providers. It's all about keeping that spread which has taken decades to build up.Amazon likes going into sectors where it perceives prices can be reduced drastically. Although there may be other parts of the pharmaceutical sector where this may very well be true, I believe McKesson's business will stand the test. Remember, the 3 big distributors control this section of the pharmaceutical industry, and I believe it will remain this way. Long MCK."
4148152,20297,2018-02-19T15:36:12-05:00,,"Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been one of the most innovative and disruptive companies of this century, with incredible success in areas that lie outside of what has been historically perceived as its core business (book selling).Thus, every announcement or speculation that Amazon will enter into a particular industry sends stocks of that industry into a tailspin. Investors sell first and ask questions later. When Amazon announced its purchase of Whole Foods, grocery stores declined as much as 30%. Even Tesco (OTCQX:TSCDF), separated by an ocean from Whole Foods, was down on that news.A big part of Amazon's success has come from not being taken seriously by its competition. Amazon was able to create a huge lead in AWS (Amazon Web Services) because the competition (Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) did not give Amazon enough respect. Competitors thought, ""what does a book seller know about the cloud?"" Well, according to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, such thinking gave Amazon a much bigger lead over its rivals. Today, everyone takes Amazon seriously. Indeed, fear of Amazon is reaching paranoia levels.McKesson (NYSE:MCK) shares, for example, took a 20% dive during the fourth quarter of 2017 on speculation that Amazon would start distributing pharmaceuticals in the U.S. As McKesson shareholders, my firm took this speculation seriously, but upon further investigation, it became evident that such concerns were overblown. After the market cooled off from fourth quarter worry about Amazon, McKesson shares recovered.Then, in late January, news that Amazon, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) will join forces to drive down U.S. healthcare costs hit healthcare sector stocks, including McKesson.How big of a punch could this be? McKesson is the largest distributor of pharmaceuticals in the U.S. Its 2018 sales are on track to exceed $210 billion. It is important to point out that McKesson is not a retailer but a distributor. It is one of three railroads for drugs in the U.S. McKesson distributes drugs to thousands of independent pharmacies, as well as giants like CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD), and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), McKesson operates two distinct distribution businesses: branded and generics. Though these businesses may look similar on the surface, the economic models of branded and generic businesses are quite different.In the distribution of branded drugs (about 70% of McKesson's revenue and 30% of profits), McKesson has a fee-for-service model. Pharmaceutical companies want to be involved in high-value activities: chiefly, inventing and manufacturing drugs. Getting drugs to thousands of pharmacies on a timely basis and collecting accounts receivable is not the business they want to be in. They don't have the scale and distribution know-how of McKesson, Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH), and AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) - that collectively control 90% of drug distribution in the U.S. Thus, the likes Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) pay drug distributors a small ""fee for service,"" and pharmaceutical companies (not distributors) negotiate prices with pharmacies.More than 90% of McKesson's profit in this segment is driven by volume, while just 10% is linked to changes in drug prices. Pfizer, for instance, despite its might, would still have higher distribution costs than McKesson because it doesn't have McKesson's scale and focus on distribution efficiency. So, Pfizer is happy to pay McKesson this service fee and not think about drug distribution.In its generic drug distribution business (about 30% of sales, 70% of earnings), McKesson uses its enormous buying power to buy drugs at low prices from generics manufacturers and sell at higher prices to pharmacies. Since it can source the same drug from various manufacturers, it leverages better prices from the likes of Mylan (MYL) and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA). Drug distributors are a significant deflationary force in generic pricing - good for consumers, not great for Teva or Mylan.So, McKesson has a wide protective moat, which includes the distinct possibility that Amazon's adventure into drug distribution could lead to miserable failure. Here's why:1. Amazon cannot match McKesson's buying power or negotiating power when it comes to generics. Current Amazon sales of pharmaceuticals are somewhere between zero and slightly above zero. McKesson's sales are pushing $210 billion, about $65 billion of which comes from generics.Walmart is the fourth-largest pharmacy in the U.S., with sales of $20 billion. It had distributed drugs, but in 2016, it signed a distribution deal with McKesson. Walmart realized it could get better prices for generics through McKesson. Amazon, with near-zero sales, doesn't stand a chance.2. Amazon has no structural advantage. In the fight against Barnes & Noble (NYSE:BKS) and Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), Amazon could charge lower prices than brick-and-mortar retailers because it had a structural advantage - it did not own stores and have all the extra costs associated with them. On one of his conference calls, McKesson CEO John Hammergren said his company was Amazon before Amazon was Amazon. Indeed. McKesson has highly specialized warehouses designed to distribute drugs. It can get any drug to any pharmacy in the U.S. within hours.3. McKesson's pretax margins are just 1.7%. If Amazon is looking to cut fat in the pharmaceutical industry, this is not where the fat is.4. Distributing and selling drugs is not like selling or distributing most anything else. First, some drugs require refrigeration, and others are controlled substances. Distributing them puts an extra regulatory (and self-policing) burden on distributors. McKesson has paid fines and recently received plenty of negative publicity from ""60 Minutes"" for distributing opioid pain medications to legal pharmacies who illegally sold the medicine on the black market.Second, unlike in almost any other industry, pharma consumers are price-insensitive. If you are on Medicare, Medicaid, or a copay/low-deductible private insurance plan, you really don't care if you are paying the lowest price because you don't see the price (other than for copay). For this group of drug consumers, which constitutes the bulk of the U.S. population, lower drug prices are not an incentive to switch.Moreover, let's say Amazon starts an online pharmacy and self-distributes. Internet-savvy millennials are not the ones consuming most of the drugs in the U.S. Their parents and grandparents are. This demographic still has brick-and-mortar habits that are less likely to be broken anytime soon. Also, major pharmacies already have mail-order operations. It would be logical for Amazon to try to get into the almost-trillion-dollar pharma business, but its success here will be limited, and it will take decades to gain a meaningful market share.5. Suppose Amazon opens an online pharmacy and succeeds. It would probably take five to 10 years to reach sales of, let's say, $10 billion (half of Walmart's current drug sales). Let's assume that Amazon self-distributes and will not use McKesson, or that it decides to employ the services of Cardinal Health. This would steal less than a year of current growth from McKesson, in five to 10 years.Put simply, the laws of economics still apply - even to Amazon. Drug distributors are strong financially and have great scale and a tremendous purchasing-power advantage. Distributors' stocks may take a dive, but their business will be fine in the long run. The only competitive advantage Amazon has against drug distributors is that Wall Street completely ignores its profitability and focuses only on revenue growth.McKesson is one of the U.S. stock market's most interesting investments. Its business is future-proof. The demand for its product is not cyclical and is likely to continue to grow as the U.S. population ages. Higher or lower interest rates, recession or no recession, inflation or deflation, McKesson's earnings power will continue to march ahead for a long time.McKesson has a conservative balance sheet; it can pay off its debt in less than two years. McKesson pays a lower dividend than its competitors, but it has purchased a third of its shares over the last decade. Expected earnings of about $13 a share this year could grow to $15 in 2019. At a conservative 15 times earnings, McKesson is worth about $225 a share. However, McKesson has spun off its technology business into Change Healthcare, which could go public in 2019. McKesson owns 70% of Change Healthcare, and my firm estimates McKesson's interest is worth about $25-30 a share. Thus, a conservative estimate of McKesson's value is about $250.Accordingly, my firm took advantage of recent weakness in McKesson's shares and increased our position.Originally published on ContrarianEdge.com."
4189902,101928,2018-07-25T12:11:21-04:00,Medical distributors' stock prices have fallen on similar industry headwinds.The market might be overstating concerns: shares look attractive at current levels.Investors should not be fooled by the dividend yield: McKesson is a better choice over Cardinal.,"In an industry already facing some pressure because of drug pricing volatility, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) acquisition of online pharmacy PillPack has sent shares of the ""big three"" medical distributors McKesson (MCK) AmerisourceBergen Corp (ABC) and Cardinal Health (CAH) into a tailspin. Cardinal Health has been the most punished by the market and shares are down more than 20% YTD. Although competitors haven't lost as much as Cardinal, I do not think the Dublin-based company to be the top ""buy-the-dip"" pick in the space. Here is why.YTD return of medical distributors (Source: Morningstar)When the chart looks ugly, it is time for old-school contrarians to come forward and dig out value from the dustbin. As a long-term investor, the current situation seems a good entry point to scoop up shares at attractive valuations, while doom and gloom still abound in the Street. In fact, there are reasons to believe the market has been overreacting to at least some of the concerns here. The Amazon fear will probably turn out to be a remake of the Whole Foods story: the PillPack threat is more imaginary than real, as the three distributors still enjoy a competitive advantage over new entrants including Amazon. The dedicated distribution network built by the incumbents is not easy to replicate: drugs are not another kind of boxes to be picked, packed and delivered. It will take significant time and efforts to develop knowledge, scale and most importantly relationships with the big pharma. Even if Bezos decides to invest heavily in the space, he may find that he has thrown billions to scrap the same 1% margin as the efficient incumbents. If Amazon wants to throw money here to have a seat at the table, they will probably get to add one at the dining table, but only to find there's no 'fat' to cut out. On the bright side, however, all players will enjoy some organic growth, as the secular trend of an aging population which requires more and more drugs continues.If medical distributors are here to stay, it seems overall a good time to invest in companies like McKesson and Cardinal Health. The fall of the last few months has brought shares to trade at attractively low-P/E valuations. With a 2018 EPS guidance of $13.0 - $13.8 and analysts' consensus of $13.41, MCK trades at an fwd P/E of 9.9. As for CAH, with midpoint guidance of $4.90 and analysts' consensus of $4.92, fwd P/E is also around 10. Even if MCK is likely to miss Q1 earnings on Thursday, consensus still believes earnings will grow more than 6% to $14.5 EPS in 2020.McKesson earnings forecast (Source: CNN Money)When considering a ""normalized"" P/E of about 15.0x, discount seems in excess of 30% in both cases, even though in recent years multiples in the 15x ~ 20x region have been all but uncommon. The 15x multiple seems therefore prudent, considering these distributors are well-established corporations operating on razor-thin margins and with moderate growth prospects going forward. This ""rule of thumb"" valuation seems confirmed by analysts as well. Morningstar has put a ""5-star"" rating on both stocks, meaning the analyst following them believes they are both currently trading at more than 30% discount to fair value. The analyst points at a $210 fair value for McKesson, a number which can be easily obtained by multiplying the upper end of the 2018 EPS guidance at a 15x P/E multiple ($13.8 x 15 = $207). However, I believe a more compelling bull case based on a good DCF valuation model (which also includes a Monte Carlo simulation!) has already appeared on SeekingAlpha in this article. Considering I agree with the author's thesis and there is little I wish to add to his take on MCK valuation, I suggest everybody who wants to delve deeper into the numbers to read the piece. However, Morningstar also suggests CAH has a fair value of $82 per share and trades at an even higher discount to fair value of 40%... Is CAH the (slightly) better value among the two? While I believe there's no real reason for Cardinal to trade at a premium over McKesson and therefore a more reasonable rule-of-thumb valuation is $4.92 x 15 = $74, there are other far more important reasons to believe an investment in McKesson seems a wiser pick at current levels.In every value investor dream, undervalued shares quickly appreciate back to ""fair value,"" and investors swiftly reap hefty profits. Unfortunately, the market is seldom so accommodating to contrarians, who on the opposite have to often ""back up the truck"" and keep their faith strong. Organizations are never created equal, so odds will be more favorable to those who choose the company that in the long-term has shown consistent results and the management who has the most reliable track record. There has been a definite difference in performance between MCK (which has overperformed the broad market over the years) and CAH, which on the opposite has underperformed the SPY when considering a 10-year horizon (or longer).MCK vs. CAH total returns (Source: Morningstar)My biggest problem with CAH is management execution. In the past few years, Cardinal first elected international wholesale expansion as a driver for growth: in 2013, Cardinal was the pioneer player in China among the big three, and the company invested massively in growing its business there. Then, last year management reversed course and decided to sell its Chinese operations. In the meanwhile (2015) management decided to acquire Cordis, diversifying its business and get into medical devices. I find this lack of focus a warning sign on CAH management. Although the jury is still out on the Cordis acquisition, the company has already admitted having troubles to put the pieces together. Cardinal has already lowered guidance for the current year over ""a negative impact by effective tax rate change associated with Cordis unit"" and acknowledge that resolve issues ""is going to take some time.""At first glance, Cardinal seems currently a better DGI pick: its yield is relatively high at almost 4%, and the conservative payout ratio leaves ample room for the distribution to grow over time. CAH's dividend compares strongly to the ""meager"" 1% yield of McKesson, but MCK has also returned a significant amount of cash to its shareholders over the years, although through buybacks. In the last ten years, MCK diluted share count has shrunk 25%, while CAH shareholders have also enjoyed a 12% reduction in share count. But while both companies have returned significant amounts of cash to shareholders, MCK has just performed much better by growing its business significantly while doing so (with a revenue CAGR of about 8% in the last decade), something that Cardinal just hasn't done nearly so well (revenue CAGR of about 4%).And the growth difference is what ultimately explains share performance. At the end of the day, when you build a moat based on scale, it is good to be the industry leader rather than the runner-up.To take a better look at what revenues already suggest, I checked the Free Cash Flow trend for Cardinal and McKesson over the last decade. Considering both companies had similar FCF of about $3 per share in 2008, the difference in what happened next is quite striking:Although earnings wouldn't show a much different picture, I chose FCF/Share as a measure for comparison to straighten out some accounting differences. Moreover, cash flow is perhaps the best measure to determine the resources that companies can muster for dividends and buybacks.While there are reasons to believe both CAH and MCK are undervalued, most of the times similar discounts to estimated fair values do not result in comparable investment returns. McKesson is the industry leader, a well-run business trading at a desirable price. For this reason, I rate MCK a STRONG BUY as long as the company trades at a forward P/E below 10, and I believe the company to be a far superior pick to CAH for new investors. As for Cardinal Health, the company faces similar industry trends and currently trades at the same very low P/E multiple as McKesson: considering the odds, a purchase at this levels will probably turn out fine. However, I believe management execution, which has been CAH's Achilles heel, has to improve. Otherwise stock will keep underperforming both the market & peers."
4148028,103970,2018-02-19T02:42:35-05:00,"McKesson is the giant of all medical distributors, and it’s ready to take on any headwinds or competitors.The company fundamentals are above average, but more importantly, its longevity and dominance make it a solid investment for the future.Value is returned to shareholders in four ways, especially via acquisitions.The pros of the company are many while the risks include stricter regulations, a money-hungry CEO, and a new threat from Amazon’s health insurance company.Various valuation ranges show that once this company gets through short-term headwinds, the share price could soar.","(McKesson might not be a household name, but it's been around since 1833 and is ranked #5 on the Fortune 500).I had never heard of McKesson until the company began showing up in the BTMA Stock Analyzer as a possible buy. From that point on, I began noticing the name when I was in my doctor's office. I saw ""McKesson"" on a wheel chair, on a bottle of rubbing alcohol, and on various medical supplies. After learning more, I found out just how immense this 185-year old company is and about its overwhelming control over the US pharmaceutical distribution system.The sheer size, dominating control, and ability to be a low-cost producer in an industry with super slim margins are the main reasons why it will endure through the hardships now being faced by healthcare companies. When competitors can no longer compete, this aggressive company will buy them up and come out of these hard times bigger and better than before.McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) has an above-average 70/100 company rating according to the BTMA Stock Analyzer. It has decent marks on most categories like Upward Price per Share, Return on Equity, consistent and increasing EPS, and Ability to Recover from a Downturn, but is lacking in Return on Invested Capital and Gross Margins.(Source: BTMA Stock Analyzer - company rating scores)The past 10 years of share price movement have been relatively good for MCK as it has outperformed the S&P 500 and its competitor, Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH). However, MCK's gains were outperformed by its other competitor, AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC). This chart is useful to give us an idea of how MCK's share price moves in relation to the market and its competitors.McKesson's earnings over the first seven years in this 10-year frame were rocky, then earnings began accelerating over the past three years. Especially the most recent year of EPS saw huge growth, but if you look closer into the financial statements of the company, you'll realize that this EPS of $22.73 is misleading. The Q4 of 2017 shows that the EPS was elevated due to a one-time transaction related to McKesson's recent merger and acquisition activity. Therefore, after removing this one-time transaction benefit, the adjusted EPS for the year is 11.61.(Source: BTMA Stock Analyzer - 10 years of earnings)As a result of adjusting the EPS, we will also need to adjust the PE Ratio which was exaggerated because of the one-time transaction. So instead of a PE Ratio of around 7, we need to adjust the PE Ratio to 14. These adjustments to the most recent year's EPS and PE Ratio greatly reduce the growth and estimated value of the company. We'll consider this when we do valuations.One of the most important measurements to look for is Return on Invested Capital or Return on Capital Invested. This measurement answers the question ""Is the company making money from investing the company's capital?"" In turn, this number gives us an idea of whether we will receive a satisfactory and predictable return from investing in this company's stock. The past five years of MCK's returns have been mediocre. The most recent year had a huge spike in ROIC, but this is most caused by the one-time gain received because of the acquisition activity. It should be expected that next year's ROIC levels will fall back down to more realistic levels.(Source: BTMA Stock Analyzer - return on invested capital)Gross Margins for MCK have been low. When considering companies as an investment, I like to see Gross Margins that are much higher (around 30% if possible), but for the industry MCK is above average when compared with other pharmaceutical distributors.(Source: BTMA Stock Analyzer - gross margin percent)The company has also been known to return value back to the shareholders in four main ways. Over the past 10 years, acquisitions have created the most value for shareholders and share repurchases come in second. Additionally, the company is reinvesting capital into its distribution centers by expanding and maintaining them, plus it invests even more money into its software systems. Finally, a small but increasing dividend is being paid at around 1%. Below you can see that the dividend yield has been increasing, and total yield may go up or down depending on how active MCK is with acquisitions and mergers.Looking at other misc. fundamentals, we can see that the company's balance sheet is fairly healthy with a decent debt-to-equity ratio that's below one. In the short-term the company also appears to have just enough assets to cover debts according to its Current Ratio. Remember that PE Ratio will need to be adjusted to 14 since we also adjusted 2017 EPS.After examining the fundamentals, we can see that the company is in decent shape, but there's nothing to get very excited about especially when you compare this company's fundamentals to many of the other good companies in other industries. I feel that this stock grabs the attention of value investors because of its current PE Ratio that seems ultra low. But we've revealed a more realistic PE Ratio of 14 that isn't as appealing for bargain hunters.Despite this, there is still value in McKesson, and I believe that most of it is based on the company's pros that we'll list below.For valuation purposes, I will be using an adjusted EPS of 11.61, which removes the one-time transaction benefit from the 2017 EPS. I've also adjusted the PE Ratio from 7 to 14 to reflect the adjustment in EPS.I've used various past averages of growth rates and PE Ratios to calculate different scenarios of valuation ranges from low to average values. The valuations compare growth rates of EPS, Book Value, and Total Equity.In the table below, you can see the different scenarios, and in the chart, you will see vertical valuation lines that correspond to the table valuation ranges. The dots on the lines represent the current stock price. If the dot is towards the bottom of the valuation range, this would indicate that the stock is undervalued. If the dot is near the top of the valuation line, this would show an overvalued stock.(Source: BTMA Wealth Builders Club)From this visual chart, we can clearly see that when considering past performance of MCK, the stock is now undervalued. When comparing the relation of MCK to the S&P 500, the stock is still undervalued. However, when considering future growth forecasts, the company is slightly overvalued. These valuation ranges suggest that short-term future outlook for the company is pessimistic and keeping the share price down, but according to past performance, the stock should do well and regain value once this downward pricing pressure eases up.Because of headwinds in the pharmaceutical industry, I would personally wait to see if MCK falls lower around $130-135. Then I'd wait out the pessimism and let the stock price rise back up.As we know, calculating values is an inexact science, so consider many methods and try to be more conservative and add a margin of safety as needed.There have recently been about the same amount of shares of MCK decreased from portfolios as added to portfolios. Below, you can see 19.5 million shares have been decreased vs. 18.5 million shares increased. However, there have been many more shares sold out (8.3 million) than new shares purchased (1.9 million).Therefore, according to these numbers, it is obvious that the selling off of MCK has helped to push the stock price further down during the last couple months.(Source: MCK's new and added positions)(Technical analysis is showing a slight oversold situation with a downward trend starting to bottom out. While there isn't strong confirmation of all three indicators showing a change in trends, it appears that MCK may be starting a short-term price climb if buying momentum increases).McKesson has 185 years as a successful company that knows how to survive and lead. It has had above-average fundamentals over the past 10 years and the company is so big and encompassing within its industry that it's hard to fail and even harder for competitors to enter and compete in this low-margin industry.The pros include strong economic moat, dominant control of its market, and pricing power. The company returns value to shareholders through share buybacks and aggressive acquisitions. The cons include a greedy CEO who likes to stuff his wallet at an amount that makes other CEOs look modest. The company's role in contributing to the Opioid Epidemic in USA is questionable. Finally, the biggest current drawbacks are headwinds caused by the tightening of regulations and pricing pressure on pharmaceutical companies.In the short term, these headwinds can result in decreased share price, but McKesson is arguably the best-positioned company to overcome these negative forces while buying up smaller failing companies to survive and thrive in the aftermath.McKesson should be a safe investment long into the future, especially if you're able to buy at a further discounted price while analysts and investors are being pessimistic about this stock and its industry.Thank you for reading.

4146491,103830,2018-02-14T08:41:03-05:00,Healthcare is a complex industry.Multiple variables which yet underdetermined will decide their future.Best place in your portfolio is in a basket of undervalued stocks.,"McKesson (MCK) is a global leader in healthcare supply chain management solutions, retail pharmacy, community oncology and specialty care and healthcare information technology. They divide their business into two main segments; McKesson Distribution Solutions and McKesson Technology Solutions. These two segments should not mislead an investor into thinking that they equally contribute to the company's existing business though. Currently the Distribution Solutions group contributes approximately 99% of their revenue or $195.9 billion. This can be further broken down into their North American segment which has revenues of $164.8 billion, their International segment which has revenues of $24.8 million and their Medical-Surgical distribution services which has revenues of $6.2 billion (Source: SEC Filings). While there are risks associated with every part of their business, a good deal of it is wrapped up into their North American operations due to its disproportional contribution to its revenue and earnings. In the past few years MCK has seen its stock price plummet from a peak of around $240 in 2015 to today's price of $148 (Source: Google Finance) which equates to an astonishing 40% loss in market capitalization. Much of this price reduction is a result of the perceived threat to their business derived from mainly two things, (1) The threat of Amazon (AMZN) deciding to become a competitor of MCK and (2) the effect of ongoing changes to the regulatory framework of the US healthcare industry. Both of these risks are real, but are extremely difficult to substantiate.MCK describes their business as a ""Healthcare Supply Chain Management Solutions"" company and if there is one thing that AMZN excels at, it would be (among other things) their supply chain management. Based on this you would think AMZN could easily compete successfully with MCK if they decided to, but that seems a bit preemptive to price into a stock considering we still don't know, if, how or when AMZN is thinking about competing. So how do you substantiate this threat? Currently I do not understand the North American healthcare industry enough to feel confident in whether I can properly assess MCK's competitive position, but we can assume the market has marked down MCK's prospects by about $20 billion in market capitalization and around 6-8 percentage points off future returns. So if you think that a combination of AMZN and new government regulations is going to reduce MCK's growth to around 4% per year (with all else being equal), you can still justify buying at these levels and do alright. But the inherent problem is how we evaluated the downside risk on this stock. It could range from being severe to non-existent. Recently, you can see the impact on a company's stock once AMZN indicates an interest in becoming one of its competitors by looking at what happened to United Parcel Service (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) on the day AMZN announced their intent to start self-performing increasingly more deliveries. But to handicap MCK's stock in the range of 40% in response to a threat which really cannot be substantiated quantitatively seems to be a bit overblown. One such example is when AMZN announced their Whole Foods purchase Kroger's (KR) stock sank to $19 per share but has since recovered to $27 (Source: Google Finance). Time will tell how it will actually play out in the long run but my opinion is that AMZN is not going to compete with nearly as many industries and companies as the market is pricing in to certain groups of stocks right now.In MCK's most recent 10-k (SEC Filings) the first Risk Factor that is summarized in Part I is ""Changes in the United States healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations"". In the next 4 pages of the 10-k they breakdown this risk into the following sub risks:Many of these variables are beyond my level of understanding of the US healthcare industry and even if I tried to learn about them I think the amount of effort required to get myself to some sort of level of comfort in terms of investing will be disproportionate to the potential return. I could be hugely mistaken on that, but I am willing to live with the consequences at this time. That being said, the long term success of any new policy is dependent on the financial health of all the stakeholders involved, which includes companies like MCK. So while there may be drastic changes coming, it is to ultimate benefit of government and tax payers that a new system provides the opportunity for companies to earn a decent return on their invested capital.From 2007-2016 MCK experienced 8.3% CAGR in revenue 10.8% CAGR in net income and 9.4% CAGR in free cash flow (Source: SEC Filings). If an investor were to prorate this growth into the future you could easily justify paying a multiple of over 20x which would equate to a share price roughly where it was in 2015. Under these assumptions, the stock is extremely cheap right now. AMZN however has a huge appetite for entering industries that fit into their long term strategy and it is obvious with their Whole Foods purchase that these strategies may not necessarily be in industries that have attractive qualities from an investor's point of view. The question I generally ask when I research stocks is what probability it has in providing a 7% annual return through a combination of multiple expansion and a discounted cash flow analysis. Today you can pick up MCK for a multiple of 14x on their normalized earnings which is a very reasonable price for a company that is not very capital intensive and provides modest growth going forward. But given the perceived threats I would be hesitant in buying at these levels. MCK is a lot harder for me to understand than a coffee chain that can break down their growth plan into the number of restaurants it plans to open each year. The best place for MCK in someone's portfolio in my view would be in a basket of stocks in which you believe are significantly undervalued. If you are an investor who likes to make take larger positions in your stocks (ex > 10%), I would hold off on buying into MCK right now and revisit if it takes another 10-15% drop."
4134592,103554,2017-12-31T10:05:47-05:00,"MCK is the largest pharmaceutical distributor in North America, and has been expanding its footprint by acquiring numerous smaller players.Overall, MCK’s fundamentals are solid, with consistent increases in the fundamentals.Although MCK acquired substantial debt as part of its recent acquisitions, that debt now appears to be returning to industry and historical norms.MCK appears to be fair valued, with a 0.9% dividend yield growing at a sluggish 4-5% for the last few years.","McKesson (MCK) is the largest pharmaceutical distributor in North America and a major player in healthcare. The company is riding the wave of industry consolidation and expanding its footprint by acquiring numerous smaller players. Currently, the McKesson’s fundamentals are respectable and the healthcare industry is experiencing solid tailwinds. While the company’s debt has notably increased due to recent acquisitions, McKesson appears to be returning to historical and industry norms. Based on a panel of valuation models, McKesson is fair to overvalued at the moment and I consider it to be a solid “hold”.Where do you buy your medications? Your local pharmacy? But where do they get their products? Pfizer (NYSE:PFE)? Merck (NYSE:MRK)? Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN)? Nope. They get them from a distributor like McKesson. But McKesson is much more than just a middle-man. Over the years, the company has expanded into a wide range of businesses, and now consists of two primary business segments, distribution services and technology solutions.The distribution solutions segment distributes branded and generic pharmaceutical drugs and other healthcare-related products internationally and provides an array of support services to community-based oncology and other specialty practices. It also provides medical-surgical supply distribution, logistics and other services to healthcare providers within the United States. Additionally, this segment operates retail pharmacy chains in Europe and Canada, and supports independent pharmacy networks within North America and Europe.The technology solutions segment supplies clinical, financial and supply chain management services to healthcare organizations. This segment also includes a significant investment by McKesson in Change Healthcare, a technology company, which provides software and analytics, network services and other offerings to healthcare payers, providers, and consumers.McKesson is North America’s largest pharmaceutical distributor, with more than 40,000 customers. During 2017, sales to their ten largest customers, including group purchasing organizations accounted for approximately 54.2% of their total revenue. Sales to their largest customer, CVS (NYSE:CVS), accounted for approximately 20.2% of total revenues.Looking broadly at the US economy, healthcare accounts for nearly 18% of GPD, and is still growing aggressively. Healthcare spending is predicted to account for nearly 20% of the economy in 2025. As healthcare spending grows, so will healthcare related companies.The healthcare sector as a whole is experiencing a wave of consolidation. Smaller companies are being bought up by larger ones, and larger companies are merging into even bigger ones (e.g. the recent proposed merger between CVS and Aetna (NYSE:AET)). McKesson is no exception, and has already bought up several smaller specialty distributors. McKesson is number 5 on the Fortune 500. By virtue of its size alone, it is likely to emerge a winner in the race to oligopoly.McKesson is continuing to expand its footprint. Just last month, McKesson announced the acquisition of RxCrossroads, a provider of pharmacy dispensing and logistics services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers. So long as it doesn’t overextend itself, McKesson’s focus on acquisitions could serve as a major source of value creation for the company.Corporate executives get paid generously - some would say obscenely - for their work. They’re human just like the rest of us, so it is reasonable to expect them to guide their company in ways that give them the best performance reviews and the highest bonuses. The basics of McKesson’s management compensation plan, as outlined in the 2017 proxy statement are laid out below.Short-term bonuses are based on two criteria, adjusted EPS (75%) and adjusted operating cash flow (25%). Once the bonus is determined, an individual modifier is applied by the Board to increase or decrease the bonus as they see fit. The modifier is based on an individual executive’s contributions and performance on non-financial objectives.Long-term bonuses are determined as follows. 20% is based on a combination of adjusted operating cash flow and average ROIC. 40% is based on total shareholder returns (TSR) vs the S&P500 Health Care Index and adjusted EPS. The final 40% is based on the stock’s price performance.McKesson’s long-term compensation plan is decent, but not great. I am not a fan of compensation based heavily on TSR, EPS, or share price, as a focus on these metrics encourages value-destroying activities (questionable mergers and acquisitions, excessive share buybacks, unsustainable dividend policies, etc.) so long stock as price is pushed upwards. I like the use of ROIC as it encourages value creating activities, but it only composes a fraction of the compensation plan.Overall, the compensation plan isn’t noteworthy, but it’s in line with those used by many other companies.There are four ways a company can return value to shareholders. First, reinvestment in the business via capital expenditures. Second, by paying dividends. Third, by engage in share buybacks. Finally, they can engage in merger and acquisition (M&A) activities. To get a feel for how McKesson spends its money, I graphed yearly data, taken from the statement of cash flows, on how much McKesson spends on each of these four options.Over the last 10 years, McKesson has been engaging in relatively low and steady investment in property, plant, and equipment. These investments went towards maintaining and expanding their distribution centers and networks, and also includes substantial investments in capitalized software systems.McKesson has a long history as a dividend paying company. The amount of money paid out as dividends has been slowly increasing over the last decade, which is in line with McKesson’s dividend increase history. Currently, the yield is around 1%, which is a below the S&P 500 average, and below the industry average as well. Ultimately, dividends are secondary to the fundamentals. Strong fundamentals create a long runway for price appreciation and continued dividend growth.McKesson has engaged in varying degrees of share repurchase activity over the last decade. Most recently, in both 2015 and 2016 the Board authorized substantial share repurchase programs. In 2017, repurchase activity continued under these authorizations. There is no indication yet as to whether share repurchases will continue into 2018. While the amount spent on share repurchases has been considerable, the change in share count has been small. From 2012 through 2016, McKesson repurchased about 7.2% of its shares. While I am not a fan of share buybacks, as many researchers believe them to be an exercise in value extraction rather than value creation, I do not consider McKesson’s program to be excessive. As a comparison, consider three companies I recently reviewed. The auto parts manufacturer Lear (LEA), the specialty chemicals company LyondellBasell (LYB), and the media company Viacom (VIAB) reduced their share counts by about 34%, 29%, and 26% respectively, over a similar time period.McKesson has undertaken a number of major acquisitions in the last several years, and some of the recent ones are highlighted here. In 2013, McKesson completed its acquisition of PPS World Medical, an American distributor of medical products, equipment, billing services, and pharmaceutical related products to non-hospital healthcare providers. In 2016, McKesson completed the acquisition of Vantage Oncology LLC and Biologics, which expanded their footprint in the rapidly growing specialty pharmaceuticals space. Also in 2016, McKesson completed their acquisition of Rexall Health, which operates approximately 470 retail pharmacies and expanded their retail footprint in Canada. Also in 2016, McKesson completed its acquisition of UDG Healthcare, which is based in Ireland and the UK and provides pharmaceutical and other healthcare products to retail and hospital pharmacies. Lastly, in 2017, McKesson completed its acquisition of Change Healthcare, a healthcare technology company which provides software, analytics, and network services.Now that we have a sense for McKesson’s priorities when it comes to returning value to shareholders, let’s begin our look at the company’s fundamentals.Note: Data was pulled from Morningstar. The graph was made by me.When evaluating a company, I start with the income statement. Starting at the top of the income statement, we see that revenue has been increasing slowly and steadily over time.When we look at operating income and net income, we see large spikes in 2016 and 2017. During these years, Change Healthcare Holdings (CHC) entered into a merger with McKesson to create a new business Change Healthcare (a healthcare related software and technology company), which consists of the entirety of CHC, and the majority of McKesson’s technology solutions business unit. The spikes in operating and net income are due to one time net gains from this transaction, so we shouldn’t expect a repeat in future reports.Free cash flow has generally increasing over the years. Despite some variability, this increase is roughly following that seen in net income.Looking to the future, McKesson is in a strong position to take advantage of industry-wide catalysts to continue growing its revenue streams.Having examined McKesson’s income, it’s time to dig deeper into its business efficiency and profitability.Note: Trendlines are shown in red. Data was pulled from Morningstar. The graph was made by me.When searching for investment opportunities, I look for efficient business practices and formidable economic moats (otherwise known as competitive advantage). These are the hallmarks of companies that can consistently deliver above average returns. In this section and the next, we’ll examine McKesson’s efficiency and profitability.We will begin evaluating McKesson’s efficiency by looking at gross margin (shown as % revenue). The two dotted lines represent rules of thumb. Values below 20% (yellow dotted line), suggest that a firm is in a fiercely competitive industry, values between 20% and 40% (green dotted line) suggest a highly competitive industry, and values above 40% may suggest a strong competitive advantage.Over the last decade, gross margins have generally increased from approximately 5% to around 6%, well below my rule of thumb. However, the margins are on the high end when compared to other pharmaceutical distribution companies. While these may not seem like impressive numbers, McKesson’s size and market share provides it with a sizable competitive advantage.Next, we’ll look at sales, general, and administrative costs (SG&A; shown as % revenue). Again, the dotted lines represent rules of thumb. Values between 30% (green dotted line) and 80% suggest a moderately competitive environment. And, values below 30% may suggest a strong competitive advantage.SG&A has remained below 5% for the last decade, which is well within my rule of thumb. SG&A is higher in both relative and absolute terms than several of McKesson’s competitors, but not high enough for me to be concerned.Looking at the earnings before taxes (EBT) margin, a metric that removes the effects of state and local taxes on earnings, we see a general trend that mirrors the slow improvement in gross margins over the last decade.The takeaway is that while McKesson operates in a highly competitive environment, it has been able to maintain the efficiency of its business while slowly growing margins. The trend towards industry consolidation will only help McKesson maintain its competitive advantage.Note: Trendlines are shown in red. Data was pulled from Morningstar. The graph was made by me.Three profitability ratios are commonly examined when evaluating a company. Return on assets (ROA) measures profitability relative to total assets. Return on equity (ROE) measures profitability relative to shareholder equity. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how efficiently a company uses its invested capital to generate profit, and is considered the best of these ratios.Like the profitability measures above, these ratios are used to help determine the presence of a competitive advantage and can be used to judge the profitability of McKesson relative to its industry. The green dashed lines drawn at 10% for ROA, 15% for ROE, and 15% for ROIC are rules of thumb, where consistent values above these bars suggest a strong competitive advantage. The orange dotted lines represent the industry averages (pulled from Aswath Damodaran’s awesome collection of data) for these ratios.All three profitability measures display similar trends over the last decade. All were roughly stable through 2015, and then in 2016 they spiked upwards. Through 2015, ROA was low (approximately 5%) compared to my rule of thumb, but was on par with the industry average.The recent spikes in ROE and ROIC warrant some explanation. If you recall from the above section, McKesson recently benefited from one time net gains from this transaction related to the formation of Change Healthcare. For several years, ROE and ROIC hovered around my 15% rule of thumb, but were below the industry average. Beginning in 2016, ROE soared to between 40% and 50%, and ROIC jumped to around 30%. These spikes are likely reflective of that one time gain, so we should expect ROE and ROIC to drop back towards historic norms (approximately 15%) in the future, which would still make McKesson a profitable company according to my rule of thumb.Overall, excluding the recent spike, ROE and ROIC have remained steady at levels close to my rule of thumb. This suggests that despite operating in a highly competitive environment, McKesson has been able to maintain a strong competitive advantage.Having reviewed McKesson’s profitability and efficiency, it’s time to move on to everyone’s favorite four letter word: debt.Note: Trendlines are shown in red. Orange lines represent current industry averages. Green lines represent rules of thumb for the presence of an economic moat. Data was pulled from Morningstar. The graph was made by me.Revenue, profitability, and moats all take a hit when serious competition arises or when the economy heads into a recession. Creditors don’t care about economic downturns. Debts must still be paid. Companies with lower debt burdens have greater resilience and flexibility when hard times hit. With that in mind, we now turn our attention to McKesson’s debt.First let’s take a look at the numbers. McKesson’s long-term debt increased through 2013, and then leveled off and began a slow decrease. So what does McKesson use its debt for? Taking a look at past annual reports, loans are regularly taken out for general business uses. In 2013, there was a large spike in McKesson’s debt due to several acquisitions (PSS World and US Oncology), from which McKesson inherited additional long-term debt.Is the debt manageable? To answer that, we’ll look at both the debt to equity ratio and the financial leverage ratio. The debt to equity ratio compares the amount of equity to the amount of debt. The financial leverage ratio compares a company’s assets to its equity. This may seem like an odd way to measure debt, but keep in mind that assets equal debt plus equity. So as equity decreases in proportion to debt, the ratio increases.The debt to equity ratio spiked in 2013 as a consequence of McKesson’s acquisitions, but has been decreasing in subsequent years as McKesson has paid off its debt. Overall, this doesn’t concern me as McKesson appears to be on track to pay down the debt that it took on as part of the acquisitions.The financial leverage ratio also slowly increased and spiked in 2013. Afterwards, it began a slow decrease. The financial leverage ratio has been greater than 4 for almost the entire last decade. This is very high compared to many other companies, but is in line with other competitor companies (Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) and Amerisource Bergen (NYSE:ABC)).Overall, I am not concerned about McKesson’s current debt load. While it spiked in 2013, McKesson has been reigning it back in. Hopefully, this trend will continue. The debt could become an issue if McKesson goes on another acquisition spree and overextends itself.Note: Trendlines are shown in red. Data was pulled from Morningstar. The graph was made by me.Looking at companywide measures of profitability tells us a lot. But as shareholders, we only own a fraction of the company, so it behooves us to examine a few items on a per share basis as well.The first graph in the below panel shows the number of shares outstanding. From 2012 through 2016, McKesson has repurchased about 7% of its shares. The share repurchases will likely continue as long as business conditions remain good.The next two graphs show earnings per share (EPS) and free cash flow (FCF) per share. Both of these graphs mirror the growth seen in the earlier net income and free cash flow graphs.In this section of my analysis, I determine the EPS and net income growth rates so that I can derive an estimated growth rate to use in the later valuation models. I normally use the last five years (2012-2016) data to make these estimates. However, the spike in net income and EPS seen in 2016, and to a lesser extent in 2015, will drastically skew attempts to estimate net income and EPS growth rate. To avoid the spikes, I am going to back up two years and use the 2010-2014 date range. From 2010 to 2014, net income has increased by 22.8% (5.3% annually), while EPS increased by 37.2% (8.2% annually).As McKesson recently went through some acquisition related structural changes, it’s hard to say whether these growth estimates will be the new normal for the company. However, I feel that these are reasonable estimates for a fairly mature company, and reflective of McKesson’s capacity for organic growth.And now it’s time for a brief discussion of dividends.Note: Trendlines are shown in red. Data was pulled from Morningstar. The graph was made by me.As we complete our survey of McKesson’s fundamentals, it’s finally time to talk about dividends. I prefer to discuss dividends last, because if the fundamentals don’t excite you, the dividend history is irrelevant - you shouldn’t be buying the stock.Over the last decade, McKesson’s dividend has been growing in fits and starts. In 2009 and 2012, the dividend did not grow. Dividend growth over the last few years has been slow, about 4% to 5% per year.For dividends, I focus on not only on growth, but also on sustainability. As a proxy for sustainability, I use the dividend payout ratio as calculated first using EPS and then using FCF per share. Both payout ratios have remained low, around 15%. These low payout ratios give plenty of room for McKesson to continue growing its dividend into the foreseeable future.However, my gut feeling is that we should not expect to see stellar dividend growth from McKesson. Despite the very low payout ratios, McKesson seems to be more focused on acquisitions (and to a lesser extent share buybacks) than dividend increases.Note: Trendlines are shown in red. Data was pulled from Morningstar. The graph was made by me.Now that we’ve covered the fundamentals, it’s time for exercises in valuation. But first a few caveats. Much like dividends, if the fundamentals of a stock don’t excite you, the valuation is pointless - you shouldn’t be buying the stock.I approach valuation by employing several different methods, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The more agreement between the results, the more confidence I have that my valuation reflects reality.The first approach is a relative valuation of McKesson vs its historical valuation. Five valuation ratios will be examined: Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, Price to Book (P/B) ratio, Price to Sales (P/S) ratio, Price to Free Cash Flow (P/FCF), and Dividend Yield (if present). In the graph below we assume that MCK is a mature company with a relatively stable range of valuation ratios, then we compare the current value to the historical range to get a feel for MCK’s current valuation relative to its past performance.To explain how the graphs are constructed and interpreted, we’ll walk through the P/E graph. I began by determining the high and low P/E value for each of the last 10 years. This was done by dividing the lowest and highest stock prices during a given year by the stock’s reported earnings for that year. Then I took the median of the past 10 years for the annual low P/Es (the green horizontal line) and the annual high P/Es (the red horizontal line). The x-axis of the graph is drawn at the midpoint between the two medians. If the current P/E (the blue diamond) is closer to the red line, the more overvalued the stock may be based on its historical highs. If the current P/E is closer to the green line, the more undervalued the stock may be relative to previous lows.The same process applies to P/B, P/S, and P/FCF. For dividend yield, higher dividends are associated with lower stock prices (remember dividend yield = annual dividend / stock price), so the graph appears flipped, with higher numbers representing undervaluation and lower numbers representing overvaluation.Compared to McKesson’s historical valuation, P/B, P/S, and dividend yield are in overvalued territory. P/E and P/FCF are both in undervalued territory.In summary, three out of five historical valuation metrics suggest that McKesson is currently overvalued.Note: Data were pulled from Morningstar. The graph was made by me.The second approach is a relative valuation of McKesson’s current valuation multiples to those of competitors in the same sector. In these graphs we can see how McKesson stacks up against similar companies, and how this family of companies compares to the S&P500 average (the solid black line), which approximates the market as a whole and serves as the reference. The green shaded area is undervalued vs the S&P500 and the red shaded area is overvalued. The orange dashed line indicates the industry average. Competitor companies are shown as black dots and McKesson is the blue diamond.Four ratios will be examined: Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, Price to Book (P/B) ratio, Price to Sales (P/S) ratio, and Dividend Yield.For competitor companies, I selected Cardinal Health, AmerisourceBergen, Henry Schien (HSIC), Patterson Companies (PDCO), and Owens and Minor (OMI).When compared to the S&P500, McKesson is undervalued based on P/E, P/B, and P/S, and is overvalued based on dividend yield.When compared to the industry average, McKesson is undervalued based on P/E and P/B, fair valued based on P/S, and overvalued based on dividend yield.When compared to other companies, McKesson is undervalued based on P/E, fair valued based on P/B and P/S, and overvalued based on dividend yield.To summarize, based on the competitor valuation model, McKesson is probably somewhere between fair and undervalued.Note: Blue diamond = MCK; Black dots = competitor companies; Black line = S&P500; Orange dashed line = Industry average. Green shaded area is undervalued vs the S&P500. Red shaded area is overvalued vs the S&P500. If data is not available for a particular company, it will not appear on the graph. Data were pulled from Morningstar. The graph was made by me.Having examined two different flavors of relative valuation, it’s time to take a crack at a discounted cash flow valuation, which allows us to estimate the intrinsic value of McKesson based on initial assumptions about McKesson’s future growth and discount value.The table below is a DCF matrix. By looking at an array of different estimations at once, we can base our decisions about over or under valuation on a range of assumptions instead of just one. These can be a bit complex at first glance, so let’s walk through it together.First, let’s look at just the numbers. The box in the center of the grid below shows the intrinsic value of McKesson based on the key assumptions outlined below.Each cell in the table corresponds to an intrinsic value computed by using different combinations of growth rates and discount rates. As we move horizontally, the assumed initial growth rate increases or decreases in 10% increments. As we move vertically, the assumed discount rate increases or decreases in 10% increments.Cells towards the top right represent optimistic estimates (higher initial growth and lower discount rate), will give higher intrinsic values and be more likely to suggest undervaluation. Cells towards the lower left represent skeptical estimates (lower growth and higher discount rates).The column on the far left represents a worst case scenario, and is based on a 0% (zero) initial growth rate. Intrinsic values presented in this column will probably be low and unappealing, but if you want to take a highly skeptical view of a stock, this column is your guide.Note: Green shaded cells indicate margin of safety >20%. Red shaded cells indicate margin of safety <20%. The table was made by me.Now that we have our intrinsic values calculated, we need to discuss margin of safety. A margin of safety is the difference between the estimated intrinsic value of the stock and the current market price. Remember that intrinsic values are based on mathematical models. They are a guide pointing us in the (hopefully) right direction, not a true indication of what a stock should be worth. We need to ask how much higher does the intrinsic value need to be for us to start being confident that the stock is undervalued.In the table, margin of safety is represented by the red or green shading that appears in each cell. The minimum margin of safety that I am willing to accept to believe that a stock is undervalued is 20%, which is indicated by white shading. As the intrinsic value increases above the 20% margin of safety threshold, the cells become green. The deeper the green shading, the higher the margin of safety. As the intrinsic value decreases below the 20% margin of safety threshold, the cells become red.A quick example of how this works: McKesson is currently trading at 152.57, a 20% margin of safety is added giving us 183.084. Green shading starts when the intrinsic value is predicted to be at least 183.084 and gets deeper as the estimated intrinsic value moves up. When the estimated intrinsic value is less than 183.084, the cell gets red shading and as intrinsic value decreases the red shading gets deeper.Using our base assumptions, McKesson has an intrinsic value of around $165, which implies an 8% margin of safety. Nowhere near high enough for me to start getting excited. Looking at the matrix as a whole, most of the cells are shaded red, suggesting that even if we alter our assumptions a bit, McKesson a margin of safety is unlikely to appear.Based on this model, McKesson is fair valued.Let’s partake in one more adventure in valuation modeling. This time we’re going to use a two-stage dividend discount model. Also, we’re not going to try to predict the future with this model. Instead, we’re going to determine what inputs give us the current market price of the stock. Once we’ve done that, we’ll have some idea of the assumptions that the market has already baked into McKesson’s price.For the two-stage dividend discount model, the following key assumptions produced an intrinsic value of $154.36 - pretty close to the current price.If we assume that the market price is a correct approximation of McKesson’s intrinsic value, the market expects the dividend to grow at 15% per year for 5 years, then drop down to a terminal growth rate of almost 9% per year.The reverse dividend discount model produces numbers that are much higher (by two to three times) than McKesson’s current dividend growth. This suggests that McKesson may be overvalued as the predicted growth needed to justify the price is much more aggressive than what is currently taking place.Now that we’ve finished our analysis of McKesson, let's see how the company stacks up against my six principles of investing.Yes. McKesson acts primarily as a pharmaceutical products distributor, but has also been expanding into a variety of other business areas. Overall the company is doing well, and is in a good position to continue making gains. McKesson’s executive compensation system deserves a mention here, not because it is particularly good for shareholders (it’s middle of the road), but because McKesson’s CEO, John Hammergren, was the highest paid CEO in the country in 2013. His pay was so absurdly high, even by CEO standards, that he was forced to agree to a 50% pay cut in response to shareholder outrage.Yes. I like the consistent increases in revenue, operating income, net income, and free cash flow. ROE and ROIC have been flirting with my rules of thumb for most of the last decade, suggesting that McKesson is a profitable company despite competing in a low margin industry.Yes. While the pharmaceutical products distribution industry has relatively low margins, scale matters. As the preeminent distributor in North America McKesson has the economy of scale needed to maintain its position. McKesson’s ROE and ROIC meet my rule of thumb and suggest that McKesson has a competitive advantage. McKesson’s acquisition strategy will work to further reinforce its competitive advantage over time, so long as the company doesn’t over extend itself.Yes. The absolute amount of debt held by McKesson is manageable and the debt to equity ratio is also reasonable. The financial leverage ratio is too high for my tastes, but it does appear to be generally in line with competitor companies. Currently, McKesson is reducing its debt, which is a positive sign. However, if they become more aggressive in their acquisitions, their debt load could potentially become unsustainable.Maybe. McKesson has EPS and FCF based payout ratios of below 45%, leaving plenty of room for dividend growth. Dividend growth stalled in 2009 (probably due to the Great Recession) and again in 2012 (probably due to a diversion of funds towards acquisitions). More recently, dividend growth has been slow (around 5%). My impression is that while McKesson is committed to their dividend, they are not focused on it. Investors shouldn’t consider McKesson to be a traditional dividend growth company, rather they should treat the dividend as a nice bonus while they await share price appreciation.No. McKesson appears fair to overvalued at the moment. Out of the four valuation models tested, one suggests undervaluation, one suggests fair valuation, and two suggest overvaluation. In the historical valuation model, three out of five measures suggested overvaluation. In the competitor valuation model, three out of four measures suggested potential undervaluation. The DCF model suggests fair valuation. Finally, when I ran a backwards looking dividend discount model to determine what growth estimates were baked into the stock price, it suggested that McKesson may be overvalued.Future regulation is a major risk not only to McKesson, but the entire healthcare sector. The present political climate is favorable to corporations, so McKesson can breathe easy for the next few years. However, healthcare spending in the US is on an unsustainable trajectory. While I feel confident that McKesson will survive and maintain its market share, its revenues may not survive a major regulatory shift.McKesson is riding the consolidation wave, acquiring smaller companies, and expanding its footprint. The best-case scenario is that McKesson becomes one of the winning oligarchs. Worst case scenario is that McKesson becomes overextended and thus unable to weather recessions or other economic headwinds. Investors should keep an eye on McKesson’s debt burden.Finally, the CEO John Hammergren. He has already demonstrated that he is happy to use McKesson as his personal piggy bank, and cannot be happy about his recent forced 50% pay cut. While I like McKesson overall, I would advise current and future investors to keep an eye on McKesson’s proxy statements and make sure that the company doesn’t drift towards using softer, more easily gamed, metrics in compensating their executives.Hold.Based on the above analysis, McKesson is a hold. It meets four of my six buy criteria. McKesson is a major pharmaceutical distributor, and likely to stay that way. McKesson is a dividend paying company, but the current yield (<1%) is not exciting. McKesson prefers to direct its resources towards mergers and acquisitions, as well as share buybacks. At present, McKesson’s valuation isn’t impressive either. McKesson appears fair valued, with no meaningful margin of safety remaining.If you liked this analysis, please FOLLOW me.

This alone should be reason enough to examine the stock and check out if we have a bargain at our hands or if there are good reasons for the stock being so cheap and beaten down.MCK data by YChartsIn the following article, we first try to understand the business model and examine a little closely how McKesson is making money. After that, we will look at the company’s valuation a little closely and provide an intrinsic value calculation. In a third and fourth chapter, we look at the growth potential of the sector and the competitive advantage of the company. Finally, we analyze a few different risk factors.To examine and analyze any company, it is important to understand how it generates revenue and profit. McKesson is a global leader in healthcare supply chain management solutions, retail pharmacy, community oncology and specialty care, and healthcare information technology. In the company’s own words, the business is quite simple:Basically, McKesson is divided in two business segments: distribution solutions (pharmaceutical distribution and services) and technology solutions (products and services). The technology solutions segment provides clinical, financial and supply chain management solutions to healthcare organizations. As the segment generated only $2.6 billion in revenue (about 1.3% of the overall revenue of $198.5 billion), it can be neglected at least as long as we are talking about the company’s revenue. However, when focusing on operating profit and operating margin, the segment is contributing about one-eighth of the company’s operating profit due to higher margins.The distribution segment generated about $195.9 billion in revenue in the last year. We have to point out that although the distribution segment is generating almost all of McKesson’s revenue, it has an operating margin of only 1.7%, while the technology solutions segment has an operating margin of 12-13%. The distribution solutions segment distributes branded and generic pharmaceutical drugs and other healthcare-related products internationally and provides practice management, technology, clinical support and business solutions to community-based oncology and other specialty practices.McKesson is the largest pharmaceutical distributor in the United States with more than 40,000 customers. The business supplies branded, specialty and generic pharmaceuticals and other healthcare-related products to customers like retail national accounts, independent retail pharmacies and institutional healthcare providers such as hospitals and health systems. The company is also one of the largest pharmaceutical distributors in Canada. Aside from North America, McKesson also provides distribution and services to the pharmaceutical and healthcare sector in 13 countries in Europe. Its wholesale network delivers daily to 50,000 pharmacies in Europe. The retail pharmacy business serves patients and consumers in European countries directly through over 2,400 of its own pharmacies and over 5,500 participant pharmacies operating under brand partnership agreements.We already mentioned that McKesson has a P/E below 8 right now, but the number is misleading. The company reported $23.28 GAAP EPS for the full year 2017, but we have to point out that in the fourth quarter, it reported additional $3,947 million as “gain on net asset exchange, net” which led to earnings per share of $16.79 for the quarter. Much more realistic are the adjusted earnings per share of $11.61 for the full year and $3.39 for the fourth quarter (on a non-GAAP basis). Using these numbers, we get a realistic P/E of 14, which is still very cheap. For the fiscal year 2018, the company expects adjusted earnings per share between $11.80 and $12.50.It seems important to point out that GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations are “only” expected to be between $4.80 and $6.90 for 2018. And while EPS on a GAAP basis as well as the adjusted earnings per share both have shortcomings, we should be careful not just to take that number best suited for the point we are trying to make (in this case, that McKesson is undervalued). And if we take the lower end of GAAP guidance, the forward P/E ratio would be 33.3, and therefore, rather high.For a more accurate intrinsic value calculation, we will not use simple valuation methods like the P/E ratio, but apply a discount cash flow analysis. In the Investor Day Presentation (slide 14), McKesson claims it is on the path to double-digit adjusted EPS growth - meaning the company expects at least 10% EPS growth. If we take McKesson’s free cash flow of the last years (not 2017, as the free cash flow was exceptionally high), we can use about $2,173 million free cash flow as the basis for our calculation (free cash flow of the past four quarters) and also assume the company will grow 10% for the next decade. As usually, we use a 10% discount rate, and for perpetuity, we assume 3% growth (very conservative for a wide-moat company). All these parameters lead to an intrinsic value of $254.59 for McKesson, making the company extremely undervalued. It would have to grow about 4% for the next decade and 3% for perpetuity to be fairly valued right now. The important question right now is if the company will be able to grow at least 4% annually for the next 10 years and then 3% for eternity.In order to ensure above-average growth rates, a company usually needs some form of competitive advantage, because otherwise competitors will enter those segments of the market that pledge high growth rates and increasing revenue. McKesson has built a distribution network, especially in North America, that is hard to match for new competitors. The top three distributors - McKesson, AmerisourceBergen (NYSE: ABC) and Cardinal Health (NYSE: CAH) - have a market share of 90%, and even McKesson, with its distribution system already in place, has extremely low net income margins. Over the last years, McKesson’s net income margin has fluctuated about 1%.These factors show us how difficult it is for new competitors to enter the market, as gross and operating margins for new competitors would be terrible. With very little revenue and extremely high costs of revenue at the beginning, it is almost impossible for new competitors to match McKesson’s prices and profitability. While the company has to spend about 25% of each year’s net income as capital expenditures, the costs for new competitors to build a similar distribution network would be much higher.(Source: Own work based on data from Morningstar)We learned above, that McKesson (as well as AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health) doesn’t have to worry much about new competitors entering the market because of the competitive advantage and the wide moat the company has. McKesson mostly has to worry about its two competitors, but if we look at four different metrics - return on assets, return on invested capital, net income margin and gross margin - McKesson seems to be superior to its closest rivals. Gross margin was the highest in the last ten years, and net income margin also was in most years higher than the margins of Cardinal Health and especially the margins of AmerisourceBergen. On average, the net income margin over the last decade was 1.17% (Cardinal Health had a net income margin of only 1.01% and ABC only 0.55%).But not just margins are better, the return on assets and return on invested capital are also higher. Return on assets for McKesson was 4.29% on average during the last decade (compared to 4.03% for Cardinal Health and 2.91% for AmerisourceBergen). Return on invested capital for the company is on average 14.62%, compared to 13.52% for AmerisourceBergen and 10.44% for Cardinal Health. I think it is safe to say that McKesson doesn’t have to fear its closest two competitors, at least not based on the different presented metrics.A wide moat is certainly one of the most important “assets” a company can have, as it protects the business and keeps competitors at a healthy distance. But a moat is only helpful if the overall business is increasing. A moat is pointless if revenue for all companies operating in a certain sector is declining as the overall demand is fading (it might help the company to survive a little longer, but can’t stop the decline forever). Therefore, it is also important to look at the sector the company operates in and analyze if the sector as a whole is promising increasing revenue for the companies.(Source: 2017 Investor Day Presentation)The spending on pharmaceuticals and the market is expected to grow in the high single digits in the next years, not just in the United States, but also in Europe and globally. Especially the aging society in developed countries will maximize the demand for pharmaceuticals and healthcare solutions. But the demand in emerging countries is also rising. The increasing demand for pharmaceuticals and drugs will lead to more and more products that need to be distributed and leads to increased revenue for McKesson. But not just the demand for drugs will expand in the years to come, the demand for medical-surgical supply will also increase as the demand for surgery and operations will rise.In case of McKesson, not just the distribution segment, but also the technology solutions segment will profit from these mega-trends that will continue over the next years and decades. Combined with the competitive advantage, I think it is not only reasonable, but also extremely conservative, to assume at least 4% growth for the next decade.We already wrote above, that it is very hard for new competitors to enter the markets due to the high costs and extremely thin margins. It would take some big corporations, that have massive capital resources and can spend millions or even billions of dollars upfront and can stand being not profitable for quite some time. A few days ago, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE: JPM) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced forming their own insurance company. The project aims to improve healthcare for the employees of the three companies (about 1.3 million people) and wants to provide affordable healthcare coverage for the U.S. employees. The company should be free from profit-making incentives.Although we know very little about the new project right now, it had the power to disturb the markets quite a bit. Companies like Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), CVS Health Corp. (NYSE:CVS) or Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX) took dramatic hits that day. Considering how little we know about the project, the sell-off seems like an overreaction. However, it wouldn’t be the first time that Amazon made other stocks tank after some announcement. Target (NYSE:TGT) or Kroger (NYSE:KR) are examples from 2017 and two stocks that declined quite a bit as the market panicked. But after a few months, both stocks have recovered nicely so far (about 50% gains), as market participants seemed to realize they overreacted. A similar development could also be the case for McKesson.For long-term investors, it is however more important to analyze if these sell-offs are justified as we have a real threat at our hands or if they create a great entry point. The three companies (Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan) certainly have the power and financial resources to build a similar distribution network as McKesson. Nevertheless, I don’t think McKesson has to fear the newly formed insurance company. But it doesn’t really matter if the new company will hurt revenue and profits in the long term - what really drive the stock markets are expectations. And right now, market participants assume that Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan will hurt McKesson, and this might lead to cheap stock prices.Additionally, there are two other risks I like to point out. One is the dependency on CVS Health Corp., which is McKesson’s largest customer and accounted for about 20% of total revenue last year. If the company would lose CVS as customer, the effect on revenue as well as profitability would be quite dramatic. We are also facing the risk of being too optimistic about revenue growth for the entire healthcare sector. Most analysts expect growth rates in the high single digits, and therefore, much higher than GDP growth.Although McKesson was even cheaper a few months ago, and it looks like we have missed out on our chance to buy the company at a very attractive price, investors should not panic. First of all, the company is still very attractively valued, and McKesson is still a buy. Additionally, as already mentioned above, the rumors about Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan forming a new company might lead to a further declining stock price. Finally, we are confronted with an US stock market at one of the most overvalued states it has been during the last century. If the stock market should enter a corrective phase or even a bear market - and it will at some point in time (No, the first signs of panic in the last few days are not what I mean) - many individual stocks will be drawn down with the overall market even if the companies are already cheap. In my opinion, we can stay patient and probably will see price levels of $140 or even $120 again.Thanks for staying with me till the end.

4107746,21652,2017-09-18T15:26:55-04:00,McKesson remains out-of-favor.Long-term results suggest today’s price is a bargain.Analysts think an EPS revival is on tap starting in 2018.MCK could just be the best value available in the entire healthcare industry.,"The broad averages hit a series of new records last week. Finding bargain-priced shares is a tough job. Most stocks which are down in this environment have obvious flaws.Can stocks with ""warts"" still hold amazing upside potential? Absolutely. The ""efficient market theory"", which says every stock sells for exactly what it is actually worth, gets disproven regularly.McKesson (MCK) is a prime example of a company offering big potential gains due to public perception that its business model is in jeopardy. Traders who disagree can snag great value.MCK is on pace to post more than $200 billion in FY 2017 revenues, more than ever before (fiscal year ends Mar. 31, 2018). The shares carved out a peak north of $234 back in 2015. They rallied to more than $197 last year. McKesson closed on Friday, Sep. 15, 2017, at just $149.88.EPS are expected to dip slightly this year, from $12.88 to about $12.07. That downer may have obscured the company's superior longer-term track record. McKesson's share price has done well but it fails to reflect anywhere near the past decade's true growth in fundamentals.The market remains skeptical but analysts see FY 2017 as nothing more than a small speed bump. Consensus views for FY 2018 now project EPS of $12.89. Value Line thinks earnings could reach more than $20 per share by 2022.MCK's current valuation looks remarkably similar to its previous best entry points (green-starred below). McKesson was expensive when it peaked in 2015. The P/E was 23.8x then versus a 2010 - 2016 average level of 15.7x. The yield was sub-par, too.A simple regression to the mean valuation on next year's estimate suggests $203 as a reasonable 12 to 18-month target price. That's far from an upper limit as MCK broached $214 in both 2014 and 2015 when fundamentals were less favorable than they are today.Don't just take my word on this.Standard and Poor's research seconds the idea that MCK can see profits rebound next year. They call present day fair value as $220.30 while conservatively seeking a share price of $172 over the coming 12-months. McKesson falls into S&P's top 2% in terms of ""investability"", a measure of quality.Independent analysis from Morningstar goes further. They label MCK a 4-star (out of 5) BUY and would upgrade to their very top rating should the shares dip below $147. Its view of McKesson's fair value runs $210.The firm's higher than typical current yield and wide moat serve as added plus factors.Value Line assigns MCK their highest possible financial strength rating. You can now own this long-term winner at a discount price. Why not buy when it's on sale?Option savvy traders might consider selling some MCK Jan. 2019, expiration date puts. With the stock just below $150 you could snare $15.40 for the at the money strike, greater than $20 on the $160s or about $26.80 for standing ready to buy, if exercised later, at the more aggressive $170 level.Break-evens drop to very attractive levels of between $134.60 and $144.90.Maximum profit on these, or any other option sales, would be keeping 100% of all premium received up front. The worst-case scenario on these would be forced purchase at the net prices indicated in the table above.Outright ownership of the shares offers unlimited upside but without any extra margin of safety should things out less well than expected.McKesson is a blue-chip company at a decidedly white-chip valuation right now.Buy MCK shares, sell some puts or consider doing both.Disclosure: Long MCK shares.

In the context of an expected offer of CVS for Aetna, the firm appears to be exiting non-core holdings perhaps to minimize transaction review risk as well as raise cash for a potential bid for Aetna.According to a 2014 report by UnitedHealth Center for Health Reform and Modernization, the specialty pharmacy market size regarding drug spending alone in 2012 was $87 billion and was forecasted to rise to $400 billion by 2020.The main drivers for this expected growth include unit price growth and utilization growth for the primary conditions of cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.As biopharma firms develop ""orphan"" drugs in greater numbers due to the rise of new technologies such as gene editing, the number of drugs delivered in a specialty environment could increase dramatically.McKesson believes that by 2018, ""50% of all drugs sold in the United States are expected to be specialty pharmaceuticals, compared with 30% today."" It projects the specialty market will grow over 25% per year and ‘that five of the largest specialty drug manufacturers will control 75% of the market.With that kind of concentrated market power, it isn’t difficult to see why McKesson needs to be a big player on the other side of it.McKesson intends to pay $635 million net of the present value of incremental cash tax benefits and says it will fund the deal with cash on hand.As of September 30, 2017, MCK had $2.56 billion in cash and $51 billion in total liabilities. So while the firm has significant liabilities, it can do the deal with cash on hand without undue financial hardship.The deal will be ""approximately 20 cents accretive to adjusted earnings per diluted share by the third year following the close of the transaction."" That is Non-GAAP guidance, which is usually more favorable to management, and it says the firm won’t benefit financially for more than two years after transaction close.MCK appears to be acquiring RxCrossroads as an opportunistic deal due to CVS having bigger issues on its corporate horizon.As McKesson stated in the deal announcement,In a report on TheStreet, Leerink Partners analyst David Larsen stated of the deal, ""We view (it) as a smart strategic move to help position the company for the continued importance and growth of specialty pharma products.""Investors seem to agree, as MCK stock rose on the news which was announced November 6""(Source: Seeking Alpha)So, although it will take some time for MCK to close the deal and absorb RxCrossroads into its operations, the deal appears to be perceived as a positive development and assuming smooth integration should be accretive to MCK in the medium term.I write about IPOs, M&A deals, and public company investments in technology startups.

4101666,67113,2017-08-24T13:38:26-04:00,Biotech again has bottomed before the S&P 500 and is showing considerable strength. McKesson will not be left behind.Sentiment and technicals both pessimistic and oversold. Both are ripe conditions for a snap back rally.There was nothing in Q1 earnings to adversely affect the fundamentals long term. Ignore the noise. Long Mckesson.,"McKesson's (NYSE:MCK) first quarter earnings results along with the down move in the biotech complex were the main reasons why the pharmaceutical distributor has shed over $20 a share over the past six weeks or so. The stock is now trading at sub $150 levels whereas it almost reached $170 a share just before it announced its first quarter numbers. However, I didn't see anything in Q1 earnings that could potentially adversely affect McKesson's fundamentals over a sustained period. In fact, the surprising low profits in Q1 came from contract alterations with two large manufacturers.Mckesson already has moved to streamline these agreements to ensure earnings on a quarterly basis and more predictive in nature instead of having peaks and troughs in earnings. For example, the adjusted earnings figure of $2.46 was well behind the $2.82 expectation. This number obviously put pressure on the shares and it could have been avoided to some extent. How? Well, management needs to be more up front with their short-term earnings expectations. In saying this, annual guidance has been increased slightly on previous estimates and this move should to some extent calm investors nerves with relation to the future profitability of the company. We will remain long. Here are some reasons why.Firstly the company's valuation cannot be ignored when you combine it with McKesson's strong competitive advantages and biotech's fundamentals. McKesson currently has an earnings multiple of only 6.7 which is more than three times less than its five-year average. The company's price to cash flow ratio of 8.9 looks particularly attractive as attractive value plays from a cash flow basis usually have ratios around these levels. As long as the politicians don't begin to meddle in this sector, McKesson along with Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) and AmerisourceBergen Corp.(NYSE:ABC) should continue to dominate pharmaceutical distributorship.McKesson incidentally is by far the cheapest of the ""big 3"" and is up there with respect to long term earnings growth projections (7%-plus annualized). Because margins are so slim in this game, any potential competitor would have to have huge scale to be in any position to compete. Whether on the buying side through heavy discounting from manufacturers due to volume or on the distribution side due to extensive logistics, any potential competitor would find it extremely difficult to gain market share from McKesson, in my opinion.On the technical side, McKesson appears to have formed a daily cycle low and its momentum indicators are pushing off oversold levels. Furthermore biotech as discussed yesterday has broken its down trend line and seems to be leading equities higherSentiment actually didn't get to ultra pessimistic levels before Q2 earnings were announced which could have possibly given us a sell signal. It definitely now though has retraced back into ""buy range"" territory. Moreover, the weekly stochastics also have retraced back to levels we saw last April. As we know McKesson shares tacked on $30 between April and June of this year.Source: Sentimentrader.comI have gone through every key financial ratio and all have improved meaningfully over the past decade. Free cash flow came in at $4.2 billion at the end of March last which was more than eight times larger than 2008 numbers. Earnings per share over the same time period are up by a factor of seven which is really impressive considering that the top line has only doubled to almost $200 billion. The only ratio which is slightly worse off is the company's debt to equity ratio which currently is at 55%. Again, despite this ratio has risen, there is nothing to worry about with respect to the company's balance sheet.Just keep looking at the big picture. The noise surrounding generic pricing and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will ultimately fade away.

4108375,102764,2017-09-20T15:42:22-04:00,"Companies making high-conviction stock buybacks tend to generate market-beating returns over time.Introducing a quantitative system focused on companies with big buybacks and with attractive profitability and valuation levels.Among the companies in the quantitative system, McKesson looks like a particularly attractive candidate for value investors.","Stock buybacks are a widely debated topic among market participants. Some investors consider buybacks a smart and efficient way to distribute capital to shareholders, while others believe that buybacks are just a shady corporate maneuver aimed at artificially inflating earnings per share by reducing the amount of shares outstanding. As it usually happens with these kinds of things, it all depends on the particular company and its circumstances.A company that is repurchasing stock is basically investing in its own shares. If the stock is undervalued and business prospects are good enough, then share buybacks are a smart use of the company's capital. On the other hand, if the stock is overvalued, there is no reason to invest in the company in the first place, and buybacks make things even worse.When the business is solid and the stock is attractively priced, then buybacks are major positive for investors. In these situations, the stock is already worth buying due to fundamental strengths and a convenient valuation. Since the company is investing its capital in an asset with promising expected returns (its own shares), this makes the investment thesis even more compelling.Many companies are not very thoughtful when it comes to repurchasing stock at the right prices and for the right reasons. However, the evidence indicates that big buybacks are generally good news for investors in terms of expected future returns. Quantitative research shows that companies making high-conviction buybacks, meaning buybacks that account for more than 5% of shares outstanding, tend to outperform the market. According to an article from Patrick O'Shaughnessy, the average stock in companies making a high conviction buyback tends to outperform the market by 3.3% in the subsequent year.Based on these concepts, we can build a quantitative system looking for high-quality companies making big buybacks. In order to be considered for inclusion in the system, a stock must meet the following criteria:Backtested results from this strategy are quite promising. Since January of 1999, the portfolio generated an average annual return of 16.69% versus a much more modest 3.88% for companies in the S&P 500 index. In other words, a $100,000 investment in the portfolio recommended by the system would currently have a market value of $1.78 million, while the same amount of money invested in the S&P 500 would be worth around $203,700.Data and charts are from Portfolio123, and the full list of companies currently included in the system is available to subscribers in my research service, The Data Driven Investor.McKesson (MCK) is one of the top players in the pharmaceuticals and medical supplies distribution business, a highly concentrated market. According to estimates from Pembroke Consulting, the top three players in the industry - McKesson, AmerisourceBergen (ABC), and Cardinal Health (CAH) - account for about 85% to 90% of all revenues from drug distribution in the United States.Size is a crucial source of competitive advantage for companies in the business, since it generates efficiencies in key areas such as warehousing infrastructure, route density, and other logistical aspects. In addition, big players such as McKesson can leverage on their size to obtain conveniently low prices from drug manufacturers. Since costs are a major success driver in the business, scale advantages and cost efficiencies keep smaller competitors at bay.The industry is facing considerable headwinds due to pricing pressures in the drug business and consolidation among pharmacy retailers. Nevertheless, McKesson is implementing a strategic restructuring to increase scale, accelerate growth, and better focus on its key areas of strength.Among other moves, the company has sold its Enterprise Information segment for nearly $185 million, and it has acquired CoverMyMeds, a leader in electronic prior authorization (ePA) solutions, for approximately $1.1 billion. In fiscal 2017, McKesson closed acquisitions such as Vantage Oncology and Biologics, broadening its presence in cancer care and oncology pharmacy. The company is also expanding into Canada, Ireland, the UK, The Netherlands, Portugal, and Belgium through multiple acquisitions.Source: McKessonMcKesson has an impressive track record of consistent performance when it comes to cash flow and earnings generation over the long term. Profit margins are quite low in the industry, but internal capital reinvestment needs are also minuscule, so McKesson allocates generous amounts of capital to both acquisitions and stock buybacks.Source: McKessonThe company’s capital deployment plan for fiscal 2017 is quite illustrative. Internal investments amounted to $562 million and dividends payments absorbed a modest $253 million. On the other hand, acquisitions represented $4.2 billion and buybacks $2.3 billion. This shows that McKesson is prioritizing investments in two key areas: strategic acquisitions and repurchasing its own stock.Over the past decade, McKesson has reduced the amount of shares outstanding by over 27%. In the last year alone, the company shrunk its share count by 7%; McKesson is building an outstanding track-record when it comes to buybacks and reducing the share count over the long term.MCK Shares Outstanding data by YChartsLooking at valuation levels, the stock certainly looks attractively priced. Wall Street analysts are on average expecting the company to make $12.08 in earnings per share during the current fiscal year. This puts McKesson at a price to earnings ratio of 12.3. As a reference, the average stock in the S&P 500 index is currently trading at a forward price to earnings ratio of around 20.5, according to data from Morningstar.McKesson is operating in a challenging industry environment, and acquisitions always carry considerable risks, so these factors can keep weighting on valuation for a considerable time. Without any short-term catalysts, there are not many reasons to rush into the stock, so patience could be a smart approach to follow in this particular name.On the other hand, data show that when a solid company is repurchasing big amounts of stock at attractive valuation levels, this usually bodes well in terms of potential returns going forward. With this in mind, McKesson could be an interesting candidate for value-oriented investors with a long-term horizon."
4083866,67113,2017-06-26T09:46:20-04:00,Stock is still pretty cheap especially from a cash flow perspective compared to competition.Donald Trump seems to have softened up a lot with respect to the pharmaceutical industry. Looks now like strict drug pricing controls will not materialize.Biotech has been forming a strong bottom for the last 18 months. McKesson looks set to take advantage of the biotech tailwind.,"We were fortunate to be in McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) prior to the company announcing its fourth quarter results on the 18th of May. Earnings reports many times are the catalyst for stocks shooting higher as shares of McKesson are now up 18% already since the last earnings announcement. Technically the stock looks very strong. The moving averages have now crossed over as the stock continues to rally despite shares trading with obvious overbought momentum conditions.The same pattern seems to be playing out with the company's sentiment readings as optimistic readings are not deterring the stock from rallying higher. The next major resistance level on the technical chart is just below the $200 level which would be another 18% move to the upside from present levels. One would feel that if the biotech (ETF) (NASDAQ:IBB) keeps rallying in the same fashion as it has been doing of late, McKesson should get to that psychological $200 level in not time. In any event, we will remain long the stock as here are prime reasons why we believe this large pharmaceutical distributor has plenty more upside.Obviously a strong calling card for us going long this stock many months ago was its cheap valuation. However this stock (because of its up-move) is now only coming to the attention of analysts as it still is being touted as a strong value play. The company's earnings multiple is still only 7.2 which is well behind both the industry's average 12.2 number as well the company's 5 year average of 22.8. Remember the company's shares topped out in mid 2015 at almost $240 a share but the company's financials seem to be far better shape presently than previous years. For example in its recent fiscal year, McKesson reported $198,533 billion in top line sales which returned over $5 billion in net income (earnings per share of $22.73).Now I acknowledge that fiscal 2017 was an exceptional year for earnings primarily because of the merger with Change Healthcare but earnings are still expected to grow by a long term average of 7% over the next 5 years. The top line is expected to grow by about the 3% mark so margins for the company over time should definitely increase. McKesson's gross margin surpassed 6% between 2014 and 2016 and currently stands at the 5.7% mark. Margins are razor thin in this sector but the company looks like it will be able to recover lost ground as illustrated through its latest guidance numbers.What looks like will be a another tailwind is a probable change of stance in Washington with relation to the president's executive order. Donald Trump's post elections comments about the extortionate pricing of drugs in this industry made many believe that the likes of McKesson would struggle and it did up to its latest earnings report. However the combination of an earnings surprise along with Trump's pro business policies has McKesson homing in on $170 a share now. Trump was really caught in two camps with respect to what he wanted to achieve in this sector.On the one hand, he wanted lower prices but on the other he wanted a vibrant sector with much less regulation. Die hard Donald Trump supporters must be pretty upset with this news as it seems to be a complete 180 from his comment on biotech companies ""getting away with murder"" earlier in the year. Nevertheless from an investing point of view, if the Senate's healthcare bill gets passed into law, you have to feel it will be bullish for biotech stocks. Just look at the bottoming formation the sector has undergone over the past 18 months. The sector still managed to make higher highs in spite of Donald's Trump's warnings looming over the sector.Even with the nice up move McKesson has experienced of late, the stock is still much cheaper than the other major players in this space (AmerisourceBergen Corp.(NYSE:ABC) & Cardinal Health Inc (NYSE:CAH)). These three distributors dominate pharmaceutical distribution and I believe this monopoly will continue. Bears may state that the company's earnings multiple is not reputable given the company's latest ""Change Healthcare"" deal so let's compare its cash flow multiple (which is an extremely important metric as margins can be so tight) to the competition. McKesson's price to cash flow ratio comes in at 7.8 (5 Year Average of 13.2) which look far more attractive than AmerisourceBergen's 11.2 and Cardinal Health's 23.3.Therefore we will be staying long McKesson for the time being. Its strong guidance for fiscal 2018, low valuation along with Trump's seemingly industry friendly policies should drive this stock higher."

Based on my analysis, I think McKesson is one of the most undervalued companies in the S&P 500 at this moment. Below is a video discussing my DCF model. But before you watch the video, let me give you a brief overview of the company and touch on concerns stemming from industry-wide price declines for generic drugs.Based out of San Francisco, McKesson ""is a global leader in healthcare supply chain management solutions, retail pharmacy, community oncology and specialty care, and healthcare information technology."" Moreover, the company ""partner[s] with pharmaceutical manufacturers, providers, pharmacies, governments and other organizations in healthcare to help provide the right medicines, medical products and healthcare services to the right patients at the right time, safely and cost-effectively."" Source: McKesson's Form 10-K for fiscal year ending March 31, 2017.The company operates with two segments--namely, McKesson Distribution Solutions and McKesson Technology Solutions.It appears that the Technology Solutions segment is slowly being wound down. In June of last year, McKesson entered into a contribution agreement with Change Healthcare Holdings, Inc. and other investors to form a joint venture called Change Healthcare. Under the terms of the Contribution Agreement, McKesson contributed the majority of its Technology Solutions segment businesses to Change Healthcare and in return received a 70% equity stake in the joint venture. The deal closed in on March 1, 2017. (Note: McKesson expects there will eventually be an initial public offering of an entity that holds equity in Change Healthcare, at which time McKesson will likely exit its investment in Change Healthcare through a distribution to McKesson shareholders.)The company's primary focus is now on its Distribution Solutions segment. In its latest Form 10-K, The company describes its Distribution Solutions segment as follows:In my opinion, the company has a wide moat economic moat that will insulate it from harmful competition for years to come. It is part of an oligopoly comprised of two other large pharmaceutical distributors--Cardinal Health (CAH) and Amerisource Bergen (ABC). According to Morningstar, AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health, and McKesson have a combined market share well above 90% in the pharmaceutical distribution industry.Generic drug prices have been falling recently. This has caused quite a stir in the generic drug industry. The stock prices of generic manufacturers like Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA) have been absolutely decimated over the past few weeks as a result of lower generic prices combined with highly leveraged balance sheets. Over the last few quarters, McKesson's stock price has also been held back over generic pricing concerns since it is an important part of the supply chain for generic drugs. McKesson acknowledges that this is a legitimate concern in the ""Risk Factors"" section of its Form 10-K, saying:However, I think the market's concern (reflected in McKesson's depressed stock price) is overblown. McKesson's management made certain comments on the most recent quarterly earnings call which suggest that they too believe the concern around generic price deflation is overblown.For instance, in response to an analyst question, John Hamgren, McKesson's CEO, made the following comment:See McKesson's Q1 2018 Earnings Call Transcript (emphasis added).To me, this statement indicates that the company has some ability to protect itself from price declines to preserve margins. In other words, Hamgren appears to be saying that just because the company is able to source generics cheaper from manufacturers doesn't necessarily mean it will pass 100% of those savings on to its end customers, thereby preserving some of its margin.Here is another interesting exchange between a Goldman analyst and James Beer, McKesson's CFO:See McKesson's Q1 2018 Earnings Call Transcript (emphasis added).Is it just me or does Mr. Beer seem to be saying that the current generic pricing environment could actually be a net positive for McKesson? If this is the case, I'm not too worried about the impact of generic price deflation on the company's future profitability. It is definitely something that investors should continue to monitor, but management sounds confident in its ability to successfully navigate around this issue.MY VALUATIONWith the foregoing in mind--let's take a look at my DCF valuation model for McKesson! In the video below, I discuss my underlying story for The company and how this story is reflected in the numbers and assumptions I use to arrive at a fair value conclusion of $190 per share. As an aside, this video is the second video in a series of valuation videos that I plan to create and publish on Seeking Alpha. The first video in the series, which was published a couple of minority weeks ago, discussed my valuation of Gilead Sciences (GILD).As the video explains, I estimate McKesson's revenues will grow modestly over the next ten years--from approximately $200 billion last year to about $287 billion in the terminal year. Specifically, I assume that revenues will grow an average of 4% per year over the next five years (from now through 2021), and an average of 3% per year over the following five years (from 2022 through 2026). After year ten, I assume that revenues will grow at just over 2% (equal to the rate of the 10-Year Treasury Note which, in theory, is the market's approximation of the long-term growth of the economy).Additionally, in my model, I assume that operating margins will average 1.80% per year over the next ten years and into perpetuity. This is inline with historical operating margins for The company. Note that operating margins were higher at 3.35% last year due to one-time benefits related to the Change Healthcare transaction. I also assumed a 30% tax rate over the next ten years and into perpetuity given that the median tax rate over the last five-year and ten-year periods has been about 30%.My assumption for modest growth in revenues, stable operating margins, and a 30% tax rate results in free cash flow to the firm increasing from my estimate of $2 billion this year (which may be conservative) to $3 billion in the terminal year. This results in the a cumulative cumulative free cash flow of $24.5 billion over the next 10 years ($16 billion on a present value basis). When combined with the terminal value and net of debt and minority interests, I get an equity value for The company of $40.4 billion or approximately $190 per share. With shares trading around $155 at the time of this writing, there is still over 20% upside potential to my fair value.As always, I welcome constructive feedback. If you disagree with any of the assumptions I made in my DCF model, I'd love to hear it in the comments below. And if you enjoyed the video, please follow me on Seeking Alpha.

This is due to razor thin margins, common for a distributor in any industry, which lead to huge revenue figures but only marginal profits.Healthcare stocks were beaten down going into the election last year as rhetoric from both candidates made investors nervous about renewed legislation in the healthcare space. The higher drug prices offer more profits for companies like MCK, which pass the higher prices down the line but maintain the same margin. CEO John H. Hammergren discussed the pricing environment on the earnings call:It seems the environment is getting somewhat better for the wholesalers, and news out of the president's meetings on healthcare paint a pretty pro-business picture of the future, as well. The group Trump has charged with working on drug pricing innovations has been reported as discussing speeding approvals by the FDA for generic competitors to branded drugs, which I have discussed in previous articles is already mostly underway. The generic approval backlog has been shrinking over the last year or two, which has already had its effects on these companies. According to Kaiser Health News, the group has also discussed extending monopoly patents for American branded drugs overseas, drug companies offering rebates to patients that don't improve on their condition, and using T-bills to offset the costs of expensive medicines to drug manufacturers to avoid rationing drugs to Medicare and Medicaid patients.None of this sounds like a hard line regulatory attack on the pharma industry like some expected coming into the election, which should help bolster the outlooks of drug manufacturers and wholesalers alike.Source: Drug Channels InstituteAnother factor placing downward pressure on profits for the wholesalers is the consolidation in the industry. With so much traffic going through the largest pharmacies and those companies locked in with preferred wholesalers, the expectation is preferential pricing. This cuts further into the margins for MCK, but it's necessary to maintain the huge volumes a partner like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) provides.Source: Analyst PresentationMCK has been acquiring a significant number of companies to drive growth in a difficult environment. The Change Healthcare transaction involved the divestiture of the company's technology segment into a joint venture, which MCK plans to exit through a shareholder distribution. The segment had not performed well, and the company made the decision to divest it and focus on distribution, which generally accounted for 98% or so of profits.Outside of that transaction, the company is expanding across Europe in the Celesio segment with 6 different acquisitions last year. It's unlikely to dampen results too badly, but MCK has a sizable presence in the U.K., which will be a dynamic environment as it transitions for Brexit.The CoverMyMeds acquisition for $1.3B involves electronic prior authorization, which will accelerate the prescription approval process. This streamlines the process and lowers costs. This will be a fresh start for the company in its newly formed Prescription Technology Services business, which will likely be a solid move for the company's results with its higher margins.The significant number of acquisitions will bring with it some integration risk, and also the risk of shareholder value destruction. Happily, MCK looks as though it is holding its own in its returns on invested capital against itself historically as well as its key competitors. With the amount of capital being deployed by the company, it will be important for investors to keep an eye on this metric.Looking at MCK's P/E versus its projected growth rates, it looks undervalued compared to CAH. However, CAH does offer a significantly higher yield, and ABC offers both a higher yield and double the projected growth rate. With the company's recent acquisitions and likely fewer regulatory headwinds going forward, 4% growth should be easy to top making 12.8x earnings most likely a good value.MCK Total Long Term Debt (Annual) data by YChartsThe long term debt is very manageable and only comes in a little over 2X the free cash flow. Free cash flow has grown over the last year, and will hopefully continue its upward trend with earnings growth. The company is currently holding $2.3B in cash, and paid down $541M of its long-term debt last year. With the number of acquisitions and share buybacks the company has undertaken, it is good to see that the debt levels are under control. The final thing to note is that MCK has long been criticized (including by me) for not offering a generous enough dividend. At a forward yield of 0.84%, it is still very low today. However, the most recent hike of 21% is much higher than its average growth rate, and could very well presage a new emphasis on dividend growth for the company.Looking at the valuation graph, MCK looks to be trading well below its long-term averages due to the dip in earnings shown from 2016 through 2018.If MCK is successful in meeting estimates and returns to its long-term valuation of around 16X earnings, an investment today would yield a total annualized return of 14% over the next 3 years. That may or may not occur, but I believe that MCK is offering the best margin to safety of the three drug wholesalers today, and is a solid choice for long-term investors looking for healthcare exposure.If you liked this article and would like to read more like it, please click the ""Follow"" button next to my picture at the top and select ""Real-time alerts.""

4106427,67113,2017-09-13T08:45:24-04:00,Stock only has the look of temporary headwinds - not permanent ones.Competitive advantages still intact.We will ignore the wiggles and remain long.,"I wrote an article last month about McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) and stated that I felt the stock was pretty cheap and that I was expecting a sharp bounce. Technicals were showing that the biotech complex had bottomed out and the bounce there was lining up with depressed sentiment in McKesson at the time. To cut a long story short, the stock is up over 9% since that call. Despite the big move up, McKesson continues to trade with an earnings multiple of just over 7 (the real earnings multiple is 5 to 6 points higher due to the once off gain in the last quarter of the company's latest fiscal year) which means it is still by far the cheapest of the three main distributors in this sector.Although some of our holdings are dividend based, we hold McKesson primarily for capital gain potential. In fact the stock only pays out a dividend yield of 0.8% which is well behind the industry average of 1.4%. Therefore let's go through some growth and margin numbers of the company to see if McKesson firmly will remain a core holding in our portfolio.Obviously margins are imperative at McKesson. The company's margins in the first quarter didn't convince investors when compared to numbers in the same quarter of 12 months prior. Gross margin in Q1 of this year came in at 5.01% compared to 5.8% in the first quarter of 2016. Operating income in the first quarter was well down at $633 million which meant operating margin came in at 1.23%. Furthermore because of higher operating costs the company generated in the first quarter, net income fell to $307 million in the first quarter. This meant net margin came in at 0.6% which again was lower than what investors had become accustomed to. However, long term investors invariably look at a company's history to see what is the general direction of the company's top line, its operating income and its bottom line. One cannot make a decision on an investment over a few quarters. I like to go 10 years back at least to get a gauge on how the company's fundamentals are progressing. Even if we take out the consolidated net income figure of $3.6 billion in Q4 last year, McKesson's operating income has risen consistently since 2011 which increased the company's operating margin from 1.6% to 1.9% in fiscal 2016. Gross margin numbers over the past decade tell a similar story. Gross margin has increased from 4.9% in 08' to currently a trailing twelve month average of 5.5%. Yes the recent quarter's 5% was below the long term average but again, one cannot do proper due diligence of a company over a few quarters. One needs to have a longer time frame.The real question investors should be asking is whether there is any evidence that McKesson's competitive advantages may be in danger. This sector is controlled by the three principal pharmaceutical distributors which control 90%+ of the market. Now McKesson in its latest fiscal year grew its top line by almost 8% (10 year average) which is around 1 percentage point behind AmerisourceBergen Corp.(NYSE:ABC) and almost double what Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) reported. From an operating income and net income growth perspective over the past 10 years, McKesson has doubled the annual average growth rate (18%) over AmerisourceBergen Corp (9%). Therefore definitely within this sector, McKesson definitely has not lost out in terms of a growth competitive advantage.From a technical analysis perspective, investors invariably turn away from a stock if it continues to trade well below its all time highs. However these are the precise times when one should be scaling into a long position. If we look at a weekly chart on McKesson, we can see that its slow stochastics remain heavily oversold despite the strong bounce the stock underwent in the latter part of last year.Furthermore the range bound nature of the stock over the last 12 months or so has resulted in strong support around the $140 level (around 10% below the current share price). The all time highs of this stock occurred in 2015 at $240+ a share (53% above all time highs). Therefore when you take into account the company's economies of scale and strong earnings growth projections over the next few years, the risk/ reward play here has to be to the upside.McKesson shares are up almost 12% year to date and the stock remains undervalued despite the one off gain in Q4 in its latest fiscal year. We will continue to ignore the wiggles and remain long this stock.Premium subscribers received this article before the article went live on the main site.

4086147,103418,2017-07-06T16:20:38-04:00,"McKesson is trading at a substantial discount to both intrinsic value and relative to peers.Has a relatively significant margin of safety.Strong financial position, favorable return on capital resources, and shareholder focused management.","Investment ThesisMcKesson (MCK) is currently trading at a substantial discount to intrinsic value on both a discounted cash flow and peer average multiple basis given conservative operating and valuation assumptions. This discount is due to:Irrespective of these market views, if McKesson can achieve even the most conservative operating performance in fiscal 2018 and in an explicit forecasting period of 5 years (to 2022), stripped of any unusual benefits/losses and tax consequences, then McKesson is unquestionably undervalued at a minimum of 17.5% given peer average multiples.Business SummaryMcKesson Corporation operates in the ‘Healthcare Distributors’ sub-industry with core competencies associated with pharmaceutical and medical supply wholesale distribution, in addition to healthcare information technology and supply chain management. McKesson operates in two general segments: McKesson Distribution Solutions and McKesson Technology Solutions. The Distribution Solutions segment distributes branded and pharmaceutical drugs and other healthcare-related products to retail national accounts, independent retail pharmacies, and institutional healthcare providers in the United States, Canada, and 13 countries within Europe. Moreover, the Distribution Solutions segment provides proprietary solutions for supply chain management, marketing, managed care contracting, operational efficiency, automation and other business solutions for these major customer groups. Furthermore, the segment provides specialty solutions to oncology and other specialty healthcare practices throughout the United States and provides medical-surgical supply distribution, logistics, and other services to physicians’ offices, surgery centers, extended care facilities, hospitals, and alternative homecare health sites. The Technology Solutions segment provides clinical and financial information systems for healthcare organizations such as workflow management and supply chain management solutions, and includes a 70% equity investment in a joint venture (Change HealthCare) which plans to provide software, analytics, and network solutions to all stakeholders within the healthcare supply chain (Per 2017 10-K).ValuationFiscal 2018 Projected Results:With an overall revenue growth assumption of 1.9%, much lower than mid-single digit growth according to May 2017 8-K management guidance, McKesson would produce $12.16 in diluted EPS. This projection is comprised of relatively conservative assumptions:Justified Price Given Peer Averages:Highlighted data represents the more favorable valuation between McKesson and the averages of peers in the same sub-industry provided by McKesson’s own peer comparison outlined in 2017 Proxy Statement (includes AmerisourceBergen (ABC), Cardinal Health (CAH), and Express Scripts (ESRX)).Given a forecasted diluted EPS of $12.16 and a peer average P/E ratio of 16.17, a justified price to equalize valuation with peers equates to $197.18, representing a 19.8% upside from the latest closing share price of $164.54. Given F2018 forecasted cash flows from operations of $4,069 mm (without forecasting unusual items and detailed business operations) and a peer average P/CFO of 10.05, a justified current price equates to $193.27, representing a 17.5% upside from current price levels. Moreover, a justified price according to peer average P/S equates to $224.73, a 36.6% upside representing F2018 projected revenues of $202,260 mm according to the above assumptions. Lastly, with a peer average 8.67x EBITDA multiple, a justified price equates to $216.16, a 31.4% upside representing a F2018 projected EBITDA of $5,275 mm with amortization expense according to management guidance and conservative forecasted depreciation and share-based compensation expense.Discounted Cash Flow Analysis:Source: Own analysisWACC Assumptions:With unlevered free cash flow between 2018-2022 resulting in $3,855mm, $4,125mm, $3,590mm, $3,767mm, and $3,906mm respectively, assuming cash flows are generated at the middle of the period: Source: own analysisPerpetuity Assumptions:EBITDA Multiple Assumptions:Represented in the following sensitivity analyses: the intrinsic value of McKesson given a wide range of possible values for the DCF inputs is greater than the current $164.54 closing price for the majority of sensitized values shown by the grey highlighted values, with a significant portion of the values representing a 30%+ upside shown by the green highlighted values.Source: Own analysis   Source: Own analysisFurthermore, at a peer average EBITDA multiple of 8.7x, the terminal year (2022) EBITDA value at as low as 60% of the original forecast ($6,856mm) still produces an equity value of $176.73, an 8% upside and at 70% of the original forecast, $197.42, a 20% upside.Overall, utilizing conservative operating assumptions produces an equity value per share of $267, a 38.4% upside using the perpetuity approach and $251, a 34.5% upside using the exit EBITDA multiple approach.ManagementMcKesson seems to have relatively propitious management that is focused on increasing shareholder value both in the short-term and long-term. John H. Hammergren (Chairman, President & CEO) has been with the company for 21 years and has focused on expanding and improving the company’s core competencies. Alongside Hammergren, McKesson’s management has consistently sought opportunities to expand the company’s core businesses as well as improve shareholder value through acquisitions, divestitures, equity investments, stock buybacks, and dividends. For example, management has shown willingness to divest businesses that are not contributing to the core competencies of the business such as the sale of the ZEE Medical business and nurse triage business both in fiscal 2016, and the Brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business in fiscal 2017. Moreover, management has recently allocated significant capital for acquisitions in fiscal 2017 including the acquisition of Rexall Health, Vantage, Biologics, UDG, CMM; all of which expand on McKesson’s distribution and technology segments. Although McKesson’s dividend yield and growth over the years has been relatively low compared to peers, providing a 3-year dividend per share CAGR of only 6.8%, these commitments were magnified by an annual recurring dividend of €0.83 per share to Celesio shareholders committed under the ‘Domination Agreement’ (Per 2017 10-k). Furthermore, management has consistently utilized authorized stock buyback programs to further enhance shareholder value. For example, over the past three years, McKesson has repurchased a total of $4.3 billion worth of stock with $2.7 billion still authorized to be utilized for further repurchases, with future probable accelerated share repurchase (ASR) programs to be authorized (Per 2017 10-k).In addition, McKesson has implemented shareholder focused compensation and incentive programs for management and employees. John H. Hammergren’s compensation package is comprised of only a 9% allocation toward a fixed base salary. The remaining allocation is comprised of short-term and long-term cash incentives as well as long-term equity incentives. The allocation is presented in the following company document:These various incentive programs are fixed to specific performance metrics related to operating performance and shareholder value creation such as adjusted EPS, adjusted OCF (operating cash flow), average ROIC (return on invested capital), etc.Moreover, in order to prevent unfair benefits to company insiders, stock option re-pricing of underwater options associated with management incentive programs is not allowed without shareholder approval (2017 Proxy Statement).Performance:Management’s effectiveness and ability to create value has been relatively consistent over the period F2013-F2017, as shown in the following table:Source: S&P Capital IQ NetAdvantage, company filings, own analysisImportant notes to consider:Even using normalized net income produces acceptable returns on company resources, with actual results including unusual items producing much greater return metrics.  ‘Peer Averages’ consists of McKesson’s internal peers including: Abbott Laboratories (ABT), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck (MRK), Pfizer (PFE), AmerisourceBergen (ABC), Cardinal Health (CAH), Express Scripts (ESRX), CVS Health (CVS), HCA Healthcare (HCA), and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) (Per Proxy Statement for July 2017 Annual Meeting).Management’s effectiveness is relatively lower compared to peers in specific areas. For example, McKesson’s ROA is relatively lower compared to peer averages corresponding to ‘Distributor, Wholesaler’ peers and a peer basket utilized by McKesson for internal comparison. Moreover, although McKesson produces much greater ROE compared to the greater peer basket, it lags its more comparable peers (Normalized net income was used for peer averages for better comparison). Although McKesson’s returns on company resources lag peers in specific areas, management’s ability to produce returns is nevertheless beneficial for shareholders. With the return on invested capital consistently greater than any reasonable WACC, the company is consistently creating value and increasing its moat within its competitive environment as well as returning acceptable capital to shareholders.Financial PositionMcKesson’s current and historical financial position is relatively much more favorable compared to ‘Distributor, Wholesaler’ peers both in liquidity and solvency. The following table shows this comparison between F2015-F2017:McKesson, over the past three fiscal years, has achieved more favorable liquidity position compared to peers, with a most recent (F2017) current ratio of 1.04x compared to a peer average of 0.90x. Moreover, McKesson’s solvency position is relatively much more favorable compared to peers with total debt calculations in 2015 and 2016 including redeemable non-controlling interests, and 2017 including all debt outstanding, redeemable non-controlling interests, and off-balance sheet liabilities such as the present value of all future minimum operating lease obligations. The peer averages (Per S&P Capital IQ NetAdvantage), only include book value of issued debt. Therefore, even with adjustments made to McKesson resulting in greater total debt balances, McKesson has achieved more favorable solvency ratios. Although McKesson has historically maintained relatively low interest coverage ratios compared to peers, the interest coverage is still substantial with significant cushion for adverse changes in operating performance.Risks(Per 2017 10-k)Equity Downside Risk:Given the valuation metrics outlined above, McKesson currently boasts a significant margin of safety with a significant divergence from intrinsic value even with relatively conservative assumptions. Failure to realize 100% of any of the above assumptions would still produce a significant gap between current market price and intrinsic value (Shown in sensitivity analyses). With that being said, there is a risk that market behavior will exaggerate any negative events falsely justifying selling pressure to previous lows attained over the past couple of months. Such a discount to true value would produce an even better investment opportunity with an undeniable margin of safety.Source: Own analysisCatalystSummaryMcKesson currently retains a strong competitive position within its ‘Healthcare Distributors’ sub-industry with a consistent ability to expand its moat through strong ROIC, improve its core competencies through acquisitions, divestitures, and equity investments, and retain a healthy financial position with the ability to weather adverse changes in the competitive environment. With a reasonable conservative F2018 revenue growth rate of 1.9%, factoring in benefits from acquisitions, equity investments, and organic growth, partially offset by continuing price deflation in specific areas and increased competition, a justifiable price given peer multiple averages is at least 17.5% greater than current market levels. Moreover, given reasonable assumptions outlined above, a discounted cash flow analysis given an explicit forecast of five years, produces an intrinsic value per share of $264 (Perpetuity approach), a 38.4% upside and $251 (EBITDA Multiple), a 34.5% upside. Given a significant divergence from intrinsic value, with a variety of assumptions shown in the sensitivity analyses producing a significant upside from current market levels, it is reasonable to assume a strong margin of safety limiting downside risk. McKesson is comprised of attentive management who are focused on, and incentivized to, place a strong emphasis on shareholder value, giving investors confidence in the notion that McKesson will strive to consistently, gradually improve long-term performance. Overall, with acceptable deviations in operating performance and valuation assumptions, McKesson still seems to be undervalued relative to intrinsic value at its current market price, thus providing a recommendable ‘value’ buy opportunity with a medium to long time-horizon."
4087600,49201,2017-07-13T15:23:11-04:00,"A frugal dividend tempers McKesson Corporation's abundant earnings yield.Nonetheless, the company is the arguable leader of the health care distributor oligopoly in both fundamentals and valuation.McKesson's downside risks are newsworthy.But the stock’s compelling margin of safety appears protected by the company's enduring delivery of compounding annual growth.","(Note: subscribers to Main Street Value Investor Marketplace received the first look at this research).Macroeconomic downside risks stemming from exorbitant CEO pay, the opioid crisis, pending healthcare reform, and evolving reinvention of retail pharmacy delivery models are newsworthy topics for McKesson Corporation (MCK).However, as overpaid executives and other stock price thrashing issues come to fruition, the stocks of companies that are quality capital allocators such as McKesson, temporarily go on sale without compromising the recurrent delivery of compounding annual growth.Thus, we believe MCK is perhaps a compelling asymmetric value play, rare in today’s secular bull market.An appreciation of a company's products or services and competitive advantages are essential to the main street value investor. To own a business, we must first familiarize ourselves with the enterprise that generates the numbers that comprise the stock's analysis.Based in San Francisco, California USA, McKesson Corporation is engaged in delivering pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, and healthcare information technology. The company operates through two segments:The chart below demonstrates that distribution solutions is McKesson's revenue driver.Source: McKesson CorporationMcKesson claims to be the oldest and largest healthcare company in the nation, serving more than 50% of U.S. hospitals and 20% of physicians. The company delivers one-third of all medications used daily in North America and has operations in more than 16 countries.Economic MoatWithin investing parlance, an economic moat is the subjective measure of the competitive advantages of a company's goods or services in the marketplace. A wider moat creates a barrier to entry for potential competitors.McKesson competes head-on with two other health care distributors, AmerisourceBergen (ABC) and Cardinal Health (CAH), but the sheer dominance of the market by all three players commands a universal wide moat rating.According to Morningstar analyst, Vishnu Lekraj:Possessing market dominance within a limited pool of competitors or oligopoly is an ideal wide moat play for the value investor. Oligopolies are more attractive to investors than the single dominant player of a monopoly, which is vulnerable to government antitrust law enforcement both at home and abroad. (Source: McKesson Corporation)MCK is a large-cap stock in the health care distributors sub-industry within the broader health care sector. As of this writing, its market capitalization was an approximate $35 billion. MCK’s price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), or current stock price relative to earnings per share for the trailing 12 months, is approximately seven times versus ~16x for health care distributors as a whole. In comparison, the S&P U.S. Health Care sector is trading at ~35x P/E against ~22x for the S&P 500 Index.Our perpetual skepticism in forecasting — and the reader frustration it sometimes creates — aside, the forward price-to-earnings ratio for MCK is approximately 14 times compared to ~21x for the health care sector and ~19x for the S&P 500. The trailing and forward P/E ratios for MCK appear significantly discounted relative to the health care distributors, health care sector, and the large-cap domestic market as a whole.As of its fiscal year ending May 18, 2017, McKesson's earnings per share (EPS) were $23.89 annualized, netting a 14.57% earnings yield, i.e., EPS divided by the most recent stock closing price. We view earnings yield, the inverse of the P/E ratio, as the equivalent of a stock's equity bond rate or how a company's earnings compare to the 10-year Treasury rate. As of the market close on July 10, 2017, the 10-year Treasury was yielding 2.38% or 1,219 basis points, i.e., 12.19 percentage points below MCK’s earnings yield.As of this research, McKesson is paying a meager 4.72% of its adjusted EPS to shareholders in an annual dividend of $1.12 per share, paid quarterly, resulting in a 0.68% dividend yield. In contrast, McKesson’s most recent five-year compounded annual dividend growth rate was an encouraging 14.10%.Despite its unexceptional payout and yield, McKesson has more than doubled its annual dividend from $0.48 in fiscal 2009 to a high of $1.12 in F2016.Ultimately, dividends keep us compensated in the short term as we wait patiently for capital appreciation of the company's stock over the long term. However, McKesson’s current profile dictates a lucrative earnings return on the stock price against a seemingly trivial dividend yield.When considering the worthiness of a company's inclusion in the Main Street Value Investor Model Portfolio (MSVI), the emphasis is placed on actual growth metrics as opposed to speculative forecasts of what may or may not occur with future revenues, earnings per share, free cash flow, or dividend growth.Instead, we look for positive, trailing five-year increases in revenue, earnings, cash flow, and dividends. As defensive investors, we prefer companies that are already growing, not just promising to grow.In the most recent five-year reporting period, McKesson’s compounded annual revenue and earnings per share growth rates were 10.17% and 33.49%, respectively. We prefer double-digit five-year growth in the top and bottom lines and McKesson is delivering, pun intended.Granted, we are cautious of the effect of McKesson's aggressive share buybacks on the EPS growth. However, as value investors, we also take note that in fiscal 2017, the company repurchased 14.1 million of MCK common shares through open market transactions at an average price per share of $140.96 or about an 18% discount to the trading range of the stock as of this writing. CEO John H. Hammergren (McKesson Corporation)We want to own companies with efficient and transparent management that leverage returns for customers and investors. John H. Hammergren is chairman, president and chief executive officer of McKesson Corporation. Joining McKesson in January 1996, he was named president and CEO in 2001 and chairman in 2002.Hammergren, his leadership team, and the ~78,000 employees of McKesson are delivering a trailing 12-month operating margin (EBIT, or earnings before interest and taxes) of 3.58% of revenue, yielding a net profit margin of 2.66%, i.e., trailing 12 months of income after taxes divided by sales. We prefer double-digit margins, but McKesson’s net profit margin outperforms the 1.12% of the health care distributors group including the most recent trailing net margins of Cardinal Health at 1.05% and AmerisourceBergen at 0.77%. In low margin, wide moat industries, small margin premiums count.The Art of Increasing Marginally Low Cash FlowsAt MSVI, we prefer highly profitable, cash-generating companies that provide margins of safety in a literal sense.As reflected on McKesson’s financial statements for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017, we note the increase in five-year average growth in free cash flow from $2.1 billion in fiscal 2013 to $4.2 billion in fiscal 2017. Free cash flow is net income and other cash from operating activities minus payments for capitalized expenditures, e.g., property and equipment, during the same period.Free cash flow allows a company to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value such as research and development, acquisitions, dividend payments, share repurchases, and debt reduction.This annualized horizontal trend in generating free cash is tempered by the company's recent 2.72% vertical cash flow margin, below our minimum threshold of 10%. Cash flow margin (CFM) is operating cash flow divided by sales, each measured over the trailing 12 months.It is important to recognize that the generation of operating cash by the health care distributors is low due to the competitive squeeze on net margins. Thus, we are inclined to keep a closer eye on cash flow margin to measure management’s ability to convert net income into operating cash flow.McKesson’s 2.72% CFM exceeds both Cardinal Health’s 1.70% and AmerisourceBergen’s 1.13% CFM.Returns on ManagementAs does Warren Buffett, we place a premium on the return on invested capital (ROIC) or how well a company is allocating its financial resources to generate returns for the business. We target companies producing 12% or higher in ROIC. McKesson’s ROIC, at the time of this research, was a health care distributor oligopoly leading 28.39% versus 17.75% for ABC and 11.15% for CAH.To be sure, the return on invested capital is only as good as the company's weighted average cost of capital (WACC). When a business's cost of capital increases, it typically translates to an inverse decrease in valuation and an increase in risk. At 8.40% WACC, as of this writing, McKesson is exceeding the company's average cost of that capital by more than three times.The potential for manipulation of equity from stock buybacks notwithstanding, the return on equity (ROE) — or how well the company generates net income as a percentage of total equity in the stock — provides another excellent measure of management effectiveness. We seek a minimum of 15% and note that McKesson’s most recent trailing ROE of 54.62% was outpacing the declining ABC ROE of 53.11% and the steady CAH return on equity of 20.55%.With a massive distribution footprint such as McKesson’s, we also want to take a peek at return on assets (ROA), i.e., management's ability to efficiently deploy its assets. As of this writing, the company was leveraging assets at a respectable 8.69%. With notable consistency, McKesson’s ROA is superior to its primary competitors, ABC and CAH, which were each below 5.00%.Fundamentally, McKesson is compounding revenue and earnings and generating operating and net margins that are superior to the health care distributor oligopoly where it competes. Although McKesson's small vertical operating cash flow margin is typical of its industry, management was growing horizontal free cash flow during the most recent five-year reporting period. As a middleman operation requiring relatively minimal capital expenditures, McKesson and its management are the beneficiaries of excess free cash flow for other capital allocation opportunities to further enhance shareholder value.The company’s management team, with an assist from Mr. Market, is delivering an exceptional earnings yield that far exceeds our minimum EY threshold as well as the 10-year Treasury bond rate. However, MCK’s yield, growth, and payout ratio of its dividend are less competitive than AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health.It seems that McKesson management has the resources to increase dividend payouts, but the board is apparently choosing to retain earnings for other potential uses such as buybacks, acquisitions, and net debt reduction.Despite its underperformance in dividends, McKesson presents as the most fundamentally sound major health care distributor in profit margins, earnings, and other returns on management such as CFM, ROIC, ROE, and ROA.Does MCK’s higher earnings yield — the reciprocation of its lower P/E ratio of 6.92 times against ABC's P/E of 17.85x and CAH's P/E of 18.30x, as of this writing — also make McKesson the best value based on current stock prices?Searching for Value (Geralt/Pixabay)Determining the attractiveness of a stock's price based on valuation multiples relative to a company's fundamentals is one of the primary tenets of the Main Street Value Investor's search for stock investing nirvana or alpha.As of this writing, MCK appears as the most attractively-priced stock among the three dominant health care distributors. Current valuation indicators are clearly in the bullish range depending on an investor's multiples of choice.MCK was recently trading at 5.68 times enterprise value to operating margin (EV/EBIT). In general, less than 12 times reflects a reasonable stock price. EV/EBIT is a useful indicator of whether the stock is overbought, or oversold by the market as appears the current case for MCK. Suggesting market perform levels, ABC and CAH were each trading at just above our 12.00x EV/EBIT minimum threshold.As of this research, the price to sales ratio (P/S) for MCK was 0.18 times. We interpret <2.00x as an attractive multiple when measuring a stock price relative to its revenue stream. MCK’s peers, ABC at 0.14x and CAH at 0.19x, were trading at similarly attractive P/S levels. In contrast, the domestic health care sector had a P/S ratio of 1.95x versus 2.08x for the S&P 500.MCK also appears reasonably priced when considering its price-to-book or P/B ratio. As of this writing, the stock is trading at 3.17 times its net asset value. ABC was at an elevated 8.06x and CAH at a competitive 3.68x P/B compared to MCK. We focus on fundamentally sound companies selling at a P/B ratio of less than 2.00x; however such attractive trading multiples are hard to find in this secular bull market.Growth vs. ValueThe price-to-earnings growth ratio (PEG) is a favorite among Wall Street's growth and momentum crowds. As value investors, we are more cautious based on the projection nature of PEG as opposed to actual trailing results. Nonetheless, PEG can provide a substantive peek into a stock's price worthiness.We prefer the PEG ratio below 2.00, and MCK was recently trading at 1.75 times based on a five-year growth projection. As of this writing, ABC was trading at a competitive 2.11x PEG, and CAH was at a threshold beating 3.69x its projected five-year earnings growth.We also measure cash flow multiples as a reliable predictor of the intrinsic value of a stock price. At MSVI, we look for stocks trading at a single-digit price-to-cash flow ratio (P/CF) and MCK was recently trading at an oligopoly preferred 5.76 times versus 11.10x for ABC and 11.82x P/CF for CAH.To be sure, MCK is trading at attractive valuation multiples when measured against earnings, enterprise value, sales, book value, projected earnings, and cash flow. Although competitive in several valuation multiples, ABC appears more expensive than MCK regarding earnings, enterprise value, net asset value, and cash flow; and CAH presents as pricier than MCK in earnings, enterprise value, projected growth, and cash flow.For value investors, the stock price is paramount to initiating the productive partial ownership of quality companies. However, preservation of capital becomes supreme immediately following the stock purchase. Evaluating downside risk is a good measurement of this all-encompassing margin of safety.Nevertheless, we do not know what McKesson or any health distributor’s stock price will be one, three, or five years from now, never mind next week.(Vimeo)A company's balance sheet liquidity, e.g., current assets divided by long-term debt (CA/LTD), was a favorite of Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing. Higher than 1.50 is ideal, as we want to own businesses that theoretically can pay down debt at least one and a half times using liquid assets.Our most recent measure of McKesson’s CA/LTD was a debt crushing 5.06 times. In simple terms, the company could pay off its long-term debt obligations five times using liquid assets such as cash and equivalents, short-term investments, trade accounts receivables, and inventories.Current ratio (CR) is another simple but telling measure of a company's financial stability. CR is current assets divided by current liabilities, thus the higher above 1.00, the better. McKesson’s most recent quarterly balance sheet had a CR of 1.04, demonstrating that liquid assets are just adequate in fully funding near-term liabilities, such as accounts payable, accrued expenses, debt service, and income taxes.We should not be surprised that McKesson’s largest current liability relates to its accounts payable. This is perhaps a manifestation of its health care consumables distribution business, predicated on coordinated aging of outstanding invoices to maintain a balance between receivables, inventories, and controllable payouts.Nonetheless, the Main Street 20 Watchlist (exclusive to members of Main Street Value Investor Marketplace) ranks McKesson's overall market risk profile as average. We like profitable, dividend-paying, wide-moat companies with low volatility plus the cash flow and liquidity to pay its bills, both short and long-term.Although protected by a wide moat in a competitive low margin business, the dividend has room for improvement using available free cash flow. Plus, MCK’s 1.13 five-year beta demonstrates more volatility than the S&P 500's base 1.00. Although current balance sheet liquidity is notably marginal for McKesson, we covet the strength of the company's longer-term debt coverage.Additional downside risk factors include the pending healthcare reform legislation from Congress that may have a material impact on revenues.To be sure, another question looms by way of the transformational retail environment, in general. For any company heavily invested in the retail pharmacy supply chain, will drone deliveries of mail–order prescriptions — or similar online direct to patient models — slay the legal drug middleman?New York Stock Exchange (Skeeze/Pixabay)A stock's margin of safety is an estimate of the difference between the intrinsic value of the stock and its current market price. Some professional value investors prefer to calculate the margin of safety with discounted future free cash flow projections. For example, Morningstar recently published its view of MCK’s ""fair value,"" at $210.00 per share, about a 27% premium to the stock price as of this writing.These types of overly sophisticated margin of safety or intrinsic value estimates are what allegedly justify the high fee structure of Wall Street. However, we are suspect of the projection nature of these formulas. If we have to start predicting future cash flows, interest rates, and capital expenditures, haven't we become more a speculator and less an investor?We take a modest and frankly realistic approach to estimating intrinsic value. Thus, we prefer to measure the margin of safety in a broader sense as opposed to Magic 8 Ball specificity.Wall Street, in general, continues to regurgitate complex, assumptive financial models of predominantly pie in the sky price targets. If those models consistently worked, wouldn't we all be overnight stock market millionaires?To the contrary, the MSVI Margin of Safety model looks for reasonably-priced stocks with favorable earnings yields (EY), returns on invested capital (ROIC), and cash flow margins (CFM). We simply add the sum of EY, ROIC, CFM, and the reciprocal EBIT/EV, and weigh against balance sheet liquidity (CA/LTD) to assess the overall equity bond rate, management effectiveness, earnings quality, market valuation, and financial stability of the company.We believe our calculation of margin of safety is a useful measure of a company's intrinsic worth based on current and trailing indices as opposed to assumptive future cash flows and other crystal ball projections. Thus, we measure MoS for longer-term value investing as opposed to shorter-term value trading.As of this writing, the Main Street Value Investor margin of safety rating for MCK reiterates a bullish view based on our proprietary formula.McKesson comfortably exceeds our margins of safety for earnings yield, management effectiveness, and current assets to long-term debt. Furthermore, the operating earnings to enterprise value is close to six times the targeted threshold. This key valuation indicator is screaming “mispriced” on the buy side of the trade and is the highest EBIT/EV among all holdings of the Main Street Value Investor Model Portfolio and Main Street 20 Watchlist. Again, the company comes up short in cash flow margin as would be expected from a health care distributor.That written, it is important to stress that our measure of the margin of safety is a screenshot of our research and not a buy, hold, or sell signal.We own common shares for the long-term benefit of partnering with a company that supports its customers with in-demand, useful products or services, rewards its employees with sustainable career opportunities, and compensates its shareholders with positive returns protected by world-class internal financial controls.However, attempting to predict explicit future prices or percentage gains and declines is a Wall Street game of chance that we respectfully choose to avoid on Main Street.Coat of Arms of West Virginia (Wikipedia Commons)As value investors on Main Street, we do not interpret the Wall Street consensus as a definitive buy or sell signal, but a suggestion to perhaps run the other way. However, evaluating the consensus on a stock is an entertaining if not serious dive into a contrarian's treasure trove.According to the Wall Street Journal, 18 analysts currently covering MCK are collectively bullish with an average price target of $173.20, a 5% premium to the closing price as of this writing. The price targets range from a low of $145.00 to a high of $210.00. Despite the plethora of Ivy-League MBAs, company visits, investor conferences, earnings calls, algorithms, and financial modeling that goes into these ratings, only time — in the context of hindsight — will determine which targets are accurate, if any.Data miner Tip Ranks says the financial blogger consensus, including contributors from Seeking Alpha, is bullish on MCK. At MSVI, we place increased weight on the blogger consensus as it tends to be more of a Main Street view, although we are mindful that many bloggers focus on fundamentals, technicals, growth, and dividends, not necessarily value.As of this writing, short interest on MCK, or the percentage of shares that are traded based on a bet the stock price is poised to drop, was bullish at 1.4% of shares outstanding. We think of short interest as the hedge fund consensus since the Wall Street money manager elite executes a significant shorting of stocks. Per TipRanks, hedge fund holdings of MCK had increased in the most recent quarter, suggesting an overall bullish view.When a High Paid CEO is Not EnviedA unique contribution of the Main Street Value Investor series is the measurement of employee satisfaction, including the rank and file's evaluation of the CEO. Although gathered from non-scientific data of the all-too-biased Internet, we believe a snapshot look at employee morale is worth the peek to quantify a company's cultural dynamic.According to Glassdoor, approximately 2,200 alleged present and former employees of McKesson Corporation that submitted online reviews have collectively rated the company 3.4 out of 5 stars, a relatively low score on Glassdoor.The most-cited positive comments from McKesson employees were ""much more productive and better for work-life balance which is huge"" and “ability to work from home when needed."" The most mentioned drawbacks are ""work-life balance needs improvement” and “upper management doesn’t appreciate the hard-working employees with great work ethic.”Based on close to 900 reviews, McKesson employees give CEO John Hammergren a mere 71% approval rating, a relatively low score on Glassdoor.Any time a company CEO is respected — or disrespected — by those that work within the same culture as him or her, we take notice.I wonder if recent headlines have anything to do with McKesson's bearish Glassdoor ratings.On CEO Hammergren:From July 10, 2017: Teamsters Urge McKesson Shareholders to Vote Against CEO Pay (CNBC/Reuters).From October 6, 2016: America's Highest Paid CEO Puts Giant Orinda Estate for Auction (Curbed San Francisco).Hammergren is no longer the highest paid CEO in the U.S.Nonetheless, Hammergren’s current McKesson bio highlights that Harvard Business Review (HBR) named him as one of their 100 Top Performing CEOs in the World. That was in 2015 when he came in at #63. The bio does not disclose that in 2016, HBR left Hammergren off of its top performing CEO list.On the Opioid Epidemic:From June 13, 2017: As America’s Opioid Crisis Spirals, Giant Drug Distributor McKesson Is Feeling the Pain (Fortune)Readers may access public disclosures from the company specific to the controlled dangerous substance oversupply complaints from the state of West Virginia, and others, beginning on page 108 of the commitments and contingent liabilities section of McKesson’s Form 10-K annual filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, date stamped March 31, 2017.Despite overpaid CEO’s, tragic epidemics, changing-of-the-guard government reforms, and evolving business models, quality capital allocators such as McKesson are otherwise good for our financial health.To be sure, satisfied employees are more inclined to deliver quality products and excellent service, which often translate to loyal customers and sustainable profitability. Thus, investors on Main Street should consider weighing the relative bearish view among McKesson’s insiders and observers against the overall bullish view of the Wall Street consensus.Intelligent investors own risk-averse slices of wonderful companies, thereby leaving the trading of stocks to risk-defying speculators. Self-directed investment research is best carried out within a model that drives to a quantitative outcome of a bullish, neutral, or bearish call on the targeted company and the stock that represents its ownership.Based on this approach, we find McKesson to be a fundamentally sound company whose stock trades at an alluring margin of safety despite an average-risk profile.Although McKesson’s appealing margin of safety is tempting, a value trap risk is perhaps lying in wait of a healthcare recession that squeezes already depressed profit and cash flow margins into the gutter.Specific to McKesson, socially conscious investors may be turned off by the claims of CEO Hammergren’s outrageous pay disparity, and the company’s alleged contributions to opioid abuse. However, this brings forth one of the benefits of being an individual investor focused on buying slices of companies as opposed to actively trading stocks or having an index or active fund manager choose the holdings. We can make the tough choices and take personal responsibility when we click the buy or sell trade button at our online discount broker.CEOs and societal woes come and go with abandon. To the contrary, the seemingly mispriced stocks of wonderful, capital deploying companies such as McKesson are cast as rare opportunities in bull markets - although not devoid of risk.For better or worse, investing is a proverbial double-edged sword of directly participating in socioeconomic empowerment by way of the straight edge, while unintentionally perpetuating greed from the serrated side.Tread carefully, forever remembering that the benefits of physical and emotional health usually outweigh any advantages of financial wealth.Stay well and happy investing.I invite you to learn more about Main Street Value Investor in the SA Marketplace where we host an actively-managed model portfolio of mispriced stocks with compounding returns and wide margins of safety through all market cycles.Join Now and Avoid Our Upcoming Price IncreaseWe are raising our prices 60% for new subscribers on April 2, 2018.

4048194,67113,2017-02-22T08:08:02-05:00,McKesson looks like it has bottomed and looks on course to form a weekly swing this week.Fundamentals remain strong for the company despite losing some key contracts.Selling covered calls in January 2018 can substantially boost income here.,"McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) is now down almost 35% since its 2015 highs of just over $240 a share. The loss of some key contracts and the meaningful downturn in the general pharmaceutical sector over the past two years has resulted in McKesson's share price now having sunk almost $100 from its all-time highs. Although the stock sold off post 3rd quarter earnings at the end of January, the share price has gradually recovered those losses and now seems ready to take out its pre-earnings share price.Sentiment has already bounced off its multi-year lows which looks encouraging for the company going forward. Any time a stock undergoes a significant correction the principal question in the aftermath has to be whether the company's long-term fundamentals are still intact or not. Consensus definitely believes so, although negative earnings growth is in the cards next year with $11.92 expected in earnings per share.Thereafter in 2019 analysts are projecting a 10% increase in earnings over the previous year. This really is the crux of the issue for investors thinking of going long this stock. By investing here one is not expecting the company to return to meaningful bottom line growth for another eighteen months at least. However the share price should move before the company returned to earnings growth, so the window of opportunity may not be as big here as many think. Let's go through why I believe McKesson still has its fundamentals intact and how you can pick up this stock at an even cheaper price if you still have reservations about going long this name.I have written in recent commentary that I like both the biotech and pharmaceutical sectors because they continue to make higher lows and higher highs and M&A activity remains very robust. Personally I just can't see major pharmaceutical distributors being sidelined in this sector going forward. Drug costs especially in the US continue to be a controversial topic which is why McKesson and its operations has come under the radar. Some bearish analysts believe that McKesson (being a distributor) doesn't have enough control as its business model could be attacked both from buyers on the front line and from government on transparency. However I just feel that the supply chain models - and the logistics setups built by McKesson and its two main competitors, Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) and AmerisourceBergen Corp. (NYSE:ABC), over the years - are a huge competitive advantage in themselves. These three distributors control the market, so outside competition inching its way in here seems unlikely. Personally I just feel that there is going to be too much growth in this sector over the next few years and McKesson looks set to benefit especially considering its present valuation.What I also like about McKesson's future prospects is that long-term contracts with partners are the norm in this sector, plus the company continues to look like it can bounce back from temporary setbacks. For example, the pending purchase of Rite Aid by Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) means that the existing McKesson's OneStop Generics Purchasing deal will most assuredly come under pressure. The acquisition of Omnicare by CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) was another blow to McKesson as Omnicare before the acquisition had significantly increased the business it had been doing with McKesson. However McKesson struck back by entering into new more favorable agreements with Wal-mart (NYSE:WMT) and Albertsons, plus it also started to restructure its own operation in a sustained effort to bring down costs. Presently this market looks very stable with all of the three major wholesalers controlling the major pharmacy benefit managers and retail chain customers. However I continue to prefer McKesson, as it is cheaper than both its peers and the S&P 500 (NYSE:SPX) from an earnings standpoint.Currently the company has an earnings multiple of 16.6 which is a full six points lower than its five-year average. Furthermore its price to cash flow ratio looks particularly attractive at 5.3 compared to a five-year average of 13.8. McKesson has a strong balance sheet with far more equity than debt and it continues to spit out large cash flows. Its current free cash flow number on a trailing 12-month average comes in at well over $5.7 billion, which is the highest it has been for over a decade. In fact over a 10-year period all of the company's important financial metrics are well ahead of the company's 10-year averages. This stock rode the wave of the pharmaceutical bull run up to mid 2015 and I just can't see McKesson (especially with the scale advantages it enjoys) getting left behind in the next phase of this bull run.The one area which may detract investors from going long McKesson is its small dividend yield of well under 1%. However, for example by selling the $155 covered call, which expires next January (11 months) for around $13 per call option, one could substantially increase their dividend yield over the next 12 months. Selling this call option basically gives the call buyer the right but not the obligation to buy their shares at that strike price. Sometimes selling covered calls gets a bad rap because the investor is essentially capping the potential gain on the investment. However the probability of success goes up substantially because, instead of buying at around the $150 level, the premium from the call option is collected and put towards the cost of the shares. In this way, one is actually reducing their cost price to well under $140 a share (based on 100 shares on one call option).Strategies like these definitely put the odds in your favor. Yes, you are capping your upside, but selling covered calls one year out on beaten-up stocks is an excellent strategy for the risk-averse investor. Many investors will chime in and state that McKesson's fundamentals look strong so calls should not be sold here. This may be true but it is extremely difficult to time the market. On the contrary, the stock could be at these levels in 12 months' time or lower, but the covered call seller will still have made money. That is why I like this strategy here - and especially because of the low dividend. If the stock is below $155 at expiration, the investor will have pocketed the full option premium ($13) and at least $1.12 in dividend income, which would be income of $14+. If we take this income and calculate it off the present share price, the income yield would rise to 9.3%. On the contrary, if the stock rallies from here so that it is trading above $155 on expiration, the investor will keep all of the above income as well as the capital gain (around $5 per share) on the sale of the shares. Then we are talking about a $19 return - which, based off today's share price, would be a return on investment of 12.7%.To sum up, I believe the bottom is in for McKesson and it should grind higher from here. Income investors could use the generous option premium to sell some 2018 covered calls to bring in additional income and increase that yield to up near 10%."

4065099,101959,2017-04-25T16:11:57-04:00,"McKesson remains well off of its highs.Headwinds persist, but the company is making moves to drive continued growth.Investors looking to initiate a long-term position will likely do well from these prices.","McKesson (NYSE:MCK) is a large-cap pharmaceutical wholesaler and distributor operating in a low-margin, oligopolistic sector with its 2 key competitors: Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) and AmeriSourceBergen (NYSE:ABC).The company has taken a beating over the last year, down over 30% off of its highs on poor forward guidance and weak results. The same headwinds affecting MCK have affected its competitors, but MCK is now the cheapest of the three, despite being the largest. MCK represents the best value today in its sector, with a significant margin of safety baked into the share price. The long-term investor who is not overly concerned with dividends should see this as an opportunity to buy a well-operated blue chip healthcare stock at a bargain price.MCK is the largest of the drug wholesalers by sales in a field that rewards scale. The company operates 31 distribution centers, a master distribution center, and other facilities. Additionally, MCK has extensive Canadian operations with another 14 distribution centers. Wholesalers fill a pivotal role in the healthcare supply chain as their massive infrastructures are difficult to replicate. This also makes it less likely for the field to be disrupted by an upstart competitor. It would be very difficult and require a ton of money for a new company to enter the space by attempting to build out a similar infrastructure.Source: Company PresentationConsolidation of key customers has been one of the major trends in the space over time. Although each of the wholesalers has a considerable number of clients, large companies like CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), and Walgreens Boots Alliance (NYSE:WBA) represent a large percentage of revenues for the companies. For that reason, maintaining key clients is essential.MCK is in the process of building out its generic drug sourcing agreement with Wal-Mart, called Carrollton. Wal-Mart is the third largest pharmacy, and so it will drive meaningful business through the sourcing venture. Looking below, the major retail pharmacies and PBM's are now all aligned with the big 3 wholesalers. This alignment of the largest customers has made the wholesalers have to take lower margins in exchange for the predictability of business.Source: Drug Channels InstituteIt should come as no surprise that drug pricing has been a hot topic for some time now. The wholesalers and much of biotech have felt the pain of drug pricing rhetoric, although it is much more of an issue in the biotech sector. For the wholesalers, higher drug prices increases overall revenues, which leads to margin expansion and more profits. When prices stop inflating at the same level, or even deflate, growth slows and company profits take a hit. Looking at MCK's performance over the last couple of years, investors don't see a very rosy picture going forward. Although all 3 companies are trading below their long-term averages, especially considering that this is a highly valued bull market, MCK takes the cake trading at ~11X earnings today as compared to a normal ratio of 16X.Source: raps.orgMCK saw declines in both its gross profit and profit margins due to drug pricing this last year. The increasing utilization of generic drugs has come about as the FDA works on clearing the backlog of generics awaiting approval. Following the increased scrutiny, the agency has worked to streamline the process and lower the average review times for drugs. The backlog will likely be clear this year, which will halt the bleeding somewhat for the wholesalers on the pricing mix side. So far this year, management has seen pricing levels in-line with expectations, and no more talk about any price wars between the wholesalers.One of the strategies the industry has been using to combat this reliance on drug price increases is the move towards a fee-based approach. These agreements pay the wholesalers for the distribution at a fair and set price, negating the effects of the changing drug prices. These new agreements will allow for more control over margins, which will be of great benefit to the company.Healthcare ITSource: Acquisition PresentationMCK announced a deal last summer to combine its technology solutions business with Change healthcare to form a new healthcare IT company. MCK will be contributing the majority of its technology solutions division with the notable exceptions of the RelayHealth Pharmacy and EIS businesses. Change Healthcare is contributing mostly all of its businesses, and MCK will own ~70% of the combined firm. Additionally, MCK will be paid $1.25B at the close, and the company expects over $150M in annual synergies by the second year after close. The transaction is expected to close in the next few months.The company will be engaged in providing software and analytics, network solutions, and technology-enabled services to cut costs, improve revenues, and increase cash flow for its clients. The rapidly growing healthcare IT market is an opportunity for MCK, especially considering the margins that technology companies are able to maintain. However, the technology solutions division has not been performing to par for some time, hence the spin off. Combining with Change Healthcare and giving the technology division the tools it needs should help it grow much more quickly than it did when it was part of MCK.MCK has historically driven much of its growth through acquisitions. Just this last year, the company drove revenue growth despite its own headwinds through the closing of the UDG Healthcare Plc, Biologics, Inc., Vantage Oncology Holdings LLC, and Sainsbury Plc acquisitions. These acquisitions expanded MCK's geographic reach, with UDG Healthcare and Sainsbury Plc residing in Ireland and the UK. MCK also acquired Rexall Health in December 2016, a Canadian company giving MCK 470 retail pharmacies.Numerous acquisitions can be dilutive to shareholders, considering integration risks and debt levels. However, the company has continued to deliver strong returns on invested capital, as shown below.The acquisition of Vantage Oncology and Biologics will push MCK further in its specialty pharmacy distribution business, and will increase the scale and scope of its oncology and integrated cancer care offerings. The newest acquisition on deck is that of CoverMyMeds. MCK agreed to acquire the company for $1.1B, with a $270M incentive if CMM is able to reach certain performance goals through end of FY2019. CoverMyMeds is a healthcare IT company, specializing in electronic prior authorization technology. The company has been a partner of MCK's RelayHealth Pharmacy since 2010, and will continue to operate as an individual business unit. The company has a strong track record of driving returns through its acquisitions, and will likely continue to do so.MCK Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YChartsMCK's priorities are to maintain its investment grade credit rating, while committing $700-800M to internal investment and continuing to acquire companies. With nearly $6B in free cash flow this last year, the company has been able to acquire companies, repurchase shares, and increase its dividend without sacrificing internal investment.MCK Total Long Term Debt (Annual) data by YChartsLong-term debt is on a downtrend, and the company will likely continue to pay down debt as required to maintain its credit rating. The company has cash on hand of $2.4B, with $1.8B offshore, and expects to receive $1.25B at the close of its Change Healthcare transaction. The dividend yield of 0.82% only equates to a payout ratio of ~13%, although the dividend has been grown at an average 16.7% over the last 10 years. MCK is not a strong dividend play, but buybacks and a low valuation still represented a shareholder yield of nearly 10% last year.Looking at the graph above, MCK's share price has gone off a cliff. The company trades today at ~11X earnings, compared to its long-term average of 20.6X. However, the company likely won't be growing as quickly as the 17.5% earnings growth rate over that period, so the expected P/E ratio should be somewhere closer to 15X, likely.With a return to a P/E ratio of 15X, and based on analyst estimates, MCK would yield an annualized total return from an investment today of ~13%. This is factoring in the headwinds the company faces today, and decreasing earnings this year. If headwinds abate, the company could surprise to the upside easily, since there is quite alot of pessimism in the name at the moment. The yield is such that dividend investors should likely look at Dividend Aristocrat and competitor CAH, but MCK represents the strongest value in its industry today.If you liked this article and would like to read more like it, please click the ""Follow"" button next to my picture at the top and select Real-time alerts.

4023860,21652,2016-11-16T07:49:17-05:00,McKesson got blasted last month after reducing estimates.FYs 2016 & 2017 Still on track for record results.MCK's Best valuation since 2008-09 more than offsets the bad news.,"Healthcare supply, information technology and services giant McKesson (NYSE:MCK) should close out FY 2016 (ends Mar. 31, 2017) with record annual revenues of about $200 billion.The company sports a great track record across all major metrics. Political forces knocked MCK, and many other healthcare stocks, to the canvas during October as fears of price controls and the company's estimate cuts hung in the air.McKesson, which peaked above $243 in 2015, dropped briefly to south of $115 in late October before rebounding slightly. It finished at $143.69 on Monday, Nov. 14, 2016.Value Line just released its latest full page report on MCK. This one fully reflects the firm's new realities in the current industry climate. While the rate of growth may slow down, it still appears that MCK will post all-time best results in both 2016 and 2017.America's population is aging. Demand for MCK's products and services positions the firm right in the sweet spot for continued progress. The recent sell-off has made a premier company available at a decidedly non-premium asking price.Eighteen months ago the shares were pricey, at more than 20x forward earnings versus a 10-year average P/E of 15.2x. The yield at the old peak of $243.69 was the worst (lowest) since the high-flying market of 2007.The Oct. 28, 2016, low of $114.53, however, provided traders with MCK's lowest valuation entry point since the darkest days of 2008. In retrospect, both the highs of 2007 and 2015 and the nadirs of 2008 and 2016 were true outliers.This week's multiple on McKesson looks remarkably like the best buying opportunities (green-starred below) during 2010, 2011 and 2013.You'd think that analysts would be heartily recommending the stock while it's cheap. Instead, many are weaseling and appear wishy-washy or outright negative.Due to weak momentum, Value Line assigned MCK its lowest rating for near-term performance. While dissing MCK, Value Line noted the company's ultra-high financial strength and indicated a three to five year target price range 110% to 155% above the stock's quote as of their press deadline.No wonder readers went away confused about whether to buy, hold or sell.What are McKesson's shares worth?Applying a slightly below normal 15x multiple to the consensus 2017 estimate of $14 supports a 12 to 15 month goal of $210. That number is far from crazy. MCK fetched $214 during 2014 on EPS of just $11.11. MCK broached $243 last year.Take the emotion out, then evaluate logically and quantitatively. MCK looks like one of the market's best bargains, especially with the broad averages hovering near all-time highs.Are research analysts falling all over themselves helping steer investors into the stock now that it's once again available at a very reasonable price?Nope. Standard and Poor's and Thomson Reuters list MCK as ""neutral"". Second Opinion is negative on MCK and shows the stock in decline. Market Edge has an outright ""avoid"" rating.Morningstar research is an exception. It went with the fundamental view that McKesson is quite attractive. They labeled it as a 4-star (out of 5) BUY while calling present day fair value as $200. Morningstar's easy to understand 'price to fair value relationship' chart illustrates that MCK hasn't been this big a bargain since late 2008 through early 2009.Option writers can feel good selling Jan. 19, 2018, expiration date in-the-money puts at $160 to $180 strikes. The maximum gain on any option sale is keeping 100% of the money received up front. These 14-month duration trades would offer potential profits running from $2,610 to $4,060 per 100-share contract sold.The most conservative of those three strike prices (the $160's) drops the 'if put' forced net purchase price to near $134. Future stock price action can never be guaranteed. The chart above shows, though, that owning McKesson at $134 would have been a winning position for all but a few days during the most recent three years.Almost the same could be said for the more aggressive, $170 and $180, strike prices as well. Break-even points for both were running south of $140.McKesson is one of just a handful of high quality stocks which are now selling for less than they did during last winter's panic lows.Ignore most of the analysts' apathy. Buy MCK shares, sell some long-term puts or consider doing both.Disclosure: Long MCK shares, short MCK Jan. 2018 puts."
4029743,67113,2016-12-11T16:35:07-05:00,"Although fiscal 2017 guidance has been cut, I believe the current pricing environment will pass in due time.McKesson's scale is its most obvious competitive advantage. Furthermore its long term fundamental metrics and biotech's remain very strong.Analysts have long term earnings growth expectations of 8%+. This is in line with what the company has produced historically. Buy now while it is still trading for a discount.","McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) is still down 25% in this calendar year and down 7% in its own fiscal year which started back in April. The announcement of its fiscal second quarter which finished back in September resulted in the stock tanking by more than $36 a share back to the $124 level. Since then the stock has recovered well (now trading around the $146 level) but investors remain pessimistic regarding this stock. In fact, sentiment in the stock remains near the lows of last month which is positive in my opinion (as I use sentiment as a contrarian indicator).Source : Sentimentrader.comIn saying this, there is no doubt that McKesson is facing strong near term headwinds. The main reason for the 2017 guidance cut was the ongoing price war particularly against AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) and when you combine this with the lack of price inflation in the market at present, it was no wonder that investors began to liquidate their positions. McKesson has come out and stated that it will aim to renegotiate with manufacturers for compensation purposes as all that the current soft pricing environment is doing is trimming margins. This is where the bears seem to be troubled at present. Mckesson's margins are already razor thin so further trimming never goes unnoticed. Although revenues have kept charging higher in recent years, margins (both gross and operating) on a trailing twelve month average (5.9% & 1.7% respectively) are down compared to fiscal 2016.Another reason is definitely the bearish perception we have in this sector at present. Why? Well although biotech stocks rallied hard when Donald Trump was announced as the new president-elect, he has since come out recently and said that he will tackle the whole area of rising drug prices. Biotech investors had hoped that Trump's business led intentions would be bullish for the sector but his recent comments has brought this up for debate. So what investors have to ascertain now is whether fiscal 2017 will only be a bump in the road for McKesson or something more permanent. I would be leaning more towards the former for the following reasons.Firstly before investing in any stock, I believe it is important to see how the company's important fundamental metrics have performed over the past decade for example. As the table illustrates below, the company has very strong trending fundamentals and has always recovered when margins or earnings dipped for a year or two.Secondly one needs to look at the strong competitive advantages Mckesson brings to the table with the most obvious one being its scale. In fact Mckesson, AmerisourceBergen & Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) dominate pharmaceutical distribution which means newcomers would have major headwinds in stealing market share here. Why? Well these companies have major infrastructure and distribution assets built up down through the years. Any client going direct to the manufacturers just would not have leverage and scale to warrant sizable discounting which is why McKesson is protected to a large degree.Furthermore the company's current earnings multiple is 16.4 which is below the industry average of 16.7 plus almost 8 points below McKesson's five year average of 23.0. In fact due to the slump in the share price since May of last year, all of McKesson's valuation metrics are much lower than the company's historic averages. Its price to cash low ratio looks particularly attractive at 6.3. Investors need to realize that large cap companies like McKesson (which incidentally has strong competitive advantages) rarely sell at such low discounts. When equity markets finally take a breather, McKesson should get caught up in the profit taking which is why we may see lower prices in the near term. However sentiment will not stay this low for long so long term investors could do much worse than investing in this stock at sub $150 levels."
4061423,72015,2017-04-10T10:30:53-04:00,"After years of receiving a premium valuation, shares of McKesson are now trading well below historical average multiples.While its margins are low, the company manages to generate strong free cash flows.A discounted cash flow analysis finds that McKesson is modestly undervalued using conservative assumptions.Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis suggests that further downside is likely limited.","McKesson (NYSE:MCK) is one of the largest corporations from the United States that many of its residents have probably never heard of. In fact, it might surprise you to learn that among all companies in the S&P 500, McKesson has the 5th highest revenue over the last 12 months (trailing only Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)). Of course, the margins in the drug distribution business are not quite as high as those enjoyed Apple, but nevertheless, McKesson has been a solid free cash flow generator over the last decade.However, after several years of strong share price performance, concerns about declining drug prices have caused shares in McKesson to fall from a high of $240 nearly two years ago, to their current level just above $140 today. In fact, whether one looks at a trailing price/earnings ratio or a forward price/earnings ratio, McKesson seems undervalued relative to its recent history:This article analyzes McKesson's past performance to see how efficiently it can turn sales into free cash flow and then uses a discounted cash flow [DCF] model to determine a fair value for the company's shares. It also includes a sensitivity analysis to help give a sense of a range of different outcomes based on modifying two key assumptions.DCF ModelNote: I invite you to read my original article that outlines the DCF sensitivity analysis methodology. The basic idea is that since the results of a DCF analysis can be heavily skewed by making minor changes to the terminal growth rate or firm's cost of equity, I have used a range of long-term growth rates and discount (cost of equity) rates in my analysis below. By using one's own estimate of long-term growth and an appropriate discount rate, each individual investor can come up with their own target price for the security in question.To get a sense of how effective McKesson is in turning sales into free cash flow, the past 5 years of data is analyzed:As previously mentioned, drug distribution is a notoriously low margin business. Therefore, one should not be surprised to see that McKesson is only able to generate an average of a little over 2 cents in cash flow for every dollar in sales it achieves. However, capital expenditures are modest - an average of less than $500 million annually over the last 5 years (equal to just 0.32% of sales). The DCF model will use these two averages moving forward to estimate future operating cash flows and capital expenditures.While analysts predict that sales will grow nearly 4.5% this year, future sales growth is expected to slow in 2018. Based on this forecast, I am a assuming a (fairly modest) long-term revenue growth rate of 1%. The model assumes that revenue growth rises in a linear fashion from 2018 through 2022 (when it reaches the 1% long term rate). Using the ratios calculated above and after adding back the after tax interest expense, the following free cash flows are estimated:These free cash flows (along with a terminal free cash flow estimate) are then discounted back to the present time using McKesson's projected cost of equity. Various different estimates of its beta are available depending on the time frame used, but as per my explanation in this article, the ""adjusted beta"" of the stock was calculated to be 1.05. Based on a 8% market risk premium and risk free rate of 2.5%, McKesson's discount rate is estimated to be 11%. If you feel like a lower or higher discount rate is warranted, you can see how changing that variable impacts the results of the model in the sensitivity analysis at the end of the article.After subtracting the firm's approximately $6.7 billion in net debt, the model reaches the following conclusion:Using several fairly conservative assumptions (including no improvement in margins and a mere 1% long-term growth rate), the cash flow analysis suggests McKesson's shares are currently undervalued by a fairly significant margin of 12%.Sensitivity AnalysisHowever, my favorite part of this DCF model is the sensitivity analysis. The below table allows the reader to view the results of 35 different iterations of the McKesson model using a range of long-term growth estimates and discount rates. The target prices range from a low of $133 to a high of $232 - the cells highlighted in green are more than 10% above the current share price:One particular aspect about this chart that interests me is the lack of any red cells (which would suggest a scenario where the stock is currently overvalued by 10% or more). Even assuming zero future sales growth, McKesson shares appear reasonably priced. Once any sort of future revenue growth is accounted for, significant upside emerges.While current McKesson investors might be disappointed to see only 12% upside to the target price in the base case scenario, they should be excited about this sensitivity analysis, which suggests limited downside and the potential for shares to surpass the $200 level once again if growth expectations rise even a little bit."
4040627,84276,2017-01-30T10:04:14-05:00,McKesson Corporation fell to a fresh 2-month low on Friday.The stock may correct 5-10 percent more in the coming sessions.$120-$130 is a good range for long-term investment.,"McKesson Corporation (NYSE: MCK) will soon provide another buying opportunity to investors. The fundamentals and technicals suggest that the selling pressure should be over soon, giving investors a much-needed relief.Following the company's Q3 earnings announcement and its decision to buy CoverMyMeds for $1.1 billion, the stock had fallen to a fresh 2-month low of $135.46 on Friday. The stock ended the week near the lows at $136.74, which indicates that there may be some minor losses in store.The daily MCK price chart below clearly tells us that the stock has broken down from a flat consolidation range (marked with the green rectangle) of $140-$150.Source: TradingViewIf you will remember, I had written about $150-$160 as the target price for McKesson in my October 31 article titled, McKesson Corporation: The Bottom Is Near, And May Want To Get In. At that time, the company had slashed its outlook for the year and reported lower-than-expected earnings. I had then said:The stock touched a high of $151.77 in November on a strong rebound and $151.82 on January 20, thereby proving my bullish case correct.This time, I do not believe that the selling pressure will intensify significantly and that a rebound may come sooner. A range of $120-$130 should be considered for the stock to make fresh investments or increasing exposure.My basis for recommending a purchase after a 5-10 percent correction is based on both fundamental and technical factors.Technical FactorsThe 14-day Relative Strength Index is showing a reading of 36.6639. Generally, a reading of 30 or below is considered to represent oversold conditions.The 14-day Money Flow Index has a value of 43. For MFI, the oversold boundaries are represented by values of 20 or below.The MACD indicator has given a fresh sell signal, which means that the selling pressure might not end immediately. This is a momentum indicator which tells us that the bears are now in charge of the situation.Fundamental FactorsOne of the basics to invest in a business starts with knowing whether the business is attractively priced or not. Looking at the company's current valuations below tells me that MCK is not exorbitantly priced. All the important fundamental valuation metrics (except price-to-sales ratio) that an investor should consider before investing are lower than their historical averages.I personally pay significant attention to the price-to-book ratio. MCK's current P/B ratio of 3.8 is less than its 5-year average of 4.3.Source: Morningstar.comAnalysts at Morningstar.com find the forward PE of the company at 10.8 with a five-year earnings growth estimate of 9.6 percent. The average rating is 3.8, with 5 as 'buy' and 1 as 'sell.'At a forward PE of 10.8, the business is already attractively priced. And with a 5-10 percent cut, the forward PE ratio will slip into single digits and will match the earnings growth estimate. This means that an investor will be paying conservatively for the company's per-unit earnings growth.Therefore, the range of $120-$130 will prove to be a suitable investing range for a long-term commitment.ConclusionAlthough the market is reacting negatively to the company's Q3 and the announcement of the $1.1B purchase of CoverMyMeds, investors with a time horizon of 3-5 years will find the stock attractive in the $120-$130 range. The technicals and the fundamentals both indicate that the stock should not suffer significantly, but a 5-10 percent correction.If this correction occurs, the stock's forward PE will match the expected earnings growth rate, which implies that investors are paying conservatively for per-unit of earnings growth.Note: I cover several stocks in different sectors as well as S&P 500, crude oil, gold and silver, U.S. dollar, etc. So, if you liked this update, and would like to read more of such informative articles, please consider hitting the ""Follow"" button above.

4018086,101959,2016-11-02T07:17:41-04:00,"McKesson was sold-off terribly after their earnings call on Friday.They are operating in a deflationary environment for drug prices and increased competition.They are the largest company in the space, financially stable, and prepared to weather the storm.McKesson is cheap today, and presents an excellent value opportunity for the long-term investor.","McKesson (NYSE:MCK) is the largest of the 3 companies operating in the wholesale medical distribution space. Due to the low margins and efficiencies of scale, there is a high barrier to entry in their business, and thusly they only have 2 real competitors, AmeriSourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) and Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH). I did an article yesterday looking at CAH after earnings, you can check that out here.McKesson's most recent earnings could be called a disaster. The company's share price fell over 22% in one day, the single worst day performance since 1999, when they were involved with an accounting scandal with their HBOC healthcare technology acquisition. Their warnings over a competitive pricing environment dragged the share prices of their 2 competitors down, as well. With margins in this business so low, price wars can crush profits in a hurry. CEO John Hammergren spoke about this in their earnings call:Further, he called out ABC as the perpetrator, but not by name:This more aggressive behavior is worrisome, since it is likely to eat into the margins of all 3 companies, since they aren't going to let business just walk out the door. In their most recent quarter, their operating profit margin took a ~40 bps hit due to having to lower prices and compete.McKesson recorded revenue growth of 2% YOY and an earnings drop of 7%, after adjusting for a one-time goodwill impairment charge. It's expected that the pricing environment affected earnings to the tune of $1.60-1.90 per share. The onboarding of Albertson's-Safeway drove revenue increases through the quarter when compared to last year, but with margin compression this was not able to show through in earnings.One of the ventures McKesson will have closing soon that will raise some cash is their Change Healthcare joint venture. It involves merging McKesson's technology segment with most of Change Healthcare into a technology company offering financial and payment solutions as well as tools for administrative and clinical management. It will pay McKesson $1.5B to start, and they will end up with 70% of the company, which they plan on divesting following its IPO. It is expected to close 1st half of calendar year 2017, so there will be more updates on that to come.Speaking of cash, McKesson expects to drive 15% growth YOY in operating cash flow, excluding $270M in cash payments for their cost alignment plan and settlement with DEA/DOJ. They expect to deploy this cash into pretty massive buybacks, having approved a $4B share buyback program going forward. This will definitely have more bang for the buck after their massive recent decline. This will retire nearly 14% of their total shares outstanding as of the closing price on Tuesday.The Way ForwardThe competitive pricing environment these companies are facing today is likely spurred on by the generic price deflation that has plagued earnings in the sector for some time. It is not in any of these companies' or investors' best interests to spur a price war. With margins already under pressure due to the FDA's clearing of the generic drug approval backlog, problems are only being aggravated by the attempts at grabbing market share. Janet Woodcock, Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, has ramped up generic drug approvals considerably over the last year. This has been a bad thing for these companies, as it increases the competition in the market and depresses prices overall. With the backlog expected to be cleared early next year, the deflation will likely slow down or stop entirely, but the new normal will be that these companies will have to find profitability through other means than drug price increases. It is well documented through the ails of biotechs like Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) that drug pricing is a hot button issue lately. Therefore, it should be the expectation going forward that high branded and generic pricing increases should not be relied on to drive earnings.McKesson has updated its outlook from the previous range of $13.43 to $13.93 per diluted share to a new range of $12.35 to $12.85 per diluted share for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017. This revised outlook excludes from adjusted earnings the second-quarter EIS goodwill impairment charge and anticipated Cost Alignment Plan charges of 6 to 8 cents per diluted share. This outlook is contingent on similar pricing pressures to what was witnessed this last quarter. It is impossible to forecast how long the pricing pressures will exist, but they won't last forever. CEO John Hammergren had this to say during the call:McKesson is the largest company in this space, they are financially strong enough to withstand short term pricing pain, and they have been through this before. The pricing issues are mostly felt in their independent segment, since a lot of their bigger deals are locked down under contract. They have also generated more and more FCF, with the trailing twelve months coming in at ~$4.7B. Looking forward, profit margins may stay depressed for some time, but as long as they aren't losing business, then their competitors' attempts to outprice them will have been in vain. I believe that McKesson will be fine in the long run, and that the bad news going forward is priced in.McKesson is trading today at a forward P/E of ~10.3X, based off their guidance for the full year 2017. The last time investors saw them this cheap was 2009. They are not a company to buy for the dividend, since they only yield 0.9% even after the selloff and don't prioritize raising it every year. However, the value proposition with this stock is compelling, considering that they are the largest company in the space, operating from a strong financial position. Long-term investors willing to wait for the tide to turn for this sector are likely to be rewarded.If you liked this article, and would like to read more like it, please click the ""Follow"" button next to my picture at the top and select Real-time alerts.

4039801,25120,2017-01-26T14:13:44-05:00,"Investors in McKesson were not too pleased with third quarter results, which were largely in line with expectations.The company announced the acquisition of CoverMyMeds in a deal which makes strategic sense but probably adds nothing to current earnings.Amidst an appealing valuation, solid track record and in my eyes incorrect concern that distributors are to blame for high drug costs, I'm an owner of the shares.","Investors in McKesson (MCK) were not to happy with third quarter results and the purchase of CoverMyMeds. While the company hiked the full-year guidance in a modest way, after a big cut in the previous quarter, the quality of this raise is very low. McKesson sees slightly higher earnings on the back of a lower effective tax rate.At the same time, McKesson announced a $1 billion acquisition to shift away from its core distribution activities in a deal equivalent to $4 per share of McKesson. CoverMyMeds was founded in 2008 and while it has managed to report impressive growth, I think that the revenue, let alone earnings contribution, will be very limited. That said, the strategic rationale behind the deal focused on lowering the costs throughout the system and improved growth profile is much welcomed.Based on the appealing valuation multiples, sound cash flow generation and strong track record, I like the shares. I furthermore think that the company does not deserve to get any blame for jacking up the costs across the overall healthcare system. All of this makes me attracted to the shares at this level.How Is The Company Doing?McKesson shocked the market last quarter by pointing out that the company is facing a price war following very competitive pricing from its competitors.The impact of this was relatively modest during the quarter as the company reported a 5% increase in third quarter sales to $50.1 billion. The company reported a 5% drop in adjusted earnings to $3.03 per share, with GAAP earnings closely mimicking the adjusted numbers at $2.86 per share. While revenues were slightly lower than forecasts amidst lower inflation of branded pharmaceuticals, and more challenged reimbursement environment in the UK, earnings were slightly better, creating a mixed picture.There was even some good news. The company hiked the adjusted earnings guidance for the year to $12.60-$12.90 from after it was reduced to $12.35-$12.85 alongside the second quarter earnings release. The midpoint implies a $0.15 per share hike from the previous guidance. The quality of this guidance is poor as it is driven by a lower anticipated tax rate, with the distribution businesses still being under pressure. As a result, the effective tax rate is seen around 25% this year.GAAP earnings are seen at $10.05 per share, plus or minus $0.25 per share. The hike in the guidance is driven by anticipated higher inflation in Q4, seen at mid single digits or even high single digits.The Purchase Of CoverMyMedsAlongside the quarterly earnings report McKesson announced another acquisition, announcing the purchase of CoverMyMeds in a $1.1 billion deal. The good thing is that cash tax benefits reduce the effective purchase price to $0.9 billion, although earn outs will run as high as $270 million. This business will become part of the technology solutions business, as McKesson continues to shift away from the low margin but core distribution activities.CoverMyMeds is a privately owned company which provides electronic prior authorization solutions to pharmacies, providers, payers and pharmaceutical companies. The company secures that consumers will obtain electronic prior authorization which they need in order to get their drugs. At this moment, most of the prior authorization is done manually, being slower and most costly to the system. The company currently processes prior authorization for 700,000 prescribers.McKesson is very familiar with the company and its Relay Health Pharmacy business has been partnering CoverMyMeds since 2010.If all goes well the deal should add $0.30-$0.40 to adjusted earnings per share some three years from now. That yields a $66-$88 million anticipated earnings accretion based on the current share count, but probably relies heavily on pretty aggressive growth assumptions. No other financial details were released other than that the combination of CoverMyMeds and RelayHealth could generate a billion in sales some three years ahead in time.Valuation Looking Very ReasonableMcKesson ended the quarter with $2.4 billion in cash and operates with a net debt load of $6.7 billion. That is equivalent to little over 1.5 times adjusted EBITDA, being a very reasonable leverage ratio, even if we have not accounted for the CoverMyMeds purchase yet which will increase this ratio by 0.2-0.3 times.With shares trading at $140, we can hardly call shares expensive based on the GAAP guidance of $10.15 per share and non-GAAP earnings guidance of $12.75 per hare. This results in a 11-14 times multiple, based on the accounting metric which you prefer, as the truth is probably somewhere in the middle.The concerns about slower topline sales growth and margins have triggered a 40% sell-of from the highs of $240 in May of 2014 to current levels which are roughly $100 lower than that. That has resulted in a material setback as investors not only worry about slower growth but about margins as well. But how realistic are these concerns?Gross margins have risen from 5% a decade ago to 6% by now, not being very high margins for a distribution business. McKesson can easily justify this increase as sales have doubled to $200 billion while it has focused on higher margin technology solutions as well. GAAP operating margins have ranged anywhere between 1-2% each year, margins which can hardly be called excessive in my eyes.McKesson's strategy to pursue deals, such that of CoverMyMeds, even aid to reduce systemwide healthcare costs, something which should be applauded by all parties involved. While we have little information to figure out of the $900 million deal makes sense, it is equivalent to just $4 per share.As a result, I think that McKesson might deserve to trade at market multiples again in the future. Based on current earnings power and the different accounting methods, this translates into a $175 target based on GAAP earnings and a 17.5 times multiple, and even $220 target based on non-GAAP earnings in the medium to long term.At this moment McKesson is valued at just $30 billion at $140 per share. A 17.5 times market multiple requires the company to post earnings of $1.7 billion on a GAAP basis, half a billion less than the current guidance. This translates into a 0.25% margin shortfall (after tax), which in my eyes effectively prices in any potential margin risks. This is certainly the case as McKesson does not appear to be a bad actor in driving up costs for the overall system."

Intraday, the stock tumbled to as low as $114.53, extending its downtrend which began last year.The stock is now off roughly 50 percent from its all-time high of $243.61 in May 2015, and there seem to be fewer takers.MCK's shares tumbled massively on Friday after the company reported lower-than-expected Q2 results, and slashed its outlook for the remaining of the year. The Health Care (NYSEARCA: XLV) dropped more than 2 percent as the panic spread to other companies as well.In such grave situations, investors often reassess their investing strategies and wonder as to what should be their next course of action. While there is little solace as of now for those who bought this stock near the top, buying near low levels can help lower the average purchase price, and may even reduce potential losses.In this article, I will attempt to cover McKesson both from a fundamental standpoint as well as a technical perspective. My fundamental assessment reveals that in spite of the ""uncertainties,"" the company's business is strong enough to weather the storm. The technical analysis will provide some important levels to look forward to.The data below has been taken from MorningStar, and spans the period from 2007-to-date. There is visible improvement in all the metrics including revenue, gross margin, operating income, net income, dividends, book value per share, operating cash flow, free cash flow, etc.Although I am looking at the historical data, my aim is to establish that the company's business is sound, formidable, and can pass through a downcycle amid competitive pricing pressures. We have also seen the company emerge stronger from the 2008 depression. The company's strengths far outweigh the weaknesses in the broader environment, and the investors should consider taking a leap of faith here, and not abandon the ship.Source: MorningStarOne way to measure the financial strength of a company is by studying its cash flows. From the green rectangle above, it is evident that the company has been increasing its free cash flow, which amply covers the dividend payout to shareholders.Even more, while the free cash flow has grown roughly 2.5x from 2007-2016 ($1.233b-$3b), the dividend growth of >4.5x has far exceeded this rate. Recently, MCK announced a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share; in 2007, the annual dividend was $0.24.Now, let us consider some other aspects of this business. But this time, to draw more conclusive results, let us compare the company's fundamentals with that of the broader industry, and see if MCK is available at a discount or not.The P/E (TTM) is 12.1, which for the industry is 13.9. The price/book is 3 while the industry average is 3.7. A very important metric to consider while doing fundamental analysis is price/sales ratio; P/S for MCK is 0.1, half of the industry's average of 0.2.The return on assets is 3.9%, which is less than the industry's average of 4.5%. The return on equity TTM is 24.6%, lower than the industry average of 26.5%.Source: MorningStarOverall, I am convinced that the fundamentals are intact, although I would have appreciated if the ROA was slightly better.Looking ahead, the management has indicated that there will be a pressure on earnings, and hence, the ROA will remain depressed. This disappointment has been baked into the price, and after some further downside, I believe the stock will become attractive to long-term investors who are always on the lookout for strong businesses trading at discounts.Another thing to consider here is that this is not simply just this company's problem, rather a broad sector-based problem in a softer pricing environment. When the fog lifts, and it will eventually, MCK and this sector will rise sharply, although it may take its time.Technically as well, the stock looks ripe to make a strong comeback, however, near-term panic cannot be ruled out.Here are the important technical points drawn from the Weekly MCK price chart below:Source: TradingViewAlthough the weekly price chart has confirmed that the stock is oversold and is a good candidate for a short-covering play, it is better to take a look at the monthly price chart as well. I have employed the Fibonacci retracements to the entire rally from the 2008 low to the 2015 peak, and found some interesting observations which are hard to deny.Source: TradingViewPost hitting its peak in May last year, the stock slumped quickly in the new few months to pierce the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement (FR) of $192.51 decisively and strongly rebounded from the 38.2% FR of $160.86 - marked as 1 in the chart above. The rebound saw the stock once again test the 23.6% FR, this time on the upside, but failed to sustain - marked as 2. #3 marks the moment when this failure dragged the stock down to slightly below the 38.2% FR, but once again recovered to the 23.6% FR as 4. Clearly, the stock has followed the technicals laid by the FR.As of Friday, the stock pierced the 50% FR of $135.28 on huge volumes and slumped to $114.53, which is in close vicinity of the 61.8% FR of $109.70. The 61.8% Fibonacci retracement is an extremely strong level, and I wouldn't be surprised in the least if the stock registered a bottom near this level.Those with a low-risk appetite can choose to adopt a broad range of $100-$110 for their purchase. One can easily expect the stock to reach at least $150-$160 in the next 6 months, based on simply the technicals.ConclusionMcKesson remains a strong business from a fundamental perspective and an attractive investment from a technical viewpoint.I am counting on the market's overreaction to drive the stock down to $105-$110, at which making fresh investments should be considered.The company's drag on the Q2 results was a $290 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge, taken for the Enterprise Information Solutions. However, the company is exploring strategic alternatives for the EIS business within the Technology Solutions segment, and any positive news on this front, could send the stock soaring higher. With the recent debacle in stock price, the management would be pushed to achieve this sooner.McKesson expects $12.35 to $12.85 per diluted share for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017. Even by taking these figures as true, the stock is trading at roughly 10x, which is expensive by no means. The company has also announced a fresh $4 billion share repurchase program.My advice to investors is simple: Never let the market's frenzy influence your investing strategies. McKesson has a good solid, honest management at the top, which actually cares about creating value for the customers as well as the shareholders. And this, in my opinion, is a lovely recipe for success.Note: I cover several stocks in different sectors as well as S&P 500, crude oil, gold and silver, U.S. dollar, etc. So, if you liked this update, and would like to read more of such informative articles, please consider hitting the Follow button above.

4018088,25120,2016-11-02T07:29:23-04:00,"McKesson reported dismal second quarter results following the outbreak of a price war.Shares lost a quarter of their value and are cut in half compared to last year despite topline sales growth and a strong financial position.At these levels I believe that the risk-reward is fair or actually attractive, warranting an opportunistic long position.","McKesson (MCK) reported dismal second quarter results, sending a shockwave through the industry and its share price as it warned for a price war. Shares lost 25% of their value in response to the earnings report and statements by its CEO on the conference call, with shares now being cut in half versus 2015 highs.While margin pressure is never good for investors, I think that topline sales can be flattish to up slightly going forwards, while the company remains profitable and well capitalized. I believe that the market is pricing in quite severe margin pressure at these levels.If margin pressure might not be as bad as feared, combined with continued growth, financial strength and a 50% pullback in the share price, investors might have a great opportunity to buy into a long term growth story.A Quick IntroMcKesson might not be a household name but the chances are that the company provides services to you on a frequent basis. The company delivers a third of all medical prescriptions in North America, processing over 17 billion pharmaceutical transactions each year. The company has seen spectacular organic and deal related growth over the past decade, as has demonstrated on long term resilience, having been established more than 180 years ago.McKesson has organized its activities in two segments: distribution solutions and technology solutions. The distribution business generated $188 billion in sales in the fiscal year of 2016. It delivers branded and generic drugs and related products to retailers, independent retail pharmacies and institutional healthcare providers.Technology solutions is a $2.9 billion business which offers IT and related services to improve management of care and resources for healthcare organizations.Tremendous GrowthThe rapid growth of the US healthcare system and acquisition spree has resulted in rapid growth over the past decade. McKesson has grown sales from $87 billion in 2006 to $190 billion in its fiscal year of 2016, translating into a compounded annual growth rate of roughly 8% per year. Part of growth has come from dealmaking, as I estimate the total cost of deals over the past decade at roughly $13 billion by browsing through the cash flow statements of this corresponding period. A significant part of this relates to the Celesio acquisition, boosting the distribution activities in Europe.The good news is that investments being required to report organic growth are relatively modest. This allowed McKesson to pursue dealmaking as well as consistent share buybacks, as the company bought back a quarter of its outstanding share base over the past decade.The significant cash requirements to pursue dealmaking and buybacks have been funded from solid profitability and the fact that the dividend is very modest. Even after shares have been cut in half from 2015 highs, the yield is only approaching 1%. Combined with effective working capital management, McKesson has been able to finance this expansion while the balance sheet remained in excellent shape.One has to give management some credit as well for capital deployment. The vast majority of the shares were bought back in the period 2006-2013 when shares were trading comfortably below the 2015 peak at $240 per share.While some commentators might argue that McKesson and other competitors have used their position as middle man, alongside the introduction of the Affordable Care Act, to report blatant profits, this argument can hardly be defended. Gross margins have risen from roughly 4-5% of sales in 2006 to 5-6% at the moment. This modest margin expansion results from economies of scale and move into the higher margin technology business which reports gross margins of 50%.As a result, operating margins have improved towards 1.7-1.8% of sales in recent years, up from 1.3-1.4% reported a decade ago.What Has Gone Wrong?The predictable margins and strong growth made McKesson a attractive growth play. Shares traded at just $50 in 2007 and peaked at nearly $250 in 2015. Ever since shares have halved at $125, still translating into decent gains for long term holders of the stock. That said, valuations have come back to reality as revenues have more than doubled in absolute terms since 2006, and actually have tripled on a per share basis.This makes that the company now trades at 0.17 times projected sales of $200 billion for this year, implying a 20% discount compared to the ten year average. EBITDA multiples of nearly 8 times mark a similar 20-30% discount versus the long term average, as leverage remains very modest. The reason for the discount has to be sought in the emerging headwinds.This includes the continued increase in costs related to the healthcare system and the political reality that rising drug prices and overall healthcare costs is not sustainable. Not only will this impact growth, it most likely results in lower margins for all parties involved, even if McKesson has not seen much margin expansion at all over the past decade.While the stock has been weak following a multi-year momentum run, and concerns about the wider healthcare sector as of recent, it were the second quarter results which triggered a huge sell-off. Shares fell from $160 to $120 on a single day as second quarter topline sales growth slowed down to just 2%, with revenues amounting to $50.0 billion.Reported GAAP earnings of $1.35 per share were cut in half following a $290 million goodwill impairment charge, as adjusted earnings fell by 7% to $2.94 per share on the back of softer pricing in the distribution business.CEO John Hammergren points towards recent pricing pressure on medication and limited inflation which is impacting topline sales growth and pressuring margins. He recognized that McKesson was quick to lower prices given the conditions, allowing it to maintain market share. Yet these comments seem to indicate that a full blown price was has broken out.The company cut its adjusted earnings target for its fiscal year of 2017 towards $12.35-$12.85 per share, indicating a $1.08 per share cut compared to the previous guidance. For your reference, adjusted earnings came in at $12.08 per share in the fiscal year of 2016, but it seems that investors fear about further cuts to the guidance. GAAP earnings are seen quite a bit lower at $8.95 to $9.80 per share, with the majority of the difference resulting from amortization and acquisition related charges.With adjusted earnings hitting $6.47 per share in the first half of the fiscal year, adjusted earnings are seen at $5.88-$6.36 per share the second half of the year. This seems to indicate that second quarter earnings results are becoming the new norm for the rest of the year.Modeling The Future, Balance Sheet Strength, Bad News Is Priced InThe good news heading into this period of turmoil is the strength of the business in terms of its financial position. McKesson holds $5.5 billion in cash with total debt amounting to $8.1 billion. The net debt position of $2.6 billion is limited given that the company has fairly modest pension related liabilities as well. As adjusted EBITDA runs at roughly $4.5 billion a year, the 0.5-0.6 times leverage ratio is very modest by all means.The question therefore is simply what future margins can look like on a $200 billion sales base, which is expected to growth much slower or be flattish going forwards. Since 2010 operating margins averaged 1.7-1.8% of sales which is above the 1.3-1.5% reported in 2006-2009. Again, McKesson was much smaller and focused on lower margins activities in the time frame 2006-2009.If I assume a return to 1.5% operating margins, I see EBIT run at $3 billion a year. Interest expenses run at $300 million a year, as a 30% tax rate translates into net profits of $1.9 billion a year. With 228 million shares outstanding, GAAP earnings are seen at $8.00-$8.50 per share. Combined with a market multiple of 17 times earnings, this translates into a $140 target.This indicates that the market believes that the pain might be even deeper given that shares have fallen to $120-$130. If we stress test a 1% margin scenario, I see after-tax profits of $1.2 billion, for earnings of $5.00-$5.50 per share. This could support a $100 valuation if shares are awarded a market multiple.Final ThoughtsThe market is telling me that things look pretty bad for McKesson, essentially telling that at $120-$130 per share, operating margins are set to retreat from an average of 1.75% of sales, towards 1.25% in the coming time.Fortunately the market has priced in quite some bad news already as McKesson has excellent cash flow generation and a very strong balance sheet. The company furthermore announced a $4 billion share repurchase program following the soft results, sufficient to buy back over 30 million shares at current levels, equivalent to roughly 13% of the outstanding share base.I think that current levels offer quite a nice opportunity as it are not the likes of McKesson which have boosted margins in a big way in the past decade. Other parties in the system have been reaping the big bucks from increased spending across the overall healthcare sector as I believe that this observation and alleviation of margin pressure at some point in the future should allow for meaningful upside."
4016783,38311,2016-10-30T09:44:12-04:00,"Another scary episode on how quickly share prices can turn.Unfortunately, the share price decline in McKesson is not entirely unfounded.Is the company now undervalued? Should you invest in it?","Last Thursday, McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) reported its Q2 2017 results after market close. Its shares reacted negatively by sliding as much as 28% the next day. More than 28 million shares traded hands, which was 17x that of its average volume!Just what did McKesson report?For Q2, McKesson generated revenues of $50 billion which were 2% higher year over year. GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $1.35, down 49% year over year.However, the year-over-year expectation for the fiscal year 2017 isn't as scary as that double-digit earnings decline. Specifically, management lowered its earnings guidance for fiscal 2017 from a growth of 7-11% (estimated in Q1) to a year-over-year change of -1% to 3%.The negative outlook resulted from recent customer pricing activities and a trend of slower branded pharmaceutical inflation.Increased competitionMcKesson has always operated in a competitive environment, but instead of being concerned about customer pricing, it has always focused on delivering value. For example, it focuses on delivering exceptional service and innovation to help its customers to more effectively and efficiently connect with patients.Unfortunately, in Q1, McKesson began experiencing some customer pricing softness, which has worsened in Q2.This is what CEO John Hammergren had to say about it:This sounds like a price war, which can be dangerous to an industry that already earns thin margins. My hope is that the lower pricing is a temporary measure only.MCK Profit Margin (TTM) data by YChartsMcKesson and its peers already earn low marginsHammergren goes on to say, ""We believe the services we provide to both our provider customers and our manufacturer customers offer substantially greater value than what either party could develop with a more direct relationship. And we expect that with our focus on the value we deliver, our margins will recover over time.""The good long-term strategy will just be as Hammergren said - to focus on delivering creating value for your customers and higher profits will come.Slower branded inflationBefore talking about this issue, let's take a look at how McKesson is compensated for branded pharmaceutical product distribution services. It is essentially the middle man.Hammergren explains:There have been fewer price increases from manufacturers than the company expected. And when there are price increases, they're at a lower rate than the growth in 2016 and are also below the company's expected growth rate.Don't bet against McKessonAlthough there's increased uncertainty, aggressive competition, and pricing concerns, investors shouldn't bet against McKesson. It has come a long way to become a market leader.Here is a quick comparison of the profitability of McKesson against its competitors, Cardinal Health Inc. (NYSE:CAH), and AmerisourceBergen Corp. (NYSE:ABC), until recently.MCK Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsBelow is an infographic from the company's 2016 annual report that highlights some of its stats and accomplishments.ValuationValue Line's last report on McKesson was quite positive. Back in August, McKesson was trading at about $196 per share and Value Line had a three- to five-year price target range of $275 to $335 per share for an annualized return of 10-15%. New Value Line reports on McKesson and its peers should come out soon.Morningstar maintained the wide moat on McKesson but reduced its fair value estimate by 10% to $200 per share. From the close of $124 per share, the company is discounted by 38%.F.A.S.T. graphs has also updated with a 0% growth expectation for fiscal 2017 and a moderate growth estimate of 4% in 2018.Assuming a fair multiple of 15, McKesson's fair value should be close to $188 per share, implying a margin of safety of 34%.Dividend and share buybackAlthough McKesson offers a dividend, it still yields less than 1% after the huge price decline. Moreover, its dividend growth has been lumpy (even though it still increased its dividend per share at a CAGR of 18.9% since 2008).If you're looking for a dividend growth name in the space, you should explore AmerisourceBergen, which has increased its dividend per share at a CAGR of 35.8% since 2008 and at a CAGR of 46.8% over the last 10 years.The Board of Directors just authorized a new $4 billion share repurchase program, which will be a good use of capital if its share price remains depressed or falls further.ConclusionIn the short term, share prices can easily be shaken by news and emotion. However, in the case of McKesson's share price decline, it wasn't without reason.It is facing increased competition and drug price increases have occurred in moderation compared to the previous year. So, it'd be amazing if McKesson could more or less maintain its current profitability for this fiscal year. If so, investors can invest at a discount in an industry leader, which has normally traded at above a P/E of 15.That said, cautious investors who are interested should wait for some sort of consolidation or upward action supported by strong volume before getting in. The reason is that it's more likely the shares won't head higher anytime soon due to headwinds and negative market sentiments.Share your thoughts in the comments belowIf you like what you've just read, you can also follow me.

I'm interested in why it dropped and it triggers me to revisit my investing thesis. If the investing thesis remains sound and the company fundamentals are intact, then I'll think about adding to my position.McKesson Corporation (NYSE: MCK) investors (myself included) have not had a good few weeks, with the stock dropping ~ 10% as of late.Courtesy of Google FinanceBefore we talk about why this has likely happened, let's pause to review MCK.The BusinessMCK is in the business of health - they largely act as the middle man between the consumer and the manufacturers of pharmaceutical and surgical equipment. Operating within two segments - distributions and technology - MCK's revenues have grown at 12% over the last 3 years, netting over $190 billion in FY 2016.Source: MCK 10K FY 2016.The distribution solutions - the meat and potatoes of MCK's business - delivers pharmaceutical and surgical products to retail and institutional clients. Additionally, MCK provides specialty oncology services to physicians as well as biotechnology companies. This was bolstered by the acquisitions of Biologics Inc and Vantage Oncology Holdings LLC in 2016.In addition to operations in the United States, MCK also has operations in Canada and Europe. It was also previously active in South America, although the divestiture of its Brazilian Operations is set to close in the second half of FY 2017.Operating in an oligopoly [along with Cardinal Health NYSE: (CAH) and AmerisourceBergen NYSE: (ABC)] MCK is the largest (by market cap) of the three. All three of the companies seem to be quite good at what they do as well.*Real ROIC = ROIC - WACCData courtesy of GuruFocusAs we can see, all operate on razor thin margins. To be successful with 1% margins you need to be exceptional at what you do, as there is little room for error. This is what I think affords the companies their moat - it would take an immense amount of resources and expertise for a new company to come in and set up a distribution chain that could be competitive with these three.MCK appears to have mastered this business, posting impressive earnings growth over the past twenty years.Courtesy of FASTGraphsIn addition to earnings, cash flow has also been growing.Courtesy of FASTGraphsFurthermore, as with all health care associated stocks, there are exceptional demographic tail winds happening right now in North America - primarily, the boomers are aging.Courtesy of US Census BureauFurthermore, as standards of living increase, people are also living longer.Courtesy of Health, in the United States, in 2014 (CDC)Although people are living longer, the incidence of chronic diseases is increasing - additionally our lifestyles aren't doing us any favors, but that's a discussion for another day.Courtesy of Health, in the United States, in 2014Increased life expectancy, coupled with increased chronic conditions, leads to more health care resource utilization and higher expenditures. Courtesy of Health, in the United States, in 2014As we can see, the lion's share of the spending is private which in the last 10 years averaged 5.7% per year growth. Private spending has grown at a smaller clip of about 4.7% per year. Medicare spending has grown at a whopping 7%, while Medicaid spending has grown at about 4%.Assuming the average life expectancy of 75 - 80 holds steady for the next two decades, one could project that health care spending would grow, at minimum, at least mid - high single digits, independent of overall economic growth. Again, this is a massive tailwind for any health care company.Of course, this begs the question of how sustainable health care spending is in the developed world - this is a fair question getting lots of discussion in an election year. Indeed policy to curtail spending would affect the sector as a whole, so such risks aren't unique to MCK.Furthermore, with 1% margins, the health care distributors don't have much wiggle room - I think this is a good thing, as it affords them negotiating leverage other companies - say with 100% margins - don't have. For example, if government was to squeeze the distributors even a little, all of a sudden millions of Americans would no longer be able to get their prescription medications. Again, I think this is another situation where their thin margins increase their moat.DividendsMCK does reward shareholders with a small dividend, currently $0.28 / share (0.67% yield). Dividend growth has been reasonable the last 5 years (8.10%) and with such a small payout ratio (11%) it's reasonable that dividend growth could increase as earnings growth slows. Said another way, as MCK transitions from its growth phase to a mature stage, it could start paying out those earnings instead of retaining them, leading to impressive future dividend growth.To summarize, so far we can see that MCK is a strong company, with a wide moat, in a sector that's got massive tailwinds that will persist for decades to come. Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?So Why The Drop?I see two potential reasons for the recent drop - one is revised investor expectations, and the other is insider selling.The first potential reason for the drops are updated investor expectations, which of course leads to an updated share price. In July, MCK issued guidance for $13.43 - $13.93 adjusted EPS which equates to high single digit growth - lower than the historical double digit growth. This is roughly in line with analyst expectations, which are at present $13.51 for FY 17.Even so, if $13.43 adjusted EPS was realized that would equate to a target price of ~ $219, at today's P/E of 16.37. Of note, this represents a return of 24% (excluding dividends) based on today's share price. However, this information is old news and so surely the market isn't reacting to it now.On September 6th and 12th, MCK Chairman, President & CEO John Hammergren exercised some options and then promptly divested ~$36 million worth of shares. Additionally, other members of the board - Marie Knowles, Christine Jacobs and Wayne Budd - have been selling in the last month.Looking a bit further, insiders have been selling all year, so why is this time different?Courtsey of GuruFocusPerhaps it was the sheer amount of shares (201,000) that Mr. Hammergren sold that spooked investors - let's take this opportunity to revisit that monthly chart of MCK's price.Courtesy of Google FinanceTo my eye, it looks like the big drops coincide with Mr. Hammergren's sales. Indeed, if the CEO is offloading that many shares, something must be wrong, right?Well, perhaps not. Let's look a bit further into Mr. Hammergren's previous sales over the past year.Data courtesy of GuruFocusAs we can see, he's been fairly active exercising his options and selling massive blocks of shares every five months or so, and each time he offloads a massive block of shares there is an associated sell off.Given the 13% earnings growth in FY 16 it appears the sky wasn't falling, and rather people were over-reacting to his insider selling. Thus I would argue his insider selling doesn't necessarily represent a problem with the business, although one could argue excessive executive compensation is a problem itself.Putting It All TogetherMCK is a high quality business with a solid moat that, like all health care stocks, is set to benefit from a multi-decade demographic tailwind. Additionally, it has a strong history of earnings and dividend growth, although earnings growth is slowing as of late.To me, it seems investors are fearful of the recent insider selling, although historically it's a repeated pattern of behavior from management, that doesn't necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals. Instead, I see the insider selling as an opportunity, as the volatility gives me the chance to buy a high quality business at prices momentarily suppressed by fear.Based on today's price, if MCK can materialize the conservative earnings estimates, that would lead to a short term gain of ~20%. Furthermore, given the quality of the company, the necessity of its services, and the ongoing demographic tail winds, this is a company I have no problem going long on.I think it's time to add to my position.What do you think about MCK?

3706646,96216,2015-11-23T11:18:46-05:00,"McKesson’s current undervaluation is due to the healthcare industry as a whole rather than factors related to the company.
        Valuation techniques (DCF, Comparable Companies Analysis) indicate a higher share price.
        The (currently small) IT segment of McKesson’s sales shows growth potential in the future.","Thesis: I am proposing a long position on McKesson today due to the capital preservation provided by industry dominance and the different sectors McKesson operates in, as well as the strong future growth potential.McKesson's current share price is at $189.68, with a 52-week range of $160.10-$243.61.Company OverviewMcKesson primarily operates in two different industry sectors, being IT services and distribution. Only a small portion of their revenue came through the IT services route in recent years compared to the massive distribution channels.Another factor to examine is the industry profit margins, and how McKesson compares. The medical distribution industry has a profit margin of 3.9%, compared to McKesson's most recent 5.65%. This is high, and has been increasing in the past three years, because of business acquisitions and a higher buy margin within North America. I predict that this will be a big factor for McKesson's continued industry dominance in the future.McKesson is focused on making new partnerships with suppliers in the future, further increasing their revenue stream. In IT services, McKesson benefits from increased legislation and health care reform (Obamacare), and is focused on the expansion of this aspect in the future. When analyzing McKesson, we cannot describe it as a stable medical distributor, but as a stable medical distributor with a small and expanding IT segment.CatalystsRisksValuationI performed two types of valuation on McKesson.First, a comparable companies analysis. This gave us an implied share price of $218.66, showing how MCK is undervalued relative to the industry sector.I also performed a DCF analysis. I received a share price of $283.66, again indicating that this company is undervalued. I assumed 5% sales growth, which was conservative considering the past sales growth of the company and potential future IT growth.ConclusionTo summarize, MCK is a stock that provides a safe bet in the risky healthcare industry while also indicating a strong upside potential. Throughout my analysis I have attempted to show you why the catalysts indicate that MCK will grow in the future and how MCK is currently an undervalued stock."
3767386,94696,2015-12-21T03:27:44-05:00,"Acquisition of Rite-Aid a material risk to earnings.
        Culmination of a tough year for McKesson.
        $2 billion buyback executes on a free option to protect shareholder value.","On October 29th, McKesson (NYSE:MCK) reported Q2 2016 earnings of $3.31 beating consensus by $0.32 and representing 19% year on year growth. Revenues grew 10% including a 4% currency drag and management raised earnings guidance for the year. Lately, the stock continues to tread water as the uncertainty of the Rite-Aid (NYSE:RAD) distribution contract represents a near-term risk.Recent Bad NewsThe pharmaceutical supply chain has experienced considerable consolidation in the past year with varying degrees of pain and joy inflicted on the distributors. It's been a sea of bad news for MCK, which has mostly been on the wrong side of consolidation this year. First, OptumRx switched to Cardinal Healthy after the UNH arranged marriage between OptumRx and Catamaran. Second, they lost the generic sourcing for Omnicare to Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) when Omnicare was acquired by CVS. Finally, the announced purchase of RAD by Walgreen's Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) creates a risk that WBA shifts RAD distribution to AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC).While winning and losing deals, especially on price or during consolidation, is somewhat normal, the latter event could represent a significant earnings headwind given that RAD represents $18 billion (~10%) of McKesson's revenue. Even when considering that it was probably slightly lower margin than the corporate average, it still represents a 8-10% earnings headwind for next year (or whenever the assumed transition is officially announced).Recent Good NewsLost in the ""RAD overhang"" has been several good announcements that the market has generally ignored.First, after Albertson's acquired Safeway, they extended their distribution and sourcing agreement and added Safeway as a customer. This agreement could add $0.20 to 2017 earnings. Second, they acquired the pharmacy operations of Sainsbury's U.K. as well as the drug distribution business of UDG Healthcare. These agreements highlight how Celesio is being used as a global platform for consolidation and should add $0.10 to $0.14 to 2017 earnings.Declining PEAs mentioned the loss of the RAD business represents a material risk to earnings growth next year - the recent good news adds some visibility but likely doesn't offset the RAD earnings risk. Assuming the transition occurs at the end of McKesson's 2016 fiscal year, it could result in 2017 earnings growth in the 2-4% range from around 12% previously forecast. As a result, the forward PE multiple of McKesson has declined from 18x in May to 14x currently. This compares to ABC and CAH at 15.5x and 14.5x, respectively.The outlook for ABC and CAH seems comparatively brighter. Forecasts call for these two to grow earnings, 17% and 13%, respectively while McKesson is forecast to deliver 12% earnings growth. Without much guidance from either MCK or WBA, analysts appear not to have adjusted their 2017 numbers yet.$2 Billion BuybackThis is when the benefit of a business with good cash flow and a balance sheet with low debt really shines. Every business will face tough periods and MCK is certainly taking its share of punches in 2015. However, a company like MCK doesn't need to spend much every year to maintain its existing level of sales and earnings, which have grown every year for the past 10. In fiscal 2015, it spent roughly 15% of cash flow on capital expenditures. The result is cash builds quickly for shareholders and the company has a great track record of re-deploying that cash for acquisitions.Further, they've also regularly repurchased stock and with Q3 results, announced a new $2 billion stock buyback (even after purchasing nearly $500 million of stock and repaying $500 million of debt in the first half of their fiscal 2016). This is why being prudent with capital spending and keeping a clean balance sheet is a great asset. It can protect shareholders against shocks and/ or adverse events. In this case, the free option will allow McKesson to offset the earnings from some of these lost contracts and repurchase stock at lower prices than earlier in the year.Amazingly, the $2 billion buyback only takes net debt/ EBITDA to just over 1x. The company could theoretically recapitalize even more aggressively. If management added two more turns of EBITDA in debt and repurchased $10 billion of stock, that would represent 20% of the equity value .With a historical preference for acquisitions, management will likely keep its powder dry. However, if the share prices remains under further pressure, management continues to have a free option to buyback stock and protect the share price."
3675506,87996,2015-11-11T09:01:45-05:00,"McKesson is among the stocks selected by Morgan Stanley as best bets for the next 12 months.McKesson has strong cash flow and balance sheet.Importantly, current market valuation seems to be rather conservative.","McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) reported fiscal 2016 second quarter results on October 29. The revenues were USD 48.8 billion (up 10% compared to USD 44.2 billion a year ago). On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 14% over the prior year. Importantly, for the first half of the fiscal year, McKesson generated cash from operations of USD 1.3 billion, and ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of USD 5.4 billion. The Board of Directors authorized a new USD 2 billion share repurchase program.McKesson is among the stocks selected by Morgan Stanley as best bets for the next 12 months. In my previous article, I have focused on another stock from Morgan Stanley list - Ingersoll-Rand. I was slightly disappointed after analyzing its fundamentals, though. Ingersoll-Rand is in very good shape from business and financial perspective, its valuation seems to be quite stretched to me (see this). Is McKesson a different story?Empowering cash generationMcKesson is focused on healthcare services and information technology and it offers solutions that include pharmaceutical and medical-surgical supply management, and business and clinical services. Its stock went through remarkable rally in 2011 - 2014 period, gaining almost 30 % in 2012 and 2014, and more than 60 % in 2013. Nevertheless, the stock took approximately 10 % dive in 2015.McKesson grew revenues 30.32% from USD 137.39 billion to USD 179.05 billion in fiscal year 2015. Its net income rose by 16.86% from USD 1.26 billion to USD 1.48 billion. We can should note high return on equity: ROE reached 21.8 % in fiscal year 2015. The Company had more than USD 5 billion of cash and its interest bearing debt reached approximately USD 10 billion. EBITDA reached USD 3.3 billion in fiscal year 2015, and the ratio of net debt to EBITDA is therefore rather low. During current fiscal year the balance sheet got even stronger.I do not believe Morgan Stanley would recommend a company with weak cash flow, and McKesson is certainly not a negative surprise. Its cash flow from operations was stable at USD 3.1 billion in 2014 - 2015 period. As indicated above, McKesson generated cash from operations of USD 1.3 billion in H1 2016. As you can see from the first table below, it represents significant y-o-y improvement, and the same holds for cash flow after CapEx. Note that The Company generated USD 2.7 billion after CapEx in 2015, and USD 2.6 billion in fiscal year 2014 (see second table below).We can see the dividends and buybacks reached USD 530 million in fiscal year 2015, which is significantly below free cash flow to equity (i.e., cash flow after CapEx/total investments). As mentioned above, the directors have authorized a new USD 2 billion share repurchase program. This means the total payout to the shareholder will increase, but it will not harm the financial stability of the Company due to high free cash flow relative to the dividends and planned buybacks.Valuation thoughtsMcKesson trades with market cap of USD 42.5 billion. As indicated, fiscal 2016 cash flow after CapEx should be above 2015 level. Nevertheless, let`s be conservative and assume short term free cash flow standard is at USD 2.7 billion level reached in 2015. Stock`s beta is at 0.9, which means the required rate of return should be close to 7.1 % (using standard CAPM model).If we assume the cash flow will be stable in the future, its present value is equal to USD 35.8 billion. It is somewhat below current market cap and this means the market is somewhat more optimistic regarding the long term cash flow growth. It must reach 1.4 % for the present value of the cash flow to be equal to the current market cap. In other words, if the short term cash flow standard is similar to cash flow in fiscal year 2015, and long term cash flow growth reaches 1.4 %, the stock is valued fairly*.The 1.4 % hurdle seems to me rather conservative from macro, industry and company-specific point of view. Long term nominal growth of the US and other developed economies will almost certainly be higher than 1.4 %, and the same holds for the health care sector. We could argue the Company was not able to grow its free cash flow in 2015, but 2016 indicates this was an exception. And there does not seem to be an obvious reason, why the Company should not be able to grow at least as much as the overall economy. In other words, this may be one of the few remaining undervalued stocks in the US.*Please note this estimate assumes future acquisitions will be value neutral. I mention this mainly because in September 2015, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire the pharmaceutical distribution business of UDG Healthcare Plc based in Ireland for Euro 408 million in cash. In July 2015, the Company announced plans to acquire the pharmacy business of J Sainsbury Plc based in the U.K. for £ 125 million in cash. Under the terms of the transaction, we will acquire 281 pharmacies in the U.K. including 277 in-store pharmacies and four located in hospitals. In August 2015, The Company sold ZEE Medical business for a total purchase price of USD 134 million.Disclaimer: I encourage you to do your own research and analysis.

They are two of the three companies who control the vast majority of the market share in the medical supply and pharmaceutical distribution space. I have been interested in this space mainly because of its high barriers to entry, and the share price declines all three of the companies have faced. Health care is also one of my favorite defensive sectors to overweight in my portfolio. The company I want to analyze today is McKesson (NYSE: MCK). I encourage anyone to go back and read the detailed analysis of Cardinal Health and AmeriSourceBergen and I will add a quantitative comparison of all three at the end.Source: McKesson FY2016 Annual ReportMcKesson is a pharmaceutical and medical supply distribution company operating with both distribution and technology solutions segments. However, distribution accounts for 98% of revenue, and that will be the majority of what is discussed.Source: McKesson 2015 10-KThis graphic will help illustrate their scale:Source: McKesson FY2016 Annual ReportMany of the qualitative factors working for and against McKesson will be macro ones, which affect their 2 primary competitors, as well. For that reason, I won't rehash them here, and will just talk about the company-specific opportunities and their recent acquisitions. I urge you to go back and read one of my other two articles on this sector which will discuss these.Many of McKesson's recent acquisitions in Europe could be cause for concern with investors due to the upcoming Brexit. American companies operating in the EU and UK will face uncertainty. However, if there were a sector to be confident in, it would be healthcare. McKesson should be able to weather any issues due to the recession resistant nature of its business, but it's still something to keep your eye on, and something that could sway a decision between McKesson, CAH, and ABC.Continued synergies from 2-year-old Celesio acquisition in Europe:In 2014, McKesson acquired German-based Celesio for $5.4 billion. This expanded their generic pharmaceutical business in Europe, and its synergies are still being realized. Management has guided for $275-$325 million in synergies. This added 132 wholesale branches supplying 65,000 pharmacies and hospitals in 14 European countries. On their most recent earnings call, management updated shareholders:John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerAcquisition of UDG Healthcare in Ireland:Last year, McKesson acquired UDG Healthcare, which operates in both Irelands, for $466 million. They also acquired 281 pharmacies in the UK under the Sainsbury's brand. Both of these are part of a larger strategy for them to increase their European presence. Like I mentioned above, the recent Brexit may give the more conservative investor pause. In my personal opinion, I believe that businesses with strong balance sheets and cash generation capabilities should not have a problem.Additionally, McKesson has acquired 2 companies in America this year for $1.2 billion. Vantage Oncology and Biologics expand their oncology business and will be accretive to earnings in 2017. Integration is underway and we should get more status on the synergies provided on their Q1 2017 report. Investors should make sure to pay attention to their next earnings call, to verify that management is meeting their goals with regards to both acquisitions.With all of these purchases, their debt has been increasing. Management discussed this during their most recent earnings call:James Beer (EVP and CFO)This is something for investors to keep their eye on. Every acquisition carries risks of overpaying and underestimations of what will be required in terms of assimilation and integration. Additionally, companies can overextend themselves right before an economic downturn causing issues with liquidity. I don't think that this is an issue for them now, however, due to their stable cash flows and the low rate environment.Quantitative Analysis:McKesson is a dividend challenger, having raised their for 8 consecutive years. However, nobody would call them a high-yielder. At the current price of $176.31, it yields about .64%. It isn't a surprise, then, that their payout ratio is only 11%. I generally like to see one that is higher than that. This pretty much precludes investment for those interested in current income, but it shouldn't for those interested in total return. Let's look at its 1/3/5/10 year dividend growth rates:Source: David Fish's CCC ListThese are not bad growth rates if this were a higher yielding company, but compared to that of ABC and CAH, it seems very small. This isn't something that changes whether or not to invest in a company, since it's possible that they have better uses for their capital in other projects that will spur growth. As stated above, they have definitely been acquisitive, and if done right, that will reward shareholders with increased earnings.Through FY2016, they repurchased $1.5 billion worth of shares, and allocated $4 billion to acquisitions as well as paying down $1.5 billion in long term debt. Trust in the company's management that capital is better allocated on acquisitions than returning it to shareholders in the form of higher dividends or more buybacks is an important thing for an investor to decide before investing in a company.Their Return on Equity has been excellent: (numbers courtesy of MorningStar)The graph below illustrates their ROIC-WACC spread. This shows the creation of shareholder value as they grow, and that their capital allocation has been in their best interest. (numbers courtesy of GuruFocus)Their FCF yield is about 7.7%, which is average. Their free cash flow generation of $3 billion for 2015 versus ~$6 billion in long term debt shows that it is serviceable. However, it is something to keep an eye on.They have compounded their earnings at an 18% rate over the last 5 years, which is an outstanding level. They have guided for ~9.5% for the next 5, which is definitely enough to make investors happy. Their ttm P/E is 17.58 and forward is 11.89, which is comparable with others in their industry.I will discuss their net margin in the comparison of all three companies below, since I believe that it can be used to measure the companies against each other in terms of their efficiency.Before we get into the comparisons between the three companies, let's just do a final look into McKesson's valuation using one of Chuck Carnevale's FAST Graphs:Source: FAST GraphsIndustry Comparison:Here is a table of some key metrics compared by company, and then all three of their net profit margin graphs, showing their efficiency in creating profits over time in an industry with razor-thin margins.Source: MorningstarLooking at these metrics side by side, I believe that all three companies are strong and their biggest differences are in ABC's debt load, FCF generation, and dividend yield. These metrics can definitely separate investors based on what they value most. My last comparison I would like to make is on their net margins. These companies being in almost the exact same business, a side by side comparison of margins can be a good demonstrator of operational efficiencies.MCK's consistency is commendable. Both MCK and CAH ended 2015 with the exact same net margin, and ABC was only off by a fraction of a percentage point. These companies, operating on such thin margins, must stay efficient and keep their costs down to maintain profitability. It looks like they have all done a good job of that, MCK being the best and ABC the worst.I think a discussion of which areas outside of America the 3 companies are expanding into can make a difference, as well.Conclusion:It's hard to come to an easy, one sentence conclusion from the data I have outlined above. I believe that all 3 companies offer different things to different investors, and they are all good defensive companies trading near or beneath fair value. I am personally long CAH and ABC, and am mostly swayed by the fact that MCK offers a lower yield without beating out the other two in earnings growth or FCF yield. Because of that, and the fact that Cardinal Health is a Dividend Aristocrat, I find them to be the most compelling, followed by AmeriSourceBergen and then McKesson.

3962675,86786,2016-04-02T11:30:56-04:00,"I run a dividend analysis on McKesson.McKesson's buyback program was successful in reducing outstanding shares, but was not a wise use of their cash.McKesson's use of cash shows they care more about management than they do investors (and employees).","I recently received a reader request to look into McKesson (NYSE:MCK):MCK is an interesting stock because of its high price but relatively low yield. I've found, through digging around in forums and comments on the stock, that many hold MCK because of its strong fundamentals, its consistent dividend growth, and its buyback program. Truth be told, an analysis of these three aspects shows the company to be weaker than its peers.Allow me to run through this analysis as if I were running a dividend analysis, as all my points are contained within.MCK Dividend AnalysisThe dividend increases have been sporadic at best:It's as if the management has no plan for the dividend but plays things by ears (or by balance sheet). Still, we've only seen increases, and no cuts to this point. This shows strength in dividend increases but no real reliability for dividend growth investors.As for dividend growth versus stock growth, we see dividend growth outpacing stock growth in terms of sporadic bursts:I have no doubt that MCK and its dividend trend have become uncoupled. Unfortunately, this removes one predicative tool from our arsenal. Using the dividend to predict stock growth speed will fail.Notably, the stock has taken a tumble, bursting along with the biotech bubble. The tumble might not have been justified - that depends on how much artificial price inflation you attribute to the bubble and how much growth you attribute to the fundamentals. In addition, we have buybacks, which have certainly raised the price of the stock to artificial levels - buybacks do not add any value to the company but simply reclaim shares.This buyback program was particularly successful:In October, MCK authorized a new $2B buyback program. I feel this money could have been better spent. In essence, the buyback program does nothing but raise the price of the stock with the side benefit of reducing dividend payouts.However, as you will see, dividend payouts are not a problem:This yield is so absurdly low that no dividend investor would ever take a second look. But if not pay a healthy dividend, what is MCK's plan. Are they positioning themselves as a growth stock, using the buybacks to inflate the price?Or perhaps they want to become a value stock without a dividend - a stock with a healthy balance sheet that does nothing but slowly grow? Few investors would be interested in such a stock, so taking this route is awkward. But the fundamentals certainly are looking well; revenue is back on the incline:The fundamental aspect I mentioned in the intro relates to income, which is steadily rising. The income has covered the dividend for a long time:This leads us to ask why the dividend has been kept so low? If the dividend only occupies 15% of MCK's income, why doesn't the company raise its dividend? This is a strange stock indeed:EPS has grown considerably, but the stock has reversed and the dividend has barely moved. Free cash flow has had its hard times but not so in recent times:A running average of the free cash flow gives a better estimate for the cash on hand and therefore MCK's ability to pay the growing dividend:Again, we see no problems here. MCK seems cash rich, yet they are seemingly unwilling to spend their free cash on anything but buybacks. Why not dividend increases?Closing ThoughtsIf not raise the dividend, just what has MCK done with its money? Considering they are firing nearly 2,000 employees, they certainly aren't using that cash to encourage their workforce. But they have recently acquired Rexall Health, a Canadian drug store.Whether Rexall was a good acquisition remains moot. The fact remains: MCK is attempting to expand with its acquisitions, including two oncology companies. The company's money is funneled into acquisitions and buybacks but not dividend hikes.The company could easily double the dividend twice without needing to raise debt. The question is why they've set their growth at such a low rate. It seems as though they care less about the investors than they do the insiders. When you look at the money funneled to management, you begin to see the bigger picture.MCK's CEO is the second-highest paid CEO. In light of the firing of 2,000 employees, this shows a possible distain for ""the little people,"" including you, the average investor. If you cannot afford to pay your employees, you probably cannot afford to pay your shareholders, either.Clearly, the buybacks were mostly at a premium, as the stock has dropped considerably even after the buyback program. MCK seems to be wasting its mountains of money on management, artificial stock inflation (possibly to help those in management with stock options), and on so-so acquisitions. Eventually this must come to an end, for better or for worse.Until that time, stay out of MCK… unless you're really hankering for a 0.7 % yield.Learn More about EarningsMy Exploiting Earnings premium subscription is now live, here on Seeking Alpha.

3963012,25120,2016-04-04T14:20:21-04:00,"McKesson is a healthcare distributor who is benefiting from long-term tailwinds and a strong market positioning.While the company has delivered on great growth and shareholder value, some headwinds are emerging.After shares have lost a third of their value from last year's highs, value is starting to emerge as structural tailwinds outweigh temporary issues.","McKesson (MCK) is a powerhouse in healthcare distribution. While the wider pharmaceutical and biotechnology space has come under pressure on the back of scrutiny regarding drug price increases, individual pricing decisions have a modest impact on McKesson which acts as a middleman in the industry.This means that McKesson makes its money from high volumes and value of the overall drugs being distributed throughout the system and does not rely on prices for individual drugs. While the public backlash can have real implications for individual drugs and their manufacturers, McKesson should benefit from increased usage of drugs over time.McKesson's BusinessMcKesson has been around for a long time, and while it is a very large business already it managed to aggressively expand its scale in recent years. The company benefited from solid organic growth as the US population is aging and drug development has been quite active. While McKesson is still very much a play on the US, it has pursued overseas expansion with the 2014 purchase of German-based Celesio.McKesson is of course mostly a distributor of drugs and related items. These products are distributed to independent pharmacy customers, purchase alliances, branded pharmacy retailers and healthcare providers, including hospitals.The company aims to distinguish itself from competition through a focus on specialty solutions, leading market scale and focus on technology. The latter should improve speed and accuracy of order fulfillment in order to drive customer service. These lower-margin distribution services generate over 98% of the annual revenues of $179 billion in the fiscal year of 2015. The technology solutions business, which is based on connectivity, supply chain solutions and patient care, generated little over $3 billion in sales last year.A Stellar Growth StoryMcKesson has grown its business at a very aggressive pace over the past decade. Revenues roughly doubled from $87 billion in the fiscal year of 2006 towards $179 billion in 2015. Part of this growth has been driven by dealmaking as the company has spent roughly $10-$15 billion in terms of acquisitions over the past decade. Most of these investments related to the $5 billion purchase of Celesio, a deal which added 22 billion euro in annual sales.While the actual revenue numbers are very high, margins are very low as McKesson is in essence a simple distributor. It acts as an intermediary between pharmaceutical producers and healthcare participants, including pharmacies. That being said, McKesson has benefited from an increase in scale and value-added offerings, trends which pushed gross margins up from 4.5-5.0% of sales in 2006 towards 6% by now. This allowed the company to increase its operating margins from 1.0-1.5% of sales towards 2% by now.The combination of revenue growth and margin improvements has allowed the company to triple its operating margins over this ten-year time period. Shareholders have furthermore benefited from the fact that the company has bought back a quarter of its outstanding shares over this time period, allowing earnings per share to increase by a factor of 4 times.This improved profitability has been well-reflected in the share price of McKesson. Shares rose from $50 in 2006 to peak at nearly $250 in early 2015. Ever since, shares have retreated quite a bit and now trade in their $150s, levels last seen by the end of 2013.It should be stated that while long-term capital appreciation remains very strong, investors receive relatively little in the form of a current payout. Even after the latest sell-off, the dividend yield comes in at just 0.7%.It seems that a too hot momentum run, increased scrutiny for the entire sector and slower growth (potentially a result of the increased scrutiny) have all been weighing on the shares. The question is if current levels start to offer appeal after investors lost a third of their value this past year.Exploring The Current Slowdown And ConcernsPart of the disappointing share price performance relates to the fear among investors about the implications of a changing political landscape. A potential reversal or adjustment to the Affordable Care Act could have big implications, while increased drug price scrutiny could have a similar impact.In my eyes, these are two temporary headwinds. Even if these trends could become more pronounced, McKesson will benefit from an increase in demand for drugs as societies are aging. With development being quite active, it is likely that producers will be able to cure more diseases in the future, resulting in additional demand for drugs. As McKesson is very diversified in terms of exposure towards individual drugs, and its producers, I only expect growth to slow down in an adverse scenario.Another concern is the rapid expansion strategy of Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA), not being a customer of McKesson. This pharmacy chain made a huge move to expand in Europe over the last couple of years with the acquisition of Boots. Last year, it made a similar move at home when it bought Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD). With Walgreens being a customer of AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC), McKesson might potentially lose a very valuable customer.Even if operational growth is slowing down, and/or McKesson might lose an important customer, the company has a few more levers to pull. This includes overseas expansion following the 2014 acquisition of Celesio. With the near half a billion acquisition of UDG Healthcare, the company is now gaining ground in the UK and Ireland as well, in its goal to set up a significant European base.The company has furthermore been quite active with regards to dealmaking at the start of the year. In February, McKesson spent a combined $1.2 billion in order to buy Vantage Oncology and Biologics, in line with its strategy to focus on specialty services in the field of Oncology. This deal was followed by the $2.2 billion purchase of Katz Group, a healthcare distributor in Canada.Despite these positive steps, shares remain down 20% so far in 2016. Part of these losses can be explained by the updated earnings guidance at the start of the calendar year. On January 11, McKesson revised its 2016 adjusted earnings guidance to $12.60-$12.90 per share, with modest growth projected for the fiscal year of 2017.While the 2016 guidance has only been narrowed from an original $12.50-$13.00 per share range, it seems that the negative market reaction relates largely to the softer earnings growth projected for 2017. This disappointing guidance relates large from weaker generic pricing and inflation trends, as negative trends could create negative risks towards this guidance.While the company remains on track to achieve this year's targets, it is important to realize that adjusted earnings are not equivalent to actual GAAP earnings. Amortization, LIFO inventory and acquisition-related charges are expected to hurt earnings by $2.30 to $2.40 per share. This implies that GAAP earnings are seen at roughly $10.40 per share.Appealing Valuation And Future Drivers Outweigh ConcernsAt $155 per share, the valuation seems very reasonable by all means. With $10.40 in GAAP earnings and $12.75 in non-GAAP earnings, shares now trade at 15 times GAAP earnings and 12 times adjusted earnings.The recent dealmaking has put some pressure on the balance sheet, although it remains healthy. McKesson ended the calendar year of 2015 with $3.4 billion in cash and equivalents and $8.7 billion in debt. This net debt load of $5.3 billion is equivalent to roughly 1.2 times trailing EBITDA of $4.5 billion. The trouble is that the 2016 deals are not being paid for yet. The three deals which are announced this year will increase the debt load by $3.4 billion towards $8.7 billion. This means that leverage is likely to come in around 1.8 times EBITDA after taking into account a modest profit contribution from the acquisitions.To tackle the very modest profit growth in the fiscal year of 2017, and the worsening operating conditions, McKesson already announced 1,600 job cuts, equivalent to 4% of the workforce. These costs savings, the gradual realization of synergies from Celesio and other deals, and continued growth of the overall market should aid earnings growth going forward. These drivers and the much more fair valuation should support the shares, even if the company faces some challenges as well."

Some have seen their market caps halved and others even worse than that. My philosophy is to invest in growth at a reasonable price (GARP) or value stocks. My previous articles have focused on companies like American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) (link here), United Rentals (NYSE:URI) (link here), and Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) (link here). Today, I will focus on a company that has been on my watch list for a very long time: McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK).OverviewMcKesson is a multinational conglomerate in the healthcare space. They have two primary businesses: Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions. Within distribution solutions, there are additional segments. For all intents and purposes, their distribution business provides pharmaceutical solutions to biotechnology companies, enhances technology, clinical support and business solutions to oncology and specialty practices.The technology solutions business helps deliver clinical, patient care, financial, supply chain and management software, connectivity, and outsourcing to healthcare organizations. Their value proposition in technology solutions is that they have a comprehensive suite of products. They help cut costs for many companies, which adds value for their customers.ManagementI like to look at management to see who is leading the company and what experience they have in the industry. Management is important because they drive results and ideally improve the operations of the business. Just look at Disney's (NYSE:DIS) CEO, Bob Iger, and Starbucks's (NASDAQ:SBUX) CEO, Howard Schultz, if you don't believe me. Where would those companies be without their stupendous leadership? Anyway, let's focus back on McKesson's management.John Hammergren: President, CEO, and ChairmanJames Beer: Executive VP and CFOPatrick Blake: Executive VP and Group PresidentOverall, management has a lot of experience between their top three officers. Most experience comes from the healthcare sector, which ought to bode well for the company going forward. I have no reason to doubt their abilities, especially considering McKesson's long-term performance.Proximate Causes For Sharp CorrectionGiven the recent international market conditions, companies with any overseas presence have seen their share prices decline. If you really want to see breathtaking moves, just look at some of the industrials with international exposure. These companies have gotten hammered because of currency fluctuations and overall business fundamentals have started to decline. Thankfully, for McKesson, the overall industry fundamentals are very strong, as demand for healthcare is booming. Unfortunately, for now, McKesson is lumped into this ""Multinational corporation with currency exposure"" cohort.2. Overall Market CorrectionAlthough the overall market decline was much worse just a scant two weeks ago, the S&P 500 is still off 5.5% from its highs. Since McKesson is in the S&P 500, you can probably imagine that they follow a similar trajectory. This has been the case, however, McKesson has been punished harder than the benchmark index. This underperformance can be attributed to my comments about McKesson being a multinational corporation.Conference CallThis is one of my favorite parts of the analysis. This is where management discusses the current quarter results, issues guidance, and answers questions about their business. With that being said, I generally look for certain keywords or phrases that exert bullishness or bearishness in the business.When asked on the call about their larger customers taking share versus their smaller customers, John Hammergren responded thusly, ""At least the base of independents that McKesson is involved and closely working with, we've seen good strength in that business, both in the growth of Health Mart stores but also in terms of their revenue growth."" He went on to lay out their strategy regarding all of their customers, ""The most important thing for us to do is to continue to focus on bringing our scale and our capabilities to the smaller customers to help them continue to level the playing field relative to the larger customers. And on the larger customer side, we have to find ways to add more value so that our margin impact isn't as negative as it can be when the mix changes."" From the statements made by their CEO, it seems as though they have plenty of opportunity and ways to enhance their relationships with their customers. McKesson appears to have a lot of their strategy figured out and that is why they are one of the leaders in their space.One way McKesson is enhancing their growth is by growing their Specialty Health business. When asked about the revenue growth outlook for this business he responded, ""We expected our Specialty business to grow above market levels. And I think not only did it grow above market levels, it grew more than we had expected. And I think our strength in particular in our community-based oncology business was very strong. Clearly, U.S. oncology continues to perform well. Albeit off of a slightly smaller base, our multi-specialty business is growing very rapidly as we create value-differentiating capabilities in that market.""It's always nice when a company's already high expectations are surpassed. Clearly, the demand for healthcare in North America and the rest of the world is increasing very quickly. In this day and age, it seems like a large number of people need to be treated for some disease or another, which is a nice tailwind for the healthcare industry. McKesson appears to be maximizing this opportunity as their North American Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services Business (which includes Specialty Health) revenues increases 16% on a constant currency basis. My conclusion is that Specialty Health is just one lever McKesson is pulling and that there will be even more levers they will continue to pull in order to enhance their growth.FundamentalsThere are a couple of metrics I like to analyze: the forward P/E ratio and the PEG ratio, and return on equity (ROE). The reason I like to look at these indicators is because they can easily be compared to their competitors and the S&P 500. In addition, I like to look at the future prospects because, ultimately, that is what I will be investing in: the future earnings and revenues of the company.Forward P/EMcKesson is valued at 14.6x forward twelve-month earnings. Let's compare this to AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC), which sells at 17.2x forward twelve-month earnings. Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) trades at 15.7x forward twelve-month earnings. None of these valuations are expensive, as all of these companies have corrected sharply from their highs. However, the question that needs to be answered is ""Why is McKesson's valuation below that of their competitors?"" To answer this, we will look at the PEG ratio.Now, let's compare McKesson to the S&P 500. The S&P 500 trades at around 19. This means that McKesson is trading at a 25% discount to the market. I do not see how this can continue. McKesson has a below average forward P/E and an above average growth profile. I don't see this trend continuing for long. I believe shares can trade up to 18x earnings over time.PEGI like to look at the PEG (Price to earnings to growth ratio) because it measures how the company sizes up against its anticipated growth rate. I like to see companies grow because they have a better chance for higher stock prices. Generally, a PEG below 1 means a stock is cheap. Between 1 and 2, means it is neither cheap nor expensive. In other words, it can go up and down without an issue. Above 2, means a stock is expensive.McKesson is expected to have a lot of growth over the coming years. According to analyst estimates, they are supposed to make $12.72 in FY 2016. Compare this to FY 2015, when they made $11.11. This is an anticipated growth rate of 14%. Going out to FY 2017, they are projected to make $14.43, which is an increase of 13% over FY 2016 estimates. So, let's take the most conservative growth rate of 13% and use the forward P/E multiple of 14.6. This gets us to a PEG of 1.1. Based on the criteria, McKesson is neither cheap nor expensive. Now, let's look at their competitors.AmerisourceBergen is expected to have growth as well. In FY 2015, they are expected to make $4.97. In FY 2016, they are projected to make $5.67. This is year-over-year growth of 14%. Using the 17.2x multiple we found above, we arrive at a PEG of 1.2, slightly higher than McKesson's. However, they have growth that exceeds McKesson's, which might warrant the disparity in PEG.Cardinal Health, like their competitors, are poised for growth over the coming years. In FY 2015, they earned $4.39. In FY 2016, they are anticipated to make $5.02, an increase of 14%. So, let's use the 15.7x multiple and the PEG is calculated to be 1.1, in line with McKesson.Based on the analysis, McKesson and Cardinal are the least expensive companies in the space. The healthcare industry is growing rapidly and all of these companies stand to benefit, to some degree.Source: CNBCReturn on Equity (ROE)Return on equity measures a corporation's profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested. So, let's get into the calculations.McKesson: 1476/8001 x 100% = 18.4%AmerisourceBergen: 276/1957 x 100%= 14.1%Cardinal Health: 1215/6256 x 100% = 19.4%McKesson is in the middle of the pack, with Cardinal Health being the leader in the group. However, despite being in the middle, an ROE of 18.4% is actually quite good and shows investors that the company is using their equity wisely.TechnicalsI like to use the technicals to determine what price is right to purchase a stock. The market tends to give discounts all the time and I try to utilize them as best I can in order to get the best cost basis. I usually don't like paying the market price unless the opportunity is truly that great. Let's see if the shares can go lower or if now is the right time to start buying.First, I look at the relative strength index (RSI) which measures whether a stock is overbought or oversold. An RSI above 70 means a stock is overbought. An RSI below 30 is oversold. At present, McKesson has an RSI of 45.44 making it neither overbought nor oversold. It is in the middle, meaning it can go either way without an issue. I also like to look at key support and resistance. The support levels are where I generally feel comfortable buying a stock. I normally don't like to see a lot of resistance because it means the stock has a harder road towards higher prices.MCK appears to have support at $178, $160, and $140. Resistance is at $200 (50-day moving average), $208, $219, and $235-$240. I don't really like the support levels because should MCK break below $178, it could quite possibly break down to $160. Resistance is manageable as there is still some upside before it gets up there. Over the long term, I believe MCK will power through resistance because of the strong fundamentals of their business. However, on a short-term basis, anything can happen. Given MCK's sharp decline, I don't see much downside, especially given its low valuation. Based on the chart below, MCK would be a tremendous buying opportunity at $178.Source: StockChartsOther FactorsBalance Sheet ObservationsMcKesson has a sizeable balance sheet. Cash has more than doubled from 2013, indicating strong business fundamentals as well as strong free cash flow generation. Everything else under the assets section was not particularly noteworthy. The company has a quick ratio that is just over 1, indicating the company has sufficient liquidity. Generally, I would like to see this ratio closer to 2, but I am not concerned by McKesson. On the liabilities side, the company has a substantial amount in accounts payable. Long-term debt of $8 billion is significant for a $44 billion company, but strong free cash flow generation ought to take care of that. Overall, the balance sheet is in fairly good shape and does not signal any red flags.Share RepurchasesWhile MCK did issue a share repurchase program of $500 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, their share count over the last three years has stayed pretty much flat. This indicates that management has chosen different alternatives to maximize shareholder value. In fact, they increased the dividend by 17% in their latest quarter. This signals confidence in their business, otherwise they wouldn't do it! Also, McKesson purchased the pharmaceutical distribution division of UDG Healthcare just one month ago. More information on this acquisition can be found here. Over the past several years, MCK has done a series of acquisitions, indicating that they prefer this method. The strategy has clearly worked as the company has had great long-term performance.ConclusionBased on my analysis, I found management to have a lot of experience in the industry. There is nothing to worry about there. In the last couple of months, there has been a sharp decline because of the company's international exposure and the overall market decline. McKesson has a modest forward P/E, solid PEG, and a solid ROE. Based on simple multiple expansion, I believe it can trade to 18x forward P/E. This would put the company's shares back near their highs. If you can get shares under $180, it would be a tremendous opportunity that would be unmatched. Their balance sheet is not worrisome in the slightest and their cash flow generation has been strong over the past several years. Overall, McKesson is a solid company with bright prospects. The healthcare industry is continuing to grow and McKesson is poised to capitalize on this trend."

In brief, McKesson delivers pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and healthcare information technology. The company operates in two segments. The Distribution Solutions segment distributes drugs, equipment and health and beauty care products, domestically and internationally. This segment provides pharmaceutical solutions for biotech and pharmaceutical manufacturers, and practice management, technology, clinical support and business solutions to oncology and other specialty practices operating in the community setting. The Technology Solutions segment includes McKesson Health Solutions, which includes clinical solutions, claims payment solutions and network performance tools. This segment delivers enterprise-wide clinical, patient care, financial, supply chain, strategic management software solutions, as well as connectivity, outsourcing and other services.Driving growth with acquisitions and partnershipsMcKesson recently acquired the pharmaceutical distribution division of UDG Healthcare plc (OTC:UDRGY) for €408 million in cash. This acquisition will add a leader in pharmaceutical distribution across the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland to McKesson's European business. Marc Owen, Chairman of the Management Board at Celesio AG (OTCPK:CAKFY), said: ""The acquisition of UDG's pharmaceutical distribution, home and travel healthcare businesses in Ireland and the U.K., will strengthen our position in the industry. We have made this investment as part of our growth strategy, which leverages the positive trajectory of the wider healthcare sector in Europe. This acquisition will also complement our broader portfolio of assets in both Ireland and the U.K. We look forward to continuing UDG's tradition of excellent customer service and to working with the UDG team.""This acquisition is in addition to the recent announcement that MCK also acquired 281 pharmacies operated by Sainsbury's (OTCQX:JSAIY) in the U.K. These two acquisitions, once fully integrated will boost both top and bottom line, while geographically expanding its footprint across the Europe, particularly in Ireland and the U.K. The company expects the transaction to add approximately 10-14 cents to EPS in 2016, while having more of a positive impact in subsequent years.McKesson also announced the signing of a five-year distribution agreement with Albertsons to include the sourcing and distribution of both branded and generic pharmaceuticals, commencing on April 1, 2016. As part of the agreement, Albertsons' network of nearly 1,700 pharmacies in their 2,200 stores across the country will benefit from the scale and strength of McKesson's proprietary OneStop® generics program and efficiency of McKesson's daily direct-to-store service model for pharmaceutical products. This distribution agreement between McKesson and Albertsons will extend through April 2021. Taken together, McKesson is growing its business organically and via strategic acquisitions and partnerships to drive shareholder value and growth now and into the future.Growing healthcare and prescription drug forecasts as a catalyst for McKesson:According to the Centers for Medical and Medicaid Services, medical expenditures are projected to grow at an average rate of 5.8% per year through 2024. This translates into 1.1% faster than GDP growth throughout this time period. Healthcare expenditure as a percentage of GDP is expected to rise from 17.4% in 2013 to 19.6% by 2024. Healthcare spending is projected to have grown 5.5% in 2014, significantly outpacing economic growth. The greater spending on overall healthcare is mainly attributable to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) health insurance coverage and rapid growth in prescription drug spending. As a result of ACA, the domestically insured is projected to have increased from 86% in 2013 to 89% in 2014 as 8.4 million individuals are projected to have gained coverage. Post 2014, national health spending is projected to grow at a 5.3% clip in 2015 and peak at 6.3% in 2020.Given these projections, this scenario bodes well for the overall healthcare sector as more individuals have access to health coverage and prescription drugs. Specifically regarding McKesson and prescription drug expenditures, this area is projected to have grown 12.6 percent in 2014 to $305.1 billion. Driving this growth were new specialty drugs and increased prescription drug use among people who were newly insured. Prescription drug spending growth is projected to average 6.3% annual growth from 2015 through 2024. Taken together, as the biotechnology sector continues its innovation and continuous supply of medications to treat and cure many different diseases coupled with the growth in overall medical spending may present an investment opportunity for companies that provide prescription drugs and pharmacy benefits.Growing revenues combined with dividends and share buybacks to drive shareholder valueMcKesson has grown its revenues greater than 46% over a 3-year period from Q1 2013 through Q1 2015. During this 3-year time frame, McKesson grew revenues from $122.196 billion in 2013 to $179.045 billion in 2015. From 2014 to 2015, revenue grew by a 30% clip, while operating profit grew at a greater than 20% clip (Figure 1). Through the first six months of this year, revenue has grown at 9% compared to the first six months of 2014 and in addition to a nearly double-digit growth in revenue, net income increased by 43% (Figure 2).Figure 1 - Financials covering 2013 through 2015Figure 2 - Financials covering the first half of 2015 compared to the first half of 2014In addition to growing revenues and profits, McKesson offers a backdrop of dividend payouts along with a share repurchase program. The company has increased its quarterly dividend payout by nearly 360% over the past 10 years from $0.06 to $0.28 per quarter. This translates into a 0.55% yield based on its current price. McKesson currently has a new share repurchase program that was approved and earmarked $500 million to buyback and retire shares. This would allow the company to remove over 2.4 million shares from the open market or 1% of outstanding shares. Although the repurchase program is not very aggressive, capital is being deployed in a variety of ways via acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases to reward shareholders.Stock performance outpaces the Dow Jones by a wide margin:Over the past 5 years, McKesson has outperformed the Dow Jones by 170% on a cumulative basis; this 4-fold outperformance is depicted below (Figure 3). Considering all the future catalysts for the company, I strongly feel the stock will continue to outperform the market by a wide margin.Figure 3 - Google Finance charts - Performance comparison of McKesson and the Dow Jones over the previous 5-year time period.Fundamental valuationMcKesson is currently priced at ~$199 and, as per Fidelity, it sports a P/E ratio of 24, which is the price per share divided by the trailing 12-month earnings per share. The P/E is currently in line with industry peers, CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) and Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH). When factoring in future growth via the PEG ratio ((P/E)/(Future Annual EPS Growth), the stock boasts a PEG of 1.63. This value indicates that investors are paying a premium of 1.63 for future growth. As a general rule of thumb, a PEG greater than 2 may indicate that the stock is overvalued.The PEG ratio is based on a 5-year outlook. Since the PEG is currently at 1.63 and it's calculated by ((P/E)/Future Annual EPS Growth), we can back-calculate the growth rate.1.63 = (24/x)x = (24)/(1.63)x = 14.714.7% annualized EPS growthAs per Google Finance, McKesson has posted 12-month trailing EPS of $8.26; thus, at an annual growth rate of 14.7%, EPS will likely be $16.40 in 5 years. At $16.40, assuming a relatively comparable P/E ratio of 22 in the future, we can calculate the future share price.22 = x/$16.40x = (22)($16.40)x = $360 per shareThese calculations do not factor in reinvested dividends or the impact of share buybacks. Combining the dividends and share buybacks, I predict McKesson will boast a share price north of $350 and for a 75% upside or 15% annual return over the next 5 years.Taken together, McKesson is attractive at these levels over a long-term horizon. I believe that the 14.7% EPS growth rate is reasonable, considering the most-recent 3-year growth rate was greater than 10%. Additionally, the 12-month target price determined by Yahoo! Finance is currently at $258 per share. There is plenty of upside in this stock over the long term. With the latest acquisitions and partnerships, the share price deduced from my exercise above appears to be somewhat aggressive. I would feel comfortable with a 5-year stock price outlook in the range of the low-to-mid $300 level.SummaryMcKesson is well-positioned for future growth and success in the growing healthcare space. The company has been highly acquisitive, growing dividends over time and buying back its shares to drive shareholder value. Major acquisitions and partnerships via UDG Healthcare plc, Sainsbury's pharmacies and Albertsons position McKesson to continue its strong performance and competitiveness in the marketplace. The company does not shy away from deploying capital to acquire other assets to drive growth in the future. In addition to its acquisitive mindset, the company also offers the backdrop of dividends and share repurchases to add value to shareholders. McKesson appears to be slightly undervalued based on its growth and future earnings as measured by its PEG ratio.Disclosure:The author currently holds shares of MCK and the author is long MCK.

The stock responded unfavorably and is now price at $183 per share. I feel that McKesson presents a compelling investment opportunity in the healthcare space, further emboldened after the perpetual sell-off from $243 to $180 per share since this summer. Earnings have been layered in throughout this downward movement that presented great earnings reports, increased dividends and additional share buybacks. McKesson continues to become cheaper and cheaper as each earnings report generates greater earnings per share while the company continues to repurchase its own shares. McKesson looks to be undervalued given its growth rate, recent acquisitions, low P/E, dividend and share repurchase program. I previously wrote an article outlining my long-term buy for McKesson (Mckesson An Often Overlooked Opportunity In The Healthcare Space) and since then the stock has become cheaper in terms of P/E and PEG ratios. McKesson is attractive below $190 per share based on the aforementioned quality attributes.Impressive quarterly results yielded lackluster stock movementFor its recent quarterly results, McKesson reported revenue of $58.8 billion. This equates to a 10% increase from the prior fiscal year quarter. Double-digit growth is impressive given the maturity of this company. In additional to this impressive revenue growth, EPS increased 19%, while cash and cash equivalents registered $5.2 billion. In addition to these impressive numbers, the company initiated a $2 billion share buyback program after its most recent $500 million share buyback program. And if that was not enough, the company raised guidance from $12.36-$12.86 to $12.50-$13.00 per share. All of these quality attributes bode well for investors and now McKesson has a trailing 12 month EPS of $8.86 and with a current price of $183 this translates into a P/E of 20.65. This is an attractive P/E given its shareholder friendly capital return plan driven by dividends and share buybacks along with its growth.McKesson is driving growth via acquisitions and partnershipsMCK recently acquired the pharmaceutical distribution division of UDG Healthcare plc.

During this 3-year time frame, MCK grew revenues from $122.196 billion in 2013 to $179.045 billion in 2015. From 2014 to 2015, revenue grew by a 30% clip while operating profit grew at a greater than 20% clip (Figure 1). Through the six months ending September 30th, revenue has grown at 10% compared to the corresponding six months of 2014 and in addition to a nearly double-digit growth in revenue, net income increased by 37% (Figure 2). Figure 1 - Financials covering 2013 through 2015 Figure 2 - Financials covering the first half of 2015 compared to the first half of 2014In addition to growing revenues and profits, MCK offers a backdrop of dividend payouts along with a share repurchase program. MCK has increased its quarterly dividend payout by nearly 360% over the past ten years from $0.06 to $0.28 per quarter. This translates into a 0.60% yield based on its current price (Figure 3). Figure 3 - Dividend history of MCK from 2006 through 2015MCK currently has a new share repurchase program that was approved and earmarked $2 billion to repurchase and retire shares. This would allow the company to remove over 11 million shares from the open market or 4.5% of outstanding shares. This newly approved share repurchase program is very aggressive and a great way to return capital to shareholders while the price is suppressed. Collectively, capital is being deployed in a variety of ways via acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases to reward shareholders.Stock PerformanceOver the past five years, MCK has outperformed the Dow Jones by 117% on the cumulative basis and this 3-fold out-performance is depicted below (Figure 4). Considering all the future catalysts for MCK moving into the future, I strongly feel that the stock will continue to outperform the market by a wide margin and considering the recent downward decline presents an opportunity. Figure 4 - Google Finance performance between MCK and the Dow Jones over the previous 10-year time periodSummaryMCK is well-positioned for future growth and success in the healthcare arena. MCK has been highly acquisitive, growing dividends over time and buying back its shares to drive shareholder value (this is especially true with its recent $2 billion share repurchase program). Its major acquisitions and partnerships via UDG Healthcare plc, Sainsbury's pharmacies and Albertsons position MCK to continue its strong performance and competitiveness in the healthcare sector. The company employs a shareholder friendly capital return plan while acquiring other assets to drive growth into the future. In addition to their acquisition style, MCK also offers the backdrop of dividends and an aggressive share repurchase program to add value to shareholders. On a technical basis, MCK appears to be undervalued based on its growth and future earnings as measured by its P/E and PEG ratios.Disclosure: The author currently holds shares of MCK and the author is long MCK.

I actually had Celesio on my target list before McKesson acquired the company, and now I'm very curious to see how the consolidated entity is doing.Strong and stable profits and cash flows are the only things I needThe company's revenue increased to $47.6B in the second quarter of the current financial year, and this resulted in an operating income of $931M, which is an operating margin of 1.96%. As you correctly notice, McKesson is operating in a large-volume, low-margin business. After deducting the interest expenses and a tax payment to the tune of in excess of a quarter of a billion dollars, the net income attributable to McKesson was $576M, or $2.49 per share (including a $0.04 loss from discontinued operations).Source: Financial StatementsOn an annualized basis, McKesson is trading at approximately 19 times its net profit, and that's usually enough to turn me off. However, I remembered from when I was researching Celesio that these companies usually have a very robust free cash flow as well. And that's what really matters for me. I don't necessarily care about accounting profits, but am very interested to find out how much cash a company is able to generate. I'd prefer a company with a net loss, but with a strong positive free cash flow any minute of the day!Source: Financial StatementsThe total amount of cash provided by operating activities was $454M, but there were some huge changes in the company's working capital position, and I need to isolate those to make sure I get a good impression of the normalized situation. Excluding the working capital changes and the $205M tax addition, McKesson's adjusted operating cash flow was approximately $750M. The total capex for the quarter was $120M, and this means the company generated $630M in free cash flow, and that's approximately $2.68 per share or 6% higher than the net profit.A solid balance sheet also helps to win me overWhen you're operating a large-volume and low-margin business, you will need a lot of working capital to keep things going. That's the main reason why McKesson has almost $40B in current assets, of which almost 40% are inventories. The $15B inventory level sounds like a lot, but it's, in fact, less than one month of doing business, based on the $47B+ revenue in the second quarter of this year.Source: Financial StatementsThe working capital is a positive $4B, and with in excess of $5.5B in cash, McKesson seems to be ready for any surprises. There's also a little bit (well, relatively seen) of long-term debt ($8.14B). Keep in mind, the Q4 quarterly report will move a part of the long-term debt to the ""current liabilities"" tab, as approximately $402M in euro-denominated bonds will be due in October 2016.So, McKesson is generating roughly $2.5B in free cash flow per year, but is only spending $240M per year on dividend payments, leaving approximately $2.3B in free cash flow on the table. A part of this will be used to strengthen the balance sheet, but once the Celesio acquisition is fully integrated in the McKesson structure, I think the company could potentially announce another sizeable share buyback.If McKesson would spend just $1B per year on a buyback, it would be able to buy and cancel 5 million shares per year, reducing the share count by in excess of 2% per year, and boosting the results per share. And $1B per year is indeed a lot of money, but taking all other things into consideration, McKesson would still be able to add in excess of $1B per year to its balance sheet, which could be used to reduce its net debt as well as to acquire new businesses that fit in the company's profile.Investment thesisMcKesson isn't expensive right now, as the expected free cash flow per share is approximately $10.75. Based on the current share price, this means the company is trading at a free cash flow yield of 5.5%. That's pretty good, but these results could be even more impressive in 2 years from now; assuming a 1.5% per annum growth in the free cash flow and a reduction in outstanding shares of 5M shares per year, the FCF/share could be boosted to $11.55/share for a free cash flow yield of 5.9%.It's a pity I hadn't done this research before the August 24th flash crash, as I would have loved to pick up some shares at $175 for a forward free cash flow yield of 6.6%. It could be a strategy to write a put option on McKesson, but I would like to see a slightly higher option premium for the put 175's maturing in February of next year."
3039236,85436,2015-03-30T14:36:50-04:00,"McKesson Corporation (MCK) offers services that help healthcare providers and payers increase profits and productivity while better serving the patient.Their recent merger with Celesio Group significantly expanded the company's footprint.McKesson's Technology Services segment offers electronic document management solutions that will prove to be essential in the post-reform, value added healthcare industry.","One of the nation's oldest and largest healthcare services company, McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) aims to improve the costly and convoluted healthcare industry by fostering transparency and efficiency among payers, providers, and patients. The company consists of two core segments: distribution services and technological solutions. The larger of the two segments, McKesson's Distribution Services, acts as an ""intelligent supply chain"" that delivers pharmaceuticals, health care products, and technology and medical supplies to retail pharmacies and care facilities worldwide. McKesson's Technology Solutions benefits payers and providers with software, services, and consultation to promote transparency, connectivity, and simplicity in a regulation laden post-reform environment. The company's leading market position allows McKesson to capture benefits from macro factors in the evolving healthcare industry.On February 5th, the company reported a Q3 2015 EPS of $2.89, beating estimates by $0.28. Earnings growth was driven by a 36.9% increase in revenue over the prior year period. Specifically, McKesson's Distributions Solutions segment, which contributed to 96.7% of revenue, saw a 38% increase in revenue.McKesson is currently the fourth largest pharmacy network, delivering 1/3 of all pharmaceuticals used each day in North America. McKesson's leading market position in generic pharmaceutical Distribution Services positions the company to profit from the increasing production and distribution of specialty drugs. To enhance their specialty drug segment, McKesson partnered with US Oncology, a network of community oncologists, to provide the physicians' independent practices with clinical, research, technological, and business solutions. Through this partnership and others, McKesson currently answers to 20% of all cancer drug demand. The market for oncology treatments alone may be worth $100 billion or more in a year and McKesson's partnerships will allow the company to grasp a large portion of that market.Although McKesson's Distribution Segment reported strong revenue, the segment's Q3 2015 margins were diluted by a 90% uptick in operating expenses over the prior year period. McKesson's acquisition of Celesio was responsible for 58% of the 61% increase in expenses. Since McKesson gained full operating control of Celesio on December 31st, these expenses are expected to fall off of their income statement and, going forward, the combined company can work towards realizing $275 to 325 million in operational synergies over the next four years. The acquisition awards McKesson with a global footprint so that it now operates in over 20 countries. In the same financial quarter, international pharmaceutical distribution revenues were $7.3 billion due to Celesio's underlying revenue.McKesson's Technology Solutions segment underperformed the Distribution Segment with a 7% decline in revenue growth over the prior year period. The contraction in revenue is attributed to realignment and divestment within the segment. But, in light of recent regulations, McKesson's efficient network management solutions have a strong potential for profitability in the evolving healthcare industry. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, signed by President Obama in 2009, incentivizes healthcare providers to ""meaningfully use"" electronic medical records in their practice and penalizes those providers that don't. Launched in 2011, McKesson's Horizon Patient Folder is a document management software that collects and organizes patient's electronic medical records. This and other technological solutions created by McKesson are now poised to handle growing business in a post-reform, value added healthcare industry. Already, 52% of all US hospitals and 96% of private health plans utilize McKesson's technology services and software.Over the past six years, McKesson has reported 14% CAGR in revenue and 16% CAGR in earnings per share growth. The company has produced notable and consistent growth in the past and, given macro trends in the healthcare industry, now has the opportunity to deliver more profits. As the United States' population ages and hospitals look to shrink their margins, McKesson's services will become increasingly necessary. Due to their strong most recent financial reports, the company upgraded its fiscal 2015 outlook, projecting an EPS of $10.80 to $10.95, up from $10.50 to $10.90. As new regulations look to purge inefficient healthcare companies, McKesson's services will be invaluable to companies looking to increase both the patient's value and profits."

Which 20 trades were the best trades of the day, and how do we decide the answer to that question? Today, we answer those questions for bonds with maturities of 1 year or more. The answers to these questions are particularly important given the well-known inability of legacy credit ratings to match the accuracy of quantitative methods used in this series of notes. We ignore legacy ratings in this analysis for that reason.Conclusion: The 20 best-value non-call senior fixed rate bond trades with maturities of 1 year or more on February 4, 2015 were issued by these firms:MCKESSON CORPORATION (NYSE:MCK)GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC.

We used the same criterion for ""best"" that we have used in recent analyses of bonds issued by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), AIG (NYSE:AIG), AT&T (NYSE:T) and IBM (NYSE:IBM). That criterion is the reward to risk ratio, calculated as the ratio of credit spread to matched-maturity default probability. The default probabilities used are described in detail in the daily default probability analysis posted by Kamakura Corporation. Both the credit spreads and default probabilities are reported as percent figures. The full text of the Dodd-Frank legislation as it concerns the definition of ""investment grade"" is summarized at the end of our analysis of Citigroup (NYSE:C) bonds published on December 9, 2013.The distribution of credit spreads is given in this histogram:The median credit spread was 1.147%, and the average credit spread was 1.791%.The distribution of the credit spread to default probability ratio is given in this histogram:The median credit spread to default probability ratio was 10.852 and the average was 19.238. Note that the average is skewed by the very high credit spread to default probability ratios of the best credits. Note also that only ratios of 40 or below are plotted on the graph.Here are the ranking results, listed from best to worst, with the McKesson Corporation 3.25% bonds due March 1, 2016 the winner at a ratio of over 400 times.AppendixCUSIPsMany investors have requested that we provide CUSIPs as part of this chart. Redistribution of CUSIPs is currently illegal under Kamakura Corporation's contract with the data vendor. We are working hard to change this so that we may make CUSIPs available in the future. This article neatly summarizes which institutions have restricted availability of CUSIPs in order to maximize their profits as a monopoly supplier of the data. Thanks to FINRA, the CUSIPs have been put into the public domain for free via this FINRA-affiliated website.Background on the CalculationsAssuming the recovery rate in the event of default would be the same on all bond issues, a sophisticated investor who has moved beyond legacy ratings seeks to maximize revenue per basis point of default risk from each incremental investment, subject to risk limits on macro-factor exposure on a fully default-adjusted basis.Maximizing the ratio of credit spread to matched-maturity default probabilities requires that default probabilities be available at a wide range of maturities. We used the default probabilities supplied by Kamakura Corporation's KRIS default probability service, interpolated to a matched-maturity basis to the exact day of bond maturity. For maturities longer than ten years, we assume that the ten-year default probability is a good estimate of default risk.Bond yields are secured from TRACE. The National Association of Securities Dealers launched the TRACE (Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine) system in July 2002 in order to increase price transparency in the U.S. corporate debt market. The system captures information on secondary market transactions in publicly-traded securities (investment grade, high yield and convertible corporate debt) representing all over-the-counter market activity in these bonds.We used the trade-weighted average yield reported by TRACE for each of the bond issues analyzed. We calculated the credit spread using the matched-maturity yield on U.S. Treasury bonds, interpolated from the Federal Reserve H15 statistical release for the trade date. The source of the information on the H15 release is the U.S. Department of Treasury.Forward-Looking Best Value Bond SelectionToday's analysis looks back at yesterday's trades. A forward-looking bond selection based on today's prices at this instant is done in the same way, with slight differences in the data sources.Author's NoteRegular readers of these notes are aware that we generally do not list the major news headlines relevant to the firms in question. We believe that other authors on Seeking Alpha, at The New York Times, The Financial Times, and The Wall Street Journal do a fine job of this. Our omission of those headlines is intentional. Similarly, to argue that a specific news event is more important than all other news events in the outlook for the firm is something we again believe is inappropriate for this author. Our focus is on current bond prices, credit spreads, and default probabilities, key statistics that we feel are critical for both fixed income and equity investors.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The company operates in two main segments: distribution solutions and technology solutions. The distribution segment delivers drugs, medical-surgical supplies, equipment and health and beauty care products throughout North America. While on the other hand the technology segment delivers enterprise clinical, patient care, financial, supply chain and strategic management software solutions within the US and Canada. In February 2014 the company acquired PSS World Medical Inc.In the highly volatile pharmaceutical market, does MCK offer stability and growth for investors?The 5 year company price to volume is encouraging for investors as the strong positive trend shows the company's continuing ability to grow the share price over 20% YTD and 120% over the past two years. In addition, the company dividends have grown 100% from 2010 to 2014. According to Isaac Newton, what goes up must come down. Will McKesson continue to appreciate or will the long awaited pullback finally occur?Vuru has mixed ratings on MCK. Based on a discounted cash flow analysis, share price is current overvalued by 21.81%, and adjusting share price for capital expenditures also puts the share price well below its current level. The factors contributing positively to Vuru's overall grade include strong dividend trends and share buybacks as well as strong management in the company.Investment RationaleFirstly, international expansion presents the opportunity for MCK to expand its top line. While the company does dominate in Canada and the US, as they are the leading pharmaceutical distributor in these markets, their presence in other geographic locations is lacking. To help boost their exposure in international markets, the company acquired Celesio, an international pharmacy distributor who supplies logistics and services to the same sector as MCK in the Latin American and European markets. This acquisition will create the opportunity for the company to expand margins in markets that have previously been lacking and adds 20B in top line revenue for the company.Secondly, the company's strong free cash flow position will allow them continue funding growth opportunities, capital expenditures and acquisition such as the one of Celesio. This trend has continued over the past 10 years and should be expected for the foreseeable future. 2014 free cash was 2.72B or up 30.85% y/y.Finally, the company's buyback and dividend trend has been attractive to investors. For the past 7 years the company has averaged a share repurchase of 4.5% per year. Expect this trend to continue into the next fiscal year.Divesture RationaleMcKesson has had strong positive trends and appreciation in the past 5 years and any pullback in the economy and in the markets could lead frightened investors to lock in their gains. With MCK's P/E multiple is at it's highest level in 10 years (36), it could be easy for investors to warrant a sell off to realize their gains.As well, the industry that MCK competes in is highly competitive. Its very easy for creative destruction to take a company's leading product off the market because of an innovation from a competitor. Expect the net profit margin to stay relatively low in the near future. Only $0.88 of every $100 of revenue has been profit, on average over the past 10 years.Lastly, the company's balance sheet continues to pose problems. The company's current ratio and TL-to-TA (Total Liabilities to Total Assets) have been on the decline over the past 10 years. Expect theses issues to be on the forefront of management's to do list for the rest of this year and the beginning of the next fiscal year.Bottom LineMCK has delivered strong EPS growth, 16%, on average over the last 3 years, but now could be the time for investors to lock in their gains. With the turmoil in the markets as of late, expect MCK to have a medium to large pullback in the coming months but gains in the long-term from strategic acquisitions."
3046946,72675,2015-04-02T02:55:06-04:00,Improved source pricing from generic manufacturers will benefit operating performance.Further upside exists given performance gap vis-à-vis AmerisourceBergen.Celesio’s European underperformance to prompt MCK to repurchase remaining Celesio shares (at a discount).,"Vertical and horizontal consolidationThe US healthcare distributor market is currently dominated by three major players with a combined market share of more than 85%: McKesson (NYSE:MCK), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) and Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH). Recently, we have seen both vertical and horizontal consolidation among healthcare distributors which are expanding their reach in order to increase buying power. McKesson is a good example of such trend: The combination of market reach from McKesson, Rite Aid and Celesio (leading pharmaceutical distributor and retailer in Europe) is providing McKesson with strong leverage in negotiating improved source pricing from generic manufacturers:§ In January 2014, McKesson acquired Celesio expecting to realize annual synergies of between $275m and $325m.§ In February 2014, McKesson expanded its distribution agreement with Rite Aid (a 5-year agreement through March 2019) adding approximately $5.5b in generic revenue and 250m generic scripts to MCK's OneStop Generics program.§ In November 2014, the company expanded its distribution agreement with Omnicare (5-year agreement through December 2019) whereby Omnicare volumes will decrease McKesson's sourcing costs.Stock performance, valuation and near-term upside§ MCK has performed in line with Cardinal Health, one of the other two major wholesalers (up approximately 20%) in the last year, but it has recently lost ground to ABC which has outperformed as it is starting to take advantage of its strategic relationship with Walgreens Boots (NASDAQ:WBA) (signed in March 2013). AmerisourceBergen is currently benefitting from purchasing through the WAG-AB consortium. MCK, however, seems to be better diversified internationally (post-Celesio acquisition) and thanks to its several sourcing partnerships, profit expectations remain high - the performance gap ABC/MCK should gradually diminish.§ Valuation multiples (EV/EBITDA, PE) for all three national distributors (AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson) are at multi-year highs as the generic sourcing agreements, favorable demand environment, and brand and generic product launches have vastly improved the prospects for the industry.§ Celesio is about to delist its shares. The delisting is likely to be a near-term positive for McKesson as it attempts to acquire the remaining Celesio shares which could be bought at a discount due to their illiquidity.Generics to help the stock§ Generic drug inflation is currently helping wholesalers. Such wave of inflation is expected to last for 2 additional years (RBC Estimates). Generic drug price inflation and a steady stream of new generic products in the pipeline create durable tailwinds for the industry. In addition, generic drugs sourcing agreements should decrease cost of goods for the distributors leading to stock price appreciation.§ The company's generic sourcing strategy (fuelled by the Celesio acquisition and the partnership with Rite Aid) is not new as it comes on the wave kicked off by AmerisourceBergen's relationship with Walgreens/Alliance Boots in March of 2013.§ The equity story of the ""big three"" distributors combines generic sourcing, European efficiency/expansion (for McKesson following the acquisition of Celesio), specialty pharmacy services, medical/surgical supply chain and information technology.Other positives§ The HCIT business is strategically well positioned: it has a strategically strong footprint across both payer and provider markets and is well positioned in high value market segments such as the connectivity and analytics markets.§ McKesson distribution business is likely to benefit from the Affordable Care Act and an improving economy in the US which is driving higher rates of utilization.§ Continued M&A in healthcare (Optum Rx / Catamaran) is driving valuation higher, particularly for companies that are integral part of the US supply chain."
2982866,63483,2015-03-08T06:54:51-04:00,"McKesson’s acquisition of Celesio will solidify the company position in Europe, despite FX headwinds.Gradually decreasing US concentration will provide a slight boost to long-term growth, however intense competition will prevent margin expansion.Continued new offerings strengthen the company’s value proposition to its customers.Demand for McKesson’s products will be resilient in the long-term due to favourable demographic trends.DCF model indicates that the company is slightly undervalued, even with conservative assumptions.","McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) is one of the largest pharmaceutical distributors within the U.S. The company operates in two segments - distribution solutions, which accounts for 98% of the sales and technology solutions, which accounts for the remaining 2%.Celesio AG acquisition will solidify company's position within EuropeLast year, the company acquired 77.6% of Celesio AG's stock - a company based in Europe which is one of the leading international wholesale & retail companies and provider of logistics and services to the pharmaceutical sector. Celesio operates in 14 countries around the world, principally within the Euro region (UK, France, Germany). It serves over 2 million customers at 2,200 pharmacies of its own and over 4,000 participants in brand partnership schemes. Its wholesale branch counts numbers at over a hundred, catering to 65,000 pharmacies and hospitals with 130,000 pharmaceutical products. Their services benefit approximately 15 million people daily. In 2013, Celesio recorded approximately $20b in revenues, which gives the combined company approximately $180b in revenues, given's McKesson current revenue base and its impressive growth rate in FY14. As a result of the acquisition, McKesson has further solidified its position within Europe. However, due to the recent strength of the dollar, the company might suffer a slight FX headwind, but in the long-term, I expect the company to continue doing very well. The combined company is now one of the largest, if not the largest wholesale and distributor of pharmaceutical products. Furthermore, it has an extremely strong brand, which can be inferred from the sustained demand for its products and services, evident from its increasing revenues in recent years.Gradually decreasing US concentration will provide a slight boost to long-term growth, though intense competition will prevent margin expansionMcKesson has slowly been reducing its dependence on the U.S. market, a move I think is correct for the company, given the maturity of the U.S. markets which leads to very low, albeit stable growth rates. Foreign operations accounted for 11%, 8.2% and 8.4% of 2014, 2013 and 2012 revenues for the company, signifying that the McKesson has been shifting its focus to the international market. The company's acquisition of Celesio AG, a European company just goes to show that it is serious in expanding its international presence, which in the near-term would offer a slight tailwind to revenue growth rates.The company operates within a highly competitive environment, with strong competition from rivals such as AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health. However, in terms of size, McKesson is still the winner. AmerisourceBergen recorded $120b in revenues in 2014, while Cardinal Health recorded $91b in revenues in the same period. McKesson is on track to record $180b in revenues in 2015, given its YTD performance. Given the large size of its competitors, and little differentiation between the competition's products, I do not expect McKesson to be able to gain any material market share. However, because of its strong competitive position, evident from its revenue base, I foresee that the company would be able to maintain its current margins going into the future.Continued new offerings strengthen the company's value proposition to customersLast December, the company launched LoyaltyScript@Retail to provide pharmacists with timely and convenient means of providing patient savings and enhanced care at the point of dispensing. The initiative provides pharmacists with easy, in-store, online access to co-pay savings offers for a growing list of medications across a range of therapeutic classes, including diabetes, hypertension, respiratory, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal diseases. The initial roll-out of the initiative will be at more than 10,000 pharmacies, with the number of participating pharmacies expected to double in early 2015. This initiative provides a strong value-add to McKesson customers, as patients increasingly want to learn more about their medication from their pharmacist. A recent McKesson research report revealed that 71% of patients are more likely to fill their prescription if their pharmacist provided medical savings cards or coupons, which is exactly what this initiative provides. This is just but one example of the company continuing to keep an eye out for customer needs and preferences which will further improve customer loyalty, enabling the company to maintain its current revenue base without much difficulty.Demand for McKesson's products will be resilient in the long-term due to favourable demographic trendsAs detailed above, although McKesson has been shifting its sights to the international market in past years, the company still derives a large portion of its revenues (89%) from the U.S. The U.S. population is aging rapidly - something that is known to many for a very long time now. According to the US Census Bureau, it estimated that the aging population in 2012 was 43.1 million and expects this number to almost double to 83.7 million in 2050. As people age, their need and demand for pharmaceutical products will no doubt increase. Given McKesson's strong competitive position and size, I have little doubt that the company will be able to capitalize on this long-term trend.As seen in the DCF model above, revenue projections for the company in FY15 is $180b, considering that YTD it has already produced $135b in revenues, the large increase in revenues primarily due to the Celesio AG acquisition. The company revenues is expected to grow at 5% in FY15, an extremely conservative estimate to say the least, stabilizing at 3.5% in FY19, which is above the long-term growth rate of the US economy, due to the company's shift to slightly higher-growth international markets. Due to its strong competitive position and relative size to peers, I expect McKesson to be able to maintain its EBITDA margins at 2.3%. The company currently trades at a EV/LTM EBITDA of 15.4x. Using this figure as the 5-year exit multiple, along with an 8% discount rate, the model produces a fair value of $253 for McKesson, which indicates that the company is undervalued by approximately 10%. My outlook for McKesson is hence bullish."

They are McKesson Corp. (NYSE:MCK) and AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC).Both companies are key players in the drug wholesale industry.

When used together, these unique ratios generate a quantitative picture of a company's underlying fundamentals, taking into account both strengths and weaknesses.The ""2014 Mycroft Free Cash Flow per share"" estimate in the table above was generated by taking the trailing twelve months (NYSE:TTM) free cash flow result for both companies and then adding my Mycroft Michaelis Growth Rate into the equation in order to generate forward looking estimates for 2014. That growth rate is generated by using my FROIC ratio (Free Cash Flow Return on Invested Capital). Basically FROIC tells us how efficient operations are as it identifies how much free cash flow is generated for every $1 of total capital employed.AmerisourceBergen has a FROIC of 30%, which means that for every $100 of invested capital, they generate $30 in free cash flow.McKesson has a FROIC of 32%, which means that for every $100 of invested capital, they generate $32 in free cash flow.Now my Mycroft/Michaelis Ratio takes that FROIC result for each company and multiplies it by the firm's free cash flow reinvestment rate. The reinvestment rate that I use is a free cash flow reinvestment rate instead of the standard one used by analysts that simply uses net income. It is calculated as follows:Free Cash Flow Reinvestment Rate = 100% - (Free Cash Flow Payout Ratio).Or;Free Cash Flow Reinvestment Rate = 100% - (Total Dividend/Total Free Cash Flow).By replacing net income in the payout and reinvestment ratios with free cash flow, I am thus able to make my analysis more precise by incorporating capital spending (Cap Ex) into the equation.Therefore from this we can determine that AmerisourceBergen has a reinvestment rate of 83% and went on to use 17% of its free cash flow to pay out its dividend. Thus by taking 30% (FROIC) x 83% = 24.9% (rounded off at 25%). From there we add the dividend yield of 1.3% (rounded off at 1%) and we have a Mycroft/Michaelis growth rate of 25% + 1% = 26%.McKesson has a reinvestment rate of 93% and went on to use 7% of its free cash flow to pay out its dividend. Thus by taking 32% (FROIC) x 93% = 29.76%. From there we add the dividend yield of 0.60% and we have a Mycroft/Michaelis growth rate of 29.76% + 0.60% = 30.36% (rounded off at 30%).AmerisourceBergen's Mycroft Free Cash Flow per share of $6.30 was generated by taking its TTM free cash flow per share and multiplying it by (100% + 26% or 1.26). Once we have our result, we then take its current market price of $69.72 and divide it by $6.30 and get a Price to Mycroft Free Cash Flow result of 11.06.McKesson's Mycroft Free Cash Flow per share of $18.94 was generated by taking its TTM free cash flow per share and multiplying it by (100% + 30% or 1.30). Once we have our result, we then take its current market price of $161.50 and divide it by $18.94 and get a Price to Mycroft Free Cash Flow result of 8.52. I consider a Price to Mycroft Free Cash Flow per share result of less than 15 to be good for purchase, and anything under 7.5 to be excellent.The higher you go above 15, the more overvalued a company becomes. I use a Price to Mycroft Free Cash Flow per share result of 22.5 as my sell price, and 45 as my short price.An appropriately priced stock should trade around a Price to Mycroft Free Cash Flow per share result of 15. This benchmark result was determined by backtesting.Buy (opinion) = A Price to Mycroft Free Cash Flow per share result of less than 7.5 is considered excellent (50% below the initial Hold level), and anything under 15 is attractive.The result I give as my Buy opinion in the table above uses a Price to Mycroft Free Cash Flow per share result of 7.5.Hold (opinion) = 15 to 22.5 (I use 15 in the table).Sell (opinion) = 22.5 or higher (50% above the initial Hold level). (I use 22.5 in the table).Short (opinion) = 45 or greater. The Price to Mycroft Free Cash Flow per share result of 45 was determined by going back to the peak of the market (in the year 2000) and averaging the Price to Free Cash Flow per share results for the key players at that time. (I use 45 in the table).The CapFlow ratio result that you see in the first table above is an original ratio I created in order to tell me how much Capital Spending is used as a percentage of Cash Flow. A result of less than 33% is considered ideal and with AmerisourceBergen coming in at just 15%, means that 85% of the company's cash flow is actually free cash flow and can be used for such things as buying back stock. McKesson on the other hand has a CapFlow of 11%, which means that 89% of the company's cash flow is actually free cash flow.Both companies have been strong growth plays over the last five years and here is the proof:In conclusion, as illustrated by the chart above, an investment made in 2009, in either of the two companies would have made you about 300% in profit. Both companies are generating an incredible amount of free cash flow and that is why each has a very low Price to Mycroft Free Cash Flow per share, thus making each a bargain. When you add in the great story of how each company is likely to benefit by ObamaCare and match that with strong fundamentals, I am happy to have purchased both for my client accounts.Disclosure: I am long MCK, ABC.

1410811,47851,2013-05-07T16:32:14-04:00,,"By Robert BrealeyMcKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) and Henry Schein (NASDAQ:HSIC) are two growth stocks that you can buy and hold without having to worry them about every day. We think of them as neither purely value or growth stocks, but rather stocks that will give you a reasonable return over an extended period of time.MCK is a $120b pharmaceutical distributor and healthcare information technology provider. HSIC is a $9b dental, medical and animal health supplies distributor and software, e-service and educational service provider.Over the past 10 years, with the exception of the stock market decline in 2008-2009, both stocks have delivered in excess of 12% annualized, compared to a 4% overall market performance. Since January 2011, both stocks have returned in excess of 19% annualized compared to the overall market of 10%.Over the period January 2, 2004 to May 3, 2013, though HSIC delivered higher earnings growth of 12.8% annualized compared to 11.5% of MCK, MCK delivered returns of 15.3% annualized compared to 12.5% of HSIC. This is due to a large extent that MCK had a lower P/E ratio of 16.2x in 2004 compared to 21.2x for HSIC, and whereas the P/E of MCK improved to 18.1x, P/E ratio of HSIC declined slightly to 20.5x.Both companies have had very consistent ROE performance and revenue growth in the past 10 years, a sign of predictability and sustainability in the business. In terms of ROE, both companies have delivered very consistent 15% ROE over the past 10 years, with the exception of a hit in 2005 for MCK. Both ROEs have an uptrend, with MCK's more marked than HSIC's. The earnings decomposition chart below shows that MCK was able to grow its earnings without requiring the same growth rate in book equity by improving its ROE.Note, however, that MCK has a higher leverage than HSIC, its Debt/EV is 16.6% compared to 6.4% for HSIC, meaning MCK actually has a lower return on assets. In fact, the uplift in ROE for MCK has been partly a result of an increase in Assets/Equity ratio from 3.1x to 4.5x, whereas for HSIC, it has stayed between 1.8x and 2.0x over time. MCK has been offsetting its declining Revenue/Assets ratio by this increase in leverage. Whereas HSIC enjoys a net margin of 4-5%, MCK's net margin is only about 1%, albeit increasing and offsetting its declining Revenue/Assets ratio. Though debt ratios of both companies remain in the safe region (EBITDA/Interest Expense for MCK is 11x and for HSIC 25x), overall, MCK is exposed to higher risk than HSIC for its higher leverage and laser-thin margins.In terms of revenue growth, both companies have delivered double digit growth for the most part in the past 10 years, with a slowdown in growth rates, steeper for MCK than for HSIC. It appears that MCK, being a larger company, started slowing down in 2006 and only recovered somewhat in 2012, whereas HSIC only hit speed bumps in 2009-2010 and 2013, with quick recoveries. Whereas the average revenue growth rate of MCK between 2000 and 2004 was 17.4% compared to 14.3% of HSIC, it has slowed down to 4.8% between 2008 and 2012, compared to 8.7% for HSIC.Close to 95% of MCK's business is Pharmaceutical distribution. HSIC is more diversified, with over 50% dental, 25% animal health, 17% pharmaceutical and 3% technology. Animal Health is an interesting segment for HSIC and continues to become more important because it has been growing at double digit rates.Analysts are more bullish about growth prospects for HSIC than for MCK. Analysts are expecting a 5.4% revenue growth for HSIC, compared to 3.6% for MCKHowever, incorporating current valuations, analysts are more bullish on HSIC than for MCK. For MCK, 12 analysts rate it a buy, 4 hold and none sell, whereas for HSIC, 4 rate a buy, 11 hold and 1 sell.I see both as stocks that you can buy and hold for the long term. Actually, I prefer HSIC slightly over MCK given its more bullish growth outlook. Valuations matter less for stocks that you want to buy and hold over the long run, so long as they are not too ridiculous. The room for improvement in P/E ratios is limited, unlike what MCK enjoyed for the past 10 years compared to HSIC.My model for HSIC assumes a 10% earnings growth for the next 5 years, 13% RONE, a future P/E of 18x and a beta of 0.8. Using these assumptions, I expect HSIC's value to be around $100, about 12% above its current price, and if you buy and hold today, you can expect returns greater than 9% annualized. Current and near-term earnings account for over 96% of current share price, which means this is a very safe investment. The upside is if HSIC can maintain a higher P/E ratio closer to 20x, which it has done so historically, in which case fair value is closer to $110 and future returns 11%.For MCK, my model assumes a 7% earnings growth for the next 5 years, 13% RONE, a future P/E of 16.5x and a beta of 0.9. I have chosen a lower earnings growth rate for MCK because it is wholly dependent on pharmaceutical segment, whereas HSIC is supported by a faster growing animal health segment. I have also chosen a higher beta, given its higher leverage. With these assumptions, I expect MCK's value to be around $120, about 11% higher than its current price, and if you buy and hold today, you can expect 9% returns. Current and near-term earnings account for over 96% of current share price, which means this is also a safe investment.Buy MCK and HSIC if you don't want to buy and sell at exactly the right timing, nor worry about occasional dips in stock prices. We believe this is what many non-professional investors want, because they don't have time or want to look at financial news on a daily basis. We believe this is a significant departure from mainstream investment thinking, which often cares more about capturing temporal mispricings in the market rather than picking investments that actually create shareholder value. Yes, money can be made by being cleverer or faster than the market, but there is a also a way for those who just want to buy and hold.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1522572,51392,2013-06-26T12:56:22-04:00,,"Since the beginning of 2009, McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) has seen its stock trend to some of the highest levels. From $39 at the beginning of 2009, the stock currently trades at $111.16 paying a $0.20 dividend. The company delivers pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, and plays a small role in health care IT. It operates in two segments: Distribution Solutions (97%) and Technology Solutions (3%), both of which have seen substantial development over the last few years. However, this article will focus on how McKesson is going to take advantage of the upcoming changes in the industry and how its capital deployment techniques are simultaneously creating and distributing value to shareholders.Investment ThesisThe drug industry is about to undergo a major change in the next ten years, and several key factors are expected to drive strong growth for McKesson going forward. The company is a leader in its sector, has the scale, efficiency, and service levels to deliver better pricing and convenience to its customers. It has stable and strong cash flows with FCF yields reaching ~8-10%. It has a steadily growing Technology Solutions division which is expected to contribute more to revenues in the coming years and lastly, is a big player in one of the most defensive industries in the market.Patent CliffParaphrased on Wiki from the European commission Pharmaceutical Sector Inquiry Preliminary Report:The cliff in 2012 greatly benefited not only generic drug manufacturers but also, pharmacy retail chains (CVS Caremark (NYSE:CVS), Walgreen (WAG), Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD), etc.), since generic drugs are generally sold at higher markups than their branded counterparts.Next year is expected to be a fairly slow year in branded-to-generic conversions since a large number of drugs went off patent this year and last already. McKesson is expected to face some headwinds in the process, but management expects strong growth (more on this later).Branded-to-Generic (next 10 years)Generic drugs have a compound benefit of being priced lower for consumers - the price leads to higher demand, which leads to higher margin and volume for distributors compared to branded drugs; they allow distributors to improve profitability through this margin expansion. The patent expirations over the next ten years are expected to invoke a major shift in the generic/branded mix within the pharmaceutical space. The shift is positioned to work favorably for McKesson's bottom line.A major research house issued a report which detailed that the generic utilization rate is currently at 80% (generic utilization rate is the number of generic drugs dispensed over total drugs dispensed) and is expected to reach nearly 89% by 2022. This, coupled with the robust patent expiration schedule through 2022 indicates there's still a large part of the runway left (and money to be made).The expiration schedule highlights 91 drugs which lose patent protection between 2013 and 2022. The drugs generate a substantial amount of revenue as well; they were responsible for roughly 35% of total 2012 prescriptions. Moreover, 27 of these drugs had sales of over $1 bil in 2012 (refer to ""blockbuster drug"" note above). Below is the schedule for the next two years:Source: Credit SuisseAlready McKesson has some of the highest margins historically among the oligopoly of the big three distributors (McKesson Corp. , AmerisourceBergen Corp. (NYSE:ABC) and Cardinal Health Inc. (NYSE:CAH)).The three biggest pharmacy chains in the US are: CVS Caremark, Walgreen, and Rite Aid. They're expected to benefit the most from the cliff; an increase in generics sales volume is aimed to improve their top line and better margins are aimed to improve their bottom line. The interesting note here is that McKesson has contracts with two of those firms: CVS Caremark and Rite Aid, both of which renewed the contract till mid-2016 (with Rite Aid giving three 2-year renewal options to 2020). Walgreen recently decided to end its distribution contract with Cardinal Health and partner with AmerisourceBergen - the smallest player in the sector. This point gives support to McKesson's ability to service its clients in an industry where service level is a key success factor. This, along with the upcoming expirations, provides backing for McKesson's continued margin improvements over the next 10 years, as generic utilization rates increase ~10%. Although all three distributors are in a position to take advantage of this conversion, McKesson's already higher margins and partnerships with the two of the largest retailers puts the company in a better standing.Financial StrengthApart from being the largest player in the pharmaceutical distribution arena, McKesson also has a philosophy of generating shareholder value through acquisitions, share repurchases, internal investments, and dividends. The chart below shows how the company has deployed capital for the last five years:Breaking it down further:Historically, the company has generated a FCF Yield of ~8-10%. This puts their FCF position between $2.0-2.5 bil every year. As seen above, cash is being used to fund acquisitions (such as PSS World Systems and similar smaller ones for its Technology Solutions division) and return excess value to shareholders. The FCF schedule is given below (in $ millions):Management has indicated it plans to repurchase more shares in 2014, to reduce the current share count to ~231 mil (down ~3.5% y/y). Although the company has a lower dividend yield than its competitors, it takes a ""portfolio approach"" to capital deployment. McKesson prefers to employ capital in a variety of accretive methods and has pointed out that a higher dividend will restrict the company's ability to continue doing so.Technology SolutionIt might seem slightly redundant to discuss a division which only generates about 3% of revenues for the company. However, the more important thing here to note is that because TS is a higher margin business (~45% GP Margin), it contributes to nearly 15% of EBIT.The division consists of three buckets: Software and software systems (17%), Hardware (3%), and Services (80%). The services segment generates 80% of the revenues, but this stream is also recurring (95%) and sticky. Due to the unique nature of this segment, it was able to generate 4% annual growth in revenue even during the downturn of 2008/2009. McKesson's system is currently used by over 2,000 hospitals/health systems, approximately 1,900 payers, over 80 health information exchanges, over 200,000 physicians and in over 50,000 retail pharmacies.It has made a series of acquisitions to improve the division and make it a larger part of its revenue stream (due to the higher margin contributions). The list of public acquisitions is below:As you might have noticed, a large number of these acquisitions are in the software space.Comparable AnalysisIt doesn't make a lot of sense to do a comps table showing how McKesson's trading metrics (P/E, EV/EBITDA, etc.) are undervalued compared to its peers, since there are only three large players in this space. The numbers are fairly similar for all three distributors, but I believe that McKesson deserves a slight premium for its performance.The company's revenue growth has outperformed its competitors by quite a large margin. However, its one year revenue growth has stayed almost flat (due to one-time impairment charges in FY13Q4). The average growth over the last 5 years for each company can be seen below:McKesson has grown revenues much quicker, and is expected by analysts to reach almost 11.4% in 2014. This is a stark contrast from the (6.8%) from Cardinal Health Inc. and above the 9.1% from AmerisourceBergen Corp. (Source: J.P. Morgan and Thomson ONE).Discounted Cash FlowI also valued the stock from a discounted cash flow perspective. The assumptions I used are listed below. However, I've used two different assumptions for 2014. One of them assumes the company will grow at 11.4% in 2014 and then at 3% for 9 years before a terminal growth of 1.4%. The other omits the large growth in 2014 and grows at 3% for the next 10 years with the same terminal growth value. I've used Bloomberg's assumptions for EBIT Margins and CAPEX growth.It produced the following output for 3% 2014E growth:And the following for 11.4% 2014E growth:The DCF, in this case, is a much better valuation method to show intrinsic value than the comps table due to the limited universe of peers. However, DCFs generally tend to overshoot its target, so I tried not to use the optimistic analyst or mgmt assumptions for the next few years. Even at its average growth rate, the sheet is generating close to a 15% upside - a reasonable premium given how the sector is expected to shift over the next ten years.ConclusionMcKesson was put in a tough position in 2013, as the company posted flat growth due to the one-time charges. From a value investment perspective, the company is stable, a leader in its arena, and generates steadily growing and stable FCF numbers each year. Moreover, it has made significant developments over the last few years to improve its Technology Solutions division, which has better margins and even more recurring and sticky cash flows. While the Distribution Solutions will take advantage of the major product mix shift in the industry, Technology Solutions will continue innovating over the next few years to become a larger part of the company's revenues (and even larger in EBIT). Looking at the company's scale, financial strength, and valuation, McKesson appears to have a large part of the runway ahead of it. The company may prove to be one of the better performers this year for investors.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in MCK over the next 72 hours.

2030481,24663,2014-02-19T07:53:02-05:00,,"Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) soared more than 6% on Tuesday to reach multi-year highs.The company announced an expanded distribution agreement with McKesson (NYSE:MCK), a massive drug retailer.McKesson essentially serves as the middle man between drug companies and pharmacies, as its services allow for a more efficient supply chain. Rite Aid has used McKesson for many years for drug distribution and sourcing, but their original contract was nearing an end. Therefore, this five-year agreement takes the partnership through March of 2019, and in an industry that will continue to change greatly during this period.With that said, many are wandering why Rite Aid would trade to new highs - it's worth noting that McKesson also reached new highs on the news - on the announcement of just a distribution agreement.The answer to this question can be tied to the vast changes that are occurring within this industry, which include more than $130 billion worth of brand drugs losing patent protection between 2011 and 2017, also called the patent cliff. Already, we have seen major effects of the patent cliff, as operating margins for pharmacies and drug distribution companies have risen drastically.For McKesson, its operating margin has risen from 1.63% to 2.03% from 2011 till the last 12 months, respectively. And, Rite Aid has seen an unparalleled improvement from negative 2.16% to positive 3.76% in the same period. As a result, shares of both companies have soared: McKesson 290% in five years and Rite Aid 400% since January 2012.As a result, one could argue that the large distribution partnership between these two companies have aided in the large returns that each stock has seen in recent years. Hence, an additional five-years has nothing but positive implications for both companies during this period of change.ConclusionThe business of drug sales has changed greatly for all companies involved, as drugs are no longer bought in small quantities or require more difficult logistical networks. Instead, generic drugs are bought in bulk and with more pricing flexibility, which has drove margins higher.Therefore, as more generics come on the market, theoretically, margins should continue to rise for both companies, which in turn should lead to larger gains. As a result, this partnership may seem small at the surface, but when you dig deeper it's likely a good indication that gains for either company are nowhere near ending.Disclosure: I am long RAD.

The company distributes pharmaceuticals, healthcare supplies and consumer health products in North America.Second Quarter ResultsMcKesson reported better-than-expected results for the second quarter of its fiscal 2014 on October 24. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.27, well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.03. It was a 19% increase over the same quarter last year.Revenue rose 11% year-over-year to $32.954 billion, beating the consensus of $32.371 billion. Its largest segment, Distribution Solutions, saw revenues climb 11%, driven mainly by strong growth in U.S. pharmaceutical direct distribution and services revenues due to market growth, business mix and one additional sales day.Income from continuing operating rose 20% year-over-year as the operating margin expanded from 1.5% to 2.4%.Increased GuidanceIn the Q2 press release, McKesson raised its full year fiscal 2014 EPS guidance. The company now expects adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations between $8.40 and $8.70, up from previous guidance of $8.05-$8.35. That was also well above consensus at the time, prompting analysts to revise their estimates higher for both 2014 and 2015.This sent the stock to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see the dramatic rise in estimates in the 'Price & Consensus' chart:Based on consensus estimates, analysts project a 20% increase in EPS in 2014 and 16% growth in 2015.Part of this growth will come organically, but McKesson is also growing via acquisition. The company recently announced plans to acquire Celesio, a European healthcare products distributor, for more than $8 billion.ValuationShares of McKesson have been on fire in 2013, surging more than 60% year-to-date. But the valuation picture still looks reasonable with the stock trading around 17x 12-month forward earnings. While that is above its 10-year historical median of 14x, it is below the industry median of 19x.Its price to sales ratio of 0.3 is also below its peer at 0.4.The Bottom LineWith strong top and bottom line growth, rising earnings estimates and reasonable valuation, McKesson still offers investors attractive upside potential.Todd Bunton, CFA is the Growth & Income Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research and Editor of the Income Plus Investor service."
2673075,72015,2014-11-13T07:42:57-05:00,"This article compares two leaders in global pharmaceutical distribution: McKesson and AmerisourceBergen.
        Many investors are likely unaware that McKesson generated nearly as much revenue over the last 12 months as Apple did.
        McKesson has delivered stronger margins and efficiency ratios than AmerisourceBergen in recent quarters, but has an uninspiring dividend track..
        Nevertheless, McKesson's projected mid-teens EPS growth rate gives the shares impressive upside potential, making this healthcare stock a compelling buy at its current price.","McKesson (NYSE:MCK) and AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) are two of the largest distributors of pharmaceutical products in the world. Both companies have grown quickly through acquisitions in recent years and have seen their share prices rise significantly over the last 52 weeks. With a market capitalization approaching $50 billion, McKesson is more than twice as large as AmerisourceBergen. This article analyzes this two competitors to determine which represents the more attractive investment opportunity in the current environment.Please click here to read my article which outlines the DRAG analysis framework in more detail.To summarize, the four variables used in a DRAG (dividend and risk adjusted growth) analysis are as follows (each company is ranked from 0 to 3 in each category): 1) How cyclical is the industry in which McKesson and AmerisourceBergen operate? 2) How strong are McKesson's and AmerisourceBergen's competitive positions within this industry? 3) How risky are McKesson's and AmerisourceBergen's balance sheets? 4) What are McKesson's and AmerisourceBergen's dividend yields and dividend growth histories?The premise is that a company that operates in a non-cyclical industry, with a strong competitive position and a clean balance sheet that pays an attractive dividend should trade at a higher earnings multiple than a company without these attributes, even if the lower quality company has higher projected future earnings growth. After adjusting for these variables, it becomes easier to compare companies in different sectors with different levels of future growth potential.McKesson vs. AmerisourceBergen DRAG Analysis:The healthcare industry in general (and specifically the pharmaceutical distribution business) tends to exhibit less than average economic sensitivity. While changes to government policies (such as ObamaCare) do impact this industry moderately, demand for pharmaceutical products is not cyclical in nature. In addition, due to the again population in North America, one could reasonably argue that this industry will see consistent growth in the decades to come, regardless of the economic environment. This academic research website lists healthcare services stocks as having a below average beta and both McKesson and AmerisourceBergen have exhibited betas of well below 1 during the past year. The iShares Global Healthcare ETF (NYSEARCA:IXJ) also possesses a beta of well below average. While AmerisourceBergen has a higher standard deviation of earnings over the past decade, much of this volatility is the result of acquisitions and one time accounting charges as opposed to instability in the underlying business. Therefore, both of these stocks deserve a premium multiple for operating in such a non-cyclical industry.Looking at the margins and efficiency ratios of these two firms makes one fact obvious: the pharmaceutical distribution business is all about volume, not margins. Keep in mind that over the past 12 months, McKesson has generated $161 billion in sales and AmerisourceBergen posted nearly $113 billion in revenue. For the sake of comparison, Apple's revenue over the last calendar year was approximately $183 billion. While these two firms operate in an oligopoly (Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) is the other major player), competition is fierce and returns are low. AmerisourceBergen's recent distribution deal with Walgreen's has temporarily further decreased margins for the company, although these are expected to recover slightly in the coming quarters. Nevertheless, both firm deserve a below average score in this area of the analysis, McKesson has better margins and ratios across the board and therefore deserves a slight advantage here.The low current ratios of both companies are not a significant concern to me, given the high levels of inventory and receivables in this industry. Both companies have also added a moderate level of debt in recent years, although neither balance sheet is overly aggressive. In particular, AmerisourceBergen only has $2 billion in long term debt outstanding (compared to $1.2 billion in cash and a $20 billion market cap). Neither firm has the balance sheet flexibility that would be necessary to finance further large acquisitions without issuing equity, but investors in both companies can be confident that these firms have sufficiently strong financial positions.While neither firm pays a significant dividend, AmerisourceBergen's yield and dividend growth history is superior to that of McKesson. And although AmerisourceBergen will likely never be confused for a high yield stock, its dividend growth in recent years has been somewhat impressive. Note that its payout ratio is artificially high due to accounting charges and should therefore not be a concern to investors. On the other hand, McKesson's current yield is negligible and dividend growth has not been a focus for the company in recent years, which is why AmerisourceBergen deserves a slightly higher ranking in this portion of the comparison.Both companies end up with the same fundamental DRAG score (5.5) as AmerisourceBergen's dividend advantage over McKesson makes up for its lower margins and efficiency ratios. However, while this analysis shows that AmerisourceBergen's shares likely have 5% further upside, McKesson appears to be the more compelling investment opportunity with upwards of 30% capital appreciate potential. This is simply because McKesson trades at a slightly lower (16 times) forward earnings multiple than AmerisourceBergen (17.5 times), despite a long term earnings growth rate that is 2.5% higher. Therefore, growth investors looking for a fairly low risk method of gaining exposure to the healthcare industry should focus on McKesson for its significant earnings and share price growth potential."

The company's stock price appreciation did not exactly keep up with the company's organic growth; therefore McKesson Corporation is currently undervalued. In the last decade, McKesson's stock price moved up from $36.02 to $81.34. This indicates a growth of 126% in the last 10 years.Book Value and Cash AssetsA decade ago, McKesson's book value was $12.78 billion. Of this value, $6.26 billion was due to inventories and $3.60 billion was due to receivables. Today, the company's book value is $33.16 billion. Of this value, inventories make up $10.38 billion and receivables make up $9.67 billion. The company's cash holdings grew greatly from $285 million to $4.19 billion in the last decade. In other words, the company's book value grew by 160% and its cash holdings grew by 1370% in the last decade. McKesson looks undervalued in both metrics.Tangible Book ValueThe company currently enjoys a tangible book value of $12.44 up from $5.14 billion 10 years ago. This is an increase of 142%. In this metric, the company looks fairly valued to undervalued.RevenuesBy the end of 2001, McKesson's revenues were $13.20 billion. By the end of 2011, the company's revenue was $30.84 billion. In other words, the company saw a revenue increase of 134% in the last decade. The company is fairly valued to undervalued in this metric.Net IncomeIn the last decade, McKesson enjoyed a net income growth of 175%. A decade ago, the company's quarterly net earnings were $108 million whereas it is $300 million today. The company actually earned $323 million in the last quarter but $23 million of this income was due to currency exchange rates. In this metric, the company is undervalued.Additional ConsiderationsIn 2010, the company acquired US Oncology Holdings as a part of its growth plan for $2.1 billion. For this acquisition, the company used money from its own cash reserves as opposed to taking on debt. Now US Oncology belongs to McKesson Distribution Solutions, and contributed to this segment's operating profit of $510 million in the last quarter. The company's other segment, McKesson Technology Solutions enjoyed an operating profit of $69 million in the last quarter.In January 2012, the company agreed with Katz Group Canada Inc. to acquire its Drug Trading Company Limited for CAD $920 million. This acquisition will also be funded with McKesson's existing cash. Drug Trading Company Limited will be also incorporated with McKesson's Distribution Solutions segment and help the company's market share gains in Canada.ConclusionMcKesson is a successful company that will continue to reward investors. Currently the company is underpriced and it will continue to see growth in the future. Majority of the analysts covering the stock rate it as strong buy or buy with an average price target of $96. I believe McKesson is currently a buy due to its 10 year trend.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
499911,21618,2012-04-16T10:20:24-04:00,,"I wanted to share with you what I call a 'swap' in my Covestor Healthcare Model last week. Centene (NYSE:CNC) shares swooned last week after they lost a contract for the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. I sold my shares at $43.49 and the stock already has bounced back to a slightly higher level!I cannot deny that I have a little seller's remorse, but I have also noticed that stocks after a sharp decline often have a bounce higher, but way once again move lower into the future. Anyhow, I picked up some shares of McKesson (NYSE:MCK) with the proceeds. One of the first times I reviewed McKesson was back on January 1, 2004, literally over 8 years ago right here on this blog.At that time the stock was trading at $32.16. MCK closed at $90.48 on 4/13/12, so the stock really has done very well since that post.Let's take a closer look at MCK and let's see if it is still was wise to pick up shares now that the stock has nearly tripled in price since I first visited it!According to the Yahoo ""Profile"" on McKesson, the companyUnlike Centene (CNC) which suffered from a loss of a contract, McKesson (MCK) has been strong recently due to a continuance of a contract with the Department of Veteran affairs (VA).In terms of its latest quarter, McKesson reported their 3rd fiscal quarter (ended December 31, 2011) on January 30, 2012. As Motley Fool pointed out on January 31, 2012, they had strong results with revenue growth of 9.2% coming in at $30.84 billion ahead of last year's $28.20 billion and exceeding analysts' expectations of $30.19 billion.The company reported earnings of $1.40 ahead of estimates of $1.38 on same basis. GAAP earnings of $1.20 were 100% higher than the prior year's $.60/share result.In terms of longer-term results, reviewing the Morningstar.com ""Financials"" on McKesson, we can see that revenue has steadily grown from $93.0 billion in 2007 to $112.1 billion in 2011 and $119.9 billion in the trailing twelve months (TTM). Earnings have grown but somewhat less consistently from $2.99/share in 2007 to $4.57 in 2011 and $5.13/share in the TTM.The company has been retiring shares through buybacks with 305 million shares outstanding in 2007, 263 million shares in 2011 and 254 million in the TTM. The company announced another $650 million in stock repurchases on January 31, 2012.Morningstar reports McKesson with $22.4 billion in current assets and $18.7 billion in current liabilities for a current ratio of 1.20. The company has also grown its free cash flow which has increased from $1.2 billion in 2007 to $2.0 billion in 2011 and $2.3 billion in the trailing twelve months.Examining the valuation of the stock, we can see from the Yahoo ""Key Statistics"" page, that McKesson is a large cap stock with a market capitalization of $22.27 billion.The trailing P/E is reported at 17.64 with a forward P/E of 12.57. With solid growth expected the PEG Ratio (5 yr expected ) works out to a very reasonable 0.95 indicating reasonable valuation.Yahoo reports 246.10 million shares outstanding with 245.30 million that float. As of March 30, 2012, there were 1.88 million shares out short with a very modest short interest ratio of 1.00 (well below my own arbitrary 3 day rule for significance).McKesson pays a modest dividend with a forward dividend yield of 0.90%. The company last split its stock in January, 1998, when it declared a 2:1 stock split.McKesson is a solid stock for my portfolio and belongs in this blog. Summarizing a few findings here, the stock recently reported a renewal of a very significant pharmaceutical contract with the Veterans Administration, the latest quarterly report was strong with growth in revenue and earnings that both exceeded expectations. Technically the stock has a strong chart going back for at least eight years. They have steadily grown their revenue, earnings (not quite as steady), and grown their free cash flow the past five years. Meanwhile they have bought back shares reducing the float and increasing shareholder value while maintaining a dividend and a strong balance sheet. The stock is modestly priced and considering estimated growth, the PEG is under 1.0 which is not a common finding in the stocks that I review on this blog.My hand isn't as steady when bad news derails one or more of my holdings. I am relatively quick to sell on this news and even though Centene (CNC) may turn out to be a terrific stock long term, it appears that McKesson (MCK) is also a good choice. I shall be keeping Centene on my 'watch list' and may well revisit this holding in the future!Disclosure: Author owns MCK.Disclaimer: Thanks so much for stopping by and visiting my blog, Stock Picks Bob's Advice!

For the 2nd quarter of fiscal year 2012, MCK announced earnings per share of $1.20, representing 19% of the total annual estimate. For fiscal year 2013, analysts estimate that MCK's earnings per share will grow by 10% to $6.96. MCK's current quarter consensus estimate has decreased over the past 90 days from 1.52 to 1.37, a loss of -.6%. Consensus estimates for the Generic & Specialty Pharma Industry have moved an average 0.0% during the same time period. The consensus range is between $1.28 and $1.52 according to 17 analysts reviewed. Of the past four earnings reports, MCK had four positive surprise reports of 9.4%, 3.6%, 11.5%, and 16.8% respectively. A pattern of increasing sales in conjunction with a rising EPS may influence a buy recommendation.On 01/24/12, MCK closed at $76.55, 12.3% below its 52- week high and 14.9% above its 52-week low. MCK shares are currently trading 2.5% below their 50-day moving average of $78.48, and 3.8% below their 200-day moving average of $79.57. Despite the minor sell-off analysts believe the 12-month target price is $100. This is derived by applying an approximate peer-level 15.7X multiple to the 2012 cash EPS estimate of $6.32. In December 2010, MCK acquired US Oncology, a leading provider of products and services to oncologists, for $2.1 billion in cash and I believe this has put it at an advantageous position for growth that it is currently experiencing. I believe this earnings report will be another positive, and five positives in a row cannot be ignored. I believe this stock is poised for growth, especially after the earnings report.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
961431,25120,2012-10-30T10:28:52-04:00,,"McKesson Corporation (MCK) announced on Thursday that it will acquire PSS World Medical (PSSI) in a deal valuing the company at $29.00 per share. Shares in McKesson rose more than 4.0% on Thursday on the back of the deal and the company's quarterly results. Shares of PSS rose 33% on the back of the offer, and closed Friday's trading session at $28.57 per share.The DealMcKesson announced that it would buy PSS World Medical for $29.00 per share. The purchase will form a leading provider of medical supplies, services and technology to physician and extended care customers.McKesson will use the distribution infrastructure, private label offering and sales and customer service teams to provide the best of both companies to customers. Customers will have access to a broad array of medical products and services.The deal including the assumption of debt, values PSS at $2.1 billion. CEO and Chairman John H. Hammergren commented on the deal:PSS reported $2.1 billion in annual revenues in 2011. The company reported a net income of $74.3 million for the year. McKesson pays roughly $1.5 billion for the equity of PSS. This values the company at 0.7 times annual revenues and roughly 20 times annual earnings. McKesson furthermore assumes roughly $600 million in debt outstanding from PSS.McKesson estimates that annual synergies could exceed $100 million per annum in four years time.The transaction has already been approved by the board of directors of both companies. The deal is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory clearances and approval from PSS's shareholders.ValuationMcKesson ended its second quarter of its fiscal 2013 with $2.8 billion in cash and equivalents. The company operates with $3.6 billion in short and long term debt, for a net debt position of $0.8 billion. Financing of the deal should not provide any difficulties given the limited debt position of McKesson at the moment.For the first six months of its fiscal 2013, McKesson generated revenues of $60.6 billion. The company net earned $781 million, or $3.31 per diluted share. At this rate, the company could approach annual revenues of $125 billion. Net income could total $1.7 billion, or $7.00 per diluted share.Currently the market values McKesson at $22 billion. This values the company at 0.2 times annual revenues and 13 times annual earnings.Currently, McKesson pays a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share, for an annual dividend yield of 0.9%.Investment ThesisYear to date, shares of McKesson have risen some 20%. Shares started the year in the high seventies and gradually rose to highs of $97 in July. Shares fell back to $85 after setting a peak in the summer, and are currently exchanging hands at $92 per share.Over the past five years, shares of McKesson have risen some 60%. Shares fell from $60 in 2008 to lows of $35 later that year and at the start of 2009. Shares steadily recovered to $97 earlier this year. Between 2009 and its fiscal 2013, the company boosted annual revenues from $106 billion to an estimated $125 billion. Net income is expected to double from $823 million in 2009, to an estimated $1.7 billion this year.For the first six months of its fiscal 2013, McKesson generated $59.0 billion in distribution revenues, 97% of firmwide revenues. Operating margins for the division are just 1.9%. Technology solution revenues came in at $1.66 billion, while operating margins came in at 11.4%.The $2.1 billion revenue addition of PSS will significantly boost McKesson's technology solution division. Furthermore the deal valued at 20 times annual earnings, seems rather favorable given the outlook for $100 million in annual synergies from 2016 and onwards.The deal seems rather favorable for both parties. I am not surprised that shareholders in McKesson react enthusiastic to the deal given the fair price and high estimated synergies. I refrain from investing as I fear the ""conglomerate discount"". The company's boring distribution activities carry low margins and low valuations. I think the technology division, including the acquisition of PSS, would command a much higher valuation on a stand-alone basis.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

365711,20725,2012-02-14T15:49:31-05:00,,"McKesson (NYSE:MCK) is well positioned in its industry that experiences slow but steady growth. The stock has the defensive characteristics that would go great if the outlook for economy is turbulent or it had significant upside because of short term mispricing by the market. However, neither is the case so I suggest that investors look elsewhere for exposure to healthcare. Below is a in depth look at the valuation metrics and top holders of the stock.Valuation: McKesson's trailing 5 year valuation metrics suggest that the stock is fairly valued as there is a mixed message about the three valuation metrics compared to their 5 year averages. McKesson's current P/B ratio is 2.7 and it has averaged 2.4 over the past 5 years with a high of 3 and low of 1.6. McKesson's current P/S ratio is 0.2 and it has averaged 0.2 over the past 5 years with a high of 0.2 and low of 0.1. McKesson's current P/E ratio is 15.9 and it has averaged 16 over the past 5 years with a high of 21.2 and low of 11.9.Price Target: The consensus price target for the analysts who follow McKesson is $96. That is upside of 18% from today's stock price of $81.34 and suggests that the stock is fairly valued at these levels. This also suggests that the stock has limited upside and should be avoided at its current stock price.Forward Valuation: McKesson is currently trading at about $81 a share with analysts expecting EPS of $7.1 next year, an earnings increase of 12% y/y, for a forward P/E ratio of 11.5. Taking a look at the company's publically traded comparisons will give us a better idea of the stock's relative valuation. AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) is currently trading at about $39 a share with analysts expecting EPS of $3.17 next year, an earnings increase of 13% y/y, for a forward P/E ratio of 12.2. Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) is currently trading at about $42 a share with analysts expecting EPS of $3.54 next year, an earnings increase of 11% y/y, for a forward P/E ratio of 11.8. The mean forward P/E of McKesson's competitors is 12 which suggests that McKesson is fairly valued relative to its publically traded competitors.Top Stock Holders: The top two funds that own McKesson are Vanguard Health Care Inv, which owns 9.8 million shares or 3.99% of the shares outstanding, and T. Rowe Price Growth Stock, which owns 4.4 million shares or 1.78% of the shares outstanding. The top two institutions that own McKesson are T.

234155,21369,2010-11-02T15:26:08-04:00,,"By Brian SozziFrom 2006 to 2009, drug distributor and PBM (pharmaceutical benefit managers) stocks were among the darlings of Wall Street. Profits were booming amidst increased generic drug utilization by those in the US, operating efficiencies, and price hikes on branded drugs.On a CAGR, the main names in the group (Medco (NYSE:MHS), Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH), Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC), and McKesson (NYSE:MCK)) notched average market cap growth of 16%. Since the start of 2009 to present day, the average share price gain for the companies mentioned has been a whopping 61%, more than double the advance in the S&P 500 Index.However, much of the friendly share price performance for the group was derived in 2009 rather than in 2010. The stocks have either flat-lined or declined in 2010 as the market became jittery on profit growth potential due to heightened competitive pricing on contract renewals and a softer generic drug launch calendar relative to prior years.Moreover, the companies began to spend the fruits of their labor by investing in assets to fund future growth ahead of new healthcare reform kicking into gear. With some 30 million new entrants arriving in the market long before not, the sector is licking its chops as each can be sold a script (hopefully a generic script through the mail).As the earnings season for the sector winds down, a few thoughts have come to mind. The first, and perhaps most important, is that now is the time to invest in the sector as growth in calendar 2012 will ramp significantly as big name brand drugs roll off patent protection (Plavix, Lipitor, Lexipro). Second, the strong are becoming stronger through acquisitions. At the end of the September quarter, the sector was sitting on nearly $10 billion in cash and equivalents.McKesson just plunked down $2.7 billion for privately held US Oncology on November 1. Express Scripts is about to experience strong earnings growth in 2011 fueled by its 2009 acquisition of NextRx. These companies are utilizing their balance sheets to grow, increase dividends, and repurchase shares at an eye opening rate. In addition, they are improving their capital structures by tapping debt markets for attractive financing.Taken as a whole, there is much to like, so it pays to get in prior to the market sniffing out the future earnings potential. I am overweight the sector (in Wall Street parlance, this means I am positive on the stocks in the sector).Sector RundownThe company generally had good things to say on its earnings call, such as an ahead of plan integration of NextRx, strong client retention, new client wins for 2011, and compelling long-term industry trends. Earnings power at Express Scripts is likely to be quite strong in coming years as NextRx clients are up-sold and healthcare reforms promote greater drug utilization (especially generics).I remain impressed by the execution of the Express Scripts management team, and believe low balance sheet gearing hints at another PBM acquisition in the not too distant future. Moreover, it's my view that Express Scripts' initial FY11 EPS guidance, suggesting 30% y/y profit growth, puts to bed numerous concerns held by the market (pricing, integration risk).I was very pleased by Medco's 3Q10 report as it displayed healthy sequential growth in revenues, gross margin, and EBITDA per adjusted claim. Following concern among consensus analysts regarding Medco's client mix and how it would impact margins, the 3Q10 report calms the fire. Medco is driving strong generic drug utilization through its book of business and is increasingly shipping higher profit generics via its mail order pharmacies. Combined with an aggressive amount of share repurchases, the positive trends in the business are likely to cause consensus estimates to edge up for 4Q10 as well.The major takeaway from Medco was the FY12 EPS earnings power amid big name generic drug introductions, such as the aforementioned Lipitor, Lexipro, and Plavix. In 4Q11 alone, with Lipitor available for one month, the contribution from generics is outlined to be $0.06 P/S, the most robust of FY11. The impact is quite obvious in FY12, which management stated will be the largest in terms of new generic launches up until 2020.I think the stock will run into analyst day on November 19, where increased granularity on the FY12 generics contribution will be unveiled. Valued at a P/E multiple of 16.9x my new FY11 EPS estimate of $4.12 (top-end of management's guidance), forecasting at least y/y growth in non-GAAP EPS of 18%, Medco shares are compelling.Though I acknowledge that AmerisourceBergen shares may have a neutral bias medium-term as the market balances a muted FY11 growth story with a stronger growth story in FY12, I believe the stock should ultimately begin to price in the ramp in the earnings trajectory beyond the current fiscal year. At current valuation, the stock has a favorable risk reward ratio in front of the ramp in earnings growth long-term.Cardinal Health reported a strong 1Q11 on October 28, aided by continued momentum behind the Pharmaceutical segment. The Pharmaceutical segment notched 32 bps of operating margin YOY as execution on generics programs improved and sales mix (bulk versus non-bulk) was favorable. Cardinal Health noted margins in both bulk and non-bulk strengthen YOY as well.I remain impressed by the work Cardinal Health has done at its largest segment of business in addition to working capital, and think there is an upward bias in profit margins in FY11. As for the Medical segment, it was a soft quarter on sales and margins compared to 1Q10, as guided to by management on the 4Q10 earnings call.Cardinal Health shares are attractively valued in my opinion. The stock trades at 11.3x my new FY12 EPS forecast of $2.92, or 13.4x my estimate for FY10. In each case, the stock trades at a discount to the five-year P/E multiple of 15.0x. With profit margins trending up and cash deployment being robust, the stock sticks out in my drug distributor coverage universe as a best in breed play.McKesson continues to represent one of the more underappreciated large-cap stocks in my coverage universe. The stock trades on a P/E multiple of 11.8x my revised FY12 EPS forecast of $5.50 (+$0.11), a discount of 15% to the five-year mean, and an even larger discount to the broad market. I view valuation as very attractive as McKesson begins to experience a ramp in earnings growth as early as the fourth quarter.Support for that call include (1) indications of a top line turnaround at Technology Solutions on the back of an influx of government dollars and increased human capital; (2) strengthening mix of sales at Distribution Solutions; (3) increased penetration of customers with the OneStop generics program; and (4) utilization of the new $1.0 billion share repurchase plan. Risks to my analysis include (1) fundamental changes in the Canadian drug market; (2) longer than expected improved at Technology Solutions.Disclosure: No positions"
285175,22145,2011-08-05T14:46:44-04:00,,"By Justin DoveWhen the market falls as a whole, it creates buying opportunities. One such opportunity that’s presenting itself is McKesson Corp. (NYSE:MCK). The drug distribution company reported a positive first quarter of  FY2012 on July 28. Despite the good news, fear in the market is  bringing down McKesson’s stock with it.Marc Lichtenfeld mentioned a solid year ahead for the stock  in January. The stock has lived up to expectation, gaining as much as  16 percent since January. It has outpaced the S&P 500 by more than  12 percent over the past 52 weeks. However, problems in the market have  all but erased the gains McKesson notched earlier this year.Why McKesson’s Best Days Are AheadMarc predicted a stronger second half of 2011 for McKesson.  Admittedly it may be hard to beat a 16 percent gain by December with the  current state of the market. But here are some reasons to believe the  best days are ahead:McKesson Positioned for Continued Growth McKesson is positioned to continue growing. The baby-boomers are  getting older and more of the population will need medication. McKesson  is the undisputed industry leader, handling one third of all drugs distributed in North America. It's also the largest healthcare IT company, “with software and  hardware technology installed in more than half of the nation’s  hospitals with greater than 200 beds.”Such advantages should keep business steady for years to come. The  company also looks like it has a solid short-term ahead. With the patent-cliff approaching, its generic drug distribution will spike along with earnings by next March. Don’t expect the dip to last long.Disclosure: Investment U expressly forbids  its writers from having a financial interest in any security they  recommend to our subscribers.

219736,23834,2010-08-10T07:18:06-04:00,,"Our country’s employment numbers this morning point to an anemic recovery, so say the economic pundits. Private companies added 71,000 new jobs (expectations were for an additional 90,000 jobs) last month while overall employment fell by 131,000 jobs. Government payrolls shrank by 202,000 (143,000 jobs were slashed by the Census Bureau). The unemployment rate stands at 9.5%.  The employment report is a bit misleading at first glance. The Census jobs were going away as soon as the Census was done. Consequently the cut in government payrolls should not be a big surprise. We would hope that government payrolls shrink further as the economy improves and private hiring increases (in the interest of full disclosure we are big supporters of less government, not more). Private hiring did increase but below what was expected – perhaps we will experience another jobless recovery. We would add that year to date private hiring has increased by 559,000 new jobs (Moody’s Economy.com 8/6/2010).   Corporate earnings have been increasing; this fact is often overshadowed by the employment report. After the second quarter earnings season, 74% of the reporting companies beat their bottom line (net income) estimates and 58% of the reporting companies beat their top line (sales or revenue) estimates. Only financial service companies (think banks) did not share in this growth.Companies are making money. Corporate earnings jumped 47% in fourth quarter 2009 and 52% in first quarter 2010.   The positively sloped Treasury bond yield curve is allowing for growth – to wit Cadbury Schweppes (NYSE:CSG) bought Kraft, Sanofi-Avantis (NASDAQ:SNY) is in talks with Genzyme (GENZ), Catepillar (NYSE:CAT) is buying Electro-Motive Diesel and Barnes & Nobe (NYSE:BKS)l may be acquired by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) or another company by the time you read this. The economy is improving – this is borne out by the improving Gross Domestic Product numbers. GDP reflects our consumption, investment spending, government spending and net exports. Or as you might remember from Economics 101: GDP=C+I+G+ (E-M). As the late President Kennedy said “We’re all Keynesians now.” You can see the rebound in GDP below (from the Bureau of Economic Analysis):So, we think the market’s pessimistic attitude is overdone. We don’t see any inflationary problems over the next six months to maybe a year. We think the Federal Reserve will need to keep interest rates low for the next six to twelve months as well. We like big name dividend paying companies – for example we just added McKesson to our portfolio (symbol MCK). Look around the next time you are visiting someone in a hospital – you’ll see their products in use. On the fixed income side we are keeping our bond maturities inside of a year. We just don’t think that we are getting compensated enough to justify extending maturities. Even though our inflation outlook is pretty benign, once inflation rears its ugly head the resulting interest rate increases will hurt.To sum, we are reminded of that great quote from the Oracle of Omaha (aka Warren Buffett – actually we are reminded of this quote almost daily) to “be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy when others are fearful.” We are greedy.Disclosure: Short"

One way investors can identify over or undervalued stocks is by using AFG’s Intrinsic Value Chart, which displays a company’s intrinsic value relative to its trading range and helps identify entry/exit points.This easy-to-read chart identifies how far a stock’s trading range deviates from its intrinsic value (target price assuming immediate decay), which helps you recognize potentially mispriced stocks and pursue long and short opportunities. AFG’s Intrinsic Value Chart also contains a company’s Value Score (ranked valuation attractiveness), Economic Margin Change (expected improvement of economic profitability), and Accuracy (how well AFG’s default valuation has tracked the company). AFG’s valuation framework estimates a company’s equity value by subtracting debt and other liabilities from the total enterprise value. The total enterprise value is estimated by discounting projected future cash flows, utilizing analyst consensus, Economic Margin methodology, and the Decay concept which addresses the perpetuity bias in the traditional DCF model.The example we have provided is McKesson Corp. (NYSE:MCK) a company that currently looks undervalued according to AFG’s default valuation model. An important fact to note is that AFG has shown it slightly over-tracks McKesson Corp. (accuracy score of 66) yet the company still looks very attractive relative to its sector peers from a default valuation perspective. Also, McKesson Corp. has a current AFG Value Score of 94, meaning the company ranks in the top 94th percentile of companies in the AFG universe in valuation attractiveness. Companies AFG identifies as undervalued have proven through back-tests to be more likely to outperform than those companies with an unattractive default AFG valuation rank.AFG’s Intrinsic Value Chart:• Identifies entry/exit points• Shows how well AFG has tracked the company (accuracy)• Displays the trading range of the company each year through time (blue bars)• Displays the end of year closing price (dash on blue bar)• Displays AFG’s default intrinsic value (red dotted line)How to Read this chart:• The Blue Bars represent the high and low trading range for a stock for each calendar year.• The red dotted line represents Applied Finance Group’s (AFG’s) historical Intrinsic Value through time.• When the red line (Intrinsic Value) is above the blue bars (trading range) the company looks to be undervalued.• When the red line (Intrinsic Value) is below the blue bars (trading range) the company looks to be overvalued.AFG’s valuation techniques are one of the ways that AFG helps investors make more informed stock selection decisions.

Our view is supported on a detailed DCF scenario analysis and valuation relative to its history and peers. Conservative assumptions get us to about a 15.5-16x target multiple on NTM EPS of $4.67, or $75 -- which compares to a sell-side range of $60-80 and average of $70.  And it would not be a stretch to justify a target multiple of 19x using academically derived WACC calculations.

193230,20568,2010-03-11T14:22:39-05:00,,"McKesson Corp. (MCK) reported in-line results for the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Earnings came in at $1.19 per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, and 13% above the year-ago profit of $1.05. Meanwhile, revenues increased 4% to $28.3 billion, driven by the strong performance of the Distribution Solutions business.Although the Distribution Solutions segment grew 4% to $27.5 billion, the loss of two customer buying groups in the U.S. continued to impact the performance of this segment. We believe performance will continue to be impacted by lost business through the remainder of the year.Meanwhile, Medical-Surgical distribution revenues increased 11% to $758 million, benefiting from small acquisitions made by the company in late fiscal 2009 and an increase in demand during the flu season. The Specialty Care Solutions business performed well mainly due to the launch of a generic product during the quarter.The Technology Solutions segment recorded a 3% increase in revenues. While service revenues grew 6%, reflecting the steady nature of the company’s products, software revenues were down 2%. Hardware revenues also declined ($23 million, down 32%), reflecting lower rates at which hardware is attached as part of system implementations and overall reduced hardware component costs.Guidance BoostedMcKesson once again raised its earnings guidance for fiscal 2010. The company boosted its previously issued guidance by 10 cents and now expects earnings in the range of $4.55−$4.70. McKesson should continue benefiting from the increased demand related to flu season in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. McKesson expects the strong flu season to contribute 35−40 cents to fiscal 2010 EPS.Estimate Revisions TrendDespite the company boosting its outlook for fiscal 2010, there were no estimate revisions in either direction for fiscal 2010 over the last 30 days. The lack of revisions is not surprising, as the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.61 is already within the new guidance range issued by McKesson.Fiscal 2010 earnings are slated to be in-line with expectations. In the past, McKesson has usually performed in-line or above expectations. While third quarter results were in-line with expectations, second quarter results were 5.94% above. On an average, McKesson has exceeded expectations by 12.05% over the past four quarters.Only one of the 21 analysts following the stock has raised their estimates for fiscal 2011 over the last 30 days. There have been no downward revisions during this period. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2011 is currently $4.73. We remain concerned about the sustainability of the positive impact of the strong flu season on McKesson’s performance going forward.Management estimates that the flu season will boost fiscal 2010 earnings by 35-40 cents. However, with the swine flu pandemic turning out to be less severe than expected, we believe the company will need to explore other business opportunities that would help sustain growth in fiscal 2011.Our TakeWe currently have a Neutral recommendation on McKesson Corp. McKesson is a major player in the pharmaceutical and medical supplies distribution market, and we believe that several factors like aging population, increased use of generics, growing demand for specialty pharmaceutical products, especially oncology drugs, should help drive growth in the Distribution Solutions segment.The Technology Solutions segment is also well-positioned for growth given the government’s focus on reducing healthcare costs and the expanded use of information technology systems.However, McKesson faces tough competition and the loss of two major customers in fiscal 2009 will continue to impact the company’s business through the remainder of fiscal 2010."
184853,21435,2010-01-27T15:53:43-05:00,,"On Tuesday, McKesson Corp. (NYSE:MCK) reported fiscal third quarter results that were in-line with expectations, and issued upbeat guidance for the rest of the year. However, the stock has dropped nearly 5% as of midday Wednesday because of an analyst’s downgrade at Leerink Swann & Co. to “market perform” from “outperform”. Perhaps the downgrade was due to overall valuation concerns as the stock had nearly doubled since the lows last March. However, considering the company was able to match earnings expectations and achieved better revenue growth than the experts thought, this seems a strange time to downgrade. We think that the market’s reaction to the downgrade offers an opportunity to buy a stock on weakness that has attractive value for long term investors.In the quarter, McKesson’s total revenue from pharmaceutical distribution grew by 2%, and growth was particularly strong in Canada. Company-wide revenue was 4% better than last year, coming in at $28.3 billion versus estimates of $27.7 billion. In addition to the better than expected sales, profit margins improved impressively to 2.03% from 1.66%. The improvement was due to a more favorable business mix as well as being the solitary distributor of H1N1 vaccines. That profit margin will not “wow” many people but the 22% improvement in gross margins really helps for a company that for the last two years has an asset turnover ratio over 4. This translated to earnings per share of $1.19, which was in-line with expectations.McKesson is optimistic about the current quarter and forecast earnings for the full year of $4.55 to $4.70, which compares favorably to current estimates of $4.55. The midpoint of that range gives a current P/E of 12.9x which is certainly not excessive. Furthermore, the new guidance implies earnings for the coming quarter will be between $1.23 and $1.38, and would be great sequential growth thanks largely to the peak of flu season.At Ockham, we continue to have an Undervalued stance on MCK because the stock still has significant appreciation potential. For example, over the past ten years the market has paid 15.5x to 24.8x cash earnings per share, but the current price-to-cash earnings multiple is just 12.7x. Sales growth has been steady and certainly is seeing a boost thanks to the 115 million H1N1 vaccines and other flu supplies that McKesson distributes. Based on current fundamentals, we believe a price in the high $60 would be a more reasonable price for this stock. We cannot comment on the reasoning behind the analyst’s downgrade today, but not a single analyst tracked by Yahoo finance has a negative rating on the stock. We think the market is overreacting to this analyst, which presents a decent buying opportunity.Original post"

35721,20215,2007-05-16T09:35:33-04:00,,"The big three distributors dominating the pharmaceutical distribution market in the US are Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH), McKesson Corp. (NYSE:MCK) and AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC). Market cap is approximately $26.6B, $17.9B and $9.8B respectively. For years this segment has enjoyed strong year over year growth in excess of 20% per annum. As stated in a previous article from 08/2006, organic growth was anticipated to slow down in 2007. Based on first quarter results (calendar year); this is precisely what has transpired. MCK revenue increased 6% YOY. Earnings however, were up 17%, beating the consensus by $0.06 per share. Out of the big three, MCK has outperformed its peers, so far and by far. Revenue Growth Back in August 2006 we calculated MCK's 2007 revenue growth coming in at 5.5%. Currently we are on track as the first quarter (FY2007 Q4) came in at 6% and is the easiest quarter to beat. The Wall Street Journal ran an article on 05/06/2007 calling MCK a possible acquisition target due to its above average free cash flow. As mentioned in the article, this is pure speculation as there are no indications that MCK is for sale. We would add that the premium to current prices would need to be substantial for the board to justify an endorsement. Expectations from MCK are high and Standard & Poor's analyst, Seligman, recently raised his target price to $79.00! We think this is a tad high. Current EOL (02/08) is pegged at $67.40. Perhaps had the stock not appreciated 18% from the beginning of 2007, there might be some merit to this speculation. Margins In this cut throat business, pharmaceutical distributors work on 1% to 3% margins. MCK put in a stellar quarterly performance due in part to higher margins on generics. It is uncertain if the above normal industry margins for generics is sustainable over the long term or will eventually revert to industry standards as competition sets in. For now (2007 & 2008), this is the bright spot. MCK is growing revenue in other higher margin areas such as its medical imaging unit. The risk to all the good news is the unlikely possibility of a deep recession. No one is suggesting that a recession in pharmaceutical wholesale in particular and health services in general is in the cards; as unlikely as it may be, one prepares for a downturn before it is upon them. Currently, we don't see MCK management taking any defensive cautionary steps. This could become an issue as early as 2008. The balance sheet today is strong enough to deal with unforeseen contingencies. Earnings per Share   MCK's Q4 results put a nice finishing touch to FY2007 (ended March). EPS came in at FY2007 $3.17 and Q4 $0.85. The CrossProfit 2007 calendar year EPS estimate from 02/2007 remains at $3.60.

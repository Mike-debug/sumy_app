4379180,69675,2020-10-15T06:35:20-04:00,"The management team at Allscripts was able to unveil hidden value by selling off a rather small operating unit of the company.
        The value of the deal was worth nearly as much as Allscripts' entire business.
        This is despite accounting for just 6% of sales, but there is a negative side to selling the unit.
        Management is creating an excellent opportunity here, but they need to be careful not to squander it.","Investing is a fascinating experience. When the world tells you, through a company’s share price, that a business represents a particular value, that is often more or less right. But not always. Sometimes the market misprices something and leaves assets on a firm’s books that are, in fact, worth far more than the market anticipates. From time to time these companies come to the public’s attention, but often only after some development that allows the business in question to realize the value they seek. Such is the case today with Allscripts Healthcare Solutions (MDRX), a provider of healthcare services and data tools. The business recently announced a sale of a minor part of its operations that will bring in gross proceeds to it and its shareholders nearly equivalent to Allscripts’ pre-announcement market capitalization. This development is incredibly bullish for the company, but it is important that management really put this capital to use if it wants to optimize shareholder value.According to a press release issued by Allscripts, the company has struck a deal to sell to WellSky Corp its CarePort Health operating unit. WellSky is a jointly-owned enterprise controlled by two private equity firms: TPG Capital, and Leonard Green & Partners. In exchange for CarePort, WellSky will pay to Allscripts a sum of $1.35 billion. This represents nearly all of the $1.38 billion market cap Allscripts was worth as of the time the announcement was made. Actual net proceeds will be some number lower due to taxes, but until management gives us what that figure is, we will be left in the dark. We shouldn’t have to wait long, though, because the expectation is for the deal to close later this year.CarePort falls under Allscripts’ Provider segment. This segment also includes other core operations of the firm, like its Hospitals and Health Systems business, its Ambulatory operations, FollowMyHealth, EPS, EIS-Classics, and 2bPrecise. The segment as a whole provides integrated clinical software applications, financial management, and patient engagement solutions, while Allscripts’ other segment, Veradigm, offers data insights with tools for clinical workflow, research, analysis, and more. Digging in more deeply, CarePort itself offers a wide array of services. These include discharge planning, transitional care management, the facilitation of payer-provider communication, patient management tools, and more.Exactly how large CarePort is, from a footprint perspective, is unknown to anybody who is not a company insider. On its website, Allscripts states that CarePort has covered services for 14 million people, that it is involved in 40% of the post-acute transitions to occur within the US. It also has operations throughout 43 states. All of this sounds large, but in the press release announcing the sale, the company said that CarePort serves only hundreds of hospitals and thousands of post-acute survivors.One might think that CarePort, to be worthy of such a high price relative to Allscripts’ market cap, would represent a significant portion of the company’s operations. This is not the case in at least one sense. According to management, CarePort accounted for just 6% of the company’s revenue during the trailing twelve months. This works out to about $104 million or so in sales from the company’s $1.72 billion over the same period of time. This implies a price/sales multiple on CarePort of 13. What’s more, it works out to a price/adjusted EBITDA multiple of about 21. It is important to put this in context though. While CarePort is not significant for Allscripts from a revenue perspective, the implied EBITDA works out to $64.3 million. For the company as a whole, EBITDA over the twelve months ending in June of 2020 was $39.3 million. So while the unit is not all that important for Allscripts’ top line, it is important for its bottom line.This brings us to the one thing that is critically important moving forward: that management allocate the capital it’s receiving from this deal intelligently. Allscripts as a business has not been doing well in recent years. In four of its five most recently-completed fiscal years, for instance, the business generated net losses. Its loss in 2019 was $182.18 million. Between 2017 and 2019 operating cash flow at the firm declined, dropping from $279.42 million to $46.25 million. This occurred even as revenue grew 18.3% over the same timeframe.2020, in some ways, has been better for Allscripts. Revenue in the first half of the year totaled $822.94 million. This is down 6.1% compared to the same time period last year. Its net loss, however, narrowed from $157.48 million in 2019’s first half to $27.96 million this year. Meanwhile, its operating cash flow turned from a negative $1.91 million in 2019 to a positive $18.94 million so far this year. These improvements should be viewed as more significant than the drop in sales, but they also underscore just how mediocre the company’s performance has been. Add to this that it has gross debt of $1.04 billion compared to cash and cash equivalents of just $205.20 million, and it’s clear that Allscripts could use the cash.It is because of the company’s poor financial condition that its market cap was so low, but now management has the opportunity to address its concerns. In its press release announcing the sale, the company said that it wants to use the cash for a mixture of investing in its other operations, paying down debt, and buying back stock. I am a fan of buying back stock when possible, but given the firm’s financial condition, something needs to change fundamentally first. If management has reason to believe that investing in its other operations will help the firm moving toward being earnings positive and cash flow positive for the long haul, it would be best to allocate most, if not all, of the proceeds in that direction. If there is any doubt about its ability to get far by investing capital in this manner, then paying down debt would be the next best solution. After all, with debt reduction there’s a guaranteed savings associated with interest expense.Based on the data provided, it’s clear that Allscripts made an excellent choice in selling off CarePort. On the top line, the unit is virtually insignificant to the business, but on the bottom line it does appear to be important to the firm. If the capital from this sale is used optimally, it has the potential to drastically improve the rest of the enterprise, but if management squanders this opportunity then the transaction could ultimately cause the business more harm than good."
4172213,101421,2018-05-10T11:50:37-04:00,Allscripts has agreed to acquire HealthGrid for an undisclosed amount.HealthGrid has created a mobile patient engagement system that promises to help Allscripts offer a more comprehensive solution.MDRX needs to continue to innovate internally or acquire technologies to take advantage of large market opportunities with healthcare system adoption of improved IT solutions.,"Quick TakeHealthcare IT firm Allscripts (MDRX) has announced an agreement to acquire HealthGrid Holding Company for up to $110 million in cash and earnouts.HealthGrid has developed a mobile patient engagement platform to help healthcare providers promote healthy behaviors among its user populations.MDRX’ stock has been flat in the past 12 months, so management needs to make bold moves to take advantage of the historic shift in EHR adoption underway in the healthcare industry.Orlando, Florida-based HealthGrid was founded in 2014 to develop mobile-centric patient engagement capabilities for caregivers, insurers and patients.Management is headed by co-founder and CEO Raj Toleti, who was previously founder and President of PatientPoint, an engagement program firm.Below is a brief overview video of HealthGrid’s approach:(Source: HIMSS)HealthGrid offers two primary solutions:No disclosed funding transactions are available, so the firm may have been bootstrapped by the founders.According to a 2016 market research report by Grand View Research, the global patient engagement market is expected to exceed $39 billion by 2024.The main drivers for this expected growth are the ‘rising prevalence of chronic conditions’ such as diabetes, which may be controlled through better and more frequent communication with patients.North America is forecasted to account for over 40% of global revenue through 2024 due to the impetus from government programs included in the Affordable Care Act [ACA] and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health [HITECH] acts.The Asia Pacific region is expected to be the fastest growing region with a CAGR of more than 20% during the forecast period.Major competitive vendors that provide patient engagement solutions include:Allscripts disclosed the acquisition price in an 8-K filing and said it would pay ‘$60 million in cash plus up to an aggregate of $50 million in earnout payments based on Health Grid achieving certain revenue targets over the next three years.’The firm did not announce any changes to its financial guidance, so the deal will not be material to its financial condition.MDRX is acquiring HealthGrid’s mobile-centric system to combine it with its existing FollowMyHealth offering.As Allscripts stated in the deal announcement,Acquiring HealthGrid will enable Allscripts to speed up its time to market and provide customers and prospects with a comprehensive solution, resulting in more customer wins.Over the past 12 months, MDRX stock has gyrated significantly, ending up essentially at the same level as it began the period, as the chart below indicates:(Source: SEEKING ALPHA)To break out of its doldrums, management is going to have to continue to make moves to increase the speed of innovation within the company, whether through internal initiatives or more likely through acquisitions as with HealthGrid.I hope MDRX is prepared to make more transformational deals to take advantage of the ongoing shift by healthcare systems to more advanced patient-centric systems.Management is taking an EHR-agnostic approach, so the HealthGrid deal should help with the offerings aligned with that approach.Time will tell if the firm's prospects and customers agree with that focus."
4095163,101421,2017-08-04T17:25:10-04:00,"Allscripts is acquiring the Enterprise Information Solutions unit from McKesson for $185 million in cash.EIS provides a range of hospital information management systems primarily focused on the small facility market.The deal is highly complementary to Allscripts and will add to its breadth of offerings, increase revenues and enable it to recognize cost synergies.","Quick TakeHealthcare IT company Allscripts (MDRX) announced an agreement to acquire the Enterprise Information Solutions business unit from McKesson (MCK) for $185 million in cash.EIS provides both clinical and financial IT software for hospital and health systems, especially smaller sized institutions.Allscripts is acquiring EIS as a complement to its Sunrise system for larger institutions and sees significant medium-term revenue upside combined with cost saving synergies in the short-term.Target CompanyEnterprise Information Solutions has been a division of McKesson’s whose portfolio of software includes:Management is headed by Nimesh Shah, who was previously VP Global Infrastructure Services at CSC.The paragon system is EIS’ flagship offering, and provides an EMR (Electronic Medical Record) system hospitals ranging from a 10-bed critical care facility to a 450-bed hospital.Acquisition Terms and RationaleAllscripts intends to pay $185 million in cash for the business unit and said it will do so out of ‘existing secured credit facilities and cash balances.’ (8-K Filing)Based on Allscripts’ cash flow performance and $89.1 million in cash, equivalents and restricted cash, it appears that the deal will not create an undue hardship on the company’s balance sheet.McKesson had begun the process of divesting itself of EIS in 2016, with its announcement that it would explore strategic alternatives for the group in order to start the bidding.McKesson chose to exit the EMR business and instead formed a new unit called Change Healthcare Holdings, which will include the majority of its technology solutions businesses.Allscripts management believes that EIS is a better fit for its focus in says that it will continue to invest in Paragon as its main solution for the small hospital market, while continuing to market its existing Sunrise system for larger institutions and complex service line needs.After transaction close, the company said the combination would double its current hospital client count in the United States.Allscripts clearly wants to be a one stop shop for care facility management requirements of any size.As Allscripts CEO Paul Black stated in the deal announcement,Concurrent with the deal announcement, Allscripts announced its second-quarter financial 2017 results, with all-time record bookings totaling $407 million. GAAP net loss was $154 million compared to $10 million in 2Q 2016.Cash flow from operations for the quarter totaled $34 million and adjusted EBITDA was $90 million, a 15% year-over-year increase compared to the same period in 2016.Additionally, management increased its non-GAAP revenue target for 2017 and its 3-Year CAGR targets for 2018-2020 as a result of the transaction.Notably, management sees significant synergies post-close as it removes duplicate positions in EIS which will result in administrative cost savings.Investors reacted positively to the financial news and possibly the acquisition news, sending the stock up 12.42% for a $1.45 per share gain, as the chart below shows,(Source: Seeking Alpha)The addition of EIS as a small hospital solution is a strong, complementary move by Allscripts and makes perfect sense.I write about M&A deals, public company investments in technology startups, insider activity, and IPOs.

2693825,41741,2014-11-19T23:07:42-05:00,Shares tumbled 15% in a day after missing 3Q consensus across the board.MDRX has Blue Harbour as an activist investor and is an even better buy after the selloff.MDRX's operational issues are addressable in an industry where bookings have been strong.,"Shares of Allscripts Healthcare Solutions (NASDAQ:MDRX) fell off a cliff after posting 3Q earnings of $0.06 that missed the $0.10 consensus and revenues of $345.4 million, which came in below the $353 million expectations.MDRX also posted 3Q bookings of $223 million, a 5.5% drop year-over-year and 4.7% sequentially, missing the $243 million consensus. Management noted that the year-over-year decline was due to a large agreement in 3Q13 with PIH Health. Excluding the impact of that agreement, bookings were actually up 16% year-over-year. And for the first nine months of 2014, bookings were up 8% from the same period in 2013.Yet, gross margins were down 130 basis points year-over-year in 3Q to 42.3%. That came in below consensus expectations of 43.2%. Again, this can be explained away by a one-time $5 million charge. Operating margin was up 182 basis points year-over-year to 6.57%, but still a long way from consensus expectations of 8.5%.Contract revenue backlog was up to $3.4 billion. MDRX continues to get contract wins with hospitals for its EHR systems. 3Q is seasonally MDRX's weakest quarter. Management also feels that it's still on track to hit its interim financial targets for 2014 to 2016. The notable standout here is, per management, that EBITDA is expected to grow at a 18% to 22% CAGR through 2016.Our initial coverage highlighted activist fund Blue Harbour's ownership and noted that the likely thesis for Blue Harbour is to push MDRX to improve operations in an effort to get margins back in line with peers and historical averages. Shares have modestly clawed their way back from the one-day 15% selloff earlier this month. But we're still below the $13-$14 price range we saw most of October.With a sub-$3 billion enterprise value, MDRX is the smallest of the three healthcare records management companies. Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN) has a $22 billion enterprise value and athenahealth (NASDAQ:ATHN) trades at $4.7 billion. It also has the most to gain from going private. Blue Harbour's experience in private equity, with founder Clifton Robbins being a former KKR partner, is a major factor when it comes to pitching MDRX's business model to PE funds.While shares of MDRX are down 7% over the last month, both ATHN and CERN are up over 10%. The market doesn't see MDRX's weakness as industry-driven, rather company-specific inefficiencies, which are items that can be addressed and remedied. Management noted along with 3Q earnings that it was seeing operating improvements. This despite the fact that its operating margin missed expectations.We made the bet earlier this month that MDRX was cheap. Well, now it has to be even cheaper, right? The valuation is certainly more compelling following the sell-off, with MDRX now trading sub 2x EV/sales. And, with MDRX still expected to grow EPS at a CAGR that's nearly double the industry average, 25x forward earnings isn't as expensive as it sounds. With a multi-year horizon, we're still buyers at these levels with this being a mid-cap activist portfolio holding."
1076241,24276,2012-12-20T17:05:05-05:00,,"I was suspicious of Allscripts (NASDAQ:MDRX) long before they dumped CEO Glen Tullman yesterday.The software as a service, or SaaS-based, health IT vendor was always suspiciously close to the Obama Administration, it seemed to me, and Tullman was briefly on the committee that eventually came up with the ""meaningful use"" standards that have helped dole out that sweet, sweet stimulus cash to the industry. The cash was based on a series of escalating capabilities, that must be fully realized by fiscal 2015 in order for companies to collect. After 2015, hospitals and clinics that have not automated will see reimbursement rates cut, so there's a stick to go along with the carrot.Tullman finally retreated from the political fray, and the strangest part of the whole corporate history was his agreement to buy Misys' health care operations, along with those of rival Eclypsis, in 2010, hence the strange ticker symbol.That deal never made sense to me. Allscripts was selling SaaS, Misys was pushing an open source story, Eclypsis was more like Cerner. And from what experts told me none really had a system that worked very well. The merger should be counted as a huge failure.Now it's all unraveled, with Tullman out as he was seeking to take the company private, replaced by a former Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN) executive, Paul Black.Cerner, however, is known for selling client-server systems based on Microsoft Windows, not SaaS services. SaaS, on the other hand, was always seen as advantaged in the final standards, since adjustments could be made to every customer's system at once.Still, Cerner simply put its head down and went back to the basic blocking-and-tackling upgrade cycle it had always used, with the same sales-oriented management team leading the way. The two stocks seemed to be moving in lock-step through the middle of 2010, but since then CERN has doubled in value while MDRX is now worth less than half what it was.In the end, MDRX became what computer nerds call a ""kludge,"" a collection of mismatched pieces that didn't work as a system. This is true of both the software and the organization, which never meshed after the Misys acquisition.There is a lesson to be learned here, and it's an old one. Having just a vision's no solution, everything depends on execution. Tullman had a vision but failed to execute. Hopefully, under Black there will be some execution, or at least an acquisition at a higher valuation than MDRX is currently stuck with.If I were of a speculative nature, I would buy MDRX here, at its bottom, and see what magic Black can pull out of his hat. I see CERN as fully valued, but it has proven to be a solid company.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

        How often in the past have they done what they are doing now?
        How sharp are they? How bad a cut have they made when they fell this way before?
        What has their ultimate recovery been worth?
        Well kid, do ya feel lucky?","Bargains sometimes come in time of stress. So do bad choices.Here are two today-illustrations of the proposition: Do you want to buy into the falling prices of either Allscripts Misys Healthcare Solutions (NASDAQ:MDRX) or Owens Illinois, Inc (NYSE:OI)? MDRX is a 21st Century software systems provider for the broad medical care industry, while OI has been producing glass containers for food and beverage products since the start of the 20th Century. Their investment considerations are brought together by the common problem of deciding when or whether an active investor might want to buy a stock currently getting cheaper.They're not alone, but come to our attention because they were adjacent to one another in our daily ranking of over 2300 equity investment alternatives, near the top (19th and 20th) of that list. Both are now being forecast by the hedging activities of market-makers [MMs] as offering near-future stock price gains very competitive with hundreds of equity alternatives.But both are good examples of how or whether to decide to reach out and catch something that could have either a timely reward - or a dangerous hurt. Let's start by looking at how the MMs have been seeing each, daily, during the past 6 months. First, OI:(used with permission)In this picture the vertical lines portray the range of prices implied as likely to occur in coming days, weeks, and months, not the past actual daily price ranges common to most stock ""charts."" Each MM forecast range is separated into upside and downside expectations by the end of day market quote at the time of the forecast.Today's forecast (at the far right) has practically no downside. Our measure for the balance between prospective gain and pain is the Range Index [RI], whose value is the percentage of the whole forecast range that lies below the market quote at the time of forecast. A low RI means the pros see it as cheap. The RI now is 1, and the thumbnail picture shows how extreme and infrequent that experience has been in the last 5 years of daily forecasts.Now here is the parallel for MDRX:Same 6-month daily history of MM forecasts. Its current RI is 11. This recent 126 days' record and the thumbnail picture are backed up by 4+ years of history, not quite the 5 years we would like . That still ought to be enough to draw reasonable conjectures about what may be coming.The single row of data below each of the Block Trader Forecast [btf] pictures helps build our thinking about that future.It repeats the current day forecast range, today's RI value, and a calculation of the potential upside price change from today's close price to the top of the forecast range. The remaining data to the right are the products of applying our standardized Time-Efficient Risk Management Discipline [TERMD] to all prior similar RI forecasts of the past 5 years.In each case a red-background panel of the Sample Size reflects our preference to have 20 or more instances of similarly-balanced RI forecasts to indicate what has happened before. In these cases, because of the low RI values and their typically infrequent appearances, that is not the concern that we would have were the RIs, say, 30 or 40.The rules of the TERMD are simple but inflexible as to subsequent judgments. A buy cost for each such RI position is established at the closing price of the next market day following the forecast. The position will be closed out at the first instance of an end of day price at or above the top of forecast range sell target, or failing that, on the 63rd market day after forecast. But not before. That keeps all results measurable on a common footing.So for MDRX, the 15 prior experiences produced an average net gain of +14.4% and on average had to be held 43 market days, for an annual rate of gain of +121%. Those 15 holdings included an average worst-case price drawdown at a -5.1% level of stress. Also in the negative considerations column is the win~loss odds experience. A 93 out of 100 Win Odds is the equivalent of 14 wins out of 15. Lastly, the credibility ratio compares the current upside sell target of +14.5% with the actual historic average gains from this level of RIs at +14.0%, a quite acceptable ratio of 1.0.All in all, a quite competitive TERMD scorecard. Let's look at OI's.The Sell Target here is smaller than for MDRX, at only +8.7%, but in its prior 18 like RI experiences, it achieved actual gains of +26.3% in only 34 market days for a staggering price gain AROR of +453%. Credibility of a current upside forecast less than 9% seems assured. Further, the 94 / 100 win odds are the product of an experience of 17 wins out of 18.But the average worst-case drawdown stresses at -8.8% suggest a prior price volatility that might get revisited in a present experience, making a reward vs. risk balance of 1 for 1 less attractive than in the case of MDRX with a +14% vs. a - 5%, or nearly 3 for 1.Now, here's the hard question, not easily answered by history. Still looking at OI, its price expectations as expressed by the way MMs are protecting themselves, has been pretty stable over the past several days.Rechecking their expectations for MDRX leaves the impression instead that still more price weakness may be there yet to be experienced.Okay, let's come back to what such a weakness may ""cost"". In the past the average stress has been seeing your investment in its worst moments down 5% below what you paid for it. Even if that average of worst prior experiences might contain one with no drawdown (a market-bottom pick) and one that was double the average, the worst-case worst case is still only down only -10%. If you're that much of a sissy, why don't you just buy an annuity?The ""cost"" of price volatility comes ONLY when the investor decides to lock in his/her loss of the present by selling, rather than see it possibly get worse, never to recover. The ""benefit"" of price volatility comes every time it does recover, including a gain to the level seen as likely. In MDRX such a recovery has happened in 93% of the times. Not bad odds against making that bad ""cost"" choice.Now, the same thinking applied to OI: After seeing the market pros repeat their conviction a number of days in a row that it is not getting worse, how likely is a -9%, or even an -18% likely to still be present 3 months from now? If seen at all? Forget that annuity nonsense.No, the choice here is between two very high odds for success situations, one with slightly larger interim stress possible and acceptably competitive profitable payoff in a reasonable two-month period (OI at +8½% target, compoundable 6 times a year for a +63% AROR) or the other (MDRX at +14½% target, about double OI's AROR when compounded, but perhaps with some greater uncertainty about a less-well-defined interim experience.)ConclusionIs your glass half-full or half empty? How important to you is assurance of success under less uncertain conditions? Does thirst for excitement or real pressure for more rapid growth in capital rank high in your preference? It's your call, knowing that there are hundreds of worse choices out there now than either of these two good ones.Well kid, do ya feel lucky? Or is it just time to be sensible and get on with making sound choices? Both can be a good decision, compared to lots of others.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

        Leading Blue Harbour to take notable interest.
        This $2.5 billion market cap company is an interesting play on health records.","The activist hedge fund, Blue Harbour Group, upped its stake in Allscripts Healthcare (NASDAQ:MDRX) last month -- now owning 7%. At the end of last year both Blue Harbour Group owned just under 5% of MDRX. Blue Harbour is the activist fund founded in 2004 by Clifton Robbins -- who cut his teeth as partner at KKR. Blue Harbour was instrumental at unlocking value at another favorite stock of ours, Nabors Industries.But as far as MDRX goes, it has been a relative underperformer of late, down 3% for the last twelve months.This $2.5bn market cap company is a key player in the health record business. Essentially, its a software provider for hospitals and other outpatient facilities. It's one of only three companies that are major players in the industry, operating alongside athenahealth (NASDAQ:ATHN) and Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN).The top line should continue growing for all three -- where the demand for collecting, managing and analyzing patient data will only increase. The only issue has been that like government, healthcare is a slow adopter of technological change.MDRX traded below $10 a share a couple times in 2012 as its margins took a beating. HealthCor Management stepped in as an activist investor, suing the company to shake up management and getting the company to consider selling itself. And as HealthCor appears to be cutting its stake in the company, Blue Harbour is taking up the torch.Even still, MDRX's continued stock underperformance is tied to its issues with margins. Its EBITDA margin is 2.1% -- which is a cool 600 basis points below ATHN and 2,400 basis points below CERN. There's a lot of opportunity there. And as bad as things were in 2013 in terms of margins, they are slowly getting better.However, the valuation discount doesn't appear to be justified as the issues are fixable. MDRX trades at 2.2x EV/sales, while ATHN trades at 6.8x and CERN trades at 6.4x. And Vista Equity recently bought out Tibco Software at 7x recurring software revenue -- MDRX trades at 4x. We think Blue Harbour's experience with private equity is a positive here, where there's continued interest in buying up software companies at high-single digit multiples of revenues.MDRX's expected earnings CAGR is well above the industry average.

In Part 1 we looked at the opportunity created in Maxwell, in this segment we examine Allscripts.*Source Yahoo FinanceAllscripts Healthcare SolutionsAllscripts is the leading provider of Electronic Health Record technologies, practice management and other clinical, revenue cycle, connectivity and information solutions for physicians, hospitals & post-acute organizations. The company provides customers a complete portfolio of clinical, financial, analytics and connectivity solutions, and has an existing client base of 180,000 physicians, 1,500 hospitals and 10,000 nursing homes, homecare agencies and other post acute organizations, according to the company, the largest network in healthcare. The company offers solutions through both traditional on premise delivery or ever so trendy SaaS (software as a service) cloud versions available on-demand over the Internet using a web browser.The current company structure is the result of an August 24, 2010 merger with Eclipsys Corporation. The goal of the merger was to create a larger, more competitive and complete solutions provider within the healthcare information technology industry. The combined company claims to own ""the industry's largest network of clients on the most advanced product platform resulting in a single patient record"", providing better and greater opportunity to address the $40 billion Health Care IT market. The company claims integrated Electronic Health Records will help reduce some of 98,000 deaths per year caused by medical errors, and reduce costs in a rising cost environment currently suffering from significant spending waste as a result of inefficiencies and misuse.Catalysts for GrowthThe company lists a variety of positive growth catalysts going forward including low market penetration of EHR as they estimate only ~ 12% of physician practices and ~11% of hospitals are currently using EHRs. They also reference a variety of government initiatives that are expected to drive adoption. The anti-kickback Stark Safe Harbor legislation and the President Barack Obama endorsed American Recovery & Reinvestment Act (ARRA) are both expected to accelerate EHR adoption in the coming years.ARRA provides financial incentives through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to physicians and hospitals that prove they have adopted and are using Electronic Health Record (EHR) technology. The ARRA law provides for what is expected to be over $30 billion in funds supporting health information technology utilization. President Obama had this to say on the subject:Jim Cramer Was on BoardOn a segment of Mad Money from November 7, 2011, he focused on the improving prospects for MDRX in an interview with CEO Glenn Tullman. From the transcript of the show:The Bloom is Off the RoseThe party ended last Thursday for Allscripts when the company reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit, forecast weak full-year results and also announced the resignation of its CFO, three directors and board Chairman Phil Pead. That was quite a barrage of bad news and shareholders didn't take it well, sending shares plunging 42 percent in premarket trade on Friday. Citigroup analyst George Hill said the results were strongly disappointing and downgraded the company's stock to ""neutral"" from ""buy."" Hill was most troubled by the loss of long tenured CFO Bill Davis, who had been the public face of Allscripts to investors for many years, saying: ""We suspect CEO Glen Tullman won a power struggle at the 11th hour leading to the board departures.""Enough to Change Cramer's MindHere was Cramer's response to the news on Mad Money: ""Sell, sell, sell. When I see that kind of wholesale resignation...a CFO leaving...I'm glad I put it on the Sell Block.""This implies he had already changed his mind on the stock before this and I believe him, but now that it is 50% off its 52 week high and down 40% in one day I don't think this is where you sell. Cramer did interview CEO Tullman again on February 22, 2012. The interview was summarized in this article on Seeking Alpha, including this passage:The Thesis RemainsI believe all the positive catalysts remain in place for Allscripts and I established a small position at $9.28 in the selloff on Friday. The management changes create some uncertainty but I believe that was more than reflected in the stock reaction. The value of its network and the market potential remain significant. Even after the haircut to estimates, the company is expecting 2012 revenues of over $1.5 billion and earnings of .77/share. Looking to 2013, estimates are for revenues to grow to $1.64 billion with earnings of .94/share.On Friday morning when the market offered me shares at less than 10x forward earnings I felt the situation presented a very attractive risk reward scenario. The shares have since rebounded almost 20% from those levels and now I think the stock is more of a wait and see. If the market gives me another opportunity around $9/share, I will consider another purchase.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
2261313,24361,2014-06-11T11:15:21-04:00,"Allscripts seems to have resolved the serious client retention issues of a few years ago, but it has yet to be seen if large R&D investments will pay off.Population health is a legitimate growth opportunity, and a market segment where larger players like Cerner are not so firmly entrenched.Trading well above its historical EBITDA and revenue multiples, the market already expects a significant improvement in growth from Allscripts' turnaround efforts.","The executive management team at healthcare IT company Allscripts Healthcare Solutions (NASDAQ:MDRX) has already accomplished quite a bit to its credit. Product quality has improved, clients have better product roadmaps, and higher investments in R&D should enhance the company's long-term competitiveness. The company has also carved out a solid position in the emerging population health space.All of that said, Allscripts has just kept pace with Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN) over the past one to two years, and lagged growth darling athenahealth (NASDAQ:ATHN). Not only is the healthcare IT space brutally competitive in the largely penetrated acute care setting, but the company has not yet proven that its transition to a recurring revenue model (including SaaS) will support healthy margins. Allscripts does not look all that cheap, which is quite common in the healthcare IT space, though the company's relative valuation will hold more appeal to those investors who believe management can deliver EBITDA growth in the high teens or low 20%'s in the coming years.M&A Has Provided Growth, But At A CostGrowth-by-acquisition strategies are not uncommon in the software space, and healthcare IT has been no exception. Both Allscripts and athenahealth have turned to acquisitions to augment their internal development efforts, broaden the addressable markets, and gain share-of-wallet with healthcare clients.In the case of Allscripts, that has come with a particular cost - a disparate set of systems that runs counter to the integration and interoperability that clients want. The problem with consolidating platforms is that it risks alienating customers and seeing them go elsewhere, and so Allscripts has found itself stuck in a ""damned if they do, damned if they don't"" process of slow integration, while rivals like Cerner leverage their stronger integrated offerings to gain more and more large deals in the space.Population Health Coming Along NicelyGoing back to the more positive angle of Allscripts' acquisition history, the company's foray into population health seems to be going pretty well. The acquisition of dbMotion brought in (among other capabilities) the ability to create a single patient record from various electronic medical record vendors, while Jardogs' vendor-agnostic patient portal (FollowMyHealth) also aids interoperability and connectivity.Population health is a big emerging area within healthcare IT. Boiling it down to a basic level, population health means using electronic data to manage the health outcomes for groups of patients through functions like data aggregation, risk stratification, care coordination, and outreach. Hospitals are increasingly seeing a push towards a pay-for-results (or ""Fee for value"") model, whether in the form of Medicare/Medicaid's punitive responses to re-admissions that exceed a threshold level for various conditions/procedures or hospital-payer collaborations that likewise focus on outcomes as opposed to procedures.While it may be a little while yet before hospitals really see a fee-for-value reimbursement model take hold, population health has grown to 20% of Allscripts' revenue (in Q1 2014) and has remained more than one-third of bookings. As rivals like Cerner and Epic are less entrenched in this space, and no vendor as of yet really has the full suite of products/capabilities that clients need, it's a valuable opportunity for Allscripts.Still Waiting For The Fruits Of The TurnaroundI believe that Allscripts management has done a good job of fixing many of the problems that led to a pretty tough 2012 (particularly with customer renewals/defections) and recent bookings growth (up more than 50% in Q4 and more than 25% in Q1) does suggest an upward trajectory in the business. The question is whether Allscripts can continue to show the sort of progress that will be needed to justify today's above-average multiples.Growth in population health management is certainly welcome, but client retention and contract extensions remains an important metric, particularly with Cerner and Epic flexing their muscles within the larger healthcare system segment and athenahealth working hard to gain share. Management also needs to show that the significant R&D investments that are presently pressuring/impairing earnings power will lead to real results in terms of interoperability and overall improvements in the electronic medical records platforms.There are also still outstanding questions regarding the company's business model transition. The software as a service model has come to healthcare IT and Allscripts is orienting its business towards a larger year-to-year contribution from recurring revenue. It still remains to be seen whether or not the transition to a SaaS model can allow for the sort of margins that bullish analysts are projecting, and it is likewise uncertain whether the company can reach that critical mass where the margins for service delivery and hosting will meaningfully and significantly scale up.Growth, But Enough Of It?I do believe that Allscripts will show pretty good long-term growth. The core acute care market is pretty well penetrated, but Cerner believes that as much as 50% of the electronic medical records market could be up for competitive takeaway. I'm looking for Allscripts to log long-term revenue growth of 5% to 6% a year, with upside/downside coming from the maturation of the population health opportunity and Allscripts' ultimate fate as a share-taker or loser.I do also expect Allscripts to see better margin leverage, as those prior R&D investments translate into revenue and the company moves past the growing pains of its shift toward a model more focused on recurring revenue. I believe the company can ultimately achieve a mid-teens FCF margin, which would support annual FCF growth of more than 20%, albeit off of a low base (growth averaging over 40% over the next five years, slowing to growth of around 11% a year in the next five years after that).The Bottom LineIf Allscripts management keeps this turnaround going, I see a very good chance of impressive-looking growth at the EBITDA, operating income, and FCF lines. The ""but"" is that a lot of that is already worked into expectations. These shares already trade at a mid-teens multiple to the average 2014 EBITDA estimate, versus a historical multiple of about 9.5x, and the shares likewise do not look like much of a bargain by discounted cash flow.Healthcare IT stocks generally get a higher than normal premium, but I'm not entirely confident that such a premium is deserved or sustainable. Allscripts shares seem to have stabilized after a pretty ugly run, but I'd need to see even more of a pullback before getting all that interested, even if these shares are around 25% below the average sell-side price target.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

102621,20444,2008-10-29T08:50:13-04:00,,"I am getting incrementally bullish on the investment thesis underlying Allscripts (NASDAQ:MDRX). Allscripts, which is the nation’s leading electronic health records (EHR) and e-prescribing player, recently merged with Misys Healthcare (a unit of UK-based Misys plc), itself a major player in the practice management systems (scheduling/billing) arena. The deal was announced back in March and closed on October 10th. On Monday, Allscripts was in New York City presenting their story to the street as well as explaining the rationale behind the deal. Here are some quick notes I put together; as readers will see, the opportunities for this company are many and large in dollar terms,and assuming management can execute operationally on this merger’s proposed synergies, the shares should rebound once the overall market recovers in 2009.Investors with a 24 month outlook, at least, may want to model MDRX out for themselves and scale into a position at the currently depressed price level.Obviously, beta risk is insanely heightened right now, but health care should provide relative outperformance in these turbulent times given weak correlation with macroeconomic shocks and the propensity of most HC companies to avoid leverageThe combined company will have a physician base of 150,000 and 700 hospitals and aim to help physicians provide better care for their patients. Management is looking for a $715M top line number for the year, 50% of which should be recurring. Misys was especially interested in using Allscripts to lessen its dependence on Western Europe banking customers and Allscripts, meanwhile, saw in Misys a large installed base of physicians to cross sell its clinical software. Within that base, only one third currently have EHR. MDRX CEO Glen Tullman noted that the Misys/Allscripts integration is well underway, with a 13 team and 230-member salesforce already trained on the cross-selling opportunities and company-wide prerogative to support existing products. MDRX wants to make life for customers easier. As Tullman joked, “our customers want one throat to choke.” I expect margins to continue to come under pressure in 2009 buy should stabilize in 2010 as the merger synergies begin to materialize and they spread their overhead over a larger sales base. Information technology in health care is on everyone’s mind as the election nears; no matter who ends up in the White House, management thinksthe push for health care reform will benefit their business: containing medical costs is the biggest health care policy the US has to wrestle with. Politics aside, the aging population and escalating costs of health care (17% of GDP and more on a per capita basis than any other country although we rank far from highest in terms of quality) will drive demand for MDRX services. It should be no news to anyone that physicians in the US are spending more time doing paperwork than they are helping patients; moreover, preventable medical errors result in an estimated 100,000 deaths every year (1.5 million adverse drug events and $880 million in unnecessary expenses). The Rand Corporation estimates that IT like Allscripts’ software has the potential to save health care stakeholders as much as $162B a year. In the US, 70% of the physicians practicing have yet to deploy EHR, a $5B market opportunity for MDRX, which dominates the ePrescribing space in terms of users and script volume.  80% of HC spending begins with the physician.MDRX will likely benefit from the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (HR 6331) passed by Congress. This Act incentivizes physicians to implement ePrescribing. Physicians who begin now will see a 2% increase in Medicare payments for 2 years while physicians who do not will see a 1% cut beginning in 2011 and a 2% cut after 2013. Every industry in the, US, except health care, has utilized IT to cut costs, improve quality, and facilitate delivery. But that is rapidly changing, and MDRX is in the sweet spot of the market. As health care delivery in our country becomes increasingly automated, MDRX will enjoy the benefits of being the go to player in this field and most recognized EHR brand among physicians. My next goal will be to find a floor valuation for this stock and I will post that as soon as I am done. Prospective investors should keep in mind that a 17-22x PE is not unreasonable for this company and that management is using “conservative” estimates in what they are providing analysts. Assuming MDRX hits its 2008 EPS target and we use an industry mean P/E of 17, the stock has at least $2 dollars in upside. Disclosure: none"

Misys CEO Mike Lawrie came out smelling like a rose, and is now head of Computer Sciences Corp. But Allscripts, which was billing itself as a Software as a Service outfit at the time of the Misys deal, was always going to have trouble merging disparate product lines. Losing Gomez should have been investors' clue to get out.Why was Tullman in such a hurry for market share? Blame it on that sweet, sweet stimulus cash.CEO Tullman was always a political player. He was on the board of the health IT industry's certification committee before becoming part of the committee that drafted the ""meaningful use"" rules under which $19.2 billion in HITECH stimulus cash is now being handed out. Play the government game too long and you're very likely to take your eye off the ball.With the firing of Eclypsis' former head, Phil Pead, plus three board members supporting him, plus the exit of Chief Financial Officer Bill Davis Tullman looks like the captain of the Titanic. Offering access via iPad is not going to solve the problem.Analysts are surprised, given the earnings miss, that Tullman is staying while Pead is being shown the door. Some are calling for Tullman's head. But that would just leave Allscripts headless.There are assets here. The company does have software used by clinics and hospitals that could be upgraded centrally. It's in the right place on the technology map. You could even call it a ""cloud"" medical software vendor.But even with the latest drop in price the company is still larger, by market cap, than anyone else in the SaaS records business. It's logical that rivals like Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN), McKesson (NYSE:MCK) or privately-held Epic might be interested, but what Allscripts needs right now is an operations person, someone who knows software, not a financial engineer.An insurance company like UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) or Aetna (NYSE:AET) might come in, or a mainline tech company like Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) or Dell (DELL-OLD) that wants market share might be interested.But to attract a bid Allscripts has to fall harder than it's bound to fall today. Wait for this dead cat to bounce before you even think of getting in. And sell at the first sign of a bid.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Healthcare institutions, private clinics and medical personnel are increasingly taking advantage of the advances in technology. For proper medical services to be provided, information such as patient's historical record and treatment history are of crucial importance. With different hospitals and medical personnel using different systems for managing patient data, it became very difficult to integrate such information for the larger benefit of the community. Eyeing this opportunity in the health sector, many IT companies started providing software that would allow the sharing of patient's medical information on a generic platform.Source: Company Presentations, McKinsey & CompanyThe above diagram shows the large and dynamic market that is waiting to be exploited by companies developing solutions for the healthcare sector. The market needs clinical, connectivity, financial and information solutions for the increasing complexities of the healthcare sector. These services are needed by health systems, hospitals, physicians and post-acute organizations.One company that is involved in developing such solutions for hospitals and medical personnel alike is Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc. (NASDAQ:MDRX). Founded in 1986, the company focused on information technology from an early stage. In 2008, Allscripts merged with rival Misys and in 2010, the company went through another merger with a major healthcare information technology company called Eclipsys. Allscripts allows its users in the healthcare sector to shift to the new age of accountable care. Allscripts' experience in delivery technology allows it to offer comprehensive solutions that help coordinate care, engage patients and make use of analytics to help support the healthcare provider. Through analytics, the healthcare providers are able to provide superior services by improving the quality and efficiency of patient care.Allscripts offers a wide range of solutions. The company provides management and safe transfer of Electronic Health Records (EHR), mobility solutions and a wide array of services for physician practice and hospital & health systems.Source: Company PresentationsThe above bar chart shows the market share of Allscripts by practice size. Allscripts is the largest provider of healthcare solutions in three categories and the second largest for the remaining three categories. This shows us that Allscripts is widely recognized in the market and its services are largely successful in delivering their results.Allscripts' Recent PerformanceCompanies such as Allscripts have tremendous opportunities for growth because of their smaller size and relatively large market potential. Historically, Allscripts has been able to report solid revenue figures.Source: Company PresentationsThe above bar chart shows that the company has done extremely well in the period, which starts from the year 2007 and ends at the year 2011. From 2011 onwards, the company started reporting stable sales.Source: Company PresentationsAnother important performance metric is the cash flow from operations (NASDAQ:CFO). In the same period during which Allscripts reported great increase in its revenues, we see that the CFO figures for the company increased substantially too. After 2011, the CFO figures saw a downtrend.Generally, we see the company performed well historically but somehow its growth got halted and its cash flows started to deteriorate. One of the primary reasons for this situation was Allscripts' inability to benefit from the acquisition of Eclipsys Corp. Allscripts wanted to expand its sales with the acquisition of this software company but the company lost most of its business to competitors such as Cerner Corp. (NASDAQ:CERN). The losses from the recently acquired Eclipsys Corp. became very evident in the year 2012 and cost the then CEO of Allscripts his job. Mr. Paul Black was appointed as the new CEO and it was immediately suspected that Allscripts would now have a change in its overall focus.Road to RecoveryAfter being appointed as the CEO, Black immediately declared his strategy for the revival of the company. In an address to the shareholders, Black said that his goals were to increase operational efficiencies, retain the existing clients and to freshen the company's line of products. This recent news suggests that Black's strategy has started to take effect.Allscripts has recently acquired two health management software and service providers. The first company is called Jardogs LLC and the second one goes by the name of dbMotion. The acquisition would allow Allscripts to give new life to its existing portfolio of products.Jardogs LLC is a provider of healthcare services and it specializes in patient kiosks and mobile-based technology for tablet PCs and smartphones. Allscripts will make Jardogs' portal available across all of its products.DbMotion on the other hand is an Israeli medical software maker. The company has developed a system, which allows information sharing between different healthcare providers securely. Allscripts reported that these acquisitions will make it realize a low EPS figure in the year 2013 but the figure would increase substantially in the year 2014.Glimmer of HopeSalford Royal has recently activated Allscripts' electronic health record system. Sunrise Clinical manager (SCM) is the name of the healthcare solution, which Salford has implemented. This is great news for Allscripts because Salford Royal is one of UK's highest regarded healthcare provider and through investment into this innovative solution, it hopes to provide improved quality and safe treatment for its 238,000 patients. This goes to show that Black's strategy of providing a broad range of healthcare solutions is a good fit for the organization.ConclusionHealthcare sector in the United States is in the age of great structural change. The healthcare providers have started to use integrated healthcare solutions, which provide greater value and flexibility to them. Allscripts is one of the leading providers of healthcare solutions. With many years of experience in the industry, it was performing really well until the year 2012 when a bad decision changed the fate of the company. With the new CEO, the company is back on track making structural changes, which have given new hope for its revival as a healthcare tech leader. Due to the above stated reasons, I would give a buy stance to investors as the future looks bright for Allscripts now.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Revenue and EPS missed, but the focus should be on 2Q clinical software bookings growing 30% YOY to $52MM+. This was below Jeffco's lofty est. of $54MM but more importantly above the Street's perceived bogey of $50MM.
Novant selecting MDRX's practice management is a huge success for MDRX, because it means Novant is scrapping GE/IDX PM for MDRX. Jeffco believes this reveals an opportunity for MDRX to replace IDX at other customers.
MDRX reaffirmed '07 guidance, which implies a steep ramp in back half. Mgmt. stated that it has increased confidence in attaining guidance, and for the firm, they take comfort in strong 2Q bookings. Any weakness from 2Q miss is a buying opportunity as $52MM+ of bookings (w/o mega-deals & ~80% seq. growth) should ease fears of slowdown.
Reiterates Buy and $33 target.
Notablecalls: Bookings is what these stocks trade on. The stock got hit in after hours action and we have some firms lowering their estimates and targets this AM. I think MDRX is a bounce candidate as expectations coming into the quarter were not high given recent misses. The growth in ambulatory EMR/PM market continues to be OK.

19674,23899,2006-11-01T08:06:22-05:00,,"Allscripts Healthcare (NASDAQ:MDRX) provides software and clinical information services to physicians and hospitals. The company is involved in what's known as the electronic medical records business, or EMR. Specifically, MDRX makes software that allows physicians to manage patient records. In addition, the firm's software allows hospitals to access patients' records electronically as needed, including in emergency medical situations. The software also facilitates communication between doctors and pharmaceutical companies and helps physicians manage the ongoing treatment of patients with chronic diseases. Competitive Advantages  Allscripts Healthcare benefits from a large base of existing customers. As one of the first movers in the EMR industry, MDRX was among the first to start signing up doctors offices and hospitals to use its software. These physicians are already comfortable using MDRX systems, and they understand how the systems work. Therefore, they are likely to keep buying MDRX product updates as opposed to switching providers and learning a new system. In addition, we like MDRX's strategy of modular software architecture. This means customers can use parts of MDRX software alongside their existing software -- they don't have to buy the system as a package. This opens up the opportunity for customers using other software to test out Allscripts' products, thereby driving new customer growth. Growth Drivers  Healthcare costs have been rising rapidly in recent years. In fact, the costs associated with hospital stays, outpatient care, and pharmaceuticals are all growing much faster than inflation. One of the reasons for this: the U.S. healthcare system has some striking inefficiencies. The government estimates that the U.S. healthcare system wastes as much as $300 billion per year in unnecessary costs and excessive red tape. Two years ago, President Bush highlighted one of the most glaring problems -- the industry's failure to use technology to automate and streamline basic services and bookkeeping. For example, while there have certainly been quantum leaps in the quality and scope of drugs available to consumers over the past century, most prescriptions are still filled the same way they were 100 years ago. Prescriptions are written on small pads and are physically transferred to a pharmacy in order to be filled. Paper copies of those prescriptions are then held at the pharmacy and in patients' physical records at their doctor's office. While this might seem a small point, estimates by the Rand Corporation suggest the healthcare industry could save more than $160 billion annually by eliminating paper records and instead keeping records in digital form. This would also enable faraway hospitals to access patient information quickly and easily. Prescriptions could also be filled electronically, with doctors transmitting prescriptions and authorizations for refills directly to pharmacies. Electronic prescriptions also offer better safety and accuracy by eliminating the confusion sometimes caused by handwritten prescriptions. Furthermore, insurance requests and Medicare documents can also be automatically filled out and transmitted. To realize these efficiencies, the government and insurance companies are pushing EMR technology, and hospitals and physicians' offices are starting to make the shift. But that shift is still in the early stages -- MDRX should enjoy years of growth ahead as the healthcare system embraces information technology as a means of cutting costs and improving safety. Valuation and Outlook  MDRX trades at a little over 21 times 2007 earnings estimates. That represents a considerable discount to the company's +30% annualized long-term growth rate. It's unusual for a company in the healthcare industry to trade at a discount to its growth rate -- typically, the stable demand for healthcare warrants a premium valuation. It's not hard to imagine MDRX trading at 30 times next year's earnings -- roughly $32 -- over the next year or so. With the government actively pushing this technology, EMR spending may actually accelerate in coming years. Therefore, Allscripts' anticipated +30% growth rate could prove to be conservative. As a result, shares of MDRX could continue to deliver market-beating gains for years to come. MDRX 1-yr chart:  Disclosure: Author has no position in MDRX"

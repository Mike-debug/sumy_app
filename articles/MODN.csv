I'm recommending the same approach again.","Since I last looked at Model N Inc. (NYSE:MODN), the shares are up about 45%, against a gain of 4.25% for the S&P 500. The company has published some more financial statements since then, so I thought I'd look in on the name to see if it's worth buying at these levels. I'll review the most recent fiscal year's financial performance and will look at the stock as a thing distinct from the company. I'll also assess the ""switch to calls"" strategy that I outlined in my previous article. For those who are just too excited to wait until the end of this article, I'll come to the point. While there are several reasons to be increasingly optimistic about this name, I think all of that good news is baked into the price. I think the shares are dangerously overpriced at these levels, and the prudent move remains switching out of the shares and into call options as proxies. This worked out relatively well in the past, and I think it will do so again.I was reasonably pleasantly surprised by the financial performance at Model N over the past fiscal year. In spite of the fact that revenue declined by 8.6% from the prior period, key drivers of prior losses also declined. In particular, G&A expense was down about 35% from the prior period. Additionally, long-term debt declined fully 15% from the same time last year, and the capital structure is very solid (cash and equivalents swamp long term debt). Before readers worry that I've turned into a bull here, I will point out that losses persist, obviously. These losses need to be financed somehow, and this has led to further dilution, with share count up by ~6% over the year. In my view, the financial performance here has been relatively good, though I would like to see the company turn a profit before I give it a clean bill of financial health.Source: Company filingsI think it's always a good idea to look at the stock itself, as a thing distinct from the business, as stocks are often driven by fears and manias that have little to do with the underlying. Since they're so often such poor proxies, we need to look at them as separate animals.During the most recent conference call, Jason Blessing expressed a fair bit of confidence about the future by pointing out that the company exceeded expectations for the quarter. It seems that the executive team at Model N is quite optimistic about the future. To quote Blessing directly,Of particular interest is the fact that the company won several key victories during the most recent quarter. For example, ""a longtime customer, multi-billion dollar medical device leader selected Model N to help power its multi-year strategy."" There's optimism aplenty, but in my view, optimism is a dangerous thing in a stock. If the market's expectations get ahead of themselves, sooner or later, the company will disappoint, and the stock will decline in price. For that reason, I generally want to avoid stocks that have too much optimism priced in.I judge the optimism embedded in a stock in a number of ways, but in particular, I focus on the simple ratio between price and some measure of economic value (earnings, free cash, operating cash and the like.) The following chart describes this relationship well in my view.Data by YChartsWhen I last wrote about the name, I was worried about (some would say 'went on about') the price to free cash flow of ~80. The shares have since gotten even more optimistically priced in my view, which obviously enhances the risk here.When I last published on this name, I suggested that this stock is a poor investment because of the valuation. That said, I thought there was a great chance that the crowd would lift the shares higher, and the crowd obliged. So, I wanted investors to switch out of the dangerously priced shares, but maintain exposure to upside from the crowd's mania. In particular, I suggested that investors sell the shares and buy the February 2020 Model N calls with a strike price of $20. At the time, the bid ask spread on these was $2.15 to $2.85. These calls have been pulled along with the stock, having last traded hands at $11.20, for an $8.35 (290%) gain. The shares, by contrast, are up exactly $10. This situation perfectly encapsulates the impact and value of replacing shares with call options in my view. Although the shares would have generated an extra $1.65 in gains over the call options, they would have done so by employing an extra $17.65. I think an extra $1.65 for much higher levels of capital deployed isn't worth it on a risk-reward basis.I think the price action we've seen at Model N further vindicates the ""switch to call"" strategy for these sorts of stocks. An investor would have received fully 83.5% of the gains, while risking only 14% of the capital. While I'm not myself a Model N long, I would recommend, again, that investors switch to calls.Specifically, I think it would be prudent for bulls in this name to sell the calls I recommended earlier to lock in the gains (what the market giveth, the market can taketh away), and buy near at the money calls. Specifically, I recommend the May 2020 calls with a strike of $30. These are currently bid-asked at $2.80-3.00. In my view, if an investor switches out of the shares, they gain access to much of the upside from this stock, at a fraction (~11%) of the capital at risk.Before switching to calls, I think investors should be aware of the risks inherent in call options relative to shares. The great thing about calls is that they have a limited lifespan. I consider this a great positive for calls because it forces us to revisit our investment theses often. Like many things, though, the greatest benefit is also the greatest weakness. The fact that calls expire means that it is quite possible for shares to languish while the call exists, causing it to lose 100% of its value. I've sometimes been frustrated by watching shares skyrocket a few weeks after calls I owned expired. In my view, calls are less risky than shares because they require less capital. That said, shares never expire (though they can languish for years, which is as bad in my view). If an investor is comfortable switching out of the shares and into calls, they should be willing to buy calls again at an appropriate strike price and duration if and when the calls I'm recommending here expire.I think 2019 was a good year for Model N, and it may be the case that the company is on its way to profitability. The company certainly demonstrated that they can reduce costs when sales drop, and I consider that dynamism critically important. In addition, there are many reasons to conclude that the company is at the beginning of a long and profitable journey. The problem from my perspective is the valuation. The stock was very expensive when I last looked in on the name, and now, it's very, very expensive. I think switching from shares to calls offers the greatest risk-reward for investors here. If investors followed my advice last time, they would have achieved over 80% of the upside the stock has delivered, with only 14% of the risk. I recommend this approach here again. I think the stock is too risky a bet, but there's a good chance that it'll be driven higher. Call options represent the best way to exploit this situation now as they did this past July."
4359151,103480,2020-07-17T18:31:59-04:00,"Model N has seen performance improve dramatically since focusing its strategy on the cloud.Its most recent quarter showed accelerating revenue growth.Margins have also improved dramatically as the company's mix of subscription revenues grew.Model N remains reasonably valued at ~8x forward revenues, and as a smaller ~$1 billion company, the company can be viewed as an M&A target.","Model N (MODN), a revenue management software company that is focused on clients in the life sciences and healthcare space, has been a largely overlooked stock this year. Model N is one of the few software companies that has failed to see its stock price meaningfully expand in the wake of the coronavirus, with shares roughly flat year-to-date. As most of Model N's software sector peers continue to notch untenable valuation multiples, this company is worth a second look - especially as Model N begins to ramp up its efforts to move its customers over to a recurring, cloud-based model.Data by YChartsAside from its recent growth in cloud, which we'll cover in depth in this article, there are two other highlights in Model N that stand out to me.The first is Model N's strong traction with some of the most recognizable names in life sciences. The chart below shows that Model N's client base runs the gamut from exciting life sciences startups to some of the largest pharmaceutical companies, including Abbott (ABT), Gilead (GILD), and Pfizer (PFE). Aside from healthcare, Model N also has a relatively smaller tech practice serving semiconductor companies including AMD (AMD), Seagate (STX), and Western Digital (WDC). And like the best names in software, Model N employs a ""land and expand"" approach - the initial deployment with one of these large companies may be small and limited to one product or business line, but over time these customers expand their usage and reliance on Model N's platform.Figure 1. Model N Q2 earnings deck Source: Model N 2Q20 earnings releaseThe second is valuation. Now, Model N isn't exactly a bargain stock - but in an age when most software stocks now trade at a mid-teens valuation multiple, Model N's valuation still leaves room for growth. At current share prices near $35, the company trades at a market cap of $1.20 billion and after netting out the $61.3 million of cash and $39.4 million of debt on Model N's most recent balance sheet, its enterprise value is $1.18 billion.For FY21, meanwhile, Wall Street analysts have a consensus revenue target of $170.5 million for Model N, representing 10% y/y growth. Considering Model N is on an accelerating trajectory and that its cloud strategy is just beginning to take off, this estimate might be a tad on the conservative side. Nevertheless, if we take consensus estimates at face value, we arrive at a valuation of 6.9x EV/FY21 revenues - not cheap for a stock growing in the mid-teens, but not exactly overly demanding either considering Model N's rising subscription mix and improving margin profile.And when we consider Model N's popularity with large tech and healthcare customers plus its cheap valuation, I also wouldn't rule out the possibility of Model N eventually getting acquired by a larger ERP company that wants to absorb Model N's vertical-focused revenue management solution. Vertical expansion has been a key growth strategy for some of the largest software players including Salesforce.com (CRM), and acquiring industry-focused companies like Model N has been the standard playbook for getting a foot in the door in a new industry.Even just a cursory glance at Model N's recent fundamental trends would help to showcase some of my enthusiasm for this name. Take a look at Model N's most recent revenue growth trends through its fiscal second quarter:Figure 1. Model N revenue trendsSource: Model N 2Q20 earnings releaseAs can be seen in the chart above, after a period of struggling performance in FY19, Model N has entered a new era of stronger sales execution and has seen its revenue growth accelerate to 15% y/y - up five points from the prior quarter, and the third straight quarter of acceleration after growth bottomed out at -12% y/y in the third quarter of 2019 (by the way, we note that in spite of today's much stronger performance, its current share price isn't too far off from the high-$20s at which Model N was trading last year after posting negative revenue growth for several quarters in a row).Jason Blessing, the company's CEO, offered some insightful remarks on the Q2 earnings call that illustrates demand picking up in the wake of the coronavirus. Because life sciences companies are kicking into high gear right now, we should expect this revenue growth to be sustained even beyond the immediate aftermath of COVID-19. Per Blessing's comments:Aside from general demand strength, we also need to highlight that Model N's cloud strategy is starting to play a bigger part in the company's overall business. Model N now expects subscription revenues to make up a 74% mix of the company's overall FY20 revenues, and the company has also noted that over 70% of its customers use an average of 2.4 or more cloud products - which is a solid illustration that Model N's ""land and expand"" strategy is working.Aside from providing a more reliable, recurring stream of revenues to draw on in the future, Model N has also taken its increased subscription strength as an operating lever to improve margins as well. The chart below offers a perfect illustration of how Model N's adjusted EBITDA margins (the company's primary profit metric) have grown over time - see in the chart below that trailing twelve month EBITDA has hit an all-time high of 11% as of Q2, up 390bps year-over-year (and a far cry from a few years ago, when Model N was generating negative EBITDA margins of approximately the same magnitude).Figure 3. Model N margin trendsSource: Model N 2Q20 earnings releaseIt's clear to see that Model N's execution is trending upward - both from a sales momentum/cloud adoption perspective, plus from an overall company margin expansion/profitability standpoint. As a niche software provider to an incredibly critical life sciences sector, I think Model N is an attractively priced asset that could function well either standalone or as an acquisition target for a larger ERP system."
4370395,103480,2020-08-24T09:51:46-04:00,"Shares of Model N have continued to rally after the company posted incredibly strong fiscal third-quarter results.
        Model N's revenue growth accelerated to 19% y/y, up four points from the prior quarter and the fourth straight quarter of acceleration.
        Nor is Model N breaking the bank to chase growth: it has also driven improvements in gross and Adjusted EBITDA margins.
        In true beat and raise fashion, Model N has also raised its full-year outlook.","With many of the large-cap tech stocks continuing to race to all-time highs, it often falls on the small-cap side for investors to truly find value. Model N (MODN) is one of the more interesting names within this space. A revenue management software company specifically for life sciences and semiconductor companies, Model N struggled to find its footing throughout much of 2019. However, this year - even amid a global pandemic that has battered many of its software rivals - strong execution led Model N into driving accelerated revenue growth rates. Given that some of the largest health and tech companies in the world lean on Model N (several key examples include Pfizer (PFE), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Intel (INTC), and Qualcomm (QCOM), investors should note that Model N's traction with huge corporate clients means it is less risky than the typical small/mid-cap software company that typically services other smaller businesses. Though Model N is up ~150% from the lows it hit in March, the stock is up only ~10% year-to-date (lagging behind most large-cap tech names as well as the NASDAQ, which has surged 22% year-to-date) despite much stronger performance since last year, suggesting that there is still further upside to go.There's also plenty of appeal in the fact that Model N is a vertical software company. Verticalized strategies have become more and more common among the larger ""portfolio"" software companies, especially Salesforce.com (CRM) - which has been known to splurge billions on industry-focused software companies (such as when it bought Vlocity earlier this year for $1.33 billion) in order to plant a deeper foot in these industries and capitalize on cross-sale opportunities. Not to mention the fact that the two verticals that Model N serves (life sciences and high technology) have arguably proven to be the arguably the most countercyclical, strongest sectors in the year-to-date. In light of Model N's improving right rights, I believe there's plenty of justification for Model N's upward drift in its valuation. At current share prices near $40, Model N's market cap is still at only $1.37 billion. After netting off the $194.2 million of cash and $112.2 million of cash on Model N's most recent balance sheet, its enterprise value is $1.29 billion. Wall Street, meanwhile, has a consensus revenue forecast of $174.4 million for FY21 (which is up only 9% y/y versus the ~$160 million midpoint of this year's revenue guidance, which Model N just raised after reporting Q3 results). I'd argue that given Model N's growth rate over the past two quarters has averaged in the high teens that a reversion to single-digit growth next year is highly unlikely, but if we take consensus at face value, Model N's valuation is still just 7.4x EV/FY20 revenues - whereas many software stocks growing in the mid-teens/low 20s have noticed high single digit or low-teens valuation multiples.Figure 1. Model N FY20 guidance updateSource: Model N Q3 earnings deckThe bottom line here: Model N is a much stronger company than it was several years ago, with a viable industry-focused strategy driving both revenue growth and margin expansion. Stay long and ride the company's upward momentum.Let's now dig into Model N's most recent results in greater detail. The Q3 earnings summary is shown below:Figure 2. Model N Q3 resultsSource: Model N Q3 earnings releaseModel N's revenue grew 19% y/y to $41.3 million, decimating Wall Street's expectations of $39.5 million (+14% y/y) by a huge five-point margin. Note that this is in spite of the fact that the coronavirus impacted all three months of the fiscal third quarter. Most companies - even technology companies - have reported sizable revenue deceleration in that period. This is also Model N's fourth straight quarter of revenue acceleration. As recently as last year, Model N's business was actually declining, showcasing how far the company has come in a relatively short period of time:Figure 3. Model N revenue and margin trendsSource: Model N Q3 earnings deckModel N's management noted that the company continued to see healthy activity in new customer go-lives, while several notable companies also expanded their relationships with Model N in the quarter, including AMD (AMD) and Micron (MU). The company did note that sales cycles have elongated, however (particularly for tech companies more than for life sciences companies) - and management doesn't expect its pipeline to normalize to pre-pandemic levels in the near term (though revenue growth has certainly taken off). At the same time, strong execution by Model N's sales teams has continued to allow Model N to close deals. Here's some helpful context from CFO David Barter's prepared remarks on the Q3 earnings call:The key upcoming checkpoint for Model N is next quarter, when alongside Q4 earnings the company will also unveil its first pass at FY21 guidance (and hopefully that comes in well above the 9% y/y growth that analysts are currently calling for). Note that Model N's recent surge in growth has not come at the expense of profitability. We note that Model N's gross margin in Q3 ticked up by an impressive 560bps to 64.0% in the quarter. This is despite the fact that Model N's low-margin professional services business (performed at only slightly above cost) kicked into high gear in the quarters to support the flood of customer go-lives; Model N's CFO noted that subscription gross margins of 74% hit a new ""high watermark."" Model N's mid-60s gross margins still trails below most software companies in the mid-70s, but it's great to see the company begin to close this gap.Figure 4. Model N gross margin trendsSource: Model N Q3 earnings releaseThis uptick in gross margins also helped Model N achieve $6.4 million of Adjusted EBITDA, more than 2x the prior year. On a margin basis, Model N's adjusted EBITDA margins of 15% rose six points relative to 9% in 3Q19. Model N's pro forma EPS of $0.15 also represented a substantial beat versus consensus expectations of $0.06.Model N has found its footing and is managing to grow in the mid/high-teens again after a soft 2019. It certainly doesn't hurt that Model N's two focus industries (life sciences and technology) are among the sectors most unshaken (and in some cases, even benefited) by the coronavirus. Stay long here."
4209603,104099,2018-10-03T10:12:30-04:00,"There seems to be a negative correlation between revenue and net income, which is troublesome in my view.In spite of consistent losses, investors are willing to pay 150 times cash for the shares.For those people who have faith that something will make this company profitable, I offer a specific call recommendation.","Over the past twelve months, the shares of Model N Inc. (MODN) are up about 9%, and I think investors would be wise to sell the shares at this point. The problem from my perspective is the fact that the various expenses here are outstripping the admittedly impressive revenue growth. This leads to consistent and widening losses. At the same time, though, the stock is hardly cheap. I understand, though, that many investors have far greater levels of faith than I do and are comfortable owning businesses that lack earnings. For such people, I recommend a lower risk way to garner most of any future gains from this company.Model N is a leader in Revenue Management solutions for life sciences and technology companies. The company's offerings are designed to transform the revenue life cycle from a host of disjointed activities to a strategic ""end to end"" process. The company offers a host of cloud based services - Revenue Cloud for Pharma, Revenue Cloud for Med Tech, Revenue Cloud for High Tech, Revenue Cloud for Semiconductors, and Revenue Cloud for Manufacturing - offer a range of solutions from ""one off"" offerings to complete suites.The company derives its revenues from the sale of its cloud based solutions as well as professional services, as well as maintenance and support services. The increased demand for the company's offerings is evidenced by the fact that revenue has grown quite nicely over the past five years.Over the past four years, revenue at Model N has grown at a CAGR of about 12.5%, which I consider to be an impressive feat. Also positive is the fact that revenue is becoming more of an annuity, given that SaaS and maintenance now represent fully 85.6% of total revenue, up from 42% back in 2013.Unfortunately this is where the good financial news ends. Outstripping revenue growth are expenses like R&D (up at a CAGR of 13.5%) and G&A (up at a CAGR of 13.5%), and this has had the consequence of growing losses at a CAGR of about 17% over the past four years. It seems that the more this company sells, the greater are the losses. I ran a correlation on full year results for the four years 2014-2017 and found a strongly negative correlation (r=-.65) between revenue and net income. The reason for this might be the fact that in order to remain relevant, the company must continuously invest in R&D and sales expenses. This prompts the question that I've asked repeatedly over the past few weeks: what will transform this company such that revenue growth consistently exceeds growth in expenses?Turning briefly to the capital structure, the company took on $50 million of debt to fund the Revitas acquisition in January of 2017. Revitas was a provider of life sciences revenue management software. The company has more than enough cash at the moment to fully pay off this debt at the moment, but investors should be aware of the fact that it is due at the beginning of 2022. In my view, it is likely that the company will need to tap debt markets in 2022 to pay this down, exposing investors to what will likely be higher interest payments at that time. Also, the share count has increased at a CAGR of about 4% over the past five years. I expect this dilution to continue as the company generates losses from operations.Source: Company filingsI think the assumption that a ""good company"" must be a ""good investment"" and that a ""bad company"" must be a ""bad investment"" is simplistic. It's often the case that a wonderful business can be a terrible investment if the investor pays too high a price. Also, a troubled company can be a wonderful investment if you can buy the stock below intrinsic value. For that reason, I must spend some time looking at the stock here. I think there's a great deal of operational risk inherent in Model N, but investors may be adequately compensated for taking on that risk if they are able to buy the shares at a reasonable discount. Unfortunately, they're not.I believe that the more you pay for something, the lower your subsequent returns. With that in mind, I offer the current price to free cash flow chart for this company.Source: GurufocusAlthough the shares have become less expensive on a price to free cash flow basis, at ~150 times free cash flow, they are still massively expensive in my view.As I wrote at the outset, some people will remain long this name in spite of the continued losses. For those people, I think call options represent a lower risk way to ""play"" this name. At the time of this writing (October 2), the bid ask spread for February calls with a strike price of $16 is $1.35-1.85. If we assume a hypothetical investor in this business simply buys the calls at market, they will garner most of the upside the company can deliver over the next six months while putting up only 11.5% of the capital. In my view, the risk-reward for this strategy is superior to stock ownership. If the shares rally from here, the call holder participates in most of that upside, using far less capital. If, as I suspect will happen, the market for these shares falters in the next six months, the drop may be 88.5% less painful given the relatively small amount of capital employed. Thus, I consider this to be a much more safe way for investors in this business to continue to participate. To be very clear, I wouldn't waste even $1.85 on this name, but if an investor insists on staying long, I think a call option gives them the safest way to do it.At the moment, I think the shares of Model N Inc. represent the worst combination of low profitability and expensive stock price. I think price and value inevitably intersect at some future point, and at the moment the price far exceeds value in my estimation. For this reason alone, it makes little sense to buy these shares at the moment in my estimation. That said, I understand that some people will be interested in participating in upside here, and will be loath to abandon the name. For such people I recommend call options as a means to garner most of that upside at far less risk."
4223563,103480,2018-11-20T11:14:35-05:00,"Model N reported Q3 results last week that beat Wall Street's revenue and EPS estimates, but top-line growth slowed to just 3% y/y.Investors have prioritized strong revenue growth above profits this earnings season, and Model N's continually unimpressive growth will hamstring its stock price.With its niche restricted to just two industry verticals, Model N is effectively signaling that it is running short of growth opportunities.","Model N (MODN), the revenue management company for life sciences and technology companies, closed out its fiscal 2018 a few weeks ago with a rather lackluster Q4 report. Like many other technology companies this earnings season, Model N's top line results were a bit of a disappointment. Despite squeaking past Wall Street's estimates, the fact that a software company has slipped into virtually flat year-over-year growth is likely to make investors extremely uncomfortable.Model N had a banner year earlier in 2018 - the same can be said, of course, of most stocks in the tech sector. Yet, a string of disappointing earnings results, culminating with Model N's latest Q4 print, have sent shares sharply lower. Shares are now down 30% from their peak:MODN data by YChartsBy all objective metrics, Model N looks like a bargain. It's a software stock trading at ~3x forward revenues (despite the recent pullback in tech shares, precious few SaaS stocks can legitimately be called ""cheap""), and it's been heavily pummeled since August. As I've noted in a prior article, however, Model N is a value trap. This is a company whose results continue to show poor performance, and whose products will eventually get eclipsed by larger vendors in the market.Model N's most important milestone this fiscal year was achieving cash flow positive status. The company generated $2.5 million of operating cash flows and spent $0.3 million on capex, indicating free cash flow of $2.2 million this year. That's up from -$12.3 million in the prior year, though it still represents a piddling 1.4% on its $154.6 million of revenues for the year.Figure 1. Model N cash flowsSource: Model N investor relationsModel N's attainment of FCF-positive status is important as the company, unlike most of its small-cap peers, is an indebted one. As of the end of the fiscal year, Model N's balance sheet carried $53.7 million of debt - which, needless to say, is many multiples of its yearly cash flow. Though it's reassuring that Model N is no longer burning cash as it did in 2017, it's unclear whether the company can perform that much better without raising its revenue growth profile.In my view, despite an improving cash flow picture and a seemingly cheap stock, investors should continue to steer clear of Model N. The fall in Model N's stock price appropriately represents its limited prospects - without top-line growth, Model N's share price can't continue to rise.Model N should be investing in its growth - either by expanding its capabilities into new verticals, or releasing new products, or expanding its sales headcount. What is concerning about Model N is its apparent willingness to stay put.One of the biggest catalysts for Model N's post-earnings pullback was a seemingly weak guidance picture for FY19.Figure 1. Model N FY19 guidanceSource: Model N investor relationsFor the following year, Model N has indicated a top-line guidance range of just $138.0-$142.0 million. It's important to note that like many SaaS companies, Model N is adopting the ASC 606 reporting standard beginning next year, so it's not directly comparable to FY18's ASC 605 results. However, Model N noted that ASC 606 accounting represents a $7.1 million headwind to FY19 revenues, so if we add this figure to Model N's guidance range to arrive at $145.1-$149.1 million in revenues, that provides a better compare against FY18.In FY18, Model N generated $154.6 million in revenues (on an ASC 605 basis), so the company's outlook for FY19 actually represents a contraction in revenues, ranging from -6% y/y to -4% y/y. Why should investors be willing to invest in a stock that has admitted to shrinkage?Here's a look at Model N's results in the fourth quarter:Figure 2. Model N 4Q18 resultsSource: Model N investor relationsAgain, the biggest weakness here is revenue growth. Revenues advanced just 3% y/y to $36.7 million, which is still modestly better than Wall Street's consensus of $35.6 million (flat y/y), but represents a stark deceleration from last quarter's 16% y/y growth. The quarter before that, Model N had grown at 18% y/y. For a software stock, growth in the teens is already somewhat unacceptable - but for that growth to slip into the single digits is even more troublesome.There is one silver lining here - like last quarter, Model N has done a good job at shifting more of its revenue mix into SaaS, and away from perpetual licenses. 95% of its revenue base in Q4 was derived from SaaS; whereas only 83% was SaaS in 4Q17. This transition to subscription-based billings and away from upfront deals may be one of the big headwinds that Model N is facing as it guides to declining revenues in FY17, but still we'd hope that new cloud deals, even if providing a smaller revenue benefit upfront, would be enough to offset the loss of license revenues.Here's some qualitative commentary on the cloud shift from new CEO Jason Blessing's prepared remarks on the Q4 earnings call:Still, we note that cloud subscription revenues grew just 3% sequentially and 13% y/y - not strong enough to make the case for this stock. We note also that Model N ended the year at an ARR (annualized recurring revenue) of $57.5 million, which is only modestly increased from $48 million as of the end of FY17. For a company that claims to be accelerating its subscription transition, its ARR certainly isn't showing it.Profitability saw modest improvements in Q4. Gross margins ticked up to 60%, up three points from 57% in the year-ago quarter. We note, however, that Model N's gross margin still trails dramatically behind most of its SaaS peers, where an average gross margin lies somewhere in the 70-80% range.The company also cut back its sales and marketing expenses by -16% y/y in the quarter. Ordinarily, a SaaS company achieving sales efficiency would be a great thing - but in Model N's case, most investors would likely prefer the company to invest more aggressively in sales to drive top-line growth. Model N was able to slice its operating losses in half to -$3.4 million, much improved from -$7.2 million in the year-ago quarter, but because neither Model N's bottom line nor its free cash flow are sufficient to support its valuation, a re-invigoration of revenue growth is far more important.As usual, Model N gives us no reasons to be bullish on the stock in its quarterly update. Sure, the company's attainment of free cash flow positive is a plus, but it likely sacrificed growth to get there. A company at Model N's stage shouldn't be slicing sales expenses - plenty of Model N's peers in the ~$150 million annual revenue mark are growing at 40-50% y/y, and Model N should be aspiring to far higher growth.The company's poor outlook for FY19, in my view, will turn off the few bulls remaining on this stock. Continue to avoid this name."

This will be Rinat's second exit as CEO.With a niche as small as Model N's, the company's <20% growth rate is too small to see a long-term bullish case.","Over the past year, one small-cap software company has quietly been ascending from troughs and outperforming its peers in the SaaS software sector. Once a troubled company with an uncertain future, Model N (MODN), a maker of revenue management software for technology and life sciences companies, has risen 16% YTD and 56% over the past twelve months. Amid a stale market this year, Model N has staged an impressive rally and is making moves toward highs of $20 that the company hasn't seen since immediately after its IPO in 2013:MODN data by YChartsObjectively speaking, Model N has been a poor-performing technology IPO. It went public in 2013 at $15.50 a share, and the company has only recently begun to break past that benchmark. That's essentially flat performance over five years, when the general expectation of software IPOs is that they return multiples of the original purchase price. The company's acquisition of Revitas last quarter has given it meaningful lift to revenues, but on the whole, I still don't see any bullish case for this company. A small-cap stock like this has its devout fan base, but just like last quarter, I continue to be unimpressed by Model N's results. The company generates only tepid growth that barely ekes out beats to Wall Street's expectations (that is, the six firms covering the stock, five of them small-cap shops), and though Model N is profitable, the profit margins are so slim that without any meaningful growth, the company can't rightly be considered a cash flow story either. Niches are great, but Model N's niche is probably too limited. It's true that the company has large semiconductor and healthcare clients (it signed AstraZeneca this quarter for its flagship Revenue Cloud for Pharma product), but it's unclear how much additional market opportunity Model N has beyond what it's currently penetrated. Revenue management software in itself isn't a must-have asset, and some of the functionality can already be handled by all-encompassing ERP systems. And because Model N only covers two verticals (albeit two very large, lucrative verticals), its go-to-market potential is smaller than a typical SaaS company. Don't get me wrong: verticalization is the right approach for this kind of software, where revenue lifecycle management varies widely by and tools need to be customized for specific purposes, probably helping Model N's win rates against more generalized software platforms. But when assessing Model N's potential for future growth, it's unclear how big its TAM is - especially when its growth rate is already below 20% despite a small scale. (Model N said on its earnings call that it believes its TAM to be $4 billion, but I find it difficult to see this company ever reaching even $1 billion in revenues).Let's dive into Model N's Q2 results:Figure 1. Model N Q2 resultsSource: Model N investor relationsTotal revenues in the second quarter were $39.2 million, an 18% y/y growth rate over revenues of $33.3 million in 2Q17. Analysts in the quarter had expected $38.2 million, or +15% y/y, making this quarter's top-line results a modest beat of about $1 million (3 points) to Wall Street consensus. That's a decent beat, but nothing that warrants a ~10% jump in shares in post-market activity. Investors are, in my opinion, overreacting to middling results.Also consider the fact that, just like last quarter, Model N's acquisition of Revitas has helped its revenue comps. The company doesn't disclose Revitas' revenue breakout or its organic growth rate, but based on Model N's previous disclosure of Revitas' $15.2 million in FY17 revenues, we can deduce that the company generated approximately $4 million in revenues for the quarter. Using this assumption, Model N's organic growth rate would be closer to the single digits. M&A is a fine way to chase growth, but in Model N's case, there aren't enough resources to keep using acquisitions as a way to fuel growth. The company has just $55.2 million in cash on its balance sheet, and though it's periodically free cash flow positive which will help in accruing acquisition firepower, Model N is also saddled with $57.7 million in debt, making it one of the rare few software companies that's actually in a net debt position.There is good news in the quarter, however, on the profit side. Gross margins ticked up to 56% in the quarter, and though low for a SaaS company (which typically sees gross margins in the 70-80% range), it's up 4 points from 52% in the year-ago quarter. Model N is gradually closing the margin deficit to peers, though it's starting from a very low base that's far from the target.GAAP operating losses also showed a tremendous improvement. Operating loss was just -$2.4 million in the quarter, or -6% of revenues. In a volatile market where investors are particularly sensitive to profitability, the fact that the company improved dramatically from a -45% operating margin last year is a reassuring signal. Accordingly, Model N's EPS of $0.02 beat analyst expectations of -$0.04 by a fairly wide margin.So it seems like on the bottom line front, Model N its staging a turnaround. But that leads into the next discussion point - why, then, is Model N's CEO Zack Rinat leaving the company again? Alongside earnings, Model N has announced that it's implementing a CEO switch, hiring Plex Systems CEO Jason Blessing to replace Zack Rinat, Model N's founder. Of course, we've always known that Rinat has interests outside of Model N - this will be his second time leaving the company, after he resumed the role of CEO to help turn the company around from its trough. But should investors read his second exit as a signal that his turnaround job is done, or that there just isn't enough to be excited about at Model N?Here is Rinat's official statement regarding his departure on the earnings call:The markets are evidently treating the news well, as the ~10% after-hours reaction to this statement as well as earnings results would suggest. But though this exit looks to be smooth and planned, there will undoubtedly be some executive disruption that may have unforeseen business impacts. Personally, I'd remain cautious any time a founder leaves a technology company - even if it's the second time.The bottom line for investors: there's certainly some positive nuggets to scrape out of Model N's update this quarter, but on the whole, I don't view the company as a strong turnaround candidate. The company's cheap valuation multiple of 3.5x forward revenues, much lower than typical SaaS software stocks, indicates that the market doesn't really have much faith in Model N either.This company isn't a value play - it's one with fairly limited prospects. Though it will likely keep trudging along at its current pace, it's unlikely to see the runaway success of other cloud names that can lift it beyond its current small-cap valuation. Stay cautious on Model N."
4200219,103480,2018-08-17T16:09:15-04:00,"Model N shares have been trading downward ever since reporting Q3 results, the first earnings quarter for new CEO Jason Blessing.Revenue growth decelerated two points from Q2, and barely beat Wall Street's expectations.Model N has also made little progress toward closing its loss gap, despite an unimpressive top line.Model N will continue to face pressure from larger companies with similar revenue management products.","Model N (MODN), throughout the course of this year, has always been one of those companies that has somehow produced an impressive stock rally I can't get behind. The small-cap vertical software company, which primarily produces revenue management software for life sciences and semiconductor companies, continues to grow at an anemic rate while not showing any impressive results on the bottom line, either.Shares have only begun to recover this year after a long stint in the penalty box. Model N went public five years ago at $15.50 per share, and despite this year's tremendous gains, early investors have still only managed about flat performance:MODN data by YChartsIn my view, this is a company with an extremely unclear direction. Model N's product is extremely niche-oriented - it provides a small subset of revenue and contract management capabilities to a limited set of clients, primarily in the life sciences/pharmaceutical and semiconductor industries. It's true that the company serves some fairly large names such as Intel (INTC), but in my view, there's nothing that Model N can do that larger SaaS companies can't. More recently, large-cap portfolio SaaS giants such as Salesforce.com (CRM) and Oracle (ORCL) have started encroaching upon the CPQ (configure, price, and quote) space, further threatening Model N's position in the sector.Verticalization is now also something that large-cap software companies turn to regularly in order to drive sales growth. Salesforce, Oracle, Workday (WDAY), and many other successful SaaS companies now run specialized practices for the healthcare, financial services, public sector, and sometimes technology industries - usually, it's the industries that either command a large wallet share or those that need special attention, primarily due to tightened regulatory concerns. While verticalization is one of Model N's strengths, it's a playbook that is already increasingly being used by larger SaaS companies - and in the end, I believe its focus on two industries limits its overall TAM.Over the past year, Model N's founder Zack Rinat has rotated in and out of the CEO role, and while the new CEO Jason Blessing (named to the post this past May) certainly has his street cred as a former CEO of another software company, it's unclear if Model N can make significant progress under his watch. Certainly on the product side, the company has yet to launch anything that can significantly expand its TAM or kick up its growth beyond the measly mid-teens growth rate it achieved in Q3.A quick valuation check on Model N: at the company's current share price just above $16, Model N has a market cap of $489 million - putting it on the small side of the SaaS sector. The company also has $58 million cash and $59 million of debt, putting its net cash position at essentially zero and rendering its enterprise value at $490 million. Here's where Model N's guidance for the year currently stands (note that the full-year outlook for revenue is barely any higher than the prior view of $152-$154 million):Figure 1. Model N guidanceSource: Model N investor relationsThis guidance range puts Model N's current valuation at 3.2x EV/FY18 revenues - certainly not an expensive multiple given many SaaS companies are trading at 7x or above, but in my view, Model N is a value trap. The company's anemic top-line growth effectively hints that the company isn't going anywhere. There's always the hope that hyperspecialized companies like this will be acquired by a larger player or by a PE firm, but with Model N having traded at a depressed valuation for years without enticing the appetite of any buyers, it more or less seems like that ship has sailed.The bottom line on Model N: though cheap, this is not a stock I'd want to invest in. With barely any growth and certainly no profits yet in sight, it's unclear why there is any bullish appetite for this name at all. I'm more inclined to stay on the sidelines.Let's take a closer look at Model N's Q3 results, which sent shares down more than 10% from recent July peaks:Figure 2. Model N Q3 resultsSource: Model N investor relationsRevenues grew by a paltry 16% y/y to $39.6 million, decelerating by two points of growth relative to the 18% y/y growth pace Model N set in Q2 (recall that investors had celebrated that earnings quarter, sending shares of Model N up 10% in response). This quarter, Model N's beat to analyst consensus was tiny: Wall Street had expected $39.2 million in revenues, or +15% y/y.The one positive thing to note in the quarter is the fact that the revenue mix tilted heavily toward SaaS, and away from license revenues. SaaS revenues grew 25% y/y to $35.6 million and represented 90% of the company's revenue base versus 83% in the year-ago quarter, while license revenues actually declined. Model N has been gradually executing on its cloud strategy (its goal is to be 100% SaaS), and the new CEO commented as follows on the earnings call:And, though a rapid shift to cloud revenues (which are deferred over time) typically has a small negative impact to gross margin, Model N's gross margin of 58.5% (on a GAAP basis) improved 460 bps over 53.9% in 3Q17.However, what I find extremely unpleasant about the quarter is the fact that general and administrative spending increased 110% y/y in the quarter to $17.0 million, with a majority of that shift owing to the CEO transition. It's good that the company was able to pare down sales and marketing spend and increase its sales leverage, but general and administrative spending is typically the ""least productive"" operating expense category and the one investors would least like to see increased as a percentage of revenues.Operating losses of -$11.0 million widened from -$9.7 million in the year-ago quarter, and GAAP operating margins of -27.7% actually worsened 220 bps from -25.5% in 3Q17.There's a popular concept in the software sector of a ""Rule of 40"" - that is, add up a software company's percentage growth rate and operating margin, and the best companies will score 40 and above. For example, it's fine for a company to be operating at -20% operating margins - as long as a rapid growth rate, preferably 60% y/y or above, is compensating for it.Model N is absolutely crushed by this metric. Its wide loss margin of -28% is accompanied by a slow growth rate of -16%, and its Rule of 40 score is actually negative.In my view, Model N continues to fail at giving investors a reason to buy. Its product lineup is stagnant and unexciting, and its financial performance continues along the same track as it does every quarter - slow growth, minimal profit progression (this quarter, GAAP operating margins even took a step backward, as CEO transition costs ate into profits). Continue to avoid this name."
4127428,103480,2017-11-24T05:24:00-05:00,"Model N finished off FY17 with a Q4 that showed only minor upside relative to consensus.The company's acquisition of Revitas accounted for most of its growth in FY17; organic revenue growth was a paltry 7% y/y.The company also released its FY18 forecast of $147-150 million in revenue, or 13% y/y growth at the midpoint.Low-double-digit growth as well as thin profit margins for this small-cap company indicate a business with an uncertain future.","(Update 12/7/2017: Adjustments made to correct previous confusion between GAAP and non-GAAP income statement items.)If there was one company that hasn't deserved the rally it's seen this year, it would be Model N (NYSE:MODN), the developer behind a series of extremely niche revenue management software applications specifically tailored to life sciences and technology companies. The company's software allows clients to create contracts and manage revenue through the deal cycle, a function encompassed by other much more powerful software suites, including Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY). As I wrote in a prior article, I believe Model N is a company going nowhere, and even despite a forecast calling for growth in the low teens, I think Model N's traction in the software world is waning and that it will underperform relative to its own expectations.MODN data by YChartsThere are few companies I would short, but Model N is one of them. Technology companies need momentum to grow, and for a company like Model N, founded in 1999 and still with a market cap under $500 million, will never get to the next rung. For a software company with such a limited feature set and addressable market to succeed, it must be branded as a ""best-of-breed"" provider, a distinction that has eluded Model N. Gartner, the leading software industry analyst, expressed uncertainty over Model N's future after its $60 million acquisition of Revitas last year, encouraging customers of its software platform to be wary of potential shakeups and to consider the benefits of remaining on the platform.Let's take a closer look at Model N's financial performance in FY17. Back when Model N announced its intention to acquire Revitas and corner the life sciences revenue software market in December 2016, it put out a press release in which it also set a revenue goal of $128-133 million in FY17.Now that Model N has closed out fiscal 2017, we can compare where it landed relative to its initial target:Figure 1. Model N FY17 resultsSource: Model N 8-K filingAs seen in the table above, Model N's FY17 revenue of $136 million exceeds the $133 million target the company set after purchasing Revitas, but not by a wide margin. Note that this revenue figure includes a deferred revenue adjustment owing to an accounting adjustment post-acquisition. Optically, Model N appears to have grown revenues by 27% y/y, but the company also disclosed that Revitas accounted for $15.2 million of FY17's revenues (also implying that Model N, in paying $60 million for the company, paid a 4x revenue multiple). Thus, organic growth in the year was actually just a paltry 13%.If I were to consider an investment in a technology company that's only capable of growing revenue at 13% y/y, I'd want it to be producing massive profits and cash flows - treating it more like a value/industrial play, not a growth technology investment. Such is not the case with Model N, which generated -$39.5 million in net losses (a -30% margin) and -$12.3 million in free cash flow.Model N also has terrible gross margins for a software company. The company generated $70.1 million in gross profit in FY17, implying a 53% gross margin, only slightly better than 50% in FY16. See how this compares to other software companies in the chart below:WDAY Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsA recent investor presentation by New Relic (NYSE:NEWR) indicates that the average gross margin in the SaaS industry is 68% (New Relic's is 81%), putting Model N radically behind and drastically limiting its profit potential even if it were able to scale to a significantly larger revenue base (which, at its growth rate, is unlikely to happen).The company has also offered the following guidance for FY18:Figure 2. Model N FY18 guidanceAt the midpoint of the FY18 guidance range, Model N is forecasting 13% y/y growth - not impressive enough to get investors excited.Add this to the fact that Model N has $57.2 million of debt (its $57.5 million of cash barely puts it in a net cash position of $0.3 million), also extremely unusual for SaaS software companies, which are usually flush with cash (from a recent IPO or venture capital raise) and have zero debt.At Model N's current market cap of $466.3 million and enterprise value of $466.0 million, the company trades at 3.13x EV/FTM revenues - starkly overvalued for a company that's barely producing any growth and shows no path to profitability.Model N's recently released Q4 and FY17 results, along with its initial guidance for FY18, only reinforce the bearish thesis on the company. Fundamentally, the company is starkly different from other SaaS companies in all the wrong ways: terrible growth, below-average margins, and a less-than-clean balance sheet. On a qualitative basis, Model N's core business of selling revenue management software to life sciences and technology companies seems unsustainable, especially when competitors like Workday are building out their own industry vertical-specific solutions to compete.As I've noted before, Model N lacks a true ""wow"" factor in its product, partially due to underinvestment in R&D and engineering; as a small-cap company with limited resources, it can't really fund a top-notch software engineering team to build a best-of-breed product.Model N's weak forecast of $147-150 million in revenues in FY18 is a telling indication of the fact that it's struggling to achieve growth. Larger, more respectable software brands will soon swoop in on its territory, and given Model N's history of barely meeting its own guidance, it's more than likely that the company won't be able to achieve the 13% y/y growth it has promised in FY18.I'm betting on a reversal of this stock's good fortunes soon. It's unclear what investors see in the company, and given the lack of true upside catalysts in the stock's future, it's safe to say that Model N continues to barely tread water in an increasingly demanding market."
4143907,103480,2018-02-07T06:14:40-05:00,"Model N posted Q1 earnings that beat analyst consensus, but still doesn't spark any bullish hopes for the company.GAAP revenues appear to have grown 39%, but the company did not disclose the contribution of Revitas, an acquisition whose results were not reflected in the prior year Q1.Organic growth is presumably much lower; in Q3, organic growth was just 13%.Gross margins continue to lag behind most other cloud SaaS peers.Outside of acquisitions (with limited cash resources, this isn't really an option anyway), Model N has few levers for achieving real scale.","Model N (NASDAQ: MODN) is an interesting company that has, after a period of stagnation, seemed to win over investors and analysts. The company's Q1 results, on the surface, appeared to be strong. Even as a bear, I have to concede that the company delivered ahead of expectations and I was particularly impressed that the company managed to win some major deals from large-cap companies in the quarter (as discussed in its earnings call), most notable among them Amgen (NYSE: AMGN), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Seagate (NASDAQ: STX). With a small-cap name like Model N and without a huge public profile, it's quite a feat to land these Fortune 100 type names that can bring millions in annual billings. These deals are the types of building blocks that can bring a ~$150 million company like Model N to become a $1 billion company. When a software vendor like Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) or Autodesk (NASDAQ: ADSK) land a big client like Amgen, it's business as usual; but for Model N, it's a huge positive indicator.Unfortunately, I still don't believe good results and strong deal flow in the quarter have quite yet moved the needle for me. When I think of a software company that is at Model N's scale - like Yext (NYSE: Yext) or Alteryx (NASDAQ: AYX) - I see innovative companies tackling extremely large TAMs that have more than enough momentum to scale to $1 billion within 5-7 years. With Model N, however - with its awkward space of ""revenue management"" and ""contract management"" software - many elements of Model N's offerings are already covered in other enterprise software offerings and there's nothing in particular about the product that makes it a ""must-have."" Even further, the company has thus far limited itself only to technology and life sciences companies - which are the largest and most important growth sectors, to be sure - but still a small portion of the overall market, whereas other truly horizontal software companies can go after any client. In short: with strong results this quarter and a raised guidance, it's easy to see why investors are enthusiastic, at least in the short term. But the long-term story is still uncertain.Recall that Model N has had a fantastic run over the past year, rising more than 40% (even after the recent market correction). Q1 earnings has the stock up another 7% in after-hours trading. But when I look at the price appreciation over the past year, I don't see a company that has fundamentally become 40-50% better, and it still fails to impress me.MODN data by YChartsHere's one thing in particular that made me a bit hesitant to praise the company's most recent quarter: its failure to break out the revenues from its major acquisition of Revitas, which closed in January of last year and was not included in 1Q17 results. Without this breakout, it's difficult to tell how much Model N actually grew on an organic basis.As shown in the chart below, taken from Model N's earnings release, the company achieved $39.1 million of revenues in Q1, optically up 39% y/y. There are positive points to note here: management had only guided to $37-$37.5 million (including Revitas), and it obviously achieved above the high end of that range. Analysts, too, were on the cautious side of those estimates and had penciled in a consensus forecast of $37.1 million for the quarter, which Model N blew past. So there is some justification for the stock's post-earnings rise, just not a terribly exciting one.Figure 1. Model N Q1 total revenuesSource: Model N Q1 earnings releaseModel N also reported a deferred revenue adjustment relating to the Revitas transaction, so adding in a ~$0.6 million adjustment, its pro forma revenue in the quarter was actually $39.7 million. See the walkdown below:Figure 2. Model N revenue adjustmentSource: Model N Q1 earnings releaseWhat threw me off, however, was the fact that Model N didn't disclose Revitas's revenue contribution in 1Q18, leaving investors to speculate what the company's organic growth rate was. 1Q17 revenues do not include Revitas's numbers (the acquisition closed in January 2017), so the growth rate from 1Q17 to 1Q18 is not an apples-to-apples comparison.Of course, Model N isn't required to disclose this information. And for a larger software company that frequently makes tuck-in acquisitions - like, say, Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL) or Salesforce, the contribution from these acquisitions is such a small (as well as regular) part of revenues that it's not entirely meaningful to disclose, though some do anyway. But for Model N - which spent $60 million on Revitas (it currently only has $48.3 million of cash left, not to mention $56.6 million of debt - putting it at a net debt position) - it doesn't have the resources to engage in hugely accretive M&A each year.As a guide to what Revitas could have contributed, Model N previously disclosed that Revitas generated $15.2 million in revenues in 2017. This put Model N's organic growth rate for FY17 actually at 13% y/y. Using this as a relative benchmark, we would estimate that Model N's organic growth in 1Q18 might be a bit higher considering the outperformance relative to targets (maybe even 20%), but not that far off. The main point here: don't be quick to see the 39% y/y revenue growth and declare Model N a high-growth company. That's thanks to its acquisition. In truth, its growth is merely decent.Model N's margins also fail to impress me. Gross margin in the quarter did rise to 57%, up from 51% in the prior Q1 - but still, that figure lags far behind other cloud peers in the high 70s and low 80s. It's understandable that as Model N moves away from large upfront license deals (which it no longer sells) and more toward SaaS subscriptions, margins might need to take a little bit of time to adjust, but the margin gap is just too wide not to notice.The company did trim down its net loss margin - GAAP net losses in the quarter was -$5.3 million, a net margin of -13% (better than -27% in the prior quarter), but for a company whose scale is still small and organic growth not entirely impressive, Model N's loss reduction isn't impressive enough for me to jump on the bandwagon quite yet. Apparently, however, Model N did impress Wall Street on the profitability front - its pro forma EPS of $0.03 was a 9c beat over consensus of -$0.06.Like any growth software company (which Model N is trying desperately to be, but falls short in many ways), the company raised its guidance after a quarterly beat - a classic ""beat and raise."" But again, the guidance raise is still modest and not anything to write home about. The company raised its FY18 revenue target of $149-$151 million, up from a prior range of $147-$150 million given last quarter. And given the shakiness of Model N's execution and its historical volatility around earnings time, I fear there's more downside risk to that forecast than upside.With the sea of red that has attacked the markets in the past week - especially high-growth tech stocks - there are plenty of high-quality names for sale that make for much better buys than Model N. Yes, the company might outperform over the next few quarters - but is there a strong growth trajectory for Model N four or five years in the future? Most would probably argue there is not, outside of an acquisition - but there have been few possibilities raised to this point to date.Also consider the fact that there's risk in the company's coming few quarters as Revitas becomes baked into the company's 2Q17 results going forward - investors might not be prepared for the optical drop in growth rates that come from the tougher y/y compares.All told, there's just not enough to like about this company to justify buying it after a 40%-plus rally."
4273819,104099,2019-07-08T07:51:19-04:00,"In this article, I review my earlier approach to this company in hopes of refining my understanding of the ""switch to calls"" strategy.The company remains troubled, with a strong negative relationship between revenue and net income. The fall in revenue in Q1 is also alarming.In spite of these problems, the stock remains excessively priced, trading at a price to free cash flow of ~80.I (still) favor the idea of switching from share ownership to calls, as this is the safest strategy on a risk reward basis in my view.","Over the past 12 months, the shares of Model N Inc. (MODN) have been on a bumpy ride, but are up 9.5% year over year. I last wrote about the company in October, and since they’ve published a few more financial statements, so I thought I’d look in on the name.For those who can’t stand the suspense, or my writing, I’ll come to the point: I think shareholders would do well to avoid the name. That said, I think the crowd may continue to drive these shares higher, and so investors would do well to switch from shares to calls.Speaking of calls, in this article I’m also going to objectively evaluate the “switch to calls” strategy that I suggested back in October. In my view, this strategy was a good one on a risk adjusted basis, in spite of the fact that people who employed it would have done better, eventually, by holding the shares. I like the strategy, because it has generally worked out, but the experience with Model N has allowed me to add some caveats to it that I’ll be employing going forward.For those who may be less familiar with the name, Model N is a leader in Revenue Management solutions for life sciences and technology companies. The company's offerings are designed to transform the revenue life cycle from a host of disjointed activities to a strategic ""end to end"" process. The company offers a host of cloud based services - Revenue Cloud for Pharma, Revenue Cloud for Med Tech, Revenue Cloud for High Tech, Revenue Cloud for Semiconductors, and Revenue Cloud for Manufacturing - offer a range of solutions from ""one off"" offerings to complete suites.The company derives its revenues from the sale of its cloud based solutions as well as professional services, as well as maintenance and support services. The increased demand for the company's offerings is evidenced by the fact that revenue has grown quite nicely over the past five years.A quick review of the financial statements suggests that this is a popular company. Specifically, over the past six years, revenue has grown at a CAGR of about 7.7%. While this is an impressive feat, it is a much slower growth rate than when I first looked in on the name back in October. In addition, I do like the fact that the majority of the company’s revenue is an annuity, given the SaaS model.Unfortunately, that’s where the good news ends. While revenue has grown at a decent rate over the past several years, so was the net loss. Net loss has grown at a CAGR of about 6% over the past five years. In fact, it seems that there is a negative relationship between revenue and net income. I ran a correlation analysis on revenue and net income, and there is a relatively strong (r=-.44) negative relationship between the top and bottom lines here.The reason why losses continue to mount as revenue grows relates to the fact that the company has seen massive increases in R&D, Sales and Marketing, and the catch all “G&A.” This prompts the inevitable question: at what point will the company be able to slow the growth rate of these investments and allow revenue to outpace costs? There’s little evidence that they can achieve this feat in the near term, as even revenue is down from the first quarter of last year to this. That said, the company did manage to reduce the three expenses I mentioned earlier, but net loss continued to widen.On the bright side, the massive dilution we’ve seen (share count has grown at a CAGR of about 4.5% over the past five years) has blunted the loss per share, which has grown at a CAGR of “only” 1.5% over the same period.Source: Company filingsWhile I consider the company to be troubled, I have to remain open to the possibility that it may still represent a great investment. The idea here is that even a troubled business can be a great investment if you pay the right price for it. The less (more) you pay for a stream of future cash flows, the higher (lower) will be your subsequent returns.When I last looked in on the company, the shares were trading at a price to free cash flow just under 150, after having descended from about 180 times free cash flow. That was one of the principal reasons why I recommended avoiding the name. At the moment, the shares are far less expensive on a relative basis, trading at “only” about 80 times free cash. Although this is relatively good as valuations go, it’s objectively bad, and so I must recommend that people avoid the name based on the valuation.Source: GurufocusI’m going to recommend that investors switch from shares to calls at this point because the crowd doesn’t seem to mind the combination of a poor business and expensive stock, and my drive the shares higher from these levels. Given that investors aren’t paid a dividend, there’s little opportunity cost in my view, and there's tremendous benefit in getting most of the upside at far less capital at risk.Before doing that, though, I think it necessary to critically evaluate the results of the strategy in my earlier Model N article. Doing so provides us some insight into the potential benefits and pitfalls of this strategy, and may give us some wisdom we can use in future situations like this.The following table compares the closing prices of the stocks and options on the day that I recommended switching from shares to the February call option with a strike of $16, and on the expiry date of that call option.Source: Author compilationA few observations from the above results are relevant.A superficial reading of events might suggest that the call option was the inferior choice because of the outcome. Making that claim is difficult, though, because doing so would be committing outcome bias. For most of the life of this option (Q4, 2018), the market was in turmoil, and these shares dropped a great deal further than the call options. It looked as though the strategy was a superior one, as the investor was losing less. Judging the strategy simply from the point of view of a (newly inflated?) market is dangerous in my view, as it may cause people to dismiss the risk-reward benefits of a “switch to calls” strategy.Additionally, while the shares generated a positive return, they did so by employing much more capital, thus the risk adjusted differences are far less in my view.Two lessons I draw from this experience are:For that reason, I’m very comfortable recommending the strategy again. As I write, the February 2020 call with a strike of $20 last changed hands at $2.20, with a bid-ask spread of $2.15-2.85. I would specifically recommend buying the calls at a limit price of $2.30. At this price, the investor will have access to most of the future price movements of the shares at only about 14% of the risk. If the shares continue to rise from here, investors will do well owning the calls, as these will capture most of that upside. If the shares drop in price, the calls will lose money, but as we saw, they’ll lose far less.I think Model N remains a troubled company, as evidenced by the negative relationship between revenue and net income. Additionally, revenue was actually lower in the first quarter of 2019 relative to the same period a year ago, which is not something investors want to see in a “growth” company. In spite of this, the shares remain relatively expensive at ~80 times cash flow. All of this causes me to want to avoid the name. That said, we live in strange times, when investors bid up the price of companies like this in hopes that something will happen someday to make them profitable. For that reason, there’s a significant chance the interaction of this market optimism and central bank activity will drive the shares higher. For people who want to continue to take the ride with this company, call options remain the best vehicle for doing so.Putting up less capital to achieve significantly similar results remains a great strategy for these beloved stocks that are so troubled in my view. I think price and value eventually meet. When that happens, I’d (still) much rather own calls than shares."

By 2000, virtually all major airlines, hotel firms, cruise lines and rental car firms had implemented Revenue Management Systems to predict customer demand and optimize available price.REVENUE MANAGEMENT ENTERPRISE SUITE 85% of revenue. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 and in the three months ended December 31, 2012, revenues from this suite constituted more than 85% of MODN's total revenues for each respective period.MODN's Revenue Management Intelligence suite provides analytical insights to define and optimize revenue management strategies.LIFE SCIENCE & TECH MARKET According to Gartner, Inc., a research firm, in 2011, life science and technology companies spent a combined $17.3 billion on software, consulting services and internal information technology (IT) personnel dedicated to sales support, marketing and finance.International Data Corporation (IDC), a research firm, reported in its Health Insights 2009 report that a lack of centralized and automated solutions for managing the revenue lifecycle resulted in over $11 billion per year in lost revenue for companies in the life science industry alone.CUSTOMERS A representative list of customers based on total revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 includes life science customers Abbott Laboratories, Amgen Inc., Boston Scientific Corporation, Bristol-Meyers Squibb Company, Johnson & Johnson and Merck & Co. Inc., and technology customers Dell Inc., Nokia Corporation, STMicroelectronics N.V. and VMware, Inc.CUSTOMER RETENTION - 95% renewal rate MODN's renewal rates for maintenance and support were excess of 95% during fiscal years ended September 30, 2010, 2011 and 2012.BOOKINGS MODN's bookings grew 34% year-over-year to $101.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, but will be recognized as revenue over varying implementation periods.This bookings amount includes bookings from LeapFrogRx, which was acquired in January 2012. LeapFrogRx's bookings totaled $9.1 million during fiscal year 2012.CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, two customers, Merck & Co., Inc. and Amgen Inc., accounted for 14% and 10% of total revenues, respectively.During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2010 and 2011, one customer accounted for 15% of total revenues each year.Two different customers also accounted for 13% and 12% of total revenues for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2010 and 2011, respectively.MODN's most significant customers in any given period generally vary from period to period due to the timing of implementation and related revenue recognition over those periods of larger projects.SALES & MARKETING MODN's sales and marketing team primarily targets large and mid-sized organizations worldwide through a direct sales force.MODN has historically focused its sales efforts in the United States, but believes markets outside of the United States offer a significant opportunity for growth.INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MODN relies upon a combination of copyright, trade secret, trademark and, to a lesser extent, patent laws, and also relies on contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality agreements and licenses, to establish and protect proprietary rights. As of December 31, 2012, MODN had two U.S. patent applications and no issued patents.COMPETITION Common horizontal applications that customers attempt to configure for this purpose in the life science and technology industries include large integrated systems vendors like SAP AG and Oracle Corporation.MODN also encounters competition from small independent companies, which compete on the basis of price, unique product features or functions and custom developments.Companies with large investments in ERP or CRM applications, which do not typically provide revenue management capabilities, may extend these horizontal applications with customizations or point solution applications in order to address one or a small set of revenue management sub processes or drivers.Specific competitor offerings include(1) Oracle Magic Quadrant for Integrated Revenue and Customer ManagementOracle Communications Billing and Revenue Management(2) SAP Innovative Billing and Revenue Management from SAP Accelerates Order-to-Cash Processes(3) McKesson(4) JDA Pricing and Revenue Management(5) Erricson, telecom5% STOCKHOLDERS, PRE-IPO Non-management Accel-KKR Company LLC, 12% Accel Partners, 12% Meritech Capital Partners, 15%USE OF PROCEEDS MODN expects to net $72 million from its IPO.Proceeds are allocated for working capital and general corporate purposes.Disclaimer: This MODN IPO report is based on a reading and analysis of MODN's S-1 filing which can be found here and a separate, independent analysis by IPOdesktop.com.

1913421,21950,2013-12-23T14:10:43-05:00,,"Model N (NYSE:MODN) is located in the small town of Redwood City, nestled comfortably between Silicon Valley and San Francisco on what is called the San Francisco Peninsula in Northern California. MODN is a revenue management company that ""…drives improved pricing, margin, and revenue performance through a powerful combination of best practices, highly configurable software applications, comprehensive services, and actionable analytics across the complete functional spectrum of pricing, contracting, rebating, sales, and marketing."" Its customers include the likes of Merck, Gilead, Boston Scientific, Novartis, and Teva in life sciences, and Microchip, Atmel, VMWare, and PMC-Sierra in high tech.MODN started publicly trading in March of this year, but it did not catch my attention until it fell a gut-wrenching 32% on September 10th after a disastrous update on fiscal year 2014 and Q1 earnings and revenue guidance. At that time, MODN blamed reduced sales visibility and announced that it had launched a search for a sales leader to help fix the problems.MODN's stock opened at $20.40 on the day of its IPO after pricing 6.74M shares at $15.50 (above the expected range of $12.50 to $14.50). The stock went nowhere for three months (probably a tell-tale sign in this year of scorching hot high-tech IPOs) before a brief run-up to a closing high of $24.62. So, I wondered whether the collapse in the stock, culminating in the earnings warning, represented an opportunity to buy a good company with a good safety margin (current valuation prints at a price/sales ratio of 2.4 and price/book of 2.5 - downright cheap in the world of high tech software). I decided to take a shot and early indications suggest this purchase is a good, measured risk.On November 19, MODN reported earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter and announced the hiring of Chris Larsen as SVP and Chief Sales Officer. Larsen comes with a very impressive resume including President of SAP and EVP Global Field Operations at TIBCO Software. Now, a bet on MODN is partially a bet that Larsen can successfully turn around the business through his sales efforts.The conservative guidance MODN provided contained no hooks for excitement. On the conference call, the company explained it is looking to get back to revenue growth in the back half of 2014. Here is the guidance the company provided for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and the fiscal year ending September 30, 2014:The most interesting part of the conference call came during the Q&A session.One analyst asked for a follow-up on the large sales opportunities MODN mentioned in its previous earnings call. From the response, it is clear the company is still struggling to close those deals, and I can only assume the hiring of Larsen will help. President and CEO Zack Rinat referred to the closing of a deal with Johnson and Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) as one large deal that did come through in the previous quarter. The company however did not directly answer whether its guidance includes assumptions about the closing of the other large, potential deals. That lack of an answer does concern me as it is hard to determine the degree of conservatism baked into guidance.MODN is currently ramping up its efforts to chase down mid-market customers after seeing great success at the high-end for the past several years. This is both positive and a bit concerning. Sometimes, these kinds of moves indicate that the more lucrative, high-end opportunities are drying up or that growth is significantly slowing down in the well-established market. Only future earnings reports will reveal light onto this dynamic.MODN earlier implemented a restructuring that reduced the size of its professional services and sent more investment into sales, marketing, and R&D. This is another potentially good/bad signal. On the one hand, a cut in professional services indicates that current engagements are winding down without significant replacement. Investment in the future may become an immediate priority simply because the existing pipeline is weakening. On the other hand, smart investments now could pay off in a big way in the future. So, a bet on MODN now is a big bet that these efforts will indeed deliver in the near future.One analyst asked for an explanation for the expansion in the sales force. The CEO responded that it comes from a core belief in the market for revenue management (no surprise there). He cited the example of the company's engagement with Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN), adding that once a company becomes successful using a system, the rest of the market moves in this direction. Amgen implemented a revenue management system for the U.S. and 60 other countries. This system proved out the potential of a single, global revenue management system that can even handle the complexities of international regulatory issues.Overall, the earnings report was slightly encouraging but mainly a ""wait and see"" kind of event.One more news item after this report provided more encouragement. In an 8K document dated December 6th, MODN announced the 2014 compensation schedule for its senior executives. Rinat was given a token base salary of $1 and performance-based RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) of 200,000 shares. Now, his compensation is directly tied to turning the company around.Almost two weeks before this announcement, the stock hit what I now think was rock bottom at $7.73. Since the announcement, MODN has surged 28%. It is definitely possible that some ""January effect"" momentum is building as well. The January effect is the storied (relief) rally in otherwise poorly performing stocks, typically small caps, that were dumped toward the end of the previous year by investors looking to harvest losses against capital gains. With that selling overhang removed, bargain hunters step into the breach and send these abandoned stocks higher. I think these kinds of stocks may experience even stronger, more exaggerated moves than usual next month and beyond, given 2013′s tremendous rally has left many investors flat-footed and scrambling for ""deals"" which can help them play catch-up.The next step for MODN to maintain momentum is to show some signs of progress in its next earnings report.Stay tuned and be careful out there!Model N has begun the long road back…Source: FreeStockCharts.comDisclosure: I am long MODN.

4111137,103480,2017-10-02T14:08:09-04:00,"Model N's growth has basically flatlined in the past few quarters, underscoring its inability to popularize its software for revenue management.Its primary applications for contract/revenue management and quote configuration compete against Workday and Salesforce, respectively, and the latter two have immeasurably better brands.With a lack of clear product vision and no path to either growth or profitability in the near future, Model N flashes all the warning signs of a cratering stock.","Niche software products, in most cases, come with abundant opportunities. For example, Apptio (NASDAQ: APTI) has made a name for itself in managing the technology spend of IT departments - a software category it pioneered and was successful at bringing to market, no matter how niche the category.Model N (NASDAQ: MODN) has, for the past several years, attempted to be the niche provider of revenue management solutions for technology and life sciences companies - basically, a software application that automates manual processes involved with contracting customers and issuing quotes. But with growth practically flatlining to single-digits, it's clear Model N is probably never going to take off.It's really only acceptable for a software company to slow down revenue growth if it can convert into a profitable, cash-harvesting company. But while Model N sits on top of profitable SaaS contracts, it's still burning cash. With no growth on the top line, it doesn't have a clear path forward.MODN data by YChartsThe stock's year-to-date rise is puzzling, as the company has failed to show any meaningful improvement in its fundamentals. Optically, the stock's ~4x EV/FTM revenue multiple looks cheap, but it's a value trap - no growth and no profits basically signals a company that's going nowhere.Stay away from this name - it has nothing unique to offer to the software industry, and with valuations in the wider market notching all-time highs, fundamentally weak companies like Model N will be the hardest hit in a correction.Model N has two primary products lines: Revenue Enterprise Cloud (its flagship product), which helps companies manage revenue contracts and rebates, and Revvy Revenue Management, which competes squarely in the CPQ (configure, price, and quote) software market. Model N also has a third, ancillary module called Revenue Intelligence Cloud, which is a quasi-BI tool that delivers industry-specific data to guide the pricing proposal process.Model N is a vertical-specific software company, serving only customers in the life sciences and technology industries. In FY16, the company's revenues derived primarily (78%) from life sciences and pharmaceutical companies, with the remaining companies in technology (with a heavy concentration in semiconductors).Let's start with Revenue Enterprise Cloud. Model N's original proposition is that revenue management features are commonly missing from ERP systems, and Revenue Enterprise Cloud is designed to work with a company's existing ERP and tack-on that additional functionality.This assertion may no longer be true. Workday (NYSE: WDAY) has a Revenue Management module that allows clients to ""get a complete view of your customers and contracts."" Like Revenue Enterprise Cloud, Workday assists in reporting and compliance requirements and has the additional benefit of integrating directly with Workday Financials, its award-winning ERP suite.When comparing the Workday brand versus Model N (which has virtually no brand equity whatsoever), it's unclear why an IT buyer would choose the latter. In recent years, Workday has also built out vertical-specific applications (including life sciences and technology), so Model N can't really win on the verticalization aspect either.And don't forget there are a legion of other ERP providers as well - Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL), Netsuite, Sage, SAP (NYSE: SAP) are just a few of the prominent names. While they may not have as robust of a feature set in revenue management as Model N, it's clear that full revenue management capabilities are a luxury and not necessarily mission-critical.Revvy, which is Model N's CPQ solution, is without a doubt in direct competition against Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) - the ironic fact is that Revvy CPQ is built on the Salesforce1 platform and Model N has a soft ""partnership"" with Salesforce in CPQ.Salesforce, however, is barreling ahead in CPQ anyway - it acquired Steelbrick CPQ for $360 million in December 2015, at the time the leading startup in the CPQ space. The new Steelbrick, rebranded Salesforce CPQ, provides the full suite of features from drawing up pricing proposals and executing them to customers.Model N is up against two of the largest SaaS giants - Workday and Salesforce - with $2 billion and $10 billion in estimated FTM revenues, respectively. It wouldn't be surprising to see Model N's current subscriptions begin to peel off in favor of competitors soon.In technology, product is everything, and investments in engineering should be at the top of every software company's priority list. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that Model N has sufficient resources to build out a quality product.In 2016, Model N spent only $23.7 million on research and development. Compare that to Workday ($680.5 million) and Salesforce ($1.2 billion). When considering which software product to buy, IT execs are undoubtedly going to consider the vendor's resources to make updates and improvements.We can look at Model N's bleak engineering picture in another way: in 2016, it reported 262 employees in its R&D organization, which averages to about $90,500 in R&D spend per employee in that organization. Hardly a competitive pay package in the Silicon Valley, especially when considering that R&D spend also includes non-salary costs.To look at an extreme comparison, we can turn to Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which also discloses its R&D headcount separately. At the end of 2016, Google had 27,169 employees in its R&D organization and spent $13.9 billion on R&D overall - averaging out to about $513,000 per employee.While Google might make for a far-off comparison to Model N, the underlying point is clear: Model N just doesn't have to resources to build a world-class engineering team or create a best-of-breed product. And without a superior product, its competitive fortunes versus Workday and Salesforce are heavily limited.In FY16, Model N's revenues grew just 14% to $107.0 million. In early August, the company reported Q3 revenues of $34.2 million, up 22% y/y. At the ~$100 million revenue mark, other software companies like Alteryx (NASDAQ: AYX) and Instructor (NASDAQ: INST), which also compete in niche software categories, are growing around 50%.Profitability isn't making any progress either, which would be the only silver lining to softening revenue growth. In Model N's fiscal year to date (nine months through June 30, the company's negative operating cash flow ballooned to $16.2 million, more than double the OCF losses of $7.8 million in the prior year period.Figure 1. Model N OCF losses As of its June 30 balance sheet, Model N only has $51.8 million of cash left on its balance sheet, so its liquidity may not last much longer. The company also has $57 million of debt, and we note it's exceptionally rare for a software company to be in a net debt position, or even carry any debt at all.Model N's phantom rally in 2017 has little support in fundamentals. With large-cap cloud giants encroaching on its territory and very little cash to continue investing into its product, it's unclear how much longer Model N can hold on to its customers.Perhaps astutely, Model N is one of the few cloud software companies not to report a customer retention rate metric.Stay away from this company - Model N's foothold on its niche market is dwindling and it's unclear how many innings it has left to play."
3818976,56112,2016-01-20T13:31:20-05:00,"Model N is too small, too nichey, and too slow-growth for most software/SaaS investors to have it on their radar.There are valid questions about the size of the TAM, but I think there's still more here than most investors would initially assume.While the company isn't screamingly cheap, it's inexpensive relative to most peers, and could garner a significantly higher valuation if management executes on stated targets.","Shortly after its 2013 IPO, Model N (NYSE:MODN) ran into some sales execution issues, and its stock price never quite recovered. Nor has investor attention - it's fairly illiquid, and hasn't received a single article on Seeking Alpha since 2013. It's traded in a pretty tight band from $10 to $12.50 or so during the last two years. At a market cap of $280 million, and with a growth rate that's not quite fast enough to catch the attention of growth/momo tech investors, I believe Model N is flying under the radar of most buysiders. While the company is still a couple years away from the profitability inflection point, and the valuation today isn't particularly cheap enough to set off my value investor spidey-senses, I do think it's an interesting story with several underlooked aspects that could drive value in the longer term.Nichey, Vertical SolutionsModel N provides revenue management solutions, specifically to the life sciences and technology/semiconductor industries (which respectively represented 84% and 16% of revenues during the last fiscal year). Beyond the industry concentration, it also has fairly significant customer concentration; Johnson and Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) accounted for 11% of revenues alone, and the company only had 84 customers in total as of the 10-K (although they've signed new ones since then). For context, the company has over 120 salespeople. The 15 largest customers represent 66% of revenues, and based on disclosure from previous years, I have reason to believe there is another customer that is at least high single digits.This is obviously a very different model, then, from the Salesforces (NYSE:CRM) of the world. While most SaaS companies focus on ""horizontal"" solutions that provide common functionalities across many, many verticals, Model N is focused very specifically on its key verticals - so while it does go up against companies like Salesforce and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) occasionally, its success has been driven by deep industry knowledge and solutions that provide features other vendors don't offer. More often than not, the company is replacing internally-developed solutions built on Microsoft Excel and Access, or similarly low-tech makeshift software. The company's YouTube channel features discussions with major customers like ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) and Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX), all of whom attest to the strength of the company's offering. More quantitatively, Model N has had retention in the high 90s, suggesting that customers do find the offerings useful.Since the sales execution issues that I referenced, investors have been questioning whether it's really an execution issue, or if the company's TAM is really big enough to justify a long-term growth story. The company pegs the TAM at $5 to $10 billion, but since the products are niche and fairly early on in adoption, there's not really a good way to independently verify this. So while these questions are valid, I think there's another angle here for several reasons.First, the penetration here with some existing clients is still low; the company has a land-and-expand strategy and I believe they have significant room to grow seat count with existing customers. They can also sell additional products; while they have twelve products in their life sciences suite, for example, the average customer only uses three. Second, there are plenty of additional large players to go after in each of the two verticals - the company recently started working with Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Internet-Of-Things group, for example. Third, the company is placing more of an emphasis on mid-market clients in addition to mega-clients, and these clients will likely offer future growth opportunities.Fourth, there are plenty of examples of companies that have succeeded in providing software to specific niche verticals - I've previously discussed Tyler Technologies (NYSE:TYL) and Blackbaud (NASDAQ:BLKB). Admittedly, both of those companies have much larger TAMs, but Model N hardly seems tapped out at $100MM in guided 2016 revenue. Fifth and finally, the company could add verticals over time; their choice to focus on specific areas rather than spread themselves too wide doesn't imply that they can't work in other industries - just that they don't right now. Some investors may not like the off-the-beaten-path approach, but I do - not only because it may allow Model N to exploit opportunities passed over by competitors, but also because it means there are less eyeballs on the stock.Here's The Growth… Where's The Profit?While growth took a dip after the IPO due to the sales execution issues as well as the on-prem to SaaS transition, the company returned to double-digit growth in 2015 and is looking to continue that trend. They are projecting around 13% growth this year (to $107MM) and looking for that to accelerate to a 20s rate in 2017 and 2018.One of the major factors keeping me away here right now: the company is looking at burning $7 to $9 million in cash in FY16; while they were actually profitable prior to the IPO at a lower revenue level and have indicated that they could be profitable today if they chose to be, they're plowing a lot of money into R&D and sales and marketing. They expect to cross over in the next few years and generate a 5 - 10% operating margin by 2018, with a longer-term target model of 15 - 25% operating margin at 65 - 70% gross margins. Analysts have noted that this is below many SaaS models, and company management has indicated that at scale, there may be long-term upside relative to this target.The transition to SaaS is also going well; recurring revenues eclipsed 60% in 2015 (with 21% of that coming from SaaS) and the company is targeting >50% SaaS revenues and >90% total recurring revenue by FY18.Valuation Not Exciting Yet, But Maybe It'll Get There?Net of projected 2016 year-end cash on the balance sheet, the company's enterprise value is just over $200MM. At ~2x forward revenues, that's not expensive in context of the software landscape, but the company isn't yet profitable and also hasn't demonstrated consistent growth over the past few years.Looking out over the next few years, though, things get more interesting. If the company does turn to profitability (which seems reasonable) and they demonstrate consistent teens-or-better growth with a high percentage of recurring revenues, the multiple might take off. I'm not saying I'd personally be willing to assign a substantially higher value to it, but if the company executes on its FY18 goals and garners a 2.5x revenue multiple, the share price would be close to $20 (accounting for cash on the balance sheet). If the company can sustain a growth rate in the high teens or low 20s, a multiple even higher than that is not out of the question (although it might imply lower operating margins as more dollars are reinvested into growing sales headcount). There are still valid questions about whether the TAM is actually $5 - $10 billion as the company says, but even if it's merely say $750MM - $1B, that's still a big enough pond to give MODN plenty of growth runway from its FY18 targets.Management A Potential Clue?One of the more interesting notes on the company is this: CEO Zack Rinat started and sold two companies for a sweet price during the go-go years of the '90s. So he's not wanting for money, and clearly doesn't need to be running a small, subscale software company evangelizing a solution that most companies clearly don't know they need (relative to ERPs, CRMs, and other top-of-mind solutions). Yet he's been working on Model N for the better part of two decades now - and he takes all of his compensation in stock (aside from a nominal one-dollar cash salary). Rinat seems to believe that there is a very large long-term opportunity here. This setup is enough to keep me watching the stock, even though it's not in an area I'd consider to be a buy zone.Wrapping It UpModel N requires more work and diligence than many software stocks, because there's no easy comp. Therein may lie opportunity, though - many of the really interesting companies are those in niches that require a bit more work to understand. I would need a bigger margin of safety to invest here, and waiting for that gives me enough time to continue to understand the story at a deeper level. But relative to the usual hype surrounding software/SaaS companies, Model N seems fairly underlooked and underloved. If they get to profitability and even halfway execute on their growth goals, and the price hasn't moved much, it seems like the risk/reward will be pretty skewed to the upside. That's enough to keep me watching."
1288141,21820,2013-03-20T01:14:19-04:00,,"Revenue management company Model N (NYSE:MODN) is set to hit the stock market with a Wednesday IPO that should see moderate interest. The company competes in the growing field of cloud based solutions for large businesses. Model N also counts numerous recognizable names as customers and could be more familiar than investors know.A total of 6.46 million shares are set to price at a range of $12.50 to $14.50. The six million shares come directly from Model N, while one seller is responsible for the other 460,000 shares. A total of 21.4 million shares will be outstanding after the company's IPO.From the company's prospectus, Model N is a ""provider of revenue management solutions for the life science and technology industries, and we believe that we are a pioneer of the market."" The company's slogan of ""More Revenue. Made Simple."" is really what the company is all about. Model N works on providing cost savings for pharmaceutical, medical device, and technology companies. The company offers the following:· Price management· Deal management· Contract management· Incentives and rebates· Regulatory compliance· Sales· Marketing· FinanceModel N's Solutions:· Driving optimal pricing and contracting strategies· Realizing greater value from contracts· Maximizing revenue by standardizing and enforcing pricing and discounting· Executing and optimizing channel incentives· Achieving accurate financial reporting· Automating government regulatory compliance to reduce revenue riskThe company's strengths include:· Comprehensive approach to revenue management· Deep domain knowledge· Strong installed customer base· Flexible delivery options· Talented team focused on customer successGrowth Strategy· Increasing sales to existing customers· Expanding our customer base· Introducing new applications and enhancing existing solutions· Extending into the mid-market through the cloud· Expanding our presence in the technology industry· Pursuing selective acquisitionsModel N lists the following companies as customers:· Pharmaceutical - Abbott Laboratories, Amgen, Boston Scientific, Bristol Meyers Squibb, Johnson & Johnson, Merck· Technology - Dell, Nokia, STMicroelectronics, VMWareThe large customers are a nice list of recognizable names. One of the company's strategies is to start appealing to the mid-market companies. This is now more possible with Model N's acquisition of LeapFrogRX in January 2012. LeapFrogRX is a cloud based analytics manager for the pharmaceutical field.The company counts on its largest companies for the majority of its revenue, creating a possible dependence on certain companies. In 2012, the company's 15 largest customers accounted for 75% of its revenue. Merck and Amgen made up the largest percents at 14% and 10% respectively.Model N is growing revenue at a good rate, but has posted several recent losses for net income. Here is a look at revenue and net income:SaaS revenue increased the most for the company, thanks in large part to the LeapFrogRX acquisition. Licensing revenue increased 10% in the fourth quarter. SaaS revenue increased 48% in the fourth quarter. Of the $3.2 million in additional revenue, $2.7 million came from the acquisition.KKR (NYSE:KKR), through a joint venture with Accel has been an investor in the company since 2000. KKR will be selling 460,000 shares in the company. Prior to the offering, Accel-KKR owned 12% of Model N. After the IPO, Accel-KKR will still own 6.6%. A strong IPO could boost KKR as it can later sell off its remaining stake. After the offering, insiders and 5% shareholders will control over 50% of the company.I expect Model N shares to price at the top end of their expected range. This is a growing company in growth markets that could provide a nice long term investment. I would be a buyer of shares if they stay under $20. My top five reasons for buying Model N on its offering are:Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in MODN over the next 72 hours.

1683342,21136,2013-09-10T05:48:44-04:00,,"The recent Initial Public Offering of technology company Model N (NYSE:MODN) provides investors with a short investment play.Model N raised $104 million by offering 6.7 million shares in March of 2013. J.P Morgan (NYSE:JPM) and Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) acted as lead managers on the deal.There are several strong reasons for my near-term short thesis.One, In September, three big-time venture capital and private equity firms that need to show good results to their investors will have their MODN shares unlocked. Accel-KKR Company LLC, Accel Partners, and Meritech Capital Partners own over 6,000,000 shares and those shares will be suddenly be unlocked and available for sale subject to normal restrictions. Investment firms are under pressure to return capital to their investors after the drought created by the great recession.Two, the management team headed by Zach Rinat also will have its 5,000,000 shares unlocked in September. Model N insiders have owned illiquid shares for many years and now they will finally be able to sell into the public market.Three, the stock chart on MODN appears to be under severe pressure and in a steady downtrend since early August. This slide may be partially due to the company's Q2 guidance below analysts' estimates. It is unusual and a terrible sign for a new public company to guide down so soon after an initial public offering especially after it gaps up on the first day. The company also has well capitalized competitors like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and HealthStream, Inc. (NASDAQ:HSTM).Readers should also review our recently published Seeking Alpha article on Silver Spring Network (NYSE:SSNI) which had their unlock expiration event this Monday. Our research over the past three years and the detailed empirical analysis done by professors Daniel J. Bradley and Bradford Jordan suggest that lockup expirations are, on average. associated with significant , negative abnormal returns, but the losses are concentrated in firms with venture capital (VC) backing. For the VC-backed group, the largest losses occur for ""high-tech"" firms and firms with the greatest post-IPO stock price increases, the largest relative trading volume in the period surrounding expiration, and the highest quality underwriters like we have in this situation with powerhouse J.P. Morgan and Deutsche Bank.MODN is a promising tech short before the September unlock date because of the needs of the cash hungry venture capitalists and their investors, diversification needs of the management team, the company's weak stock chart and the company's guidance below analysts' expectations.Disclosure: I am short MODN.

1301621,25120,2013-03-26T14:51:10-04:00,,"Last week, Model N (NYSE:MODN) made its public debut on Wednesday the 20th of March. Shares of the company, which provides revenue management solutions for the life science and technology industry, ended their first trading day with gains of 28.9% at $19.97 per share. Shares have traded around the $20 level ever since, currently exchanging hands around $19 per share.The Public OfferingModel N is a provider of revenue management solutions aimed to maximize revenues for its customers. The company offers key functions including pricing, contracting, incentives and rebates to maximize revenues through its web-based platform which works in the cloud as well as on traditional platforms.Model N sold 6.0 million shares for $15.50 apiece. The company raised $93 million in gross proceeds in the offering process, valuing the company at $332 million. Selling shareholders offered some 700,000 shares in the offering.The offering was a success. The offer price was set above the midpoint of the preliminary $12.50-$14.50 price range set by the firm and its bankers. Some 31% of the shares outstanding were offered in the public offering. At Friday's closing price of $18.45, the firm is valued at $395 million.The major banks that brought the company public were J.P. Morgan, Deutsche Bank, Stifel and Piper Jaffray, among others.ValuationModel N offers two complementary pieces of software applications. The company offers Revenue Management Enterprise and Revenue Management Intelligence services. The former automates pricing, contracting, incentives etc., while the latter offers analytical solutions services.For the year of 2012, Model N generated the majority -- some 85% of total revenues -- from its Revenue Management Enterprise solutions. Model N's customers include blue-chip names including Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Dell (NYSE:DELL) and Nokia (NYSE:NOK).The company reported annual revenues of $84.3 million for the full year of 2012, up 29% on the year before. The company reported a full year loss of $5.7 million as gross margins fell by almost 700 basis points to just under 52%.Fourth quarter revenues rose almost 24% compared to the year before, coming in at $22.3 million. Net losses doubled to $1.3 million for the period.The company raised $93 million in gross proceeds in the offering process. As such net proceeds are expected to come in around $85 million. The company operates with $12.6 million in cash and equivalents and $4.5 million in short and long term debt. As such, Model N will operate with roughly $90-$100 million in net cash.Based on Friday's valuation of $395 million, the market values the firm's operating assets around $300 million. This values the firm at roughly 3.6 times 2012's annual revenues.Note that billings for the year of 2012 grew by 31% to $101.3 million. The strong revenue growth resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.20.Investment ThesisAs noted above, the offering of Model N has been a great success. Shares were offered above the midpoint of the preliminary offering range and close 47.9% above the preliminary midpoint range at the first trading day.The immediate outlook for Model N remains good. The book-to-bill ratio came in at 1.20 for 2012, resulting in a growing backlog of future expected revenues. The long term growth prospects for cloud-based services remain good, especially during harsh economic times.A key risk for many small growing technology companies is the lack of diversification among its key customers. Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) and Amgen combined accounted for almost a quarter of total revenues. The top 15 customers account for roughly three quarters of total revenues.Furthermore, technology changes result in fast growing developments within the industry and fierce competition, possibly from new entrants. As a result Model N employs some 200 in staff dedicated to Research & Development alone, roughly a third of its total workforce. Large customers often tend to develop own applications, while Model N competes with the likes of ERP providers such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP (NYSE:SAP) in the medium-sized segment of the market.The current valuation of Model N is high and competition is fierce, putting pressure on margins. Yet the revenue multiple at 3.6 times annual revenues is in line with some of its larger competitors and the company is close to break even. At the same time, higher billings will result in further expected revenue growth into 2013.While a 95% renewal rate for its customer base is impressive, growth is slowing down a bit. After a 48% jump in the first trading day as a publicly listed company, shares are valued a little too rich. Valued at 3.6 times annual revenues, factoring in slower growth and the lack of profitability make be hesitant to pick up any shares at the moment.Yet Model N is not directly an obvious short. Other cloud-related public offerings such that of Guideware Software (NYSE:GWRE) and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) have been a huge success, as each of those companies have seen their shares price more than doubled ever since.I remain on the sidelines.Disclosure: I am short WDAY. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
1285161,28661,2013-03-19T06:09:42-04:00,,"The OfferingModel N (NYSE:MODN) is pricing just over 6.5 million shares of its stock in an initial public offering. The company is raising around $87 million and after the deal which is being managed by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Deutsche Bank Securities (NYSE:DB), the company will have a market capitalization of around $290 million. The expected price range for the offering is $12.50 - $14.50 per share.Model N's BusinessModel N provides revenue management solutions to companies that help maximize revenues and reduce revenue compliance risk by streamlining revenue lifecycle into a strategic end-to-end process. Its solutions consist of two software suites called Revenue Management Enterprise and Revenue Management Intelligence. Each suite contains applications which can be purchased together or individually. The Revenue Management Enterprise package automates the execution of processes like pricing, contracting and incentive management. This is the most popular package and for the last full fiscal year, accounted for 85% of total revenues. The company sells its products to life science customers like Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN), Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) and Bristol-Meyers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) and it also sells to technology players like Dell Inc. (DELL-OLD), Nokia Corporation (NYSE:NOK) and VMware, Inc. (NYSE:VMW).Companies That Compete With Model NModel N not only competes with both small and large software corporations, but many potential customers without significant IT resources use manual processes or personal database applications. While many large corporations are developing or have developed their own internal solutions that are company-specific. In addition, Model N faces competition from large enterprise software vendors like SAP AG (NYSE:SAP) and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL).Similar Offering'sJust last week, Silver Spring Networks (NYSE:SSNI) (which makes hardware and software solutions to help utilities convert existing infrastructure to the smart grid), priced shares that rose 25% on the first day of trading. It seemed to show a willingness by investors to buy technology companies who are not profitable yet and that there is some money on the sidelines wanting to go into new tech deals. That being said, there are a lot of issues set to go public this week, with eight deals currently in the works some money could be taken off the table.Model N's FinancialsModel N has been steadily increasing revenue over the past three years, making $50 million, $65 million and $84 million for fiscal years 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. Unfortunately, the cost of revenue has been increasing as well because of the company's efforts to hire more personnel and expand its marketing efforts. However, the company seems to be on the cusp of becoming profitable and was actually net income positive for 2010 and 2011, with just a $5.6 million net loss last year. Model N is making a profit on an EBIDTA basis which excludes expenses from its January 2012 acquisition of LeapFrogRx, which was purchased to expand Model N's analytics capabilities.How To Play Model NThis stock is somewhat of a speculative play as the $290 million market cap is a little rich considering it is not profitable and is only doing $84 million in revenue. This type of stock is not right for my own portfolio, however I do think there is a general interest in the company and the IPO should price near the top of the range and remain strong after the first day of trading. There is less risk involved in Model N's business than in many other tech companies and this IPO is definitely worth a closer look.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

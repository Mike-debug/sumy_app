Further, the two companies already had a financial ownership relationship, so integration risk should be none.By owning Sustainalytics outright, MORN can justify further investment in its offerings and integration across all of its relevant platforms, from individual advisors, asset managers to private equity firms and credit issuers.The onset of the recent COVID-19 pandemic only underlines the value of corporate governance and related risk quantification requirements for investors, so the deal makes strategic sense for MORN.The stock is potentially a different story, as my very generous DCF assumptions indicate it is potentially overvalued at its current level, giving me pause.While I like the deal for Sustainalytics, MORN as a stock is a tougher sell as I don't see a major catalyst in the near future.Given the lack of visible catalyst and uneven earnings performance, my bias on the stock is Neutral."

        Expense control and growth from the savvy PitchBook acquisition have helped Morningstar reignite earnings expansion.
        Morningstar's DBRS deal provides deeper exposure to the attractive credit ratings business, though DBRS is a distant fourth place.
        Overall, I like what the company is doing, but I'd prefer to buy shares under $130.","Morningstar (MORN) is one of the more unique firms that I have followed over the past several years. Although the company is publicly traded, founder and Executive Chairman Joe Mansueto controls roughly 51% of the company, affording it more long-term flexibility on capital allocation, cost structure, and general business decisions.Unlike many firms that flounder after a founder stepping away from full-time operations, Morningstar’s performance since Kunal Kapoor became CEO has been superb. Strong performing equity markets but also growth in Morningstar’s key business lines have sent the stock up over 80% since he took the helm, bolster shares.With a transformative merger recently completed, let’s take a look at the fintech software and research powerhouse. Ultimately, I think shares look slightly expensive, but I think the DBRS acquisition coupled with continued executional strength make shares attractive under $130.The last time I looked at the company, I noted that for years Morningstar grew revenue without any operating leverage. With low single digit revenue growth, operating income remained stubbornly flattish. 2018 was an excellent year for Morningstar. For 2018, total revenue jumped 11.4% y/y on an organic basis (+11.9% reported) to $1 billion; marking the first time the company achieved over $1 billion in revenue. Notably, much of Morningstar’s revenue comes from licensing and subscription fees t providing valuable recurring revenue streams over years, thus revenue growth accrues significant long-term value.Unlike the years of no operating leverage, operating income jumped 27% y/y to $216 million, generating a whopping 260 basis points of operating leverage. Free cash flow, the preferred metric of the Buffett-friendly firm jumped 30% y/y to $239 million. Buybacks were ultimately immaterial in 2018 due to stock-based compensation, but in the two years prior, management repurchased $32.5 million of stock on a net-basis. Thus, over the past three years, rising stock-based compensation has been more than offset by repurchases to the tune of $21.7 million.Strong performance continued in Q1’19. Revenue jumped 6.3% y/y (+8.3% organic) to $258.9 million, though operating income increased a less pronounced 4.2% y/y to $49.5 million, resulting in 40 basis points of margin deleverage. Expense management across the board remained solid, and the large increase in G&A spending (+26.7% y/y) was due primarily to a jump in stock-based compensation associated with PitchBook hitting incentive plan targets. Frankly, it’s hard to argue with paying the PitchBook management team higher bonuses, given the performance of the business since Morningstar acquired it. Subscriptions jumped 65% y/y in 2018 on top of a 43% gain in 2017, and total revenue jumped 57% y/y to $99.6 million. PitchBook sales jumped another 55% y/y in Q1’19 to $32.3 million, and Morningstar clearly seems to be a suitable owner for the platform.Morningstar’s other large products like Data (+5.8% y/y to $47.7 million) and Direct (+7.1% y/y to $36.3 million) performed relatively well, and the only meaningful drag on performance came from Morningstar Investment Management, where revenue declined 6.3% y/y to $26.7 million. Advisors are moving to lower fee investment strategies, and management noted that inflows did not recover after the rocky Q4.Overall, the legacy Morningstar business is performing well, and I believe operating margin weakness is acceptable given how well PitchBook has performed.Although the PitchBook acquisition already looks to be a home run, the more interesting M&A activity comes from Morningstar’s recent blockbuster acquisition of DBRS, the fourth largest credit rating agency in the world, for $669 million. Morningstar got its feet wet in the credit rating business when it acquired Realpoint in 2010, and over the past decade, the business grew to $36 million in revenue. This is decent, but it only represented 4% of sales. After acquiring DBRS, credit ratings will account for roughly 17% of Morningstar’s revenue.Although I tend to believe acquiring the market leader in the credit ratings space would be ideal, I am optimistic Morningstar can leverage its brand recognition and trust in the United States to grow the credit ratings business. In his thoughtful letter to stakeholders regarding the acquisition, Kapoor explained that the global credit ratings market has grown at a compounded rate of 7% over the past decade and that the increase in bond issuances in the US and Europe over the past decade has created significant ratings opportunities. The strategy makes sense, and if Morningstar can execute, I see significant runway for growing DBRS, which did $167 million in revenue in 2018.From a valuation perspective, Morningstar paid 4x sales for the business, which I estimate translates to a free cash flow multiple of 24-26x based on management’s guidance that margins are roughly in-line with Morningstar’s consolidated margin profile. Though expensive, I would hardly consider this multiple egregious, especially considering the concentration of the credit ratings business.Management earned credibility with its excellent PitchBook acquisition, and I like the idea of Morningstar getting deeper in this vertical. My only hesitation is that Morningstar likely could have acquired the business at a better price a few years ago when Carlyle and Warburg Pinus acquired the company. If I had a PitchBook subscription, I could probably figure out how much the PE firms paid, but the rumored price was around $500 million.Overall, I continue to be impressed by Morningstar’s ability to grow its market leading business for financial advisors, core data products, and PitchBook. Additionally, management’s expense control over the past few years has been excellent, allowing the company to generate some operating leverage and grow free cash flow. The DBRS acquisition provides another growth platform, and I will be interested to see how Morningstar capitalizes on this business.That being said, shares currently trade at roughly 23x my 2019 free cash flow estimate, which is not excessively priced, but it hardly provides a margin of safety given Morningstar’s dependency on higher equity markets for growth in multiple product lines. However, a price of $129, which is 20x my 2019 free cash flow estimate, would give me more comfort.Morningstar will add some leverage with this acquisition but the company generates plenty of free cash flow, to sustain a more leveraged capital structure, so I do not consider debt a material concern. Morningstar’s stock will swoon if equity markets fall, and I would capitalize on a drop."
4268075,25120,2019-06-03T18:27:53-04:00,Morningstar has bought DBRS in a deal which will provide a big boost to the business.Reasonable deal multiples and excess cash holdings make the deal accretive.I like the move and track record of Morningstar yet find shares simply too expensive at this point in time.,"Morningstar (MORN) has hit the buy button again as it has acquired DBRS, the fourth largest credit rating agency across the globe, in an effort to fortify its leading position in this environment. Investors like the deal as relative sales multiples look reasonable while Morningstar has made some savvy deals in recent years, including the purchase of PitchBook, among others.I like the deal yet recognise that, as shares have doubled over the past two years, multiple expansion has been very significant, too much to consider with any reasonable margin of safety.Morningstar has reached a deal to buy DBRS in a $669 million deal. Together with its own Credit Rating business, the combination will enjoy greater asset class coverage in fixed income analysis and research.DBRS is particularly strong in Canada but operates in the US and Europe as well. The company rates some 50,000 securities across the globe from nearly 2,500 issuers.The company generates annual sales of $167 million, suggesting a 4.0 times sales multiple has been paid for the business as margins are similar to those reported by Morningstar. Those multiples look pretty fair, but for that, we first have to look at Morningstar itself.Morningstar has managed to break through the one billion revenue barrier last year as sales rose by 11.9% to $1.02 billion, with growth almost entirely explained by an 11.4% increase in organic sales.Operating earnings grew by 27% to $215.8 million, for very compelling margins in the low-20s. The company has seen solid momentum across the board in terms of selling of data, licenses, ratings as actual assets under management of managed portfolio and associated revenues derived from them show solid growth as well. Organic growth slowed down to a still impressive 8.7% in the final quarter of the year and 8.3% in the first quarter of 2019.In traditional fashion, the balance sheet of the company is very robust as the company ended the first quarter of the year with a net cash position of $350 million. With 43 million shares currently trading at $140, the company is awarded a $6.02 billion equity valuation and $5.7 billion enterprise valuation, equal to 5.6 times sales. In that light, the purchase of DBRS looks solid at just a 4.0 times sales multiple as the pace of current growth has not been disclosed. I suggest we have to trust management, as I recognise that Morningstar has been pretty savvy dealmaker in the past.These observations show that shares rose $4 per share in response to the deal announcement, working down to roughly $180 million in value creation on the back of the modest sales multiple and the fact that excess money is put to work.For starters is the observation that Morningstar is very underleveraged as it ended Q1 with $350 million in net cash. The purchase of DBRS will turn this into a net debt load of $320 million. With EBITDA of $310 million from Morningstar alone in 2018, this comes down to a leverage ratio of 1 times as the purchase of DBRS and organic growth will only reduce this leverage ratio further below the 1 times mark.More important is the actual earnings contribution. Assuming a similar 21% margin on $167 million in sales, the deal will contribute $35 million in operating earnings. Assuming a blended cost of interest (thus forfeited interest on net cash holdings and incurred borrowings) of 3% on the purchase price, additional interest comes in at $20 million. This estimate is probably on the high side, given the modest interest received on cash holdings.This suggests at least a $15 million pre-tax earnings contribution, or $12 million after taxes, which work down to $0.28 per share, but realistically about $0.30-0.40 per share, assuming lower net interest costs.This accretion is quite meaningful, with 2018 earnings amounting to $4.25 per share. These base earnings, some organic growth, and the deal could mean that a $5 per share number, at least as a run rate, might be achievable by the end of the year. That being said, we have to appreciate that at $140, shares trade at 28 times earnings, even in that upbeat case.Reality is that Morningstar is a very nice business, being stable, diversified and underleveraged. The company has seen strong growth in the past and has proven to be a savvy dealmaker, yet expectations have gotten a bit out of hand after shares have doubled between the summer of 2017 until today.The last time when I looked at the company was autumn of 2016 as the company announced the $225 million acquisition of PitchBook, a real recent growth engine, which at the time was the largest deal to date.That business brought in $100 million in sales in 2018, making it a real growth engine with trailing sales amounting to just $31 million at the time of the deal announcement. In the same article, I noted the long-term sales growth of Morningstar, with operating margins having ranged between 22% and 27% in the recent years, and now, actually coming in below that. That is a concern, but with healthy topline revenue growth, it does not have to be a real issue.I ended up concluding that, with shares trading in the 70s the time, to become a buyer at $60-65, levels which shares nearly hit later that year and in the first half of 2017, but never ended up buying a position.Runaway momentum seen ever since, in terms of sales growth and the share price (involving significant multiple inflation), means that I am now upping by my desired entry target. Despite this more constructive stance, I would need a significant pullback towards the $100 mark before potentially getting upbeat on the shares."
4214218,57252,2018-10-25T09:30:20-04:00,"Morningstar is doing a wonderful job growing top-line.Strength is broad-based, but Data and PitchBook are the clear standouts.Shares aren't overpriced at current levels, but they are not cheap. Morningstar agrees as they have cut back on their repurchases.I would add a starter position under $110 and consider a full position in the low $90 range.","Coincidentally, I was reviewing some of the stocks that I haven't researched in a long time, and Morningstar (MORN) was at the top of the list on the same day it happened to report third quarter earnings. Since I last recommended buying shares on the Wall Street Journal hit piece in late 2017, the stock has rallied from $82.75 to $115, a gain of roughly 39% before dividends.In the past year, the company has continued to grow revenue in the double digits while doing a better job of controlling operating expenses than in years past under the leadership of Kunal Kapoor. I love what Kapoor has done, though admittedly the company is benefitting from a really great acquisition (PitchBook) and generally favorable market conditions. Nevertheless, I believe shares are now worth about $110. I would love to repurchase shares in the event of a material pullback. Let's take a look at what is driving the Morningstar turnaround.Morningstar's revenue growth turnaround really started in 2017 with the new generations of advisor software platforms. Morningstar Direct revenue was up a solid 12.6% y/y in FY17 to $124 million while the Advisor Workstation product accelerated to 6% growth from just 1.2% in the year prior.However, in 2018, it has been data and PitcbBook pacing the company. Data revenue, Kapoor's previous area of management, is up a whopping 12.5% y/y to $137.6 million. I suspect management is growing data by both adding to the amount and quality of data as well as figuring out ways to better segment customers for pricing. Data is Morningstar's sweet spot, and I am excited to see this high incremental margin business accelerate.PitchBook has grown a whopping 56% y/y to $70 million. Clearly, the business benefits from Morningstar's sales infrastructure and brand. However, I think PitchBook is a nice asset serving a market that has a fairly insatiable demand for private company data. This is a perfect example of filling in where FactSet (FDS) and CapIQ (SPGI) have deficient product offerings. I also wonder if this helps pull-through other Morningstar data products. Morningstar has not demonstrated a particular skill for acquiring assets, but I think they broke their M&A playbook with PitchBook. I'm very pleased to see what I suspect is a highly value-creative transaction occurring at a company known for acquiring assets (footnoted, HelloWallet) and divesting them a few years later.Overall, revenue is up 13.2% (12.4% organic) y/y to $757 million. Every business aside from workplace solutions is growing at a solid rate, and it feels like the company has finally figured out how to grow the business.When Morningstar was growing revenue in the low-to-mid single digits, it seemed like the story every single year was margin deleverage due to headcount growth and general expense growth. The trend is finally reversing, and once again operating margin is in excess of 20%.Year-to-date, only sales and marketing spending has grown faster than revenue, up 13.4% y/y to 15% of sales. G&A and COGS were both leveraged strongly, leading operating income to grow 31% y/y to $167 million, equal to 22% of sales. Combined with US tax cuts, EPS surged 43% y/y to $3.27 per share.Why has Morningstar suddenly been able to leverage G&A? I do not believe it is because the past investments the company made were long-term accretive. Rather, I think the company is doing a great job of managing headcount growth and overall compensation expenses. Admittedly, headcount is up 8.5% y/y, but we aren't aware of the composition of headcount growth. The company might be adding headcount significantly in lower labor cost countries, which may explain how total G&A spending grew only slightly faster than headcount.With cost controls improving, Morningstar's cash generation has been superb. Operating cash flow surged 27% y/y to $210 million, which coupled with limited capex growth drove free cash flow 30% higher y/y to $154 million. With technology companies that revolve around data experiencing explosive capex growth, I was impressed to see Morningstar only increase capital spending 19% YTD. In any event, the Morningstar model is generating excellent cash flow, and I am excited to see how management allocates capital going forward.In terms of capital allocation, I think Morningstar acknowledged that its stock has run-up a bit beyond intrinsic value. The company did not repurchase shares in Q3, and the amount of capital spent on buybacks in 2018 is down roughly 75% y/y to just $10.8 million. Management is fairly disciplined with repurchases, and I think we could see activity re-accelerate in Q4 if the stock price languishes below $120.Shares of Morningstar are certainly not cheap at current prices. The company could very easily exceed $200 million in free cash flow in FY18, which would value the company at roughly 25x free cash flow. For a high recurring revenue business growing in the low double digits, this is not an expensive price. However, it does reflect quite a bit of optimism regarding capital markets, which I believe fundamentally drive the Morningstar business. Recent volatility certainly could weigh on results, and we could see investors' pullback assets and advisors cut spending if clients move to cash.Nevertheless, CEO Kunal Kapoor is doing a wonderful job of adding onto the company legacy that founder Joe Mansueto built. I think Kapoor has a keen eye for monetizing data, and he is undoubtedly more concerned with communicating with Wall Street than his predecessor. I admire what Kapoor has done, and shares will sit on my watch list. I am near certain to buy a starter position if shares fall below $110, and I would consider making it a full position in the low $90 range."

Users had previously asked for more ‘human’ interaction, so the new hybrid service seeks to fill that need.Investment Terms and RationaleAlong with Morningstar, other investors in the current round included lead investor Rethink Impact and other investors PSP Growth, Salesforce Ventures (CRM), CreditEase Fintech Investment Fund, LH Holdings, SK Impact Fund, Khosla Ventures, Mellody Hobson, Contour Venture Partners, Ulu Ventures and Astia Angels.Valuation was not disclosed. Ellevest has now raised more than $44 million in funding since inception. Of the current $34.6 million, $9.6 million was converted from a previously promissory note into equity.A number of investors invested due to the social mission aspect of the deal, seeking to help advance equality in this area of need.Morningstar was a previous investor in the startup, having led Ellevest’s big first funding of $10 million in 2015.As to the use of the new funding, Ellevest CEO Krawcheck stated in the deal announcement,Morningstar has not been a very active corporate investor in technology startups, investing in only a handful of companies since 2009.The graphic below shows its investment focus by various metrics (click to enlarge),(Source: Mattermark)The graphic indicates that Morningstar’s investments have mostly been in B2B startups at early and growth stages. Additionally, it has focused its activity on companies in the finance, banking and analytics industry sectors.While Morningstar has been quite choosy in its investments, it has largely stuck to its core focus of financial businesses, so in that respect, Ellevest is another investment well within its primary business focus.Given that Morningstar led Ellevest’s first round in 2015, it stands to benefit from inside knowledge of Ellevest’s progress as well as potentially having a right of first refusal should Ellevest be approached for acquisition at some point in the future.Either way, MORN is well positioned should Ellevest catch fire in the marketplace for providing financial advice tailored to the needs of women.I write about M&A deals, public company investments in technology startups, and IPOs.

4012403,25120,2016-10-17T00:06:15-04:00,"Morningstar announced a nice bolt-on deal at a time when the core is struggling.I like the bolt-on deal of PitchBook given the growth, good prospects and effective usage of net cash balances.Despite the organic growth struggles, investors are still awarding shares a premium earnings multiple.To compensate for slow growth, I only see real appeal in the low sixties at this point in time.","Morningstar (MORN) announced the nice bolt-on acquisition of PitchBook. The $225 million deal is one of the largest in its history. I like the deal given the relative attractive sales multiples given the strong growth rates reported by the acquired business.The deal comes at a time when Morningstar itself is struggling to report organic growth, after having grown rapidly in recent years, providing a much needed boost to the overall organic growth profile of Morningstar.Despite the nice move, I am still cautious with regard to Morningstar´s shares on the back of a still premium valuation at a time when the core business is facing some struggles.Buying Much Needed GrowthMorningstar has agreed to acquire PitchBook Data, a provider of data, research and technology focusing on venture capital, private equity and M&A.Morningstar is familiar with PitchBook which was founded back in 2007, as Morningstar already owned a 20% stake in the business following an early investment. Morningstar´s upcoming CEO Kunal Kapoor has been on the board of the company since 2012. The company will now pay $180 million for the remaining 80% stake in PitchBook, valuing the entire business at $225 million.Morningstar points to the rapidly growing interest in private markets and private companies. By combining PitchBook´s knowledge of these markets with the research power of Morningstar and the global coverage, it is expected that PitchBook can continue to grow.PitchBook generated sales of $31.1 million on a trailing basis, suggesting that the multiples are pretty steep at 7.2 times trailing sales. That said, bookings have surpassed $22 million in the first half of the year, translating into an annualized $44 million revenue number. If that is more realistic, the sales multiples fall towards 5.1 times revenues.Growth Has Slowed Down, PitchBook Is Much NeededMorningstar has grown from a $300 million business in 2006 to nearly $800 million in revenues in 2015. Organic growth has ranged anywhere between 5 and 9% over the past five years, as the company at times has made bolt-on deals to accelerate the reported growth numbers.While these growth rates are very impressive, organic growth has slowed down in recent times. Organic revenue growth slowed down towards the lower end of the longer growth range at 5.4% in the fourth quarter of 2015, with reported growth coming in at just 2.6%.Organic growth slowed down to 2.6% in the first quarter of this year and fell by 1.3% in the second quarter, marking a severe deceleration in operational momentum. Management attributes this to lower volumes in mortgage backed securities, uncertainty in financial markets at the start of the year and lower internet advertising revenues. These headwinds were only partially offset by some relative strength at the research business.Revenues Are Flat, Margins Are PressuredMorningstar´s growing revenue base is very lucrative, as operating margins have ranged anywhere between 22% and 27% of sales over the past decade.Reported revenues are down 0.4% in the first half of the year to $390.3 million. Inflation with regard to the cost base has been hurting margins as operating margins fell by nearly two percentage points towards 22.2% of sales.On the back of a lower tax rate, Morningstar has limited the fall in net earnings, which were down by 2% to $60.5 million. Continued buybacks, financed by the strong balance sheet, allowed for flattish earnings per share.On the back of these trends earnings per share of $3 are attainable for 2016 although the multiple remains elevated. Even after shares have fallen 5% so far this year, trading at $75, shares trade at 25 times earnings despite a lack of organic growth at this point in time.The company does have a strong balance sheet, with cash holdings of $245 million being offset by merely $75 million in debt. This net cash position of $170 million will evaporate overnight given the $180 million purchase of the remaining 80% stake in PitchBook.Challenges Ahead, I Like The DealMorningstar itself trades around 4 times sales at the moment. This multiple reflects the solid earnings, and great track record of growth, while the business is facing some headwinds at the moment.The $180 million remaining cash component for PitchBook will eliminate most of the current net cash position, but will add a business with $44 million in annualized sales. This move will grow revenues by 5-6%, but more importantly it will contribute in a meaningful way to the short term challenged growth profile. While we do not have any information regarding the margins reported by PitchBook, the 5 times multiple seems justifiable.A Great Model, Requiring A Margin Of SafetyOn a pro-forma basis, Morningstar is an unleveraged business which has improved its growth profile following the latest bolt-on move at a time when the core is facing some struggles.Given the solid state of the balance sheet, low capital requirements, predictability of the business and long term track record, I consider a 18-20 times earnings multiple as being attractive. If the latest deal could boost the earnings number from $3.00 towards $3.25 per share going forward, such multiples translate into a targeted entry point around $58-$65 per share. As shares are still 15-25% removed from those levels, I will be a very patient buyer, applauding management on the nice deal."
4116705,57252,2017-10-26T09:10:08-04:00,"The Wall Street Journal released a hit piece on Morningstar that amounts to little more than noise.The piece did cause Morningstar to sell-off dramatically.After strong Q3 results, I think shares are worth $92.","Shares of Morningstar (MORN) slid in trading on October 25th after an outright hit piece from The Wall Street Journal. Because the piece is behind a pay wall, I will only summarize the key points:The fact that the stock traded down nearly 5% was, in my view, a complete overreaction to the article. Morningstar’s CEO Kunal Kapoor posted a rebuttal, and I think it's important to note that Morningstar addressed the backward-looking nature of the star rating system in 2011 when it implemented analyst medal ratings that attempt to be forward-looking in nature. In addition to the Wall Street Journal, Morningstar posted third-quarter results that were outstanding. Let’s take a quick look at why the hit piece actually validates Morningstar’s moat, and why Morningstar’s Q3 demonstrated great momentum in the core business.My above summary of the WSJ article is concise but fairly accurate. Now, in my view, the key takeaway was that financial advisors are lazy and sometimes allocate capital based on Morningstar ratings. The likes of Fidelity will pay Morningstar good money, though a low percentage of Morningstar’s overall revenue, to advertise a 5-star rating. Why? Because 5-star ratings very clearly attract capital flows.The WSJ portrayed this as a bad occurrence for society, but I disagree – especially since WSJ’s own data shows that 5-star funds outperform 4-star funds and so on. Naturally, like in any field, some financial advisors fail to perform due diligence, which can lead to bad outcomes. Morningstar ratings are meant to be a tool in the evaluation arsenal, not the end all be all. Some advisors will continue to select 5-star funds and hold Morningstar culpable for performance, but ultimately, I think this simply underscores the value of Morningstar’s brand name. The WSJ piece may do some very short-term damage, but with such great ability to drive capital flows, Morningstar’s value to the fund industry remains stronger than ever.Morningstar built on its strong second quarter performance with great third quarter results. Revenue jumped 17.3% y/y (8.7% organic) to $229.9 million driven by the PitchBook acquisition and strong across all of its key products. I was particularly pleased to see Morningstar Direct revenue jump 15.5% y/y as the product continues to resonate with advisors. Data revenue was also up strong, jumping 7.5% y/y, while Morningstar Investment Management posted 6.6% y/y growth ahead of the launch of Morningstar’s own mutual funds.The best part of the quarter was undoubtedly the operating leverage. I’ve been frustrated with Morningstar’s ability to grow operating income, as noted in my last earnings review:During the third quarter, operating income grew a whopping 19.7% y/y to $52.8 million, an increase of $8.6 million. I also noted that I thought Kapoor would be more diligent with headcount than Joe Mansueto. Morningstar added headcount of 145 employees in Q3, which was actually up slightly sequentially, but I think it will prove to be conservative for the year, as Q4 should be slower.Operating cash flow and free cash flow are up significantly, with YTD operating cash flow up 15% y/y to $164.7 million driving free cash flow up nearly 24% y/y to $118 million, as capex has remained virtually flat. Morningstar will have the opportunity to use this new cash for deployment into interesting acquisitions like PitchBook or to reward shareholders with returns of capital.Based on the broad strength of Morningstar YTD, I am increasing my fair value estimate to $92 per share. I believe this could prove to be conservative, as I believe Morningstar could create massive amounts of shareholder value by with its entry into the mutual fund industry. I will be buying shares on the open tomorrow, as I believe the market will quickly digest the Wall Street Journal article as nothing but noise."

I continue to believe shares have upside to $90. Let’s review recent performance and what has changed.Reinvigorated revenue growthIn my view, the most important factor driving Morningstar’s share performance has been reinvigorated revenue growth driven not only by PitchBook, but also by strong performance in the core business. Overall, revenue was up 15.6% y/y, with organic revenue growth (excluding PItchBook) up 9.2% y/y.Source: Company filingsEvery single business was up sharply in Q2, with Data up 6.2%, Direct up 12.7%, Investment Management up 9.7%, Advisor Workstation up 10.6%, and Workplace Solutions up 13.4% y/y. With revenue growth accelerating in Q2, we can safely expect strong results in Q3 and Q4, as Morningstar has likely one several important contracts.Overall, I’m very pleased with top-line performance, though I suspect a great deal of growth is driven by fiduciary rules remaining in place, explaining the clear jump in growth from Q1 to Q2. Regardless, this should be very solid long-term revenue that generates solid free cash flow for years to come.Operating leverage fails to materialize…but it should in timeWhile I am pleased with top-line performance, I am a little baffled by the lack of operating income growth. During Q2, the 15.6% increase in revenue added $31 million in sales but a paltry $1.4 million in EBIT. Headcount excluding PitchBook jumped 8.4% y/y, and I believe we need to see some fairly significant increases in revenue to justify the additional spend. Excluding PitchBook, operating income grew 7.1% y/y –slightly disappointing but better than the GAAP number.That being said, I think Morningstar has the ability to accelerate growth at a property like PitchBook that will allow it to leverage its massive fixed costs and existing data. Additionally, I think Kapoor seems more focused on improving shareholder returns than his predecessor, Joe Mansuetto, who could afford to run Morningstar like a private company given his large ownership position. Kapoor looks like he is the right leader to take a fresh look at Morningstar’s operating margin and expense spending.Capital allocation remains strongMorningstar did a commendable job in divesting its ownership of HelloWallet. The company identified it as a non-core asset, selling it for $23.7 million –a loss of over 50%, but a return better than -100%. I think this asset was completely out of Morningstar’s core customer base, and I think it had virtually no business in the Morningstar portfolio.Additionally, Morningstar has repurchased $27.7 million worth of stock during the quarter, capitalizing on its weak share price. Given its capital light business model, I anticipate Morningstar to remain a share-eating cannibal for years to come. As long as shares are purchased around fair value, repurchases will create value for shareholders.Overall, I am incredibly pleased to see Morningstar engage in some robust organic revenue growth, though I am a bit disappointed in operating earnings growth. Nevertheless, I think Kapoor has a good grip on how to tighten expenses, and I think we could see some operating profit growth in the mid-single digits in the back-half of 2017 and in 2018. Shares continue to look somewhat undervalued at current levels, though a broader market pullback would put a lid on share price growth. My fair value remains unchanged at $90 per share."
4022853,57252,2016-11-13T03:15:58-05:00,"Morningstar has a new CEO, new large, fast-growing segment, and a strong core business.Organic growth has been pretty lackluster and faces a few headwinds.I am slightly increasing my fair value estimate, and I think shares look reasonably cheap.","Shares of investment research, data, and software giant Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN) are down a whopping 12% year-to-date. During this time period, the company has experienced several changes including the appointment of a new CEO, acquisition of PitchBook and weak growth. My initial fair value projection for the end of 2016 was $97, but I am moderating my estimate to $90 due to the firm's weaker than anticipated growth. Let's take a look at the key changes, and why I think Morningstar's competitive advantages remain intact.New CEO Net-NeutralManagement changes tend to excite many investors with the possibility of a material change in strategy or capital allocation. I do not believe new CEO Kunal Kapoor will run the company dramatically different than founder/CEO Joe Mansuetto. Kapoor will likely focus on continuing Morningstar's key values, though I believe he could be slightly more aggressive in implementing strategic changes than Mansuetto was. The only basis for this claim would be that Masuetto, as majority shareholder, did not have the same incentive implement change swiftly. Although I think Kapoor will be given free reign with minimal interference, I believe he will have a greater sense of urgency and work to increase Morningstar's growth rate.Overall, though I can see the pace of change increasing at Morningstar, I think the change will be net-neutral. I do not believe Kunal possesses a different view for the company's future.PitchBook Deal an Ideal Bolt-onFor a financial technology company, Morningstar has a surprisingly fertile M&A pipeline. The company has been able to execute several deals over the past five years, and PitchBook is the perfect bolt-on. PitchBook sells into a similar callpoint (investment data buyers), and I actually think there could be some cross-selling of existing Morningstar products into strategic users of PitchBook data-global companies looking to perform M&A.My favorite type of M&A is exactly what Morningstar has done with PitchBook-close to the core, some potential synergies, and a business model that the acquirer completely understands. Kapoor has been on the PitchBook board since 2012, and Morningstar has been a minority since 2009. In my experience, the riskiest M&A comes from purchases outside of a business' core. This is where massive diligence misses occur.Equally as important, the deal adds $31m in TTM revenue. Sales have been growing at a CAGR of 70% over the past five years. While it seems unlikely for that trend to hold, a 25% CAGR over the next five years would put revenue from PitchBook around $100m. Even a modest $5-8m in incremental growth annually could increase Morningstar's growth rate close to 1%. Assuming operating margins of 15-20%, the deal will be margin dilutive, but accretive to earnings overall.Q3 results were lacklusterThe largest issue Morningstar faces at the present is revenue growth. Q3 suffered from a decline in transaction volumes for its credit ratings business. This tailwind is hopefully temporary in nature and accelerates if credit issuances also accelerate. Contrarily, the Morningstar.com advertising business is facing challenges more permanent in nature as advertisers flock to more targeted platforms. The drag from Morningstar.com is likely enough to prevent organic growth from exceeding 2%.Currency-neutral revenue growth tallied 1.1% in Q3, though revenue was up just 0.4% on a reported basis. Operating income declined 4.6% y/y as the company added significant data center headcount. Morningstar's quarterly income fluctuations are not material enough to worry about, and I think free cash flow will remain on-track for its usual $180-200m performance.Fair value up to $90 from $88 driven by PitchBookAs I noted before, this performance is enough to maintain the business' current intrinsic value, but we will need to see some top-line to see the value of the business increase. I have slightly increased my intrinsic value estimate based on the acquisition of PitchBook, but the poor organic growth performance limits the increase in fair value to only $2/share.Shares look expensive based on traditional metrics, but Morningstar has several factors supporting its premium valuation. 1.) Mansuetto's ownership makes the company impervious to compromising long-term performance for short-term goals, 2.) the company should be able to create some value with M&A via PitchBook and potentially ycharts in the future, and 3.) the company has several businesses with strong competitive advantages that generate tremendous free cash flow. Shares are slightly undervalued at current levels."

Following the herd feels safe… right up until the point where the herd leads you right off a cliff.“The Morningstar Mirage,” a recent article from the Wall Street Journal, shows the dangers of herd following in the mutual fund industry. Despite the repeated warning “past performance is not an indicator of future results” investors continue to pile into funds that get a five-star Morningstar rating, then find themselves disappointed when the funds fail to outperform.Morningstar’s (MORN) success and growth is impressive. The firm’s ability to compete and take market share from other sell-side firms deserves respect. However, the growing dominance of the firm in the research business also leads to harmful inefficiencies and distortions in the market. Investors and advisors deserve other, independent sources of research that go beyond Morningstar’s backward-looking methodology.“History is strewn with examples where star fund managers have fallen to earth when their luck or skill deserted them, but the Morningstar ranking adjusted only slowly downwards, with Legg Mason’s Bill Miller perhaps being the most prominent example.”Source: “Morningstar: A force to be reckoned with” By Stephen Foley.Officially, Morningstar cautions investors against treating its star ratings as predictive. “We have always been very clear that it’s not intended to predict future performance,” the company wrote to the Wall Street Journal in response to their findings.In practice, the media has identified several cases of Morningstar and its officers touting the ratings as having predictive value. For example, Morningstar’s official Twitter account shared a quote from columnist Matt Levine saying “Morningstar is better at picking mutual funds than I would have expected.” The company conveniently ignored that he also said he expected Morningstar to have zero ability to pick mutual funds.“Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM” was a common cliché in corporate America for decades. IBM was the safe choice. If you bought IBM machines for your company and they had issues, you wouldn’t face any repercussions because it was such a conventional, safe decision. All too often, purchasing agents would go with IBM over a smaller company that might fit their needs better to avoid any risk.The same issue has been true in the mutual fund industry for years. Morningstar ratings are a convenient safety net. Pick a five-star rated fund that underperforms, and people will chalk it up to bad luck. Pick a lower rated fund that underperforms, and people will question your judgment. One former adviser quoted in the WSJ piece affirmed this conventional wisdom:“Advisers get in trouble when they go against the grain. You isolate yourself more if you sell something else rather than just go with what research recommends.”However, other conversations in the article indicate that Morningstar ratings no longer provide the cover they once did. One municipal police pension fund in Illinois found itself disappointed with the return of its five-star fund. The pension board left its Morgan Stanley (MS) broker for a local one in part due to Morgan Stanley’s reliance on Morningstar ratings.Investors increasingly understand that Morningstar’s fund ratings do not constitute sufficient diligence to serve as the entire basis of an investment recommendation.Morningstar rating changes have a huge impact on fund flows as investor money piles into top rated funds. As a result, fund managers will often do or spend whatever it takes to get the best rating.Many fund managers hire executives specifically to manage relations with Morningstar. They also lobby heavily (see Financial Times: “Morningstar: A force to be reckoned with”) to earn the best “Analyst Rating,” the more qualitative alternative to the star ratings that Morningstar unveiled in 2011. These executive salaries and lobbying activities translate into higher fees for investors.In addition, fund managers sometimes pursue suboptimal strategies in order to cater to the Morningstar ratings system. David Blanchett offers a great analysis of one of these distortions in his paper “Gaming the system: the impact of Morningstar category changes on peer rankings” in the Journal of Investing.Blanchett discovered that underperforming fund managers in one category will sometimes “drift” into different categories where their relative ranking looks better. Funds that engaged in this style drift saw significant fund inflows after making the switch, but they went on to underperform their new peers. Even worse, fund managers pursuing this strategy typically saw their new category underperform their old one, further hurting returns for shareholders.In essence, the dominance of Morningstar’s research created a situation where it was more profitable for fund managers to pursue a course that hurt investor returns.More broadly, Morningstar’s dominant voice in the fund industry creates the potential for groupthink and market inefficiencies. Markets with a large number of independent estimates of value are likely to be more efficient, even if those estimates are all individually flawed (See “Market Efficiency and the Bean Jar Experiment”). When one institution can impact investor flows the way Morningstar does, you lose some of that independence, which increases the potential for instability and inefficiency.The market needs multiple, independent voices analyzing mutual funds and their holdings to serve as alternatives to Morningstar’s overly dominant and, often, backward-looking ratings.Fund industry expert Chuck Jaffe wrote an article a few years ago about how he picks a new fund. In the article, he writes that before settling on a fund, he checks with Morningstar, Lipper, and New Constructs. In addition to checking with analysts, Mr. Jaffe does a great deal of diligence on his own by reading fund newsletters, examining costs, and figuring out tax impacts.The key here is that Mr. Jaffe consults several sources of research, along with his own due diligence, before making a decision on a fund. If he likes a fund, he specifically looks for research that contradicts his thesis to see if his conclusions still hold up.Investors deserve this level of diligence. Brokers and advisors that just buy five-star rated funds without consulting other research or performing their own diligence are not fulfilling their fiduciary duty.This article originally published on November 2, 2017.Disclosure: David Trainer and Sam McBride receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, style, or theme.Follow us on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and StockTwits for real-time alerts on all our research."

As someone who works in financial publishing, I'm familiar with the financial publishing business.And one of my favorite companies is Morningstar, Inc. (NASDAQ: MORN).As an investment research and publishing firm, Morningstar provides some of the highest quality products and services to both independent investors and financial advisors. And its name is well known for it.The company recently reported that its fourth quarter 2015 earnings grew 18.4% year over year to $37.3 million, as revenues rose only 2.6% to $201.6 million.Let's look at the company's annual numbers over the last five years:In 2014, Morningstar's earnings dipped due to a $61.0 million litigation settlement that contributed to about half of its total increase in operating expenses. Adjusting for this non-recurring expense, 2014 earnings growth would have been positive.The company's current balance sheet is healthy, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.61 and current ratio of 1.3.Now on to the valuation.In my estimation of the company's value, using a discounted cash flow model, I make a number of conservative assumptions.According to my analysis, Morningstar is valued at $121.25 per share. Yet, as of this writing, the stock price closed at $79.79 (a 34% discount to its estimated value).Keep in mind that the projected growth rate is very conservative. Morningstar's FCF has grown at a compounded rate of over 10% in the last five years. And considering the conservative assumptions behind its estimated value, I believe there is a significant value opportunity here.In November 2015, Morningstar completed its acquisition of Total Rebalance Expert, which provides automated and tax-efficient portfolio rebalancing capabilities for financial advisors. Last year, the company also repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares (for $97.0 million), and it still is authorized to repurchase an additional $376.5 million in shares.Now, the dividend is nothing to drool over - only 1% - but you're still getting paid to wait. All in all, management is clearly focused on increasing shareholder value, and at the current market price, this stock is demonstrably undervalued.Note to Readers: I choose to think of Seeking Alpha as both a community and a marketplace of ideas.

It presently stands at the unprecedented level of 95.34.We don't remember having seen anything like this. Will gravity ever set in here? Morningstar (MORN) is a research outfit for investors, you can see that on their website. It's akin to Barron's, IBD or Motley Fool. Here are some of its products (from FinViz)To this we have to add PitchBook (a provider of data on private markets), which just had its first full quarter of contribution after Morningstar acquired the datafirm in October 2016 for $180M for the shares it didn't already own.We have no explanation for the time lag between the acquisition and Morningstar arguing in its latest earnings PR that Q1 2018 was its first full quarter of contribution, apart from the fact that Pitchbook was apparently only recently integrated:A little overview:MORN Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsQuite frankly, this is a little puzzling at first sight. There is certainly improvement but the share price seems to rise considerably faster than the underlying fundamentals, this becomes a little clearer with a longer-term chart:Five years back, the share price was roughly $60, it has more than doubled since, with nearly all the gains just this year.It's a little curious that a company dedicated to providing information to investors doesn't do earnings CCs but the reason for the liftoff of the shares isn't hard to find. It's right in the Q1 earnings PR:That's quite explosive, even if 8 cents of the EPS was because of the tax law and 18 cents from a one-off tax gain on the sale of their consulting services. Even so, this is an explosive EPS growth and it's the product of several forces.The main revenue sources are (from the earnings PR):PitchBook especially is off to a flying start.In the 10-Q, management speaks of both challenges and opportunities:When we look at a table from the 10-Q, which splits out the sources of revenues, we see little in terms of these supposed challenges:In fact, investment management revenues grew by 22.1%, which is even a bit above corporate average (+16.2%). The opportunities lie of course in the extensive data platforms that Morningstar can offer its clients in order to aid the demand for increased transparency and self-managed investment.There are those that argue that some of the Morningstar products aren't all that useful. For instance, their ratings (for instance of mutual funds) are basically backward-looking and have little or no predictive value, yet they remain popular. Here is SA contributor David Trainer explaining:Yet ratings change cause huge changes in investment behavior testifying to the enduring influence of Morningstar.MORN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsMargins do not seem to be trending, although in Q1 2018, operating expense grew only 8.2%, which is half the growth rate of revenues so there was clearly some leverage operating here, indeed, compared to a year ago (earnings PR):But this massive increase is due to the low operating margins in Q1 2017 and also some one-offs like favorable timing of some expenses so the dramatic improvement isn't going to last.Equally, EPS ($0.98) was also inflated by $0.18 in temporary factors as we have already reported above.MORN Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsThe company is a solid cash generating machine. Q1 operating cash flow was $59.9M, up $13.4M from a year ago. Free cash flow was $42.3M, up $10.1M from a year ago.The company has received quite a lot of cash in advance. From the 10-Q:Mind you, they have only received some of the cash related to these contract liabilities. From the 10-Q:MORN Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YChartsAs you can see, the company puts its cash flow to good use, paying a dividend (even if the yield is crashing due to the share price bonanza) and the buybacks are producing EPS leverage by reducing the amount of outstanding shares.Joe Mansueto, the founder and chairman owns 24.2M shares and he now wants to diversify at least some of these (1.6M) in the 12 months from May 2018 onwards.This could be a bit of a drag with average volume of just 68K shares, but a year is a long timeQuite healthy, we would say, with cash, cash equivalents, and investments at $355.4M (up $2.1M y/y) and $150.0M of long-term debt, which is down $30M y/y.MORN PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsAs you can see, valuation metrics jumped with the rise in the stock price and have reached really substantial levels.While the company's performance has been impressive, the latest quarterly results were exaggerated by a number of one-offs. Given the already rather elevated valuation metrics, we won't be buyers here even if we recognize that the company is likely to keep powering ahead.While the momentum from revenue growth and share buybacks is likely to continue, we don't see any structural increase in margin nor multiple expansion. The market might also get a little saturated at a certain moment."
3783956,57252,2015-12-31T16:17:00-05:00,"Morningstar is best known for its fund ratings and Morningstar.com, but the company has much more to offer.Morningstar Data and Advisor Workstation are excellent businesses with strong competitive advantages.CEO Joe Mansueto has significant skin in the game, with 55% of shares outstanding.For various reasons, the company seems unlikely to go private. However, investors will receive generous buybacks and dividend increases.Shares are worth $88 today and should be worth $97 in a year. Not a large margin of safety, but shares should produce an adequate return.","The world of investment research is highly competitive with sell-side banks like JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), specialized boutiques, Seeking Alpha, and many others battling for institutional clients, retail clients, and brokerage clients. Myself, and likely many other investors, often lump Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN) into this group. I think of it as the website with fund manager and equity manager ratings - often ignoring the rest of the business.Morningstar recently came up on one of my screens when the firm authorized an additional $300m buyback. Since 2010, the firm has retired a net amount of 7m shares (gross 9.3m) for $618.6m. With CEO and founder Joe Mansueto controlling approximately 55% of shares outstanding (24.5m shares), the free float stands at only 19m shares. As the company's core data and advisory businesses help drive over $120m in normalized free cash flow per year, I think the company is likely to achieve an intrinsic value of $97 per share by 2017. Therefore, I think shares have upside of about 20% over the next two years. Let's take a look at Morningstar's key segments, and why I think the company's choice of businesses leave it with several strong businesses with different competitive advantages.Morningstar Data - ""Wide Moat"" High ROIC businessMorningstar.com and its fund rating system tend to grab the headlines, but what investors often forget is that Morningstar has one of the largest financial databases on earth. The same data that powers Morningstar.com's large data set also feeds into sites like Yahoo Finance (NASDAQ:YHOO) and MSN Money (NASDAQ:MSFT). Morningstar's customers also include institutional money managers, broker-dealers, and other investment advisors.Key competitors in this space include FactSet (NYSE:FDS), Bloomberg, S&P, Moody's (NYSE:MCO) and Thomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI). Although the space is fairly competitive, the secret sauce of the business, data aggregation, is difficult to replicate. Morningstar's database goes back to the 1980s, and creating a similar database from scratch would take years to match. In spite of some price competition, Morningstar's marginal cost of placing new data is likely quite low, meaning that most incremental revenue flows to the bottom line.Stickiness is also a key driver of this segment's competitive advantage. It is not only cumbersome, but also quite difficult to perform any mass data migration. Once you pick a data provider, you are likely to stay with it. Morningstar has a 95% retention rate for its contracts, which includes advisor software, so I suspect that retention may even be a bit higher for the data business.In FY14, the segment generated $137m in revenue. Revenue is up just 1.6% YTD, but this growth has been negatively impact by currency. I expect annual organic growth in this segment to tally 4-6%, though I see some natural acquisition targets. Morningstar has already participated in multiple rounds of funding for Chicago-based data provider YCharts, and I think Morningstar will acquire this very interesting and powerful data provider within the next 2-3 years. I think the business will slot in nicely to Morningstar's captive advisor/RIA business. Additionally, I think Morningstar will look for acquisitions within adjacent financial data areas, as it did with Morningstar Commodity Data.Though the firm doesn't break out the balance sheet or even operating income by segment, I would not be surprised if this segment generates the highest returns on invested capital and operating profit.Morningstar Advisor Workstation - Flexible Solutions for a Growing MarketMorningstar Advisor Workstation is another nice business that Morningstar owns with high retention rates, high hurdles to switching, though its barriers to entry are considerably lower than Morningstar Data.Advisor Workstation is primarily two products: an enterprise version for large, affiliated advisors like LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) and an independent platform called Morningstar Office for independent advisors. As of Q3 2015, the company had 186 Advisor Workstation clients (up 8.8% y/y) and 4,256 Morningstar Office licenses (up 1.6% y/y).Both products are capable of handling most front and back-end needs for advisors, including report generation, data aggregation, and research. Workstation licenses are about $3,400 while Office costs advisors about $6,000 per seat. Given the functionality and power of these systems, I suspect that most advisors find them to be well worth the price. Morningstar also offers back office services that I suspect carry a strong margin profile.Source: MORN 2014 10-KUltimately, the competitive dynamics in this marketplace are favorable. Advisor Workstation faces more intense competition as the sales model lends itself to larger contracts and greater operating leverage. However, as we can see in the above chart, the firm has clawed back some market share in recent years. Competitors like Advent Software, Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW), Envestnet (NYSE:ENV), Thomson Reuters, and S&P all offer similar products with different presentations and levels of capabilities, but I think the Morningstar brand is particularly strong as its long history of mutual fund ratings resonates with advisors.Morningstar Office (as seen above) has grown at a furious pace, capitalizing on the movement of advisors from large wealth management firms to independent practices. Year to date, subscribers are down as I suspect Morningstar is facing a bit more competition in this space. However, I anticipate this product's growth to reaccelerate as the firm focuses on a next gen product in the next few years.Envestnet, in particular, has experienced tremendous growth over the past 5 years ($98m to $375m), but I would be fairly surprised to see Morningstar pursue an acquisition of this scope. Mansueto has shown tremendous patience and a willingness to build organically with small, tuck-in acquisitions. ByAllAccounts is a perfect example of the M&A I expect this segment to pursue - the company was small but owned a key niche in data integration. Acquiring it has made the Morningstar platform even more attractive to advisors.Overall, I like the direction of this segment, and I think it will be a key growth driver for the next several years. As evident from retention rates of ~95%, I have little doubt that these products are exceptionally sticky. I anticipate revenue growth to accelerate as the company moves to a next generation platform. Unfortunately, I think most of the growth will come from new licenses and cross-selling opportunities as the market for this software remains too competitive to increase price.Morningstar Direct - Tough Competition but Strong GrowthMorningstar Direct is another strong segment, though I would say Morningstar is undoubtedly one of the weaker hands. Direct is an institutional research platform that competes with the likes of Bloomberg, Capital IQ, and FactSet. As I have used all three products, I can confidently say that Bloomberg is the best, but it also carries a prohibitively high price.Direct is probably among the worst from a research standpoint, but much of its competitive advantage lies in its design and reporting functionality. Client testimonials indicate a heavy preference for the design and customized features of reports. This doesn't surprise me - particularly for wealth managers and others that have to consistently produce larger, detailed reports.Source: MORN 2014 10-KSurprisingly, this segment is growing quite well. I suspect the key drivers of this growth are the price of the service as well as the report functionality. Design is one of Morningstar's key competitive advantages - something that I cannot say for its competitors.Revenue in this segment grew about 15.7% y/y in 2014 and is up 10% YTD. With product enhancements throughout 2015 and 2016, I anticipate revenue growth to remain robust. The segment will generate over $100m in revenue this year, and it could be a $150m business within the next 5 years.Retirement Solutions - Strong Growth, Strong ProductRetirement Solutions is another low-profile Morningstar business that is growing at a rapid pace. This segment focuses on custom models, management retirement accounts, and plan sponsor advice. The revenue model is not as well laid out in the company's reports as it is for other segments, but the focus on AUM in the annual report leads me to believe there is a strong relationship between AUM and revenue. I suspect there is a fee charged as a percentage of AUM.Source: MORN 2014 10-KConcurrent with the fairly robust growth in AUM, the Retirement Solutions segment has grown from just $38m in 2012 to $57m in 2014. Extrapolating 2015's YTD growth rate of 15.9% suggests the business could do $66m in 2015. However, it can be more challenging to discover the underlying health of the business as AUM grows in-line with equity and debt market performance.Retirement Solutions AUM grew 17.1% in 2014 and 39% in 2013, whereas revenue grew 25.7% and 19.6%, respectively. Given a hybrid fee structure with some of the business based on AUM and some a flat fee, I think it's safe to say that 2014 was a better year for the business based on revenue growth outpacing AUM growth. The trend remains intact thus far in 2015, with revenue up 15.9% YTD and AUM up 11.7%.Overall, I imagine this is a fairly sticky business that will see its performance fluctuate fairly dramatically based on the performance of capital markets. I am interested to see what happens in the next market downturn.Morningstar.com and Other Businesses: Less Important, but ValuableMorningstar.com is a well-known finance hub. I personally use it as my first line data provider. The company has experienced a steady decline in premium users who are granted access to analyst reports, fair value estimates, stewardship grades, and fund ratings.YTD, subscriber growth is only negative 0.4%. I believe the core user base of do-it-yourself investors (similar to Seeking Alpha readership) is fairly sticky. However, the analyst reports are lacking, especially relative to premium Morningstar analyst reports as well as the free information now available on Seeking Alpha and other websites.Nevertheless, I think the website will remain a hub for some research as well as those looking for reliable data. Additionally, I think the site remains very attractive for advertisers as its users have a clear interest in investing and likely higher income levels.Overall, I suspect subscriber growth to be relatively flat over the next few years as Morningstar's reliance on the advisor market and other premium products will prevent it from improving its retail subscription product offering. However, if Morningstar.com can keep its traffic steady, if not growing, I think it can generate a ton of cash from advertising. Morningstar.com is probably a $60m business in 2015 with 2-3% annual growth.Management & Capital Allocation Drive Future PerformanceI love owner-operators, particularly those who are obsessed with Warren Buffett. Shareholders get exactly that with Joe Mansueto. Mansueto owns close to 25M shares, and his stake increases every quarter as the firm buys back more shares. The only reason I don't think Mansueto will take the company private is that he has pledged a great deal of his fortune to charity. Thus, I think Mansueto would prefer for shares to remain liquid and prevent his heirs from being forced sellers.Although I think investors are likely disappointed by Morningstar's moderate organic growth, Mansueto has never taken on a substantial debt load and has created a true free cash flow machine.Even after paying out a $61m litigation charge in 2014, Morningstar generated $74m in free cash flow. Excluding this charge, Morningstar would have generated $135m in free cash flow. YTD, Morningstar has generated $147m in free cash flow, allowing the firm to repurchase $30m worth of shares and payout $25m in dividends. Morningstar recently increased its quarterly dividend by 16% to $0.22/share. At $0.88 annually, shares now yield about 1.1% after returning about 25% YTD in 2015. Because I do not believe Mansueto will be taking the company private, I expect this figure to grow at a solid pace annually. The annual dividend should eclipse $1/share within the next 18 months.At this point in time, I think shares are only slightly undervalued. Based on my forecast, I think shares are worth $88. However, given the substantial buybacks and the likelihood that the company's intrinsic value grows at roughly 10% next year, it seems like a reasonable bet that shares will be worth $97 heading into 2017.Morningstar meets many of my criteria for a strong investment-sticky products with high barriers to entry, a strong brand name in its core consumer base, and solid returns on invested capital (15-20%). However, I would wait until a broader market swoon before establishing a position. Revenue declined just 5% y/y during the market crash of 2008, but shares fell 50% due to the perception of Morningstar's reliance on financial markets.Bottom line: Morningstar is a strong company with a value maximizing CEO who thinks about business in the right way. Shares aren't cheap, but I think investors could earn a fair return (8-10%/yr) even if a position is established at current levels."
4067370,96466,2017-05-01T09:06:08-04:00,The Q1 2017 results were quite promising.We expect net revenue to be around $840M in FY2017.Margins are still ones of the best in the industry but deteriorating recently.Our DCF model shows that company’s shares are overvalued.We set a target price range between $64 and $71 per share in the base scenario.,"The analysis provided in this article has not found any upside potential in Morningstar's (NASDAQ:MORN) shares in the foreseeable future. Although the company has demonstrated promising financial results in the last quarter, there is a declining trend in the growth rate of a few P&L lines. Morningstar remains one of the industry leaders in terms of operating efficiency but there is evidence of declining margins over the recent years. We consider this as a headwind for revenue growth. Our discounted cash flow model suggests a target price range between $64 and $71 per share.The company has finished off Q1 2017. The top line has increased by 9% year-over-year. The main growth driver in sales was the acquisition of PitchBook Data. This purchase contributed $13.1 million of revenue in the first quarter (See Diagram 1).We incorporated the negative trend in the top line's growth in the DCF model presented below. As you can see in Diagram 2, the sales growth rate has been declining since FY2010. The last twelve-month revenue growth rate is 2.1%. We consider this downtrend as a factor in the revenue decline. Taking into account these data points, we expect the sales growth rate to be around 2.2% in FY2017 given the upside provided by the acquisition and then to decrease to a level of 2%.Diagram 1(Source: Morningstar.com)Diagram 2(Source: Morningstar.com)We think that shrinking margins will be an additional pressure factor on growth in the future. While margins are still much higher than the benchmark, the declining trend in the margins is obvious (see Diagram 3). Our fundamental model includes the tendency of deteriorating profitability ratios. We suppose that operating profit and net income margins will be of 20% and 18%, respectively, in 2017.Diagram 3(Source: 10-Q report, author's calculations)DCF AnalysisWe built a financial model to conclude the fundamental valuation of company's shares. The DCF model is presented in Diagram 7.The DCF model incorporates historical data and certain assumptions about the future:- Revenue CAGR is set at 2% (2017-2021);- Net revenue is forecasted to be around $840M in FY2017 and then to grow at rate of 2%;- EBIT margin is set at 20% for 2017 and 19% for the period of 2017-2021, due to the declining tendency in profitability margin;- The effective tax rate is expected to be at 25% for the period of five years;- The growth rate for CAPEX in 2017 is 7.5% and is then tied to a historical value of 7% of revenue;- Net working capital is estimated to be negative and equal to around $80M for the forecast period (2017-2021);- Unlevered free cash flow CAGR is set at 9.6% rate throughout.The model shows that, after adjusting for balance sheet items, the fair value of equity is around $2.9B. Consequently, the stock's fair value is around $68 per share, which is 14% lower than the current share price.Diagram 4(Source: Author's DCF Model)SensitivityOur analysis is based on certain assumptions. The sensitivity analysis covers a range of possibilities resulting from deviations from the base scenario. Assumptions related to WACC and the Terminal EV/EBITDA multiple show that the base scenario implies a downside risk ranging from -9% to -18.This means that the target price range is below the current market price of the stock.​(Source: Author's DCF Model)Even if investors estimate the value of company by using a multiple of 15.7x, they will also face that the stock is overvalued. This aggressive scenario shows the fair value corridor ranging from -9% to +1% relative to the current market price of the stock depending the WACC chosen. Our WACC of 6.3% is calculated according to assumptions of zero cost of debt and a beta of 0.8, meaning that stock has a high sensitivity to the broad-market's fluctuations.We should notice that use of the 15.7x EBITDA multiple in the calculations is quite feasible. As you can see in the diagram above, the implied perpetuity growth rate of free cash flow at the 15.7x multiple is realistic, especially at the current WACC figure of around 6%.RecommendationWe see the factors than put Morningstar's shares under pressure and we do not see significant positive catalysts that may cause the stock to move higher significantly in the nearest future. Our DCF model shows that the current price of the stock is higher than its fundamental value. We estimate the target price of Morningstar's shares to be around $68, and the fair price range to be between $64 and $71 per share in the base scenario. As a result, we recommend selling this stock.

Further, the business is subscription driven and the demand for financial information is essentially perpetual -- although driven more or less by the bull and bear cycles of the market. The corporate stewards, too, use Buffett's language (10-K, p. 6): ""Our strategy is to widen our economic moat."" While not accepting the statement uncritically, the word choice is a sweet song to our ears. Warming our Buffett-loving hearts further, management writes: ""our goal is to increase the intrinsic value of our business over time."" Later, they also make a point to reference free cash flow. Swoon.Morningstar, however, is pretty much fairly valued at a $3.28 billion market cap. In theory, considering its past growth rates and the quality of its business, the corporation could be undervalued today. For instance, in 2013 it grew revenues by 6.1% -- if that rate applied perpetually to its free-cash-flow the stock would be likely be undervalued because the quality of the business model suggests that a proper discount rate will be low compared with many companies.We believe Morningstar will continue to grow, although the current price doesn't offer a margin of safety for the patient growth-value investor. If the growth only partially materialized, one may be better off buying other firms like FactSet (NYSE:FDS).If we are interested in where the valuation is compared to the corporations history, we can look at the free-cash-flow yield -- it is, again, neither high nor low:Hence, we don't believe there is a current opportunity in the shares. However, we believe Morningstar's business model is attractive enough to be worthy of discussion.OperationsMorningstar is multifaceted in terms of revenue generation points. Here are its big revenue product categories (10-K, page 45):Notice that all product categories, besides investment advisory, have improved year over year. The majority of the above businesses are subscription based (or license based) with recurring payment cycles as short as one month for retail facing services -- like Morningstar.com with its 9.3 million registered users and 124,000 paying users -- and between one year and three years for more institutional products. The company has sold 8,500 licenses for institutional products like Morningstar Direct and 170,000 U.S. licenses for Morningstar Advisor Workstation. Both counts increased year over year in 2013.Then, of course, they have an asset management business which is typically a fee based on assets. This segment of the business has been facing a somewhat difficult environment due to previous clients who are now:The business also breaks down revenues this way (10-K, p. 46):The investment information business is exceptionally attractive. Despite intense competition, many of the businesses in the segment produce very strong returns on capital and have achieved long-term growth with some consistency. That said, theories abound that the new technological architecture of the cloud-client variety will dramatically increase future competition. Considering that I myself want to enter this field, I suppose this is true. But the sheer quantity of data that Morningstar has gained over the years is an enormous barrier to entry -- that is, it would be incredibly difficult to compete along the specific lines of Morningstar. Further, all the advisors whom use Morningstar currently are faced with barriers to exit -- they are habituated to the design of Morningstar software.The information business is very attractive -- especially when we look at the corporation's return on assets. Take a look:Counting the 23,680 companies with market caps over $500 million, only 1,235 -- or about 5.2% -- have ROAs above 10%. It is a rare trait.Check out the company's revenue and net income:Historically speaking, the trend has been upward. The question is whether it will remain so. A recent SA article on Morningstar suggests that it cannot, due to secular headwinds in terms of passive fund management over active management and the proliferation of new technology (among other things). The author advocates for a share price around $52. I don't disagree entirely with the author's assessment of the negative secular trends, but some data out of Morningstar should temper our desire to short the stock.Product QualityFor starters, take a look at the company's operating metrics (10-K, p. 45):In almost every category, operating metrics have been favorable. (Note that the Principia subscription business is being purposefully cannibalized by the U.S. Advisor Workstation and Office business.) Now, these favorable trends are due in some measure to the recent bull market, but it nevertheless indicates that customers still believe in the Morningstar brand. In the case of retail customers, the loss of business for Morningstar.com has halted (it was in decline for a number of years). In the case of professional advisors -- making up the Advisor Workstation and Morningstar Office crowd -- the numbers keep increasing.The latter products have increased licenses outstanding from 148,392 in 2009 to 169,592 in 2013. The number of reviews of this product are minimal, although at least one is favorable. (Note, I didn't find any explicitly negative reviews, although some reviews -- too old to be counted unfortunately -- certainly brought up specific criticisms.)Controlled CorporationThere are a few views to this, but the question of whether it is good or bad that corporation is controlled is a case by case problem. With Morningstar, the controlling shareholder is also the founder, one Joe Mansueto. Presumably, it is the founder who has inserted Buffettisms into the 10-K and Buffettisms into Morningstar products --in both cases an intelligent move. Even his Wikipedia page notes that he likes ""reading the occasional annual report."" This guy launched Morningstar out of his home in 1984 with $80,000. This is my type of guy, so long as he continues to holds his 24,469,241 shares (out of 44,700,741 shares outstanding at Feb 21, 2014 for an ownership stake of 54.7%).Corporate ReorganizationLately I have been studying Alfred Chandler. His work, in which I am still a novice, discusses the role of management and management structure to the effectiveness of corporate growth strategies. Strategy defines structure, he argues. Anyways, Morningstar has undergone an internal reorganization. Previously, the corporation operated with many profit and loss centers. Now, they are organized under 5 ""groups"" which are not specifically run on a profit and loss basis but, instead, in terms of their contribution to revenues and expenses.Anyways, this is not the first company with a digital presence which is ""centralizing"" operations. This trend (if you can call it a trend -- I may be experiencing the cluster illusion) seems to stem from the need to better integrate web apps and databases with sales and management. In my opinion, this trend is derived from the new abilities of cloud based technologies. We are barely scratching the surface with regards to the operating efficiencies the new centralized cloud-client architecture creates. Anyways, management wrote in a question/answer correspondence:If the strategy is to better coordinate the building products on top of their databases and proprietary data, then this seems a wise structure. Coordination between activities very well may improve. Specifically, the use of the corporation's data assets (intangibles on the balance sheet) may improve. Of course, this is highly speculative so we will just have to watch and see. The reorganization was effective as of July, 1st, 2013.ConclusionWe do not believe Morningstar is an attractive short. We, also, don't think it is an attractive long at these prices. However, the business model is attractive -- despite some secular trends -- and the return on capital is excellent. At lower prices, Morningstar would be an excellent investment. Needless to say, the company has a great brand despite all the noise of competition in the sector.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are those of the author as of the date the article was published.

1835862,54942,2013-11-14T09:45:00-05:00,,"Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN) has realized tremendous appreciation in its shares over the last two years hitting a 52-week high last week. At $81 per share investors aren't pricing in the significant long-term headwinds and secular trend within the industry. There is a dearth of information on Morningstar with just one analyst covering it and little research on the company despite it being public since January 2005.Competition, individual investor trends towards passive investments and ETFs, liability for the information they publish, a decline in the relevancy of their ratings, and a valuation that's in the clouds all create a near perfect storm for investors long the stock.Business OverviewMorningstar was started in Chicago in 1984 by Joe Mansueto in an effort to provide individual investors with mutual fund analysis and commentary. At the time, there was a dearth of information on mutual funds and the growth within the industry was profound. Since then, the company has grown from a monthly print publication to a wide range of online, print, and advisor-focused products.The company operates within two segments: Investment Information which accounts for 80.5% of all revenue, and Investment management, 19.5%. Investment Information includes all their data, software, and research products and services which are primarily sold on a subscription basis. The Investment Management business includes all their asset management operations, which operate as registered investment advisors (RIAs) and earn more than half of their revenue from asset-based fees. At the end of 2012, the company had approximately 8.9 million individual investor subscriptions, 260,000 financial advisors, and 5,100 institutional clients.In recent years, they've greatly expanded their data coverage to include not just the 23,500 mutual funds but also most ETFs and closed-end funds, equities, hedge funds, separate accounts, variable annuities and insurance products as well as 529 plans.Business Strategy and ProductsThe largest revenue generator in investment information is Morningstar Data (22.8% of revenue at the end of 2012) which they primarily license out to other customers. This is followed by Morningstar Advisor Workstation (12.8% of revenue), a web-based investment planning system for independent financial advisors, Morningstar Direct (10.1% of revenue) for institutional clients, and finally Morningstar.com (8.2% of revenue) which includes both premium memberships and internet advertising sales.The investment management segment comprises investment advisory at 10.0% of revenue, retirement solutions and managed portfolios.The strategy of the investment information segment has been to focus their product offerings on three major platforms:Industry Demand and CompetitionCompetition in the space for investment data has been heating up as costs decline and technologies improve dramatically. The need for swift and accurate information, a critical competitive advantage for all investment professionals is a primary reason why the number of companies attempting to provide that information has proliferated in recent years.There are hundreds if not thousands of specialized information service providers supplying data on every esoteric data point imaginable. The trend within the industry recently has been towards a one-stop, all-inclusive web-based provider instead of piecemeal solutions.Morningstar had first mover advantage, a key aspect of success in any industry. They have also built a large framework for future growth moving from a focus on the individual investor towards the advisory and institutional businesses.Since the financial crisis, investment firms have cut back extensively their use of third-party information providers in order to cut back costs. Buy-side firms have reduced the number of equity analysts, market strategists, and other investment professionals curtailing the amount of data they need. Additionally, the regulatory burdens have reduced the need for a lot of this technology as many firms either exit the investment management business or cannot use soft dollars to purchase the data any longer.The primary competition to Morningstar are well-established distributors such as Bloomberg, Standard and Poor's and Thomson Reuters. Other actors are getting into the game including the Wall Street Journal, CNBC, and web-based businesses like TheStreet.com and TheFool.com.Overall, I think the industry is currently in a state of secular flux whereby the technology will continue to improve rapidly thereby increasing the availability of free or low-cost investment information greatly curtailing the largest piece of Morningstar's operations.Revenue SlowdownThe financials look strong but the question is do they warrant the excessive valuation that the stock currently trades? Looking at the most recent quarterly results, consolidated revenue increased 7.8% to $173.5 million. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency effects, revenue rose 8.8%. Organic revenue has been range bound between 5% and 10% for two years now. Prior to the financial crisis, organic revenue was typically above 15% and in most quarters above 20%. Clearly we have shifted down to a new paradigm for growth for the company.The company talks about its slower revenue growth during an investor day back in August. They stated:When the industry and customer feedback has improved while your sales haven't, it typically is due to a company-specific issue rather than more secular trends. I compared their results to Thomson Reuters who realized faster EIKON growth, triple the data growth, and stronger Financial and Risk (equivalent of Morningstar's data segment) growth.Morningstar DataThe main problem with Morningstar is that they typically overcommit and underdeliver. That has been their problem for a decade now releasing new software before it has been adequately tested and then failing to support it effectively.Their bread and butter is Morningstar Data, the licensing of hundreds of thousands of investment data points to other vendors like Microsoft's Bing Finance App. They also offer packages that include access to their proprietary statistics such as the Morningstar Style Box and Morningstar Star Rating. These two data points were the draw of customers to Morningstar over the last decade as the former were used widely by financial advisors when setting clients' asset allocation while the latter is heavily used by fund managers to market their funds' strong performance and individual investors to assess retail mutual funds.While I applaud the company's innovation in the area, adding hundreds of new data points every quarter and other real-time enhancements, competition has heated up in addition to the firm coming under heavy scrutiny for incorrect data - facing several SEC audits over the last decade, lawsuits, in addition to registered subscribers finding a large amount of errors which get listed on their discussion forum.Pricing for Morningstar Data is highly customized based on the number of funds, indexes, stocks, commodities and other securities to which the client wants access. Overall, the trend in the industry has been a decline in pricing power as competition lowers margins and pricing. Primary competition has been increasing with new players getting into the game every year.The Burton-Taylor 2012 report on information industry market research showed the slowest increase in spending since 2009 growing just 2.34% with the growth due to vendor price increases. Of the total, Morningstar held just 8.18% of market share with Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters holding shares of 30.82% and 29.48%, respectively. Bloomberg and Interactive Data Corporation are the two fastest growing according to the report.The report highlighted how the industry is becoming more fragmented with a few larger players like Bloomberg, Thomson and IDC, while more players vie for the scraps. Additionally, industry surveys suggest that new data providers are coming into the field taking on highly specialized niches catering to clients who do not want the full suite of data points offered by the larger players.Overall, I see this segment of Morningstar's business (overall 22.8% of total revenue), the company's core, as becoming highly fragmented and more price competitive over time. One of the main reasons is that firm still does not include fixed income data and uses third-party content from Interactive Data Corporation as well as hedge fund data from Hedge Fund Research. Demand for this information continues to increase and Morningstar not having their own data sources will hurt their growth going forward. This is also likely going to affect operating margins of the firm over the next several years.Other ProductsMorningstar Advisor Workstation is a web-based platform serving financial advisors with tools for conducting their core business, including investment research, planning and report generation. At the end of last year, the company had 162,904 advisors in the US licensed to use the Advisor Workstation. The product is available in two versions: Morningstar Office for independent financial advisors and an enterprise version for advisors affiliated with larger firms.The company charges approximately $3,300 per licensed user for a base configuration but pricing can vary significantly as you add features and modules. For Morningstar Office, an annual license runs roughly $5,700. This is actually a fairly modest sum within the industry. Having tested several of the competitions' offerings, this is one of the few areas Morningstar has done right. However, there are still several issues with the software and the business strategy.Previously, the company sold products separately. For instance, you could simply subscribe to Morningstar Principia for $1,100 per year and get information on all open-end mutual funds. If you wanted to add closed-end fund data or ETFs, you could add those modules for a couple of hundred dollars extra per year. The company recently decided to sunset the software and roll it up into the Advisor Workstation.Below you can see data from the end of the most recent quarter. The goal of Morningstar is to convert Principia users to Advisor Workstation using their sales force to convince advisors of the 'need' to upgrade.The Advisor Workstation growth though has been anemic. From 2008 through 2012, the growth in the number of licenses of both Workstations and Office has been just 7.2% cumulatively and just 2.4% over last year. Meanwhile, competition from Advent, Tamarac, and Thomson Reuters are taking share from the company. The largest risk though is the preponderance of new technology coming into the market. I was at an advisor conference not long ago and there was approximately 100-200 small vendors all looking to break into the market. It is only a matter of time before a few of these take off and steal share based on price and performance.Morningstar Direct is the relatively new, institutional, web-based platform that attempts to compete with Bloomberg's Terminal, Factsets Research System and Thomson Reuters EIKON, all of which are far-superior products. They charge $17,000 per year for the first user, $10,500 for the second user, and $9,000 for each additional user. At the end of third quarter, they had 8,367 licensed users worldwide.They have certainly seen significant growth in users and the product line has become a significant driver now accounting for 10.1% of total revenue as of 2012, up from 8.3% in 2011 and 6.9% in 2010. I do not understand why they have realized such growth. The platform, while nice, pales in comparison to Bloomberg's Terminal, FactSets Research System, and Thomson Reuters EIKON. Price differentials are minimal with Bloomberg now offering a small manager package for $2,000 per month. Bloomberg also offers to buy out the remainder of any existing contract with a competitor that the institutional client may have.Lastly, Morningstar Premium memberships for individual investors is the third largest product line with 123,899 members paying $22.95 for a monthly subscription, $195 for an annual, $329 for a two-year and $429 for a three-year subscription. These prices are up from $12.95 per month five years ago.The company has been shedding subscribers as regular members have become disenchanted from the higher pricing, poor technology, and inaccurate data points. There are also exogenous factors such as the growth of free websites offering similar data such as The Motley Fool, TheStreet, Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, Marketwatch, MSN Money and of course, Seeking Alpha.Investment Management SegmentInvestment advisory is the fourth largest product based on revenue in 2012 at 10.0%. The business draws on their proprietary research methodologies to deliver service offerings covering asset allocation, manager evaluation, portfolio management and 15(c) board consulting services. Most of their business focuses on investment monitoring and asset allocation for multi-manager portfolios made up of managed investment products, such as mutual funds and variable annuities.Within the Retirement Solution business, the company offers help for retirement plan participants. At the end of last year, participants had access to Retirement Solutions through approximately 202,000 plan sponsors and 25 plan providers.Lastly, the Managed Portfolios program is a fee-based discretionary asset management service that creates specific portfolios to meet investment objectives given certain risk levels. In 2012, total AUM reached $4.7 billion with about 3,200 financial advisors using the service. The business model is such that Morningstar charges a 30 to 40 bps fee for mutual fund and ETFs while charging 55 bps for the Select Stock Baskets, which are a managed service consisting of individually customized stock portfolios.Overall, revenue was down 2% in the segment to $128.3 million and operating income fell 12% to $61.1 million. The segment is driven by the variable annuity business and makes up 3% of consolidated firm revenue and 15.3% of the segments revenue. Given the low current interest rates and the likelihood that they continue going forward, the variable annuity business is likely to be hampered for some time.The investment management segment has more potential than the information business given the growth in the retirement market and the need for cheap, managed portfolios to advisors focused on sales production. However, the segment is very small compared to the overall firm and with the variable annuity business likely dormant for many years to come, it will have a built-in headwind for the time being.Controlled CompanyThe company is effectively a controlled company given that Mr. Mansueto owns 53% of all outstanding shares. Whenever I invest in a company I am always hesitant to invest when there are majority shareholders or owners of the organization holding all the cards. You are effectively handcuffed into what can be accomplished and are relying on their skills and their skills only.LawsuitsThe company has been the party to several significant lawsuits which could open the floodgates to many others. The largest open lawsuit is from three individual investors in Life's Good STABL Mortgage hedge fund (LG). The three individuals filed a complaint in the US district court in PA alleging that Morningstar committed fraud and aided and abetted the hedge fund manager through the 5-star rating the hedge fund received from Morningstar.The fund was run by Robert Stinson who told investors he would generate double-digit returns - as much as 16% annually - but who instead was committing fraud and stealing the money. The fraud was minor in comparison to Madoff but material at $17 million.Overall, the lawsuit appears to be frivolous as hedge fund reporting to Morningstar's database is voluntary. Hedge fund managers can simply submit their own returns to the Morningstar database. While that's not nearly the same as someone suing based on their traditional and proprietary open-end mutual fund rating system, it could portend future liabilities.A Changing LandscapeThe mutual fund landscape is changing rapidly and the traditional asset allocation model used by many advisors has also been slowly eroding away. The use of Morningstar ratings and style boxes by advisors and individual investors alike have been declining slowly over time. This is a large part of Morningstar's current competitive advantage.Morningstar's ratings, the company readily admits, are a starting point for further due diligence as well as indicators of past performance and should not be used to predict future performance. In fact, expense ratio is a much better predictor of future performance than Morningstar ratings according to Morningstar!The above is Morningstar's own data. They conclude that ratings and expense ratios are both predictive of future success. However, that is not the whole story. For one, the expense ratios were a bit more predictive and two, the data were not apples-to-apples. The company reserves its 1- and 5-star ratings for the top and bottom 10% of funds. However, expense ratios were split into quintiles or 20% buckets. Thus, expense ratios includes the top 20% while the star ratings just the top 10%. A sneaky maneuver by the firm. Secondly, 5-star funds beat 1-star funds just 65% of the time. And it beat 3-star funds less than half the time. Hardly a confirmation on the quality of their ratings system.ValuationIf none of the other issues surrounding the company and industry weren't true, it would still make a horrible investment simply based on the valuation. Couple it with the issues mentioned above and you get a short candidate with a long-term catalyst.A good check for valuation that I like to use is the dividend discount model and the growth rates necessary in order to justify the current share price. Below you can see the assumptions. The Street currently estimates the long-term growth rate at 15% per year (we'll ignore the fact that these figures are typically overstated). In order to justify the current price the company would have to grow at that rate for 15 years before beginning a 7-year transition to its mature growth rate. Thus, the company would need to be stealing share from competition and realizing growth rates far exceeding the industry's for 17 years!Below is what I feel is a more reasonable scenario for future growth and even here I am being generous.DCF valuation also shows very high embedded growth rates and margins baked into the stock. Below I am using what are the current expectations from the sell side for sales growth and operating margin and would constitute a base case scenario.Here is a much more optimistic scenario and one that I would apply a very low probability to happening. You can see the top line growth accelerate from the current mid-to-high single digits to mid-double digits over the next few years and then staying at that higher rate. I also have margins expanding by 100 bps per year from the already high operating margins being realized. Even with these nearly overly optimistic expectations, I could not get intrinsic value up to the current trading price of the shares.At a 30x forward multiple and a PEG of nearly 2.0x the stock is pricing in a growth rate that is clearly not going to materialize. But what will reconnect underlying fundamentals to the share price? In the end, I like to value several different valuation tools to return a tighter intrinsic value. Averaging the DDM and the DCF models gets us a rough value of approximately $51 per share or 36% below the current trading price.Catalysts LowerConclusionMorningstar is suffering a slow decline in its necessity coupled with several strategic blunders that are likely to leave it out in the cold with most advisors. The growth of the industry has been well known but I do not think investors are appreciating the growth of new entrants and Morningstar's fading relevance with individual investors. Often times, companies not followed by Wall Street can become mispriced to fundamentals. Typically I'm looking for candidates like these to go long as there is significant empirical evidence that names ignored by the street can deviate from intrinsic value much more so than a name like IBM or AAPL. Morningstar has done so with its recent surge in share price from $60 at the start of the year to the $81 current price.For people looking for short candidates to add to their portfolio, Morningstar is a great name to look at given it is being priced as a momentum stock similar to Tesla, LinkedIn, and Zillow but without the underlying growth profile.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

818801,24491,2012-08-21T02:26:53-04:00,,"As part of our process, we perform a rigorous discounted cash-flow methodology that dives into the true intrinsic worth of companies. In Morningstar's (NASDAQ:MORN) case, we think the firm is overvalued. We think it is fairly valued at $46 per share. We had previously valued the firm in the mid-to-high $50s, but slower expected revenue growth in coming years has prompted us to make this downward revision.For some background, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index, which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best.In the spirit of transparency, we show how the performance of our VBI has stacked up per underlying score:If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Morningstar posts a VBI score of 4 on our scale, reflecting our 'overvalued' DCF assessment, unattractive relative valuation versus peers, and bullish technicals. We use Moody's (NYSE:MCO), Factset Research (NYSE:FDS), Thomson Reuters Corp (NYSE:TRI), and McGraw-Hill (MHP) for our peer group analysis.Our Report on Morningstar imagesInvestment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsMorningstar's business quality (an evaluation of our ValueCreation™ and ValueRisk™ ratings) ranks among the best of the firms in our coverage universe. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders with relatively stable operating results for the past few years, a combination we view very positively.Although we don't think the firm's valuation indicates an attractive investment opportunity at this time, we'd take a closer look if the firm's share price fell below $37. The market seems to be pricing greater long-term revenue growth and profit expansion than we think is achievable.Morningstar has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 19.4% in coming years, and the firm had no debt as of last quarter.Although we think there may be a better time to dabble in the firm's shares based on our DCF process, the firm's stock has outperformed the market benchmark during the past quarter, indicating increased investor interest in the company.We don't think the firm's valuation indicates an attractive investment opportunity at this time, and we are strongly considering opening up a put position in the portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter.Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Morningstar's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 94.5%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.8%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair valueestimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Morningstar's free cash flow margin has averaged about 19.8% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Morningstar, cash flow from operations increased about 72% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 89% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Morningstar's shares are worth between $37.00 - $55.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's LOW ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $46 per share represents a price-to-earnings(P/E) ratio of about 23.8 times last year's earnings and an impliedEV/EBITDA multiple of about 10.3 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 6.2% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 7.9%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 25.6%, which is above Morningstar's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 3.4% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Morningstar, we use a 10.8% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $46 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in themarkets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Morningstar. We think the firm is attractive below $37 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $55 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Morningstar's fair value at this point in time to be about $46 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Morningstar's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $61 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $46 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
275554,24491,2011-06-19T02:48:47-04:00,,"Often overlooked by investors, Morningstar's (NASDAQ:MORN) credit business represents a unique opportunity within the firm's portfolio of business lines. The firm's credit rating methodology is fresh, unique, and forward-looking, with such interesting features as the Cash Flow Cushion and Economic Moat ratings, both of which Morningstar has trademarked. Though the independent research provider has earned the NRSRO designation (an acronym standing for Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations) via its acquisition of Realpoint in 2010, it has yet to expand to an issuer-pays model on the corporate side, due mostly to regulatory requirements and in part because the firm is brand new to rating corporate credits (it launched corporate ratings in December 2009). Morningstar, on the other hand, is not new to the issuer-pays model [the revenue model used by Moody's (NYSE:MCO), S&P (MHP), and Fitch, and seven of the 10 NRSROs], as recent deals in its equity division ultimately speak to companies in its stock universe paying for analyst research [albeit via a middle-man, the Nasdaq OMX (NASDAQ:NDAQ)]. This suggests the possibility of Morningstar stretching its independence just a bit (immaterially and of no consequence to its excellent repution) to attain new business, opening the door for yet another potential NRSRO to rate corporates in the years ahead. The corporate space is not small potatoes, with Moody's alone generating over $560 million in revenue from its Corporate Finance group last year (that's over a quarter of Moody's total annual revenue and more than all of Morningstar's last year). And according to this article, investment-grade issuance is on a tear (Morningstar's sweet spot of coverage), which albeit cyclical, indicates a very healthy market to dive into. Plus, Morningstar has relationships with almost every company in its 1,500-plus equity coverage universe (it has launched coverage on about 700 credits thus far), laying the groundwork for a transition to an issuer-pays model on the credit side in the years ahead. Morningstar's current position in the corporate arena is shown below:Barriers to success in pursuing an issuer-pays model in the corporate credit rating business are not easy to climb, but the reward may be worth the investment for Morningstar, especially as competitors like Seeking Alpha, the Motley Fool, theStreet.com (NASDAQ:TST) and new entrants like Valuentum apply pressure to retail subscriptions on its website. Seeking Alpha's viewership continues to expand, and Valuentum's expertise in discounted cash-flow valuation--Morningstar's core approach for equity valuation--could represent legitimate threats to an already-declining subscriber base. In all, if Morningstar does expand its fixed-income research to pursue an issuer-pays model for corporate credit ratings, look for the market to reset its equity valuation to a higher level. We'll take a look at how much higher in the next article of this series. As of right now, however, Morningstar investors should expect just a market return from these levels.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
475101,25113,2012-04-03T08:25:57-04:00,,"Morningstar Inc (MORN) is trading at price multiple of a company that is experiencing rapid growth in earnings, but unfortunately Morningstar growth has not been rapid and the current price it is trading for is not justified.Using the FY2011 earnings per share results of $1.97 the trailing price earnings multiply of Moningstar is equaled to roughly 32 at the moment. For a company to be justified to be trading on a price earning multiple above 30 the company must be experiencing rapid growth in earnings, such as Starbucks Corp (SBUX). Starbucks trades at the moment on a trailing price earnings multiple of roughly 34.As can be seen in the table, the earnings per share growth difference between the two companies are two very different stories. Starbucks has grown earnings from $0.43 per share in FY2008 to $1.67 per share by FY2011, this compares to Morningstar earnings per share over the same period resulting in no growth of $1.98 to $1.97. It must be considered that the future growth in earnings per share is what is most important in driving the future share price, though in my opinion its the last few years of a companies financial performance that an investor uses to best gauge the likely performance in the future. Please note I am not recommending to buy Starbucks just using their growth as a comparison.Total asset turnover ratio is calculated by dividing revenue by total assets. As total assets for Morningstar has been increasing the total asset turnover ratio has been decreasing, meaning that as Morningstar adds more assets to their balance sheet they are unable to extract the same percentage of revenue from the larger asset base. Though there was a positive sign in FY2011 that saw a small increase in the total asset turnover ratio.There is only one analyst following Morningstar on Yahoo Finance and that analyst has estimated earnings per share of $2.24 for FY2012 and $2.56 for FY2013. At the current price and according to this analyst estimate Morningstar has a forward price earnings multiple of roughly 28 and a two year forward of roughly 24. These multiples are too high and do not justify the risk involved in owning the stock.In summary, Morningstar has a good business and produces a steady earnings stream, but at the current price it is trading for it is overvalued. As a company that trades on the price multiples that Morningstar currently does would have to have larger expected future earnings to be justified.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in MORN over the next 72 hours."
1769542,24491,2013-10-24T13:57:09-04:00,,"By Brian Nelson, CFAPart of the reason why I have picked Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN) to use in this example is that the firm is trading at nosebleed multiples and has just started to ""manage"" its earnings expansion. Such activity is typically not a good sign for shareholders - mostly CEO Joe Mansueto.<< What is earnings management?Before we get started, however, it's important to note that Morningstar is trading at roughly 23 times expected 2013 free cash flow ($3.5 billion market capitalization divided by $150 million in expected free cash flow) and 25 times expected 2014 earnings estimates.I will show you in this article how Morningstar essentially generated less than 1% core diluted earnings per share growth in its third quarter, despite headline results suggesting a 21.4% gain ($0.68 versus $0.56).The Income Statement<< What is the income statement?Image Source: Morningstar1.1 RevenueTypically, the first line item on a firm's income statement is 'Revenue'. At Morningstar, revenue advanced 7.8% in the third quarter (you can see the growth rate in the far right column). There's not much that we can glean from the purity of the top line other than to take management's word that mostly all of it was organic expansion. Based on disclosures in the third-quarter press release, this appears to be the case.1.2 Cost of RevenueThe second line item is 'cost of revenue,' which is just under the category of 'Operating Expense.' According to the income statement (shown above), the firm's 'cost of revenue' advanced 19.6% on a year-over-year basis. We're assuming this growth includes salaries and other items that are indispensable to drive the firm's revenue expansion. A comparison of the revenue growth rate (7.8%) and the growth rate in 'cost of revenue' (19.6%) is quite startling. For every 1 percentage point of top-line growth, the firm has to pay more than 2 percentage points more in relevant costs. What once was a business model with nice operating leverage has now become one that is deleveraging.1.3 Overhead: Sales and marketing; General and administrativeThese are the line items where management usually starts playing tricks to manage earnings. Management has a difficult time cutting expenses in 'cost of revenue' as it doesn't want to eliminate its money-making individuals or cause any discontent for them to leave for competitors. So, what management has done in this quarter is chosen to slash 'Sales and marketing' and 'General and administrative' expenses by 11.5% and 6.5%, respectively.The total discretionary expenses that management cut in the third quarter are: (25.7 million less $22.8 million; $24 million less $22.4 million) = $4.5 million.Image Source: Morningstar1.4 Depreciation and amortizationDepreciation and amortization expenses are typically tied to fixed schedules, so management doesn't have any leeway in influencing these measures on a quarter-to-quarter basis. It can manage capital spending to a degree, but for the most part, evidence of earnings management is not found on the 'Depreciation and amortization' line. Said differently, management can cut sales and marketing mid-quarter to hit an earnings target, but there's not much the team can do on this line to influence near-term performance.<< What is Depreciation?<< What is Amortization?1.5 Operating IncomeIf we move to the operating line (it's called 'Operating income' in the image above), you'll see that operating income advanced to $44.61 million in the third quarter of 2013 from $39.86 million in the third quarter of 2012, or an increase of about $4.7 million. After adjusting for significant cuts in discretionary expenditures (""Sales and marketing; General and administrative""), operating income is roughly flat on a year-over-year basis: the $4.5 million it saved by cutting discretionary items was its ENTIRE operating income growth this period.Most analysts would stop at this point and call this quarter 'very poor,' especially for a firm that is trading at 25 times 2014 earnings.1.6 Non-operating incomeNon-operating income actually fell on a year-over-year basis. However, let's be generous and give Morningstar the same operating income it earned in last year's quarter to this year's quarter. So, let's add $1.1 million back to this year's quarter. It may not be fair to ding the firm, as non-operating income is just that: non-operating.1.7 Income before income taxesAfter adding the $1.1 million (see 1.6) back into 'income before income taxes and equity in net income of unconsolidated entities' and adjusting downward for the $4.5 million in 'managed earnings' (see 1.3), adjusted income before income taxes is $41.98 million, which compares to $41.74 million in the year-ago period. We'd argue this is still flat year-over-year performance.1.8 Income tax expenseWe don't think management has a lot of wiggle room with the IRS, but in order to provide an apples-to-apples comparison between year-over-year numbers, let's use the effective tax rate in the year-ago period for this year's adjusted 'income before income taxes' number. Last year's effective income tax rate in its third quarter was 36.37%. Applying this rate to our adjusted 'income before income taxes' number of $41.98 million (see 1.7), comparable taxes are $15.26 million.1.9 Consolidated net incomeSubtracting $15.26 million in adjusted taxes (see 1.8) from $41.98 million (see 1.7) and holding 'equity in net income of unconsolidated entities' flat at $478,000 on a year-over-year basis results in adjusted consolidated net income of $27.2 million, which compares to $27 million in the year-ago period. There was a negligible difference in 'net loss attributable to non-controlling interests' between the comparison periods.2.0 Core Net Income Attributable to MorningstarCore net income attributable to Morningstar advanced less than 1% in the period. This year-over-year growth rate is the same on a diluted basis, as last year's share count would be used in the comparison. We gave management credit for the non-operating income, so we can't also give them credit for buying back shares. Further, in any case, buying back shares to boost earnings per share is a classic sign of low-quality earnings expansion.The Bottom LineIdentifying instances of managed earnings on the income statement usually indicates the underlying quality of earnings growth is falling, and the latter usually catches up in the form of reduced equity price performance. In Morningstar's case, the firm released a third-quarter earnings report that revealed 21.4% headline earnings growth. However, this was only achieved by cutting discretionary expenses and buying back stock.

122179,21618,2009-02-24T02:35:59-05:00,,"On Friday morning I detailed my strategy for dealing with stock declines. Little did I anticipate that I would so quickly be exercising that strategy in an unexpected decline of what I would otherwise tell you is a 'favorite' stock of mine, Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN). As I wrote this, Morningstar was trading at $28.01, down $4.52 or 13.89% on the day.I acquired my 116 shares of Morningstar just a month ago, on January 21, 2009, at a cost basis of $33.53. On Friday I sold all of my shares at $28.00, for a loss of $5.53 or 16.5% since purchase. My sale point after an initial purchase was at an 8% loss. Since I enter these sales and purchases manually (rather an old-fashioned approach I suppose), this stock price blew right by my sale point and I incurred an even larger loss on this investment than I would prefer to take. In any case, the stock triggered a sale for me and I am now down to four positions: 50 shares of Haemonetics (NYSE:HAE), 90 shares of PetSmart (NASDAQ:PETM), 350 shares of Rollins (NYSE:ROL), and 154 shares of Sysco (NYSE:SYY).Being under my minimum, instead of 'sitting on my hands' with this sale, I actually have a 'buy signal' to be adding a fifth holding to get back to my minimum of 5 positions. However, instead of looking to add a slightly larger position as I would do if I were at least at 5 positions, by making a purchase of 125% of the average size of the remaining holdings, I shall continue to shrink my exposure by buying a position at 50% of the average size of the remaining four holdings.Looking for what triggered that downside move Friday, we can see that Morningstar reported 4th quarter 2008 results Thursday after the close of trading. Revenue came in at $119.3 million, slightly ahead of last year's result of $118.1 million. Net income for the quarter came in at $19.3 million or $.39/share down 3.7% from the $20.0 million or $.41/share the prior year. While this result is not surprising in light of the overall weakness of the economy, what likely triggered the rather extreme move was the fact that analysts had been expecting $.43/share according to Reuters estimates in the same article. Thus the company disappointed and failed to meet expectations.Contributing to this drop in net income were the combined facts that ""assets under advisement fell about 32% to roughtly $66 billion"" according to CEO Joe Mansueto. In addition, the company's own expenses rose in conjunction with acquisitions to 2,375 from 1,720 employees. The market did not take lightly to these results.I still like this company, but I am definitely obligated to sell the holding within the framework of my own investment strategy as well as the announcement of fundamentally poor results.I shall keep you posted on what and if I make a small purchase to bring my holdings back to my minimum of five.Disclosure: The author sold his shares of MORN, and owns HAE, PETM, SYY and ROL."
271970,24491,2011-05-26T09:05:51-04:00,,"Morningstar has carved out a nice niche in the investment research and financial data world, with such interesting analytical tools as the Style Box for mutual funds, the Economic Moat for stocks, the Cash Flow Cushion (pdf) for credit, and a variety of other tools to aid institutional investors, retail investors, and financial advisors in their analyses (ETFs, closed-end funds, etc.). Regardless of your investment philosophy, it's hard not to like Morningstar's subscription-based and licensing business model, which keeps cash coming in the door at a nice pace to fund internal growth and future acquisitions (and now a small dividend and share-repurchase program). However, the firm looks fairly valued at this time, and investors should expect no better than a market return from these levels.The firm's business can be broken down into two segments:Within its Investment Management segment, its licensed data service, which offers investment data (including real-time pricing data) across numerous databases, is the firm's largest revenue-generator at about 18% of consolidated revenue. Morningstar Advisor Workstation, about 13% of consolidated revenue, offers financial advisors a web-based investment planning system. This product has held the line at roughly 150,000 licenses during the past 4 years (153,100 in 2010; 148,392 in 2009; 151,874 in 2008; and 150,505 in 2007).Another key contributor in this segment is Morningstar.com (about 9% of consolidated revenue)--its well-known website for individual investors--which reaps in revenue from premium memberships (about two-thirds of Morningstar.com sales) and Internet advertising (the balance). Premium subscribers have fallen off considerably during the past few years as a result of the economic slowdown, a weak trial pipeline, and heightened competition from rivals like Seeking Alpha, TheStreet.com, and The Motley Fool, but growth in its institutional equity and credit business should more than offset these declines over the long haul (advertising revenue, though cyclical, should help as well). Assuming $185 per annual subscription, Morningstar needs to generate just over $7.7 million from its institutional equity and corporate credit research efforts to replace this lost retail subscription revenue, a very achievable level.(Click charts to expand)Perhaps the biggest growth driver in its Investment Information segment has been Morningstar Direct (about 7% of consolidated revenue), a web-based platform that provides advanced research (performance comparisons, in-depth analysis, etc.) of a portfolio's investment style. Direct licenses maintained a nice growth clip in the firm's first quarter, and expansion should continue to be phenomenal in the years ahead.Morningstar Site Builder, Morningstar Principia, Logical Information Machines (LIM), Morningstar Indexes, and Realpoint (an NRSRO focused on CMBS) are other contributors to the firm's Investment Information segment, which has grown (organically and via acquisitions) roughly 14% since 2008.The largest products and services in Morningstar's Investment Management segment are its investment consulting services (Morningstar Associates, Ibbotson Associates, etc.)--roughly 13% of consolidated revenue--retirement advice, and its managed portfolios, a fee-based service that manages roughly $2.7 billion in assets. Business results in this segment have been volatile during the past few years due in part to its emphasis on asset-based fees (12% of consolidated revenue), which tend to move in tandem with the overall market. After falling off in 2009, revenue from its Investment Management segment is now just shy of 2008 levels.Put Morningstar on Your Radar ScreenMorningstar's organic growth has resumed its ascent following the rolloff of revenue related to the global analyst research settlement period (ended July 2009). Look for the firm's organic growth to hover in the high-single-digits to low-double-digits in the quarters ahead.Morningstar operates a relatively high fixed-cost business--meaning the variable costs of adding the next customer are relatively low (particularly since a significant portion of its products and services are Internet-based or generate fees from assets under management). As such, look for Morningstar's operating margins to improve gradually in the years ahead.Outlined below are expectations for Morningstar's business. Assuming a 10-year revenue CAGR of 8%, 10-year EBIT CAGR of 10%, and a corresponding 10-year free cash flow CAGR of 10% (as represented by the forecasts below), Morningstar's fair value at this time is in the mid-to-high $50s (assuming a discount rate of 10% and low-single-digit growth assumptions in perpetuity). Though there's lots to like about Morningstar's business model, investors should expect to earn only a market return from these levels. That said, keep Morningstar on your radar screen and look for an entry point in the low $40s, which should offer an adequate margin of safety given risks related to its business.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Disclaimer: This article is for information purposes only.

It offers a range of Internet, software, and print-based products for individual investors, financial advisors, and institutional clients. It provides asset management services for advisors, institutions, and retirement plan participants. Morningstar sells international versions of its products to investors in Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, and South Africa.Last year MORN introduced hedge fund ratings and Style Boxes, a Morningstar Rating for collective investment trusts, a new series of hedge fund categories and indexes, analyst-driven fair value estimates for exchange traded funds, new glide path data for target-date funds, estimated cash flow and market share data for investments in global markets, and rider descriptions for variable annuities.Morningstar came public in 2005 and the shares were market darlings rising from $18.51 TO $37.43 between May and December. Earnings grew rapidly in 2006 and 2007 and MORN shares peaked at $85.50 (and 56 times earnings) late in the year.The first three quarterly comparisons of 2008 were quite positive year-over-year before a Q4 dip to $0.39 versus $0.41 made the full year 2008’s earnings a still excellent $1.88 v. $1.53 /share. MORN’s share price collapsed with the market in October and November last fall hitting $25.78 when the broad market hit bottom around Thanksgiving.Its sales and earnings are quite sensitive to general market conditions and 2009 estimates now call for their first ever drop in EPS to about $1.63. If the last five weeks upturn in the averages continues, however, I think that estimates may start ratcheting upwards. Here are their per share numbers as reported by Value Line:Year …..Sales ….. C/F …... EPS ….. B/V ….. Avg. P/E …52-Wk-Price Range  2005 …. 5.64 …… 0.98 ….. 0.70 …. 4.31 …… 42.1x …… $18.51 – $37.43  2006 …. 7.46 …… 1.57 ….. 1.10 …. 6.38 …… 37.3x …… $32.99 – $47.56  2007 …. 9.70 …… 2.12 ….. 1.53 …. 9.11 …… 37.7x …… $44.60 – $85.50  2008 ….10.21 …... 2.23 ….. 1.88 ….11.33 ……27.6x …… $25.78 – $77.81At Thursday’s close of $32.02 these shares are now at 17x last year’s and < 19.7x the reduced estimates for 2009.The company is debt free and held $174 MM cash and $124 MM in short term securities against $103 MM in accounts payable at year end 2008. That $195 MM (net cash and equivalents) equals about $4.22 /share making the effective multiple even lower.I could easily picture these shares returning to a more typical valuation as the markets firm up. The current share price is lower than the lows touched in the full years 2006 and 2007 even though revenues, cash flow, earnings and book value are much higher now.I see a minimum target price of 22x the conservative $1.63 Zacks estimate or $35.86 /share by year-end. Higher EPS and a larger multiple are certainly possible. The shares were north of $38 this past January.Here’s a nice play from now through next January:……………………………………. Cash Outlay……… Cash Inflow  Buy 1000 MORN @ $32.02 …….. $32,020  Sell 10 Jan. $35 calls @ $2.50 ………………….……$2,500  Sell 10 Jan. $30 puts @ $4.20 ………………….…… $4,200  Net Cash Out-of-Pocket ……….... $25,320If Morningstar shares rise to $35 or higher by the expiration date of January 15, 2010:You will hold $35,000 cash for your original $25,320 outlay.That’s a best case scenario, cash-on-cash return of 38% on a position you held for less than 10 months on shares which only had to go up by 9.3% from trade inception.If Morningstar shares are unchanged from your starting price on January 15, 2010:You have $32,020 for your original outlay of $25,320.That’s a total return of 26%, on shares which did not go up,  achieved in <10 months.What’s the risk?If MORN shares go below $30 before expiration date:What’s the break-even on this whole trade?On the first 1000 shares it’s their $32.02 price less the $2.50 call premium = $29.52 /share.On the ‘put’ shares it’s the $30 strike price less the $4.20 put premium = $25.80 /share.Your net break-even price is the average of $29.52 and $25.80 = $27.66 /share.Thus, Moringstar shares could fall by up to $4.36 /share or (-13.5%) by January 15, 2010 without causing you to suffer a loss from inception of this trade.

116072,21618,2009-01-23T02:17:06-05:00,,"If you are a regular reader of my blog, then I am sure you will realize that five days ago I sold my shares of Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) after they announced a disappointing earnings report and reduced guidance. I wrote about it here.Most of my sales of shares are either at appreciation or depreciation targets. They are more or less mechanical in that I know in advance what I need to do and with how many shares. This time, I used my discretionary decision-making power to determine that it was time to part company with these shares and unloaded them before any targeted price. (By the way, I sold my shares of JCI at $15.60, and as I wrote this, JCI was trading at $14.195, so thus far it wasn't a bad decision at all!)I chose Wednesday to replace this position with a new holding and chose Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN), an old favorite of mine and purchased 116 shares at $33.464. (As I wrote this, MORN was trading at $33.88, up $.87 or 2.64% on the day.)In some fashion I have liberalized my trading system recently. I still follow my rules for selling 1/7th of my holding when a stock hits an appreciation target and using that sale as a buy signal to purchase a new stock. I still employ a strategy of selling complete holdings when they have declined to an 8% loss after an initial purchase or to some higher predetermined level if they decline after partial sales on appreciation. However, it has always been my approach to sell stocks arbitrarily when I felt some fundamental information dictated that trade. And that is what happened with Johnson Controls.I have not clearly determined whether after such arbitrary sales I should 'sit on my hands' or replace those holdings with another position. With the market having corrected as much as it has, and my belief that we are closer to the bottom of this market than to the top, I chose to replace this holding. I might not do the same in the future.Also, unlike many of my purchases, I have chosen to arbitrarily pick one of my favorites as my latest purchase, rather than restricting myself to the top % gainers lists. Again, with the market having declined as much as it has (The Dow as I wrote this is trading at 8,031, down about 6,000 points or 43% since its high in late 2007), I find myself becoming more value oriented and with my growth approach I am more of a GARP investor than a momentum investor as virtually all stocks at this time have had the momentum literally beaten right out of them!My basic philosophy in any case remains unchanged. I am still looking for stocks that have demonstrated consistent revenue growth, earnings growth, possibly dividend growth, stable outstanding shares, free cash flow, and a solid balance sheet. One of my favorite resources for identifying this information has been the Morningstar website. In fact, I like Morningstar so much I bought shares Wednesday. (My kids would of course have asked me if I liked Morningstar that much, why didn't I marry it!)Let me briefly review some of the updated facts about this stock that led me once again to include it in my portfolio.I first wrote up Morningstar on Stock Picks Bob's Advice on November 22, 2005. I have also previously owned shares in my trading account.Regarding the latest quarter's results, Morningstar reported 3rd quarter 2008 results on October 30, 2008. Revenue climbed 12.2% in the quarter to $125.5 million from the $111.9 million reported a year earlier. Net income came in at $22.2 million or $.45/share, up from $19.9 million or $.41/share the prior year.Checking the ""5-Yr Restated"" financials on Morningstar on the Morningstar website, we can see the steady growth in revenue from $139 million in 2003 to $435 million in 2007 and $501 million in the trailing twelve months [TTM].During this period, earnings have increased steadily from a loss of $.31/share in 2003 to $.21/share in 2004, increasing to $1.53/share in 2007 and $1.90 in the TTM.Outstanding shares have nominally increased from 38 million in 2003 to 49 million in the TTM.Free cash flow has been positive and growing recently with $41 million reported in 2005 increasing to $101 million in 2007 and $107 million in the TTM.The balance sheet appears solid with $234 million in cash and $186 million in other current assets. This easily covers the $218.7 million in current liabilities yielding a current ratio of 1.92. Long-term liabilities are reported to be relatively nominal at $30.7 million.In terms of some valuation numbers, checking the Yahoo ""Key Statistics"" on Morningstar, the company is a mid cap stock with a market capitalization of $1.59 billion. The trailing P/E is a moderate 17.92 with a forward P/E reported to be 18.89 (fye 31-Dec-09). The PEG ratio works out to a reasonable 1.01.According to the Fidelity.com eresearch website, the Price/Sales ratio [TTM] at 3.02 is a bit rich compared to the average of 1.49 in the same industry. Also on the Fidelity website, the profitability is above average coming in with a Return on Equity [TTM] of 19.85% compared to the industry average of 18.34%.Finishing up with Yahoo, there are 46.77 million shares outstanding but only 17.94 million float. Currently there are 1.54 million shares out short (as of 12/10/08) representing 5 trading days of volume (the short ratio). I use an arbitrary 3 days for significance, so from my perspective, as with many stocks today, there are a lot of shares out short which may provide some buying support if any sort of good news is reported and a 'squeeze' develops.No dividends are paid and no stock splits are reported on Yahoo.If we review the Morningstar 'point & figure' chart from StockCharts.com, we can see that the stock hit a high of $85 in November, 2007, only to trade lower with the rest of the market and especially the financials to hit a low of $26 in November, 2008. The stock has come up a little from the low but technically, the chart does look very weak.Incrementally, I chose to add a new holding to my portfolio and thereby return my equities exposure back to the 6 holding I had prior to my sale of JCI. I believe this is a good decision, but shall manage this purchase as with all of my other holdings in the same strategy as I have previously followed.In many ways, for me Morningstar is a Peter Lynch type of purchase. I am familiar with their services---at least their internet website, and like the underlying numbers and consistency in their growth. I have owned Morningstar shares previously, and once again am a stockholder!"
64311,20856,2008-02-12T17:13:07-05:00,,"When looking for information on solid investments, individuals and institutions alike turn to Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN) to find quality research. Many, however, may be unaware that a high quality is right under their nose in the form of the holding company that supplies them with the research. Morningstar is known to most as the primary aggregator of information on publicly traded mutual funds. The company’s ability to rank funds based on returns, expense ratios, style, volatility and many other measures has won them a loyal following. The company’s product line is actually much more robust with information on individual securities both in domestic markets and increasingly covering international markets.The company has divided its revenues into three primary categories. The Individual Segment encompasses the well known mutual fund service served to consumers through the companies website. This segment received revenues of 23.7m last quarter primarily through premium membership subscriptions and advertisements sold on the site. The second division is the Advisor Segment which provides workstation technology and managed portfolios typically to independent wealth advisers. This segment accounted for 29.3m in revenues last quarter and benefited from strong growth in the number of licenses in use. Finally, the Institutional segment covers investment consulting, retirement advice and more. This is the crown jewel of the company with revenue of $60.8m in the last quarter. With improving margins, the segment saw operating income more than double at $20.7m.The most recent strength in margins across all divisions is nearly as important as the sales growth. The company has managed to scale its platform effectively to be able to offer services to more customers with relatively small increases in overhead expenses. Acquisitions have been integrated in such a way as to wring out excess costs thus leaving the company with a robust product suite powered by a stable contained back office. The institutional segment is considered to have just scratched the surface of the multi-trillion dollar addressable market and could see significant further growth with only modest increases in its cost structure. While the company is known for its expertise in domestic mutual funds, international expansion has grown to the point it is now more than 20% of revenue. The potential to serve emerging markets is incredible as investors are craving strong quality research products in this under-served area. Currently the company has a presence in 21 different international markets spanning North America, Europe and Asia. The diversification away from dollar denominated revenue also helps to stabilize earnings and has most recently led to additional gains on currency translation.The stock has taken its share of lumps along with most other growth stocks in January. Currently the price sits just above the 200 day average which has proven to be a support area for the stock in the past. Volume flow is positive with several strong price movements in above average volume the last few weeks. While the stock is not cheap, the multiple has shrunk considerably since the high and now seems very reasonable given the potential growth rate of the company. The company has a very strong balance sheet with no debt to speak of and ample cash to fund further acquisitions. While cash flow will be pressured a bit as the company develops its Chicago headquarters this year, it is comforting to know that a liquidity crisis would not have a material effect on the company’s ability to finance future growth.Bear markets are especially difficult for long only managers who are required to keep a certain amount of exposure in the markets. While I currently believe it is wiser to hold large cash balances and look for opportunistic short trades, this name may be very helpful for those who need to put some capital to work. With its talented management team, successful integration track record, low financial leverage and strong balance sheet, Morningstar should outperform its peers and possibly distinguish itself as a safe haven in a troubling market."
75887,20856,2008-05-06T12:15:03-04:00,,"Morningstar, Inc. (NASDAQ:MORN) reported earnings late last week which were met with enthusiasm by investors. The company reported that although the first quarter had challenges relating to a volatile and declining market, the company still managed to grow revenues to $125.4 million which is 31.4% higher than last year. Their profitability was equally impressive, with net income coming in at 47 cents per share compared to 33 the year before. Management noted that the results were driven by strength in investment consulting as well as the licensed data it sells to subscribers.Although the 30%-plus revenue growth looks very impressive on the surface, after accounting for acquisitions over the last year, organic growth was only 17.4%. Currency translation also benefited the headline revenue number as the company has grown international sources of revenue. In fact, overseas revenue now accounts for about 25% of total revenue which is a testament to the diversification efforts of management.While acquired revenue growth may not carry the same weight as organic revenue growth, management should be commended for their disciplined approach to acquisitions. At this point, the balance sheet is still very strong with $215 million in cash and investments. On the liability side there is no long-term debt, which will give them flexibility to not only ride out a weak economic period, but enables them to take advantage of the situation by making long-term investments in new acquisition targets at a time when prices for these companies are very low.The most recent major acquisition was a purchase of Hemscott, and although this new company may not have as much in the way of additional revenue, Morningstar is getting a very attractive India data center which it should be able to leverage by storing more of its company-wide information in this centralized location. Hopefully this will lead to cost-cutting measures that will improve the efficiency of the entire operation.In reading a research report by WR Hambrecht, I became aware of a disturbing cloud on the horizon. Currently, Morningstar receives a good bit of business from major Wall Street firms who purchase research. The agreements are a result of lawsuits back in 2004 and as part of the settlement, companies such as Merrill Lynch (MER) and SmithBarney are required to offer their clients independent third-party research for five years. Up to this point, the Hambrecht analyst believed that Wall Street would continue with the arrangement in order to stave off additional lawsuits in the future. But now that the firms are in more financial distress and are in cost-cutting mode, there is more likelihood that the individual contracts will not be renewed. While this is an issue that will not actually occur until July of 2009, it is worth keeping on the radar as the stock price will adjust in accordance with future expected events.While Morningstar is a very healthy company and has traded up very nicely in the past few days, the valuation is at a place where there appears to be a good deal of risk in the position. For those holding a long position with profits, it may make sense to take some gains off the table or to hedge the position by selling out at the money calls. For example, at the time of writing, one could sell the June 75 calls for $3.30 which helps to cut back a bit on exposure and gives additional premium to add to current gains. In conclusion, this is a strong company that should survive a weak global economic cycle, but the stock is pricey at this point and should be treated with caution.MORN NotesDisclosure: Author does not have a position in MORN."
313125,24005,2011-12-11T09:56:23-05:00,,"Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN) is a low-to-no growth internet stock that is priced to perfection at 30X trailing earnings and 23X analyst estimates. In my view, the stock market overall is a lousy place to invest right now and the mutual fund industry in particular is reeling with redemptions as it appears harder and harder for active money managers to add any value over major index funds. Legendary investors like Bill Miller have been bruised in recent years and with redemptions from actively managed funds continuing to hurt the mutual fund business, one should expect Morningstar's business to taper off in sympathy even though the company is exceptionally well managed and has a wide moat to paraphrase company vernacular.Morningstar provides a valuabe service for investors and the site is fantastic at what it does; however, in an era where little value can be gained from MIT graduates in suits over a benchmark of passive investments, it's hard to see where Morningstar's growth will come from in the future. Over the past three years, Morningstar has seen net income basically flatline at around $85MM which according to Ben Graham should be worth around 10X earnings on a best case scenario. If we apply a ten times multiple to MORN's flattish earnings, we get to an intrinsic value estimate of around $850MM or so for the business. If we add back the company's $368MM or so in net tangible book value, we get to a valuation of around $1.2 billion or so on a conservative basis. Morningstar's ""moat"" gives it another $400MM or so in brand value, which means we could see paying a maximum of around $1.6 billion or so for the business. This estimate of valuation implies that MORN shares are some 42% overvalued.Morningstar is an exceptionally well run company that is unrivaled in its market, but the stock is simply not cheap compared with the amount of web users that visit the site. Given the long term headwinds facing the mutual fund and brokerage industries, Morningstar investors face the dual challenge of investing in a shrinking industry while paying a market multiple which is more than double that of the average common stock.While I do not advocate an outright short on MORN, I do think wise investors who own the name should at the very least sell call options against their stock positions and more aggressive investors should consider selling bear call spreads on the common stock to profit from sideways to lower price action in the name. We are currently bearish on most asset classes aside from gold and silver.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
68454,21490,2008-03-13T14:19:10-04:00,,"A couple weeks ago we received an e-mail from Morningstar announcing a new type of ETF research. Here's a key passage from Morningstar's Jeffrey Ptak: Vastly
superior? That claim strikes us as a bit inflated. We make no case for
breathlessness, of course, but we do think there's a...er...fundamental
problem with this kind of ""fair value"" analysis. As ever, equity prices
are functions of (more or less*) objective facts (earnings, revenue,
margins, &c.) and investors' entirely subjective willingness to pay
for such things. So not only are ""future facts"" difficult to project
with precision, but who can say what traders and investors will pay for
them? Given this two-dimensional uncertainty, we think estimates of fair
value--over what time frame? in what sort of broad market conditions?
assuming current industry trends persist? or that they change?--are
surrounded by such enormous error terms that they might more profitably
be ignored than followed. But if not estimates of fair value, if one doesn't have a ""price
target"" for a given security or, in turn, a pool of securities such as
an ETF, what's left? We'd say known fundamentals (i.e., recent ""facts"")
and current price and volume action are the only serviceable sources of
advantage in our relatively efficient, hyper-competitive, often random
financial markets. Now, this is a little too easy, but we can't resist. In a piece accompanying the item from which we pulled the above exceprt, Ptak concludes with this:On February 27th, XLF closed at $27.56. At last check
today it was changing hands at $24.23, a decline of 12.1% in two weeks.
Which means that it'll have to gain 39.2% from here to reach
Morningstar's ""fair value"" estimate of $33.73 in the next 50 weeks.
We'd say that's possible. And exceedingly unlikely. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Yes, these ""facts"" can be fudged. And sometimes are. But let's
just assume for the sake of this discussion that earnings are earnings."

Since going public in 2005, the company has put up double digit earnings and revenue growth, while doubling its assets under advisement from a year ago to nearly $81.5 billion. Favorable secular trends and a business model that achieves operating leverage will allow for further growth going forward. An economic moat is provided by the company's branding, unique content, and deep databases that are time consuming and difficult to replicate. Investment Thesis   Valuation I used an average of my DCF model, earnings multiples, P/S multiples, and EV/EBITDA multiples to arrive at my PT of $72.00. In my DCF I assumed a growth rate for the next 5 years of 35%, and the following 5 years of 15%, with a WACC of 8.1%. I based these growth rates on favorable secular trends in the economy that Morningstar's business is leveraged to, the opportunity for growth in new foreign markets which is seeing growth in their middle classes, and the company's strong recurring revenues, strong economic moat, and ability to achieve operating leverage through their databases which are fixed assets. I used a P/E multiple of 33, a P/S multiple of 6.1, and an EV/EBITDA multiple of 20, all of which are based on a combination of the above favorable aspects of Morningstar's business model and historical multiples. Risks  Management Joe Mansueto: Mr. Mansueto founded Morningstar in 1984, and has served as chairman since inception and CEO from inception to 1996 and from 200 to present. He holds a bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago in business administration and an MBA from the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business. As the company's largest shareholder with 70% of shares outstanding, Mr. Mansuseto has a lot of skin in the game, a trait which I view as favorable. Under his guidance, the company has been extremely shareholder focused and uses the same metrics to evaluate their own business as they use to evaluate stocks: building intrinsic value over a long period of time. Mr. Mansueto has a serious passion for stocks and cites Warren Buffet as his inspiration after reading about him in John Train's acclaimed book The Money Masters. Mr. Mansueto says that the idea for Morningstar came from trying to teach himself equity analysis. Bottom Line Morningstar has an excellent business model, excellent management, unique content, and deep databases that make me believe that there is plenty of room for future growth. Entry into the fund of funds business, entry into new foreign markets, and continued expansion of the company's hedge fund and equity universe look to drive revenue growth. With the company's operating leverage through its fixed database assets, margins could easily expand more, and I believe that my $72.00 PT is a conservative estimate of intrinsic value.

Many times areas of big support such as this support area in the Dow don't provide support right at the line, particularly when emotions are high and fear based selling kicks in. Rather, you often get some kind of capitulation - a large flush of weak hands, people scrambling to get sell orders in. Essentially throwing in the towel. An exhaustion of weak hand selling, bargain hunting and some big time short covering can fuel unbelievable rallies as we saw today. After all that, the Dow still has support of its 200 day moving average and upward trend line. The lows of today will act as a line in the sand, an area of significant support. The move at the end of the day yesterday was forceful and it is enough of a springboard for a dead cat bounce. However, let's keep in mind that most of the move today was in the worst hit industries such as financial, homebuilers and REIT's. Has anything changed really? No. The market was way oversold and just needs to retrace some of the downward move. As I've said before the big money will be made on the short side and any bounces, particularly weak volume bounces provide areas for short entries. You have to believe that there are lots of people out there that have been piling up significant losses are just itching to get out with a wash or much smaller losses. We have room to run a bit here, but this is NOT the time to be getting aggressive on the long side. Patience. I'll have a full run down of the charts in the Weekly Report on Sunday night.

Leading stocks did not do well today despite the big market reversal. Summary: Where's the Money Flowing Many investing websites provide leading industries based on price performance alone. However, without accompanying volume levels, this can sometimes be misleading. The only way that I know of to gauge industry/sector strength WITH volume levels is through the analysis of ETF's. A couple years ago this was not possible, but as more traders/investors use ETF's they become a much better tool for gauging the health of the market and seeing where the money is flowing (or not flowing). Using the proprietary SelfInvestors Demand Indicator score which measures price and volume movements, I'm able to quickly see which sectors/industries are seeing the greatest inflows of cash. For a detailed look at how I go about gauging sector/industry strength please see here. Stocks I highlight one stock selected from a group of stocks moving up with volume well above average and most likely breaking out of a base or consolidation. Today's stock is a stock I covered back in February when it first broke out of a base - Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN). Most of the leading stocks that I track that moved with volume today were stocks that had beaten down and were recovering from oversold conditions. Morningstar (MORN) was one of the few near all time highs that moved with volume. See my previous commentary on Morningstar (MORN). Here's an updated look at the current technical action: I first highlighted the stock when it broke out above 47 back in February. It quickly spiked 20% higher before settling into another base. It wasn't until the company reported outstanding earnings that the stock gapped up with record volume out of a cup with no handle base to a new all time high. Very bullish action. The stock is now digesting some of those gains and nearing another entry point. I'm going to be looking to get in between 55 - 57.  Full Disclosure/Disclaimer: The stock of the day is by no means a buy recommendation. Please do your own research and make a personal decision based on your own tolerance for risk. I currently do not own a position in Morningstar (MORN)"
46259,20794,2007-09-04T04:43:43-04:00,,"I don't usually wax rhapsodic over publishers, but I'm always glad whenever I hear that Joe Mansueto is involved in a media deal.

Joe founded the mutual fund rating firm Morningstar Inc. (NASDAQ:MORN) back in the early 1980s. He has since expanded that worthy enterprise, acquired Fast Money and Inc., and is said to be in the bidding for Business 2.0.

I've never met Joe, but I used to deal with him quite a bit when I was at Business Week, which very adroitly used Morningstar in preference to Lipper Analytics from the gitgo. Joe always impressed everyone at Business Week with his analytical skills and adroit business sense, so I was delighted when he decided to enter the media business.

He strikes me as just the kind of savvy businessman you want running a magazine. No (known) ideological agenda, no wack-a-doo ideas -- he's not going to trade in advance of publication and then call it a ""business model, "" for instance.

His involvement in Fast Company, as I understand it, essentially rescued that publication from extinction.

I'm tempted to call Joe Mansueto the ""last of a breed"" of hands-off, benevolent publishers. I hope he isn't."
32317,20703,2007-04-16T13:13:21-04:00,,"I am not going to lie; I became as giddy as a teeny bopper buying the new Justin Timberlake album when I read and analyzed the business of Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN). The company possesses almost every aspect that I look for when evaluating an investable business. Great cash flows, excellent management and superior competitive advantages are all essential when I evaluate a business. Below are some additional reasons why I purchased shares of Morningstar (in no particular order) Superior Free Cash Flow Generation Much has been written recently about the importance of a company generating adequate free cash flow (click here for a more detailed explanation of Free Cash Flow). All the attention is much warranted. Having the ability to generate excess cash is beneficial as it can be used in many different ways to increase shareholder value. Ways to increase shareholder value include stock buybacks, dividend payments, and even the ability to acquire companies without adding any additional debt. Think about free cash flow from a personal aspect; wouldn’t it be nice to have extra cash per month from your paycheck after paying all your bills and living costs like groceries? All that excess cash can be used to purchase a new TV or enhance your DVD collection. Historically, many companies don’t have superior Free Cash Flow because they need to invest any cash earned back in the business. Auto makers are a good example. They make a ton of cash but require a lot of cash right back into the business (think factories, engineering.) Over the past few years, Morningstar has been able to grow and expand its FCF at a nice clip. In 2004, the company reported FCF of $25 million and $93 million in the most recently reported 2006 results. Management has decided to use this excess cash to make a variety of acquisitions that boosted their Investing Consulting business and International presence; both which are keys to future growth. Going forward, it appears the company could grow FCF an annual growth rate of about 15% for the next five years. Odds are the Company will probably use the free cash to fund more acquisitions, especially from an international presence, and buy back some stock. Strong Business Model The Company’s main weapon is its vast databases of information on mutual funds, stocks and other investments which it sells to its customers as the basis of its business. Morningstar is the first database business model I have examined. I never realized how strong using databases as the basis of a company’s business model can be. If you think about, creating a database has significant upfront and fixed costs. However, the beauty of the Morningstar model is that once the upfront costs are incurred, adding any additional customers is dirt cheap because they are able to cross sell the heck out of the databases. Without spoiling the last topic of discussion below, the company has been able to successfully cross sell database information into viable specific business segments to increase growth. For the near future, MORN’s profitability should be relatively high because the company incurred most of the upfront costs of creating their databases already. So adding the additional customers of the past few quarters has been relatively cheap. This trend should continue in the near future, as the company shouldn’t require a great deal of investment in their already strong database. However, don’t expect exploding growth because the company will potentially require investments into the international equities and hedge fund databases. Strong Business Segments Prior to researching MORN as a potential investment, my impression of the company was probably similar to many others; the company sells its mutual fund “star ratings” to businesses like Yahoo (YHOO) and MSN (NASDAQ:MSFT) to use on their finance branded sites. After further research I noticed that, while this segment was a large part of the company’s revenue, MORN has many other business lines. More specifically, I was impressed with how the company used its dominant position in mutual fund ratings to expand into many different products and business segments. The business segment expansion evidenced in the past gives me confidence that Management will continue to find additional revenue streams in the future. Below is a listing of segment revenue and percentages: Top Five Products (Segment) 2006*  Investment Consulting (Institutional) $ 46,597 - 14.8 %  Advisor Workstation (Advisor) $43,140 - 13.7%  Licensed Data (Institutional) $37,730 - 12.0%  Morningstar.com (Individual) $31,311 - 9.9%  Principia (Advisor) $28,735 - 9.1% *Below is a quick overview of each (segment) obtained from 2006 10-K Individual - which focuses on products and services for individual investors;  Advisor - which focuses on products and services for financial advisors; and  Institutional - which focuses on products and services for institutional clients, including banks, brokerage firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, media outlets, and retirement plan providers and sponsors. The notes above are just a few reasons why I purchased a position in MORN. In reality, there are a number of additional reasons why I purchased shares. I would recommend performing additional analysis to determine if the investment is appropriate for your portfolio. Disclosure: I own shares Morningstar. MORN 1-yr chart"

In Morningstar's (NASDAQ:MORN) case, we think the firm is overvalued. We think the shares are worth $51 each, slightly lower than our previous fair value estimate of the mutual fund company.For some background, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. Our process is consistent with the documented work that indicates a combined value-momentum approach is superior on a risk-adjusted basis to the strategies of value, growth, and momentum approaches, individually, and a combined growth-momentum portfolio, on average. We reveal these findings in our white paper here.In the spirit of transparency, we show how the performance of our VBI has stacked up per underlying score:If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Morningstar posts a VBI score of 4 on our scale, reflecting our ""overvalued"" DCF assessment of the company, unattractive relative valuation versus peers, and bullish techinicals. We use Factset Research (NYSE:FDS), Moody's (NYSE:MCO), McGraw-Hill (MHP), and Thomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI) for our peer group analysis.Our Report on MorningstarIn the spirit of transparency, our report on Morningstar and hundreds of other companies can be found here.Click to enlarge all images.Investment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsMorningstar's business quality (an evaluation of our ValueCreation™ and ValueRisk™ ratings) ranks among the best of the firms in our coverage universe. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders with relatively stable operating results for the past few years, a combination we view very positively.Although we don't think the firm's valuation indicates an attractive investment opportunity at this time, we'd take a closer look if the firm's share price fell below $41. The market seems to be pricing greater long-term revenue growth and profit expansion than we think is achievable.We don't think the mutual-fund company's valuation indicates an attractive investment opportunity at this time, and we are not considering opening up a position of the firm in the portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter.Morningstar has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 18.6% in coming years, and the firm had no debt as of last quarter.The firm's shares haven't performed all that well compared with the market benchmark. Without an attractive valuation for support, investors are likely moving toward the exit with its stock. The share price could have further room to fall, in our opinion.The firm experienced a revenue CAGR of about 7.9% during the past three years. We expect its revenue growth to be better than its peer median during the next five years.Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (NASDAQ:ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Morningstar's three-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 94.5%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.8%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of Excellent. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Morningstar's free cash flow margin has averaged about 19.8% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively Strong. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Morningstar, cash flow from operations increased about 72% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 89% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisThe estimated fair value of $51 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 26.4 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 11.7 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 8.2% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's three-year historical compound annual growth rate of 7.9%. Our model reflects a five-year projected average operating margin of 26.2%, which is above Morningstar's trailing three-year average. Beyond year five, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 5.2% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Morningstar, we use a 10.8% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $51 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Morningstar. We think the firm is attractive below $41 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $61 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Morningstar's fair value at this point in time to be about $51 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Morningstar's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in year three represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $68 per share in year three represents our existing fair value per share of $51 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The Company divides its business operations into three segments:  Morningstar maintains a series of databases on eight types of investments used by investors. As of December 31, 2005, the Company provided data on more than 17,800 mutual fund share classes in the United States; 43,000 mutual funds and similar vehicles in international markets; 7,100 stocks; 2,600 hedge funds; 4,800 separate accounts; 50,200 variable annuity/life sub-accounts; 200 exchange-traded funds; 600 closed-end funds, and 80 college savings plans. FUNDAMENTALS: Morningstar is a company that bled money for several years before finally becoming profitable in 2004. Since that time, the company hasn't looked back. Earnings more than tripled in '05 and will end up with another surge of 60 - 70% in 2006 once the company reports 4th quarter '06 results on Thursday. 2007 earnings estimates call for an increase in the neighborhood of 35%. One key characteristic that I look for in companies that could become the next home run are rising margins and ROE. This is the case for Morningstar. In addition, management must believe in the company because it has money on the line with 80% ownership. All the fundamental characteristics are there for Morningstar to be big winner. TECHNICAL: The stock broke out from a base today to a new all time high today. Although relative strength lags a bit with a score of 62/100, a high volume move into record territory is extremely bullish.

Lipper aims to unseat Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN) as the arbiter of good taste in the mutual fund industry.
Lipper is the owner of the HedgeWorld (a.k.a. Lipper TASS) database of hedge funds.  So one might guess that Lipper’s new mutual fund rating system would borrow some of the intellectual capital developed while trying to rate hedge funds.  
Since mutual funds tend to be high correlated with each other, they are usually grouped into discrete buckets for analysis (witness Morningstar’s style boxes).  For example, two large cap US value funds can easily be compared with each other and ranked against a common benchmark (S&P500).  But hedge funds are more heterogeneous than mutual funds.  Even within strategy buckets, they tend to have a high level of dispersion.  So hedge fund ranking brings a host of new issues to the table (which benchmark?  what timeframe?  kurtosis?  skewedness?…)
Meanwhile, over at Morningstar, hedge funds have also been on the radar screen.  So the firm went out and bought hedge fund database InvestorForce last summer.  At the recent “World Hedge Funds Summit” in Toronto last month, I asked John Rekenthaler, VP of Research and Product Development at Morningstar, whether the lessons learned from the firm’s foyer into hedge fund rating would eventually be applied to their core mutual fund business.  He agreed this would likely occur. 
We believe that rating techniques for mutual funds and hedge funds will eventually converge.  After all, a mutual fund is essentially a marketing package (a “host fund”) containing ETFs (beta) and ”embedded hedge funds” (alpha).  Once the major components of beta have been stripped out of a mutual fund, what remains can be analyzed as a hedge fund.  Since most hedge funds also contain a healthy measure of beta, they too need to be boiled down to isolate their alpha. 
So mutual funds and hedge funds are really all in the same game: alpha.  There is no reason to maintain two sets of rating systems.  At the end of the day, it’s really an apples to apples comparison.  It’s all about alpha."

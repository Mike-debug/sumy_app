As a result, MRIN raised revenue and earnings guidance by $3M for Q4. More importantly, it shows the strategic value of MRIN.","Shots have been fired in the simmering ""Ad Wars"" between FANG titans Amazon (AMZN) and the incumbent duopoly for online advertising spend, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (FB).Amazon is coming for Google and Facebook's main source of revenue, setting up a potentially cataclysmic clash between the tech titans. The spoils of this war will be massive: a $100B+ per year industry is at stake.Many don't know it yet, but Amazon Ads business is scaling fast and is still housed in its ""Other"" line item on its revenue breakout. Remember what other Amazon business was masked for years under the guise of ""Other?"" Amazon Web Services (""AWS""). Now, AWS is the clear industry leader in cloud computing and accounts for half of Amazon's pre-tax profits even with its revenue contribution being just over 10% of consolidated net sales. Amazon Ads business could have similar characteristics in the years ahead.Here is a breakout of Amazon's quarterly results from its 3Q 2018 earnings release. Q3 2018 ""Other"" revenue was $2.5 billion, up from $2.2 billion in Q2 2018 and $1.1 billion in Q3 2017. Impressive revenue growth sequentially and year over year.(Source: bamsec.com)Some analysts believe Amazon Ads business will be bigger than AWS and contribute more pre-tax earnings than AWS in just a few years' time. Given Amazon's advertising business is a relatively new upstart within the company, it already is a ~$5 billion run-rate business and scaling fast as can be seen by the ""Other"" revenue results. And it makes sense why:Amazon can do many things for brand advertisers that Google and Facebook can't offer. For example, Amazon enjoys the enviable position of having troves of customer data around individual purchasing habits and a massive infrastructure to do something interesting: use that customer data and the delivery infrastructure to send highly probable customers free samples of products from advertisers to drive sales.Using Amazon's approach, advertisers can directly quantify ROI on market spend and track sales of such campaigns. This even led to some analysts and media executives describing Google's ads business as ""quaint."" Not exactly an endearing term for a high flying FANG titan. I think you'd normally use the term ""quaint"" to describe grandma's cottage in the countryside, or something of that nature.Marin Software (MRIN) is a relative minnow in the world of online advertising (from a market cap perspective) which had fallen on hard times as customers left in droves for well-funded competitor Kenshoo. Marin lost its way - as is clear by looking at the results and share price the past 5 years - after Christopher Lien resigned as CEO in May 2014 from the company he founded in 2006 and which became the dominant player in the industry before Kenshoo made competitive inroads.MRIN data by YChartsUltimately, given the value destruction, Mr. Lien decided to make a comeback to the CEO role in August 2016 to right the MRIN ship which makes sense given he has a significant 5.6% ownership stake. As a result, Mr. Lien decided to redirect Marin's annual $25M+ R&D spend to build out MarinOne, a new platform which tracks advertising spend and ROI across the ""walled gardens"" of Amazon, Facebook, and Google.The video below explains it better than I can.I understand that MRIN began onboarding certain customers in 2018 and is now ready to roll it out to the rest of its customer base and new customers with general availability. Moreover, MRIN changed the pricing model from a portion of ad spend flowing through its platform to a monthly, fixed fee SaaS style model which aligns more with customers. This should reduce selling friction and increase customer adoption and stickiness to the platform.According to the most recent earnings call, CEO Lien said:After much delay, the MarinOne platform appears ready to go and should help MRIN arrest the declines in its revenue and begin growing again in 2019. For evidence of that, the recent Google deal caused management to revise Q4 guidance up $3 million on both the revenue and earnings line ($14.6-15.1M revenue and $2.4-2.9M non-GAAP loss), suggesting modest sequential growth against Q3 2018. If you read the deal closely, it suggests that Google will be providing a revenue share each quarter for Google search advertising related revenue, and it appears like annually for non-Google related search revenue flowing through Marin's platforms. Here is the relevant part from the 8-K:This is impressive, because it indicates the Google deal will provide regular, quarterly contributions through September 2021 and that Marin should be on its way to inflecting to a cash generator rather than a cash consumer as a result of the Google deal. CFO Bradley Kinnish suggested the following on the Q3 call in November 2018 (pre-Google deal):If one assumes that MRIN collected $3M from Google in Q4 (or will in early Q1 2019), then MRIN should generate $1M in free cash flow in the quarter. Assuming revenue stabilizes, or grows slightly in 2019, that should pack a decent punch to MRINs cash generation abilities since much of its operating cost base is fixed, and 40-50% of incremental revenue drops to the bottom line and/or bank account. The Google deal does call for MRIN to reinvest some of the proceeds back into the enterprise SaaS tech platform, so that will have a moderating impact on the cash flow, all else being equal.From a modeling perspective, if revenues have bottomed at a quarterly $15M run-rate, a $2M increase to quarterly revenues also increases operating cash flow and EPS by about $1M per quarter, so any incremental improvement to revenue will have a dramatic impact on MRINs valuation against the backdrop of the current $33M market cap and $20M enterprise value after backing out $13M net cash.To that end, I believe MRIN and Google likely do not want or need to raise any additional capital as a result of the new revenue sharing deal. In fact, if Google does have a desire to ultimately acquire MRIN, then issuing new shares at lower prices doesn't make sense if Google ultimately has to buy them back at higher prices. And clearly, large MRIN stakeholders don't want to dilute themselves at a $33M valuation given the new lease on life from Google.It may seem unlikely MRIN won't raise money since the company's cash balance has dwindled from $27.5M to start 2018 to $13.5M at the end of Q3 2018 (without considering $1.3M ""restricted cash"" on the balance sheet), but I think there is enough incentive from each stakeholder in this situation to not raise money at the current valuation.Management owns a material portion of the stock, and MRIN co-founder Walter Wiscott has been buying a modest amount of stock (24,000 shares total) all year starting at $10 per share in January 2018. Moreover, Brad Kinnish who became the permanent CFO in 2017 has extensive software investment banking experience, see his resume here. Mr. Kinnish was granted about two thirds of his 2017 pay package in the form of stock grants etc. Finally, MRIN Board of Directors provided ""Change of Control"" clauses to the named executive officers in an April 2018 8-K filing, providing for significant cash payments and accelerated vesting of equity awards in the event of a sale, indicating M&A is a decent probability ending to the Marin Software story.All told, the Google deal creates a very interesting risk/reward given MRIN likely does not need to raise cash while stabilizing the business ahead of what appears like a path to growth again. Taken together, MRIN trades at less than 1x revenue and a low multiple of free cash flow if one annualizes the 4Q results post-Google deal, or $4M.I'm not offering any price targets on shares of Marin Software because there are many moving parts to the valuation, and some unknowns about why the situation exists. I also expect the shares to be quite volatile, given there are only 5.8 million shares outstanding, of which about 40% appear to be locked up among insiders and strategic investors, including ESW Capital who recently sold their position down from 21% to just under 10% in the three days following Christmas 2018. That probably explains a lot of the drop from $12 to the mid-$5 range, where the shares trade now. From a technical perspective, the shares appear to be consolidating after the parabolic move to $12, and volume is declining which indicates large, strategic holders are not selling and day traders are moving on from the stock absent large volume.ESW Capital's strategy is to swallow up struggling software outfits - 100% ownership model - and integrate them into their large sales organization to help with scaling. It appears like that was their strategy with Marin as well. I'm speculating now, but the reason ESW sold down their position to just under 10% in MRIN could have been a handshake deal with Google who stands to benefit more from MRIN as a standalone enterprise ad tech platform, or under the auspices of Google itself should it decide to acquire MRIN in the years ahead.As explained above, part of the revenue sharing deal requires MRIN reinvest some of the cash back into R&D for MarinONE, an interesting move by Google who could be ultimately self-funding the R&D with the intention to acquire the tech platform down the road.Given the battle field of online digital advertising is changing due to Amazon's emergence as a major threat to the Facebook/Google duopoly, it might make sense for Facebook to do a similar deal with MRIN to make sure it remains a standalone or to keep it away from Google and/or Amazon. If something like that were to happen - and there is no evidence that it will at this point - expect MRIN shares to go apoplectic.All told, this is a very unique situation with many paths to a higher valuation in the years ahead with what appears like less downside risk now that Google has thrown MRIN a lifeboat for its survival."
4325607,105571,2020-02-20T09:33:46-05:00,Online advertising is a large and growing market.Strategic missteps early hobbled this company.Management and the board are exhausted.The stock has declined steadily from $119.24 to $1.40.Accord Partners has nominated two directors to assist in a turnaround.,"Marin (NASDAQ:MRIN) shares are worth less than 1% of their previous high. One competitor that started after Marin is worth 1,430 times more. Marin spent over $100 million rewriting its software, with no significant effect on revenues or share price. The company is running out of cash, management and the board seem to be drifting, and sales continue to decline. But the ad market remains strong and the company still has $53 million in TTM revenues. This company can probably be turned around. Accord Partners has just nominated two new directors in an offer to help.Marin Software owns and operates MarinOne, a digital advertising platform on which advertising agencies can buy, track, and optimize their ad campaigns across Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and other search, social, and shopping ad channels, across all devices. The purported benefit for advertisers of a ""cross-channel"" and ""cross-device"" platform is that the advertising can track a single campaign everywhere and optimize for the best performance. All the reporting, analytics, and bid strategies are in one convenient place, not broken up on the channel's proprietary platforms. Marin also claims that its platform is more feature-rich than other platforms. Advertisers using MarinOne pay the company a flat-rate subscription fee. For more, see Company Timeline and Other Documents.There is a lot of money in online advertising. According to eMarketer, digital ad spending worldwide in 2019 was $333.25 billion rising to $384.96 billion in 2020. In the US, the numbers were $129.34 billion in 2019 rising to $151.29 billion in 2020. In 2019, worldwide, Google was the largest digital ad seller, followed by Facebook, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), and Amazon with $103.73 billion, $67.37 billion, $29.20 billion, and 14.4 billion, respectively.There are many types of digital advertising, however. The best known are display ads (banners on websites), search ads (the placements at the top or to the side of a search results page), social ads (in-line ads on feeds), and shopping ads (the ads you see when you're about to buy online).Different types of ads have different economics. This is important. Display ads are served on millions of different web sites, with the demand for ads from all of those sites aggregated by hundreds of ad networks, ad exchanges, and similar middlemen. On the other hand, search, social, and shopping ads are generated by very few companies - Google, Facebook, and Amazon dominate each of the channels in the US - who sell their ad space themselves, leaving only crumbs for third party ad sellers. See Competitor Detail.Yes, the market is huge, but large parts of it are controlled by the companies that sell ads on their own pages.Opportunities (External)The spend for search, social, and shopping ad spends is still growing. These are the three types of ads Marin sells. Shopping ads, in particular, are on the rise. Amazon's ad business grew 45% from 3Q2018 to 3Q2019.The market is promiscuous. There is not much of a barrier for campaign managers to switch from one platform to another, or to use two platforms, compared to (for example) a company switching to new accounting software. This is bad for established players, but good for new players, or players knocked down and trying to come back. An ad platform can come up with a better mousetrap today and be an industry leader in a very few years.Threats (External)The main suppliers of search, social, and shopping ads are also the main sellers. Google, Facebook, and Amazon supply the inventory that Marin sells, but those companies also compete with Marin for customers. This creates channel conflict - it's hard to compete when a competitor controls not only the pricing and availability of your inventory but is also trying to sell that inventory to your customers. Even if the big channels play nice, it is still a feature race between their buying platforms and any third-party platform, and the big players have much bigger R&D budgets and inside knowledge.Strengths (Internal)The tech is pretty good. MarinOne gets favorable reviews on the www.G2.com software review site compared to other ad platforms. As of mid-October 2019, it scored 3.9 out of 5.0, trailing The Trade Desk's 4.4 and Kenshoo's 4.0. We think this is a good score for a new platform, given new-release bugs and rough spots that can be fixed.Google and Marin have a deal. In a three-year agreement (See 10-Q, ending June 30, 2019), Google is paying Marin a percentage of the ad spend Google receives through MarinOne. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 (see 10-Q, ending September 30, 2019) Marin recognized $3,026,000 and $8,988,000 respectively, including $45,000 related to performance obligations satisfied in previous periods. Marin expects to recognize revenues totaling approximately $2,980,000 for the remaining three months of 2019, and $8,940,000 for the year ending December 31, 2020. This deal is basically just a sales commission on top of Marin's margin, and it won't save Marin, but it does suggest how Marin might work profitably with the big platforms in the future.Weaknesses (Internal)The company doesn't do display. Marin only sells search, social, and shopping ads. It doesn't sell display ads. This was a fundamental flaw in its strategy from the outset. Google, Facebook, and Amazon control most of the inventory and the sales in those channels, and that's a tough trio of competitors. Display, on the other hand, having millions of sources of inventory, doesn't have one big gorilla both owning the inventory and the sales channel. This is important. The two largest third-party ad platforms, MediaMath and The Trade Desk, put the emphasis on display and not on search and social, and their annual sales are $600 million (estimated) and $604 million, respectively, compared to Marin's roughly $53 million. The Trade Desk, which started after Marin was founded, and whose buying platform is rated only slightly better, has a market cap of $13.27 billion compared to Marin's $9.28 million.The company embraced a clever but wrong premise. Marin touts itself as the ""cross-platform paradigm for search, social, and ecommerce."" It's an attractive value proposition. The problem is that the cross-platform promise doesn't mean much in search, social, or shopping (ecommerce) ads because there is one dominant channel in each (again, Google, Facebook, and Amazon in the US). Ironically, Marin's premise makes a lot of sense in display advertising, which has millions of inventory sources and thousands of distribution channels.The company has not been able to refocus. When sales started to slide after the IPO, the company did not rethink its market position or its value proposition. Instead, it pushed harder doing the same thing. It put big money into R&D to build better versions of the same products, fiddled with revenue models, dropped smaller clients to focus on larger clients, changed CEOs, changed back to the original CEO, and then spent more big money on R&D (about $100 million on MarinOne). All the while still clinging to search, social, and shopping ads and ignoring display. Sales have continued their steady slide.Leadership is exhausted and the board is ineffective. From all accounts, senior leadership is very smart and has acted ethically, but it has been unable to turn the ship around in six and a half years of trying. The board has not taken effective action in all this time, watching the company's stock decline steadily from a high of $119.24 on March 26, 2013, to $1.40. There is no rational argument to let the status quo remain. See People.The employees have lost faith. The online chatter from Marin's employees (Accord monitors the hiring sites and forums for chatter about its portfolio companies) is very negative. When MarinOne failed to improve sales, the employees concluded that current leadership could no longer steer the business. The employees fear more cost-saving cuts are coming (that is rational), those employees with better offers are leaving, and the company can't acquire enough good new talent. Comparably.com, a site on which employees rate management, give the Marin executive team, based on 12 ratings, an ""…F or 45/100. …. in the Bottom 5% of other companies in San Francisco and Bottom 5% of other companies in the US that also have 501-1,000 Employees.""The company is undercapitalized. Marin is hoarding cash and cutting costs intelligently, but a company cannot save its way to growth, and it is down to under $12 million in cash - which includes the proceeds from its recent sale of an adjunct product, Perfect Audience. It is hard to see how the company can raise significant new capital with a market cap of $9.30 million without obliterating its current shareholders. See Capitalization Table.Marin is in a bad corner of a good market with the wrong plan, declining sales, exhausted leadership, and an ineffective board. It is close to the tipping point of losing too many clients and good employees to survive. But with $53.48 million in TTM revenues (even in decline), there is clearly something there to be saved. If it can be turned around - just stabilized with a reasonable plan for growth - our EVRQ analysis (See Target Price Calculation) suggests the stock should reach $24.In mid-November 2019, Accord Partners' principal, William Urschel, met with Marin's CEO, Chris Lien, and Marin's CFO, Brad Kinnish, with an offer to bring in a team of five ad industry experts to assess the company's position and recommend a plan of action. The experts included Mr. Urschel, and Eric Picard. Mr. Urschel was the founder and CEO of AdECN, the first exchange for display ads, acquired by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in 2007. He later served as a General Manager for Microsoft's Display Ad group. Mr. Picard founded one of the first advertising technology companies back in 1997. He has had senior leadership roles in the ad businesses for Pandora, MediaMath, Traffiq, and Microsoft (he was on the deal teams for seven ad tech acquisitions totaling over $6 billion, and he wrote the advertising inputs for the Microsoft/Yahoo! Deal). Mr. Picard has also served on the board and executive committee of the Interactive Advertising Bureau Tech Lab.Mr. Lien declined the offer, expressing confidence in his own plan for the company. Mr. Kinnish resigned two weeks later. The stock has since declined another 27%. Other than Marin selling off a minor product for a little cash, we have not seen any evidence of a plan.On February 13, 2020, Mr. Urschel and Mr. Picard submitted their nominations for two board seats up for election at the next annual meeting. This is a friendly offer to help the company turn itself around with fresh eyes and new human and financial resources.In the meantime, Accord holds a very small position in Marin. We're waiting for Marin's response to our nominations before buying more - or selling off. We advise others to do the same.We will post updates right here as amendments to this profile. Stay tuned.February 27, 2020. Marin held its Q4 2019 earnings call. It was disappointing. Q4 revenue fell 28% to $11.4 million. The company had a non-GAAP operating loss of $2.1 million compared to a loss of $700,000 for the fourth quarter of 2018, even though headcount was reduced from 292 the prior year to 229 this quarter. There was no sign of a new strategy from Mr. Lien, who reiterated his faith in Marin’s current course, explaining, “…our vision remains ahead of many brands and agencies who are not yet ready to make this change. Over time … Marin will be rewarded for its leadership …” We think this is unrealistic and that the board and management need help.________________________All information in this company profile is from Accord Partners' research using public sources, including SEC filings, the company's investor relations department, industry analysts, conversations with company competitors, and public online posts by customers and employees.

4222522,21815,2018-11-15T12:12:06-05:00,"Cash burn has declined considerably in the quarter and is guided to decline some more, giving the company some more time to turn things around.That doesn't take away that the company is in big trouble, enough for us not to recommend the shares.However, there are some hopeful signs in the form of a first pocket of substantial growth.","We are keeping a close eye on Marin Software (MRIN) which is on the ropes, but if it survives, it could be a rather interesting but speculative turn-around play. That it is on the ropes is pretty clear from the following:MRIN Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsMind you, this doesn't yet include the Q3 figures, and there are some slightly encouraging data points in there:But these figures, even if some are less worse than feared, are still bad, and the company is still on the ropes with its future far from assured. The company is still bleeding customer churn in their traditional search and social business.They are nearly done building their new platform, Marin One. Here is what management argued (Q3CC):The value proposition here is that this is a much more sophisticated platform, enabling brands and agencies to gain objective data on their ad spend whilst having access to inventories including the three big publishers Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (FB), and Amazon (AMZN).The point is that the data advertisers get from each of these publishers are optimized for the individual platforms, giving rise to the need for an independent third-party platform which allows comparing the effectiveness of campaigns across these big three publishers. From management on the Q3CC:That value proposition is sound, albeit not unique as it is also one that a much bigger platform like The Trade Desk (TTD) provides its customers (as we argued recently), although we have to state that without independent reviews, it's impossible to tell which one is better at exactly what aspect of this.How much time does management have to steady the ship (which is still veering off course towards the abyss, albeit with reduced speed)? Well, that $2.5M cash burn in Q3 looks promising, and management expects this to narrow further in Q4.Given the fact that they had $14.7M left, they can survive a little longer than we expected, at least until the recovery takes hold if it takes hold.Mind you, the non-GAAP operating loss will still be large in Q4, between $5.4M and $5.9M even as the cash burn is expected to be less than half that. One might wonder what causes that big difference between GAAP and non-GAAP, from the earnings PR:But there is also a substantial, and for our purpose more important difference between the non-GAAP loss and cash burn, with the former at twice the size of the latter. Unfortunately, the company only provides reconciliation between earnings and cash flows for the first nine months, from the 10-Q:In the previous (Q2) 10-Q, accounts receivables stood at $9.768M and it has declined in Q3 to $8.666M, so clients paying up was good for $1.1M of cash flow, but this only explains a part of the supposed gap between cash burn and non-GAAP loss, which was ($4.7M).Apparently, management expects further really substantial improvements in working capital and/or the exercising of options or some other financial activity that brings in cash, otherwise, we are at a loss to explain the large guided difference between non-GAAP operating loss between $5.4M and $5.9M and cash burn lower than $2.5M.So, the company has bought itself more time, but the more important question by far is whether they can survive, that is, whether their new platform can actually revive the company's fortunes.If that question can be answered with yes, then it doesn't matter all that much if they need more time, they could even do a financing if more cash is needed. But they need to prove that they have a viable business that can ultimately sustain itself.Are there any signs that the new platform is encouraging new customers and producing less churn? There are some indications that the platform delivers on its promise (Q3CC):Encouraging, not enough, at least not yet. The company's earnings press release contained a series of items that are supposed to induce confidence (from the earnings PR):Most of these are improvements in the capabilities of the new platform (although one could also argue that they also testify to increased acceptance of partners), but the first is real tangible evidence of at least one category of spend that is increasing and likely the result for revenues coming in above guidance.We do not know from what base it starts (Amazon was already Marin's fastest growing publisher in Q2) and looking at the aggregate numbers, that base couldn't have been large, but at least it's growth in some part.This isn't entirely without importance, as Amazon itself is growing its ad business at a significant rate, so lifting on the back of Amazon could pay dividends here.Management is clearly aware of this as they're even organizing Amazon Advertising webinars for customers and prospective customers and increasing capabilities (Q3CC):It is of course management's job to be optimistic, but here is how they see the future (Q3CC):The shares offer almost something like a binary option, but in the quarter the odds have strengthened at least a little for the people betting on the long side. The ramp in Amazon ad business is perhaps the most promising sign, as the company desperately needs some corner of growth.The cash burn is decreasing, although this seems at least in part the result of improvements in working capital. But whatever the cause, it gives the company some more time before it needs additional capital.The biggest question by far is whether the new platform offers a viable business prospect. There are still serious doubts warranted about this, no matter how slow or rapid the cash burn.But at least there is a nucleus of new growth as the customer churn is very concerning given that the new platform has reached a substantial amount of customers already and is around the corner for the rest.It's not enough for us to give the shares our full backing but if we would be holders we wouldn't sell. If they manage to improve on Q3 in the current quarter and stem the velocity of revenue decline, things could even get interesting.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

This was formally introduced to the market on June 12 this year:We've already discussed the features of this upcoming platform in our previous article, here just a quick summary.The main issue which Marin One is addressing is the fragmentation that makes it difficult to measure ad performance on different publishers, as many publisher, most notably of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (AMZN).These walled gardens don't share APIs and assessing relative effectiveness of campaigns across these platforms is difficult as a result. Here is management on the Q2CC:MarinOne offers:From the PR:Now, they're not the only one to offer this. Apart from in-house solutions by publishers, there is competition from DoubleClick, Adobe Systems, (ADBE) and privately held Kenshoo, but Marin should make a useful addition. They are also introducing a fixed fee pricing model (Q2CC):However, while they officially unveiled the new platform there were some further delays with regard to its actual use (Q2CC):You might also remember from the Q1CC that they already onboarded about 80 customers to MarinOne, representing approximately 44% of Marin's monthly recurring revenue.And this has us quite worried, to be honest. Even with half of their recurring revenues (we assume there was at least some further onboarding of existing clients during Q2) already on the new platform, they are still losing clients left, right and center.The company is taking measures to reduce cost, but this is a running target as revenues also keep declining. The aim is to reduce cost by $10M a year, and in order to achieve this, headcount has been reduced from 433 to 335 in H1 2018; 40% of the remaining employees have technical roles.We assume R&D cost will also decline further now that the MarinOne platform is sort of complete. Costs are declining in dollar terms:MRIN Research and Development Expense (TTM) data by YChartsBut they're not declining nearly enough as revenues are declining faster:Now, this can only have a happy ending if the decline in revenue stops. From the Q2CC:A sympathetic view would argue that as the declining bits become smaller and the growing bits bigger, the decline should taper, and perhaps even reverse at some point.It doesn't look like we're anywhere near that point as Q3 revenue guidance again implies a substantial sequential decline in revenues from $14.3M in Q2 to $12.3M-$12.8M in Q3.Operating losses are not declining either, guided at $6.2M-$6.7M, from a loss of $6.2M in Q2 which was itself a considerable increase from the operating loss of $4.7M in Q2 2017. How long can they hold out?Cash flows have been deteriorating rapidly, despite the cost cutting. From the Q2 10-Q:The company still had $17.2M in cash and cash equivalents, burning through $6.1M in Q2. In fact, that cash is almost as much as the market cap of the company, which tells you what investors think. Cash flows have been decreasing steadily with no turnaround in sight.MRIN Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsWhile Marin looks like an interesting turnaround with a potentially valuable SaaS platform which helps clients bridge the balkanisation of the ad world into different walled gardens, it's in dire straits, and there is little to suggest a turnaround is actually imminent.The situation has deteriorated from the last time we wrote about the company, with half of the revenue (probably more) already coming from their new platform which should be their new growth engine. There is little sign this has made a material difference as churn continues unabated.True, the MarinOne platform is not yet open to all existing and new customers, and that will take until the end of the year. It's also true that the company has some growing parts and still has cash for another two to three quarters.The company could possibly get some additional finance to extent that if there are some signs that their strategy is actually starting to work.But given the state of affairs today, we can't recommend the shares, no matter how cheap they are, unless you really like to gamble and are not worried about the money put in. The shares are basically far out of the money options, right now.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks."

4162816,40251,2018-04-13T07:15:45-04:00,"MRIN has reached all-time lows in the market.  It is dirt cheap.
        They're in the final stages of beta testing their cross-platform marketing software, which they've spent about $100 million developing the past four years and already sell to big name customers.
        The market cap is $38 million against net current assets of $24.5 million.  This understates the value of their R&D and software which is not reflected on the balance sheet.
        An acquiring company could consolidate and eliminate most of the operating expenses.  If that happened, their owner earnings could be positive $42M instead of the current annual loss of $30M.
        MRIN has two potential catalysts.  Their turnaround could take off and grow revenue again, or they can be acquired.","Marin Software (MRIN) has fallen to all-time lows and presents an amazing opportunity for substantial capital gains. It's a growth play, turn around, potential merger target, and value opportunity rolled into one. Quite frankly, it's cheap and I believe the rewards outweigh the risks.MRIN is a Software as a Service (Saas) provider that enables cross-channel advertising management. For example, many companies might advertise on both Facebook and Google. Without a SaaS solution that Marin provides, they have to track each platform individually through each publisher's software ecosystem. Since many companies advertise in diverse ways, this lack of consolidation makes tracking their advertising effectiveness cumbersome and difficult. Enter Marin's SaaS platform, and now their customers can collate all separate datasets onto a single platform and compare everything holistically.MRIN ran into trouble despite their added value, innovative solutions, and impressive early growth. Observe the following trend since its IPO in March 2013. It looks like a five-year airplane landing.Marin Software's Share PricesWhat happened? It was a combination of slowing revenue growth (at first), followed by actual revenue declines, and then significantly greater R&D expenses. That's death nail for an expensive post-IPO stock that sold for over $100 per share (split adjusted). It now sells for $6.70 and has a paltry market cap of $38 million.Let's look at annual revenue and R&D expenses in the following table. The data was taken from the annual 10K's.MRIN's revenue topped in 2015 and the substantial increase in R&D after the IPO hints where the problem was.The Changing Strategy And Mr. Market's WrathThe company switched strategies not long after the IPO. It changed from a niche player in search advertisement to full-on cross channel advertisement solutions combining search, display, and social media. Why? Management perceived the old strategy as quickly reaching obsolescence along with increasing competition in the industry. The new model, which consolidates all advertisement tracking, would place them in a unique position and enable a stronger competitive advantage.This was not an easy thing to do. Normally, post-IPO companies already have the business model in place. They give priority to revenue growth and scaling, which involves heavy spending on sales and marketing. Well, that's not what MRIN did. They didn't behave like a ""good IPO"" because they reduced sales and marketing in order to increase R&D. Observe the R&D increase and the Sales and Marketing decrease starting in 2014.In short, MRIN gave greater priority to switching strategies and allowed their sales growth to stagnate and reverse while they were transitioning. This obviously crashed their share prices. Wall Street fixates on top line growth and it punishes all who disobey. However, that doesn't mean MRIN's management was wrong to do this. Good business decisions are often times difficult when dealing with impatient shareholders who want to see immediate quarterly results. Sometimes managers need to focus on the longer term.This transition began around early 2014. It was expensive and complex as the annual R&D expenses indicate. Ex-CEO David Yovanno explained some of its aspects in the Q1 2016 quarterly conference call:Now, with the original CEO returned (Chris Lien), MRIN is in the beta phase of their new and completed Marin software application and all the underlying infrastructure in place. They are fixated on growing sales again. Will MRIN return to growth with their superior cross-channel advertising platform that they spent over $100 million developing since 2014? It's a risk but I think they're in a great competitive position with a unique product offering. And the share prices are dirt cheap from a fundamental perspective, but that takes some digging to see...Seeing Through The Financial StatementsLet's look at net losses since the IPO. They don't look pretty upon a superficial glance.For the old school value investors, remember that this is tech startup. They usually go public with net losses and get valued on future expected earnings after they've scaled and grown into profitability. It's a concept that value investors often reject and they're not comfortable investing here. But let's continue because this situation is very interesting, even to value investors. Since revenues are shrinking and the company is losing about $30 million annually, that ""theoretically"" places future expected values at zero. It explains the drop from $100 per share to $6.70. But that isn't what's interesting. It's merely the cause of the opportunity.Let's take a step back and look at MRIN's owner earnings. This usually gets defined as:Net Income + Depreciation and Amortization - Maintenance CAPEXHowever, MRIN's capital expenditures are nil (it's a software company) and most of their ""maintenance"" goes into R&D, which is already expensed and included in net income.In MRIN's case, owner earnings is better defined as:Net Income + Depreciation, Amortization, and ImpairmentThese numbers are taken from the statement of cash flows. Let's see how it fared over time.MRIN's management has kept real losses below $20 million since 2015. That is impressive considering the shrinking sales/marketing and revenue combined with the transition in their software and increased R&D expenses. Losses aren't what they seem. And it gets better.Let's look at the operational expenses in greater detail.R&D hovers around $28 million annually since 2014. We know that before the IPO and the transition to cross-platform advertisement, MRIN was spending about half that amount or less (please see the above table). So R&D expenses are likely to be overstated by $14 million or more on an annual basis.Adjust 2017 owner earnings of ($17.3M) by adding a temporary $14M in excess R&D. That takes losses down to ($3.3M). But it continues to get better.If MRIN was acquired by another company in the same industry, they absorb MRIN's technology and customers but the R&D does not increase significantly. In other words, MRIN's R&D goes away from the perspective of the acquiring company, which reduces expenses by roughly $26.6 million, annually, which was MRIN's 2017 R&D expense. That would increase their owner earnings to a positive $9.3 million. But we're not finished.An acquiring company would also cut MRIN's sales, marketing, and G&A significantly. It would all get consolidated into the buyer's expenses. So these expenses also go away by 75% or so. In 2017, that would have reduced MRIN's expenses by $32.5 million [75% x ($26.9M + $16.4M)]. Add that to the previously calculated $9.3M in owner earnings, and we're left with a final calculation of $41.8M in owner earnings! That is the true value to an acquiring company, assuming they can reduce sales, marketing, and G&A by 75% and eliminate the entire R&D bill.I'll reproduce the calculation in the table below.If MRIN was acquired by or merged with a similar company, it would currently yield $41.8M in owner's earnings!What would another company be willing to pay for these owner earnings? It could be double today's market cap and maybe more. Also note that the current share float of 2.73 million is less than half the 5.65 million shares outstanding, and the average trading volume is 11.5K shares per day. It doesn't take a lot of buying to drive prices up quickly. It would be difficult to acquire a big portion of the market cap in open trading, which adds to the likelihood of a larger acquisition premium. MRIN is significantly undervalued from a private valuation perspective and a private offer is the most feasible method to obtain it.Yes, revenue is shrinking for now. However, they're also in the middle of a turnaround effort with a unique product that they've spent $100M to develop since 2014. R&D is always reflected as an expense and never as an asset. But that $100M didn't just evaporate. It created a product that has economic value and does not show up on the balance sheet.Let's have a discussion about the balance sheet. It brings my point home.Currently, MRIN has $45.1M in current assets as of Q4 2017. Subtract its total liabilities of $20.6M and we're left with $24.5M in net current assets! The current market cap is only $38 million and it makes MRIN almost a net-net. However, I still consider it a deep value opportunity because of the $41.8M annualized owner earnings that an acquiring company could create through merging their operations. Finally, the $24.5M in net current assets do not reflect the $100M in R&D spent in the last 4 years, nor the value of their proprietary cross-platform software and supporting infrastructure that came about from that R&D. All things considered, this is a deep value opportunity.A Plethora of Investing Styles Rolled Into OneMRIN is significantly undervalued on a price-to-book, price to net assets, and price to adjusted owner earnings basis. This makes MRIN a deep value opportunity. But it's also a turnaround play, a growth company, and a potential acquisition target.How is this a growth play when revenue is shrinking? Because they're in the final stages of their transition to a full, cross-platform marketing SaaS service. Their strategy going forward is less focused on R&D and much more toward sales and marketing. If growth takes off, share prices are set to explode upward. I think there is a high probability to double our money here, and a smaller possibility to see three to five times capital appreciation if the new software platform gains sales growth momentum. This should take about nine to twelve months, as hinted by the CEO in the most recent quarterly conference call:It's also possible that someone would try to acquire MRIN before the transition completes, as hinted in another recent SA article showcasing insider buying by ESW Capital. ESW Capital built their position to 13% of all outstanding shares of MRIN at the time of the article in September, 2017. They continued buying afterward and their most recent filing shows them owning closer to 14%. Their last purchases in October were at $14 per share, more than double today's prices.There is the risk that growth never materializes because their competitors have grown too strong. However, this is mitigated by MRIN's potential as an acquisition target. Those same competitors could buy MRIN without batting an eye. It's too cheap right now.I believe that the rewards outweigh the risk of ruin, and MRIN has a positive expected return if you take the speculation at today's share prices. However, this is a microcap and the share prices are volatile. As always, I risk small portions of my portfolio on things like this. Too much concentration is risky.Thanks for reading.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks."
4177924,21815,2018-05-29T16:49:59-04:00,"The company has been bleeding customers and cash for quite some time.There are some signs there is a potential for slowing this, but too little to get excited about.The big improvement should come from their new platform, Marin One, which is about to launch commercially in June. Existing customers are already transitioning.Whilst a number of arguments can be made to expect a turnaround because of Marin One, there are, as of yet, few actual signs, so this is certainly not for the faint of heart.Investors with a nervous disposition should wait for signs of a turnaround materializing.","If you like to gamble, here is one stock to bet on, Marin Software (MRIN). At first sight, this seems a scary bet:In essence, this is a simple story. The IPO money has been used to finance the construction of a new SaaS advertising platform, Platform Beta or Marin One as their old business isn't growing or has been profitable, and hasn't for quite some time.The old business (mainly managing ads on search and social media) is simply one that is bleeding customers and cash, producing a series of operating losses worsened by the investments in the new platform.There are basically two important questions for investors to ponder here:The first of these is the most important of the two by some distance, of course. If it is a viable business, the company could get financing from somewhere even if the company should run out of cash, albeit this would likely be at the expense of existing holders, even if the company has no significant debt on the books.In principle, the company should have a number of considerable tailwinds for its new platform, Marin One:These trends produce advertisers with a fragmented world in need of consolidation. Marin One offers such consolidation with three services:One argument for the consolidation around a platform like Marin One is that it enables managing advertising across increasing fragmentation, and this fragmentation included walled gardens like those of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (FB), and Amazon (AMZN).These walled gardens are not cooperating and unlikely to do so in the future, which makes it difficult to measure the relative performance of campaigns that uses these platforms. Here is SA contributor Trending Value explaining the problem:Or management (Q1CC):The company does work with these big walled gardens. Management even argued that their support for Amazon advertising was a key reason for a pharmaceutical company to renew its contract with Marin. They're also working with Google. From the Q1CC:On paper, all this looks promising, although one should not forget there is competition here in the form of Google's DoubleClick, Adobe Systems (ADBE), and privately held Kenshoo, and it's likely quite a few big companies have developed in-house solutions to manage their digital advertising.For the non-specialist, it's near impossible to gauge the relative strength of these offerings. What is sure is that much of Marin's existing businesses are not up to scratch, given the decline in sales and customers in a growing market.So, we are looking for signs which could give the investors some hope:One of course is the sheer amount of money the company has sunk into developing Marin One, but this is of course no guarantee for anything:MRIN Research and Development Expense (TTM) data by YChartsWhat could bolster the confidence of at least some investors is the return of the old CEO and Founder Cris Lien and Co-Founder Wister Walcott in August 2016.This new management expects revenue to start growing again in the second half of the year after Marin One is officially launched in Q2 even if this is six months behind earlier projections.That delay in itself isn't terribly worrying. Big complex projects like this have a habit of getting delayed, but are there any signs that uptake could actually materialize?Well, the company has already shifted customers to the beta version of Marin One, and assuming the new platform is a substantially enhanced offering, one is inclined to argue this will at least slow the churn. Here is management (Q1CC):This might sound reassuring. However, despite the fact that transition to Marin One is already in progress, revenues and losses have continued in Q1 and are guided to continue unabated in Q2 as well.It's difficult to assess how worrying this is as there is no information on whether this transition involves any new billing, or if so, how substantial that is.The seriousness of this also depends, to some extent, on the relative size of the recurring revenues, but, given the SaaS business model, this is likely to be a large part of revenues. Indeed, from the Q1 10-Q filing:So, given that the transition to Marin One is already underway even before its official commercial launch, investors need to start seeing this reflected in the company's financial performance in earnest when the new cycle of billings start with these transitioned customers, that is from Q1 2019 onwards.But we would argue that, given the commercial launch at the end of Q2, we would like to see improvements before Q1 2019 already. A continuing slide in revenue and losses in the second half of the year would make us uncomfortable. At the minimum, we would require a slowdown of that slide in H2 2018.How much time does the company have to turn this around? Well, the cash bleed was $5.6M this quarter, and that sounds a little alarming, but it was worse due to annual bonus payments and $900K in severance pay. On the other hand, changes in working capital helped to stem the cash loss, and that's probably also not repeatable.The company still has $23.3M in cash and cash equivalents, so on the count of Q1 cash bleed, they have a little more than a year. But there are perhaps a few forces that can reduce the cash outflow:A bit of a wildcard is whether the company can slow down the churn in their existing businesses. These are three:So, apart from what Marin One will do, there are some green shoots here, and one should perhaps not forget the obvious fact that declining parts become less important over time and growing parts become more important.So, if this is a trend, this could actually slow the bleeding and extend the time the company has to make Marin One into a success. Is any of that visible in the Q2 guidance? From the Q1CC:For reference, Q1 revenue was $15.4M with a non-GAAP operating loss of $6M, so things are still spiraling downward in Q2, which isn't all that encouraging, we have to say.With commercial success of Marin One uncertain and existing businesses still declining and bleeding cash, the bet for shareholders seems entirely binary. Is there any residual value that softens the picture here?Well, one could argue that the company could be an attractive takeover candidate:The valuation of the company is really depressed:MRIN EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsOf course, this 0.16 EV/S multiple depends to a large extent on the cash balance, which is disappearing at a substantial rate. But even the sales multiple is a very low 0.46 times sales, the result of its abject performance.Of course, should the new Marin One platform not deliver the success management expects, the first two items (valuation and cash balance) will mean little, and the company won't have a good negotiating position, so shareholders should perhaps not expect too much from this front.But there are those that do, like SA contributor Trending Value who argued an acquiring company can do away with much of the R&D and S&M spending, as well as the depreciation, amortization, impairment ($14.2M in 2017). We're not entirely sold on this argument and refer to the article for rationale.Apart from the possibility of a suitor, there are a few other straws that investors can hang onto:From FinViz:At present, this looks like a binary investment proposition as too little information about the prospects for Marin One can be gauged (at least not by us).While the company has at least a year and probably longer to stop the rot and make Marin One into a success, this success is far from guaranteed.On the other hand, as the company has no debt to speak off, the residual value is above zero. So, investors are unlikely to be wiped out completely in the case of failure.There is also some other stuff to hang onto, like the growth in social and especially cross-channel search and social were up. Insiders aren't fleeing and have in fact been buying not all that long ago.And should Marin One managed to stop the churn, let alone turn it around and gain new customers, the upside of the stock, given the extremely depressed valuation, is likely to be large, perhaps even very large.So, we would advise two sets of investors to take positions here. First, the ones who are better able to judge the capabilities of Marin One versus the competition, like clients or industry insiders.The second type of investors are those that can tolerate losing most of their money to get a shot at a potential multi-bagger.For the rest of us, we would wait until there are the first signs of a slowdown in churn in the second half of 2018. Q3 figures and guidance will be pretty crucial, in our view.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks."

Admittedly, I had given up on ailing ad-management software provider Marin Software (MRIN) a long time ago. The company's legacy business had been shrinking for many quarters in a row with revenues cut in half from 2015 peak levels and the new SAAS platform MarinOne still not rolled out with customers.Picture: MarinOne Strategy - Source: Company WebsiteIn addition, the company has used substantial amounts of cash over the course of 2018, leaving it with only $13.4 million in unrestricted cash at the end of Q3. While the company has recently taken measures to reduce cash burn, the ongoing meltdown of its legacy customer base is expected to cause further cash outflows in the near term.While the company carries no long-term debt, raising additional funds without substantially diluting equityholders would have been difficult for Marin Software with the market capitalization down to a measly $16.5 million as of the close of Monday's trading session.While management remained upbeat about the upcoming rollout of the new MarinOne platform on the company's Q3 conference call and projected improving trends in new business generation and customer retention over the first half of 2019, the near-term outlook remained cloudy with initial Q4 revenue expectations of just $11.6-12.1 million, down almost 35% on a year-over-year basis.But basically out of nowhere, after the close of Monday's sesssion, the company announced a three-year revenue sharing agreement with Google LLC, a division of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), effective October 1 and raised Q4 top- and bottom line guidance substantially:In essence, Marin Software will get a potentially material revenue and earnings boost from the agreement (as already evidenced by the substantially raised Q4 guidance) but will be required to reinvest some of the proceeds and even some of its own funds into the ""growth, development, innovation and expansion of the company’s enterprise tech business"" going forward.Given the reinvestment requirement, cash flow relieve might be limited but the agreement is nevertheless a highly surprising and substantially positive development for the company that might actually help Marin Software to either obtain a credit facility or raise new equity at levels substantially above Monday's closing price, this way allieviating potential liquidity concerns.Coupled with expectations for substantial progress with the new MarinOne platform in the first half of next year, already left-for-dead Marin Software might soon be ready to make an unexpected comeback. Should the company indeed manage to show improving business trends in early 2019, upside could be substantial. Until Monday's announcement the company was trading just slightly above cash levels but given the large boost to Q4 revenue expectations from the Google agreement, I would expect a major momentum rally in the shares on Tuesday, particularly in light of the company's low share count of just 5.8 million.That said, while the shares might be an interesting trading vehicle going forward, I would urge long-term investors to wait for management to provide further details on the agreement and their financial expectations for 2019 before committing new money here.A surprise revenue sharing agreement with Google puts ailing ad-management software provider Marin Software back on the map. Expect a major, momentum-driven rally in the company's shares on Tuesday. Long-term investors should wait for management to further outline the terms of the agreement and provide financial guidance on the company's upcoming Q4 conference call in February.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

4033344,22670,2016-12-29T18:00:00-05:00,"We enter 2017 in a similar position as we did in 1981 - with a pro-growth Republican about to take office and widely expected to cut the capital gains tax.We entered 1981 with a favorable backdrop for equity appreciation. However, the tax cut initiative's introduction into Congress triggered a wave of selling that contributed to a 25% market correction.This article will provide details, strategies, and specific stock selections to take advantage of the 2017's likely outcomes.","Remember the Reagan-era tax cuts? Remember how the stock market ripped during his presidency? Expecting a repeat of that era as the Trump administration kicks off?Think again.One of the biggest mistakes that investors make is comparing one similar-seeming point in time to another. This is one of the reasons why 90% of day traders lose money (the extensive reliance on past patterns to make trading decisions).The lesson is simple - investors should always view each situation for what it is (and not in comparison to something that seemed similar in the past). Sure, the coin may come up heads again but not necessarily for the same reason. In fact, there are usually too many variables to match scenarios closely enough to draw accurate conclusions.As for the coming year, CNBC had a great segment on the differences between 1981 and the situation as we enter 2017.I took particular note of the guest's thoughts on taxes:He stated, admittedly, that the market tripled during the last six years of the Reagan presidency. However, but it did so off of a PE ratio of 8 as opposed to today's 19 (in a tough interest rate environment, no less).Beyond all that, investors should be careful about selling on January 3. Looking back in history, tax cuts have often been retroactive but only to the date when the proposal was introduced in Congress. For example, the 1997 and 2003 tax cuts were retroactive to May. In 1981, the lower capital gains rate was retroactive to June 9.What's worse? Well, by coincidence or otherwise, after the 1981 proposal was introduced into Congress, the market dropped by about 25% over the next 14 months.So How Do We Make Money On This?Quite clearly, investors are anticipating that capital gains tax will be cut next year. Regardless of when that goes into effect next year, why should anyone sell their winners this year and pay higher rates? Along the same lines, why keep your losers until next year when the tax-loss write-off is worth more this year?We've seen this in the recent market action (grinding higher). I'm also seeing it in my Risk/Reward charts. It's been a LONG time since I saw so many stocks at Risk/Reward highs at the same time as seeing so many stocks at Risk/Reward lows. This phenomenon is reminiscent of the Hindenburg Omen. Out of curiosity, I googled the Omen and found that one triggered on December 2.If this plays out the way I suspect, savvy investors might make a ton of money in January by shorting challenged stocks that are near Risk/Reward highs while buying promising stocks that are near Risk/Reward lows. That's always been a good strategy but the tax-cut wild card could take things to a whole new level, possibly starting as early as next week (but possibly delayed until the tax cut initiative is introduced in Congress).Here are a couple of representative examples. I am adding both to my Official 1% Portfolio effective immediately.1. Buy Marin Software (NASDAQ:MRIN)Seeking Alpha is strewn with contributors who have written favorably about MRIN. The latest article did a great job of laying out the company's potential. However, at the time, I felt it premature to sound the ""all-clear"".In fact, I still believe the company has challenges ahead. However, it's closer to regaining momentum than it's been in years. At the same time, the shares are 40% cheaper than they started the year. As a result, three of its financial ratios are now at levels that have traditionally presaged outperformance when occurring simultaneously:Investors can review past Seeking Alpha articles on MRIN to get a good overview. To that body of work, I will add the following:Until recently, MRIN's software offering was 10 years old and in desperate need of renovation. The company has moved its code base from MySQL to a more modern technology stack featuring Apache, Hadoop, etc. The result is a product with faster reporting, higher performance, and more scalability.While upgrading its platform, competitor Kenshoo has flourished. I believe that Kenshoo now has over $6B of ad spend going through its platform, which challenges MRIN's once-dominant position. The company has grown on the strength of its social capabilities, but MRIN's new offering promises to largely close the gap.Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) also competes but has reportedly fallen out of favor. Criteo (NASDAQ:CRTO) has its supporters but allegations of bad faith business operations abound. Other competitors include Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), but they have inherent conflicts of interest (being the Internet's top sellers of ad space).Increasingly, MRIN's comps are not holistic players. The lines between search, social, and display are blurring. This gives MRIN an advantage as it comes out with its re-architected and holistic solution. Having one of the latest and greatest offerings in the market will lend itself to M&A potential. MRIN's platform is a natural fit for traditional marketing platforms (like Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), ADBE, SAP (NYSE:SAP), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL)).Bottom Line: MRIN's transformation could be game changing. At the very least, it is critical to the company's future. There's still more work to do and that work should be expected to take longer than expected. However, the stock is already pricing in a lot of negatives.This situation has been exacerbated by tax selling as investors scramble to take losses ahead of anticipated Trump administration tax cuts (which will devalue capital losses, just as they will be beneficial to capital gains).Again, it's still too early to get too constructive on this name. However, with the stock sitting near risk/reward lows, I believe it makes sense to initiate a Speculative position.2. Short Angie's List (NASDAQ:ANGI)A while back, I shorted Angie's List in my personal account with good success. Since then, I believe its position has only deteriorated, especially relative to the competition, especially Thumbtack (TACK) and HomeAdvisor (with Amazon Home Services (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook, Google AdWords Express, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), and Yelp (NYSE:YELP) all posing competitive threats, as well).It's important to note that ANGI isn't viewed to be the leading player in the market. In September 2015, Thumbtack raised $125 million at a pre-money valuation of $1.18 billion (said to be about 10x revenues). Heavy hitters like Tiger Global Management ponied up funds, lending credibility to this fast-growing company. Thumbtack has over 200,000 active professionals on their platform and continues to operate unprofitably as it focuses on growing market share.Meanwhile, IAC's (NASDAQ:IAC) HomeAdvisor grew 35% in its most recent quarter, posting $133.6M in revenue and $12.8M in operating income. By comparison, ANGI recorded $79.8M of revenue in its most recent quarter and negative $16.8M in net income. Per IAC's 10-Q, HomeAdvisor's revenue increase was ""due primarily to 39% growth at the HomeAdvisor domestic business and 17% growth at the HomeAdvisor international business. HomeAdvisor domestic revenue growth was driven by a 48% increase in Paying SPs and a 27% increase in service requests."" ANGI's ""growth"" was negative 8.3%.It should be noted that ANGI recently restarted its search for strategic alternatives, a process it went through back in October of 2014. It should also be noted that ANGI rebuffed an acquisition bid from IAC last year (at approximately the same valuation as it has today).These things have placed a perceived floor under the shares. However, in the year that has passed, Thumbtack and HomeAdvisor have gotten much stronger, while ANGI has become much weaker. Heightening competition (and the market's preference for freemium-type business models) has forced ANGI to make a risky decision - it has removed its paywall to move from a pure subscription model to a freemium model.Traditionally, such transitions are painful. For example, when a software company moves from an on-premise model to a cloud model, the stock typically suffers until the cloud revenue exceeds the on-premise revenue. More broadly speaking, as long as a company's largest source of revenue is declining, its stock usually follows suit... even if the transition is proceeding with perfect execution.ANGI's execution thus far cannot be construed as ""perfect"". Q3 revenue missed Street estimates by $2.3M while EPS ($-0.28) missed by $0.14. In the process, the company burned $19M (one third of its cash balance). This is one of the key reasons cited for why ANGI has renewed its exploration of strategic alternatives. Thus, one must question whether the company can attract the same level of offer it received last year in the face of such deterioration and turmoil in its business.Despite all of this, the shares are up ~15% since Election Day. This leaves the stock very close to its downward sloping trend line. The stock is also closing in on its 50-week moving average (which, unless shares of ANGI rise sustainably into the low teens, will keep falling for the next two years).In short, with the recent run in the shares, I believe ANGI has become a solid market-hedge short, at the very least. It may be nothing better than a ""market underperformer"" because of its strategic value to acquirers.That being said, I doubt we'll see an exit at anything more than the current valuation. Thus, its ultimate acquisition value only puts a perceived floor under the shares. That won't necessarily keep it from pulling back to its 52-week lows... and if a market downturn hits, all bets are off.Note: Short Interest = 7.5% of float/16 days to cover.Along with these two selections, my company (Pipeline Data, LLC) has been assembling a comprehensive list of ""Trump Trade"" candidates.

3514656,29391,2015-09-16T13:45:21-04:00,"Marketing technology provider MRIN picking up from all-time lows.Current cheap valuation due to continued losses that should end soon.New product developments filtering through sales team, to result in higher revenue.On target to breakeven by year end.","Marin Software (NASDAQ:MRIN) is an unpopular stock right now. From its IPO at $16 in early 2013, it has sunk as low as $3.25. Now it trades at just under $4.Like many tech IPOs, it was hyped, overpriced, then sunk to fair value (or below). I believe Marin Software is currently undervalued.The company has been investing heavily in R&D. These innovations are now filtering down to customers. And the potential market for their software is enormous.The value equationThe company is a very good value and is currently trading at 1.4x 2014 Annual Revenue. If you compare this to Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) another large marketing/sales software provider, CRM is trading at 9x 2014 Annual Revenue. Similarly Marketo (NASDAQ:MKTO) is trading at 8x 2014 revenue.Whereas these bigger companies are in more saturated markets, Marin has the potential for outstanding growth.The nature of Marin's productSearch marketing is becoming more and more complex. I have been involved in online marketing, SEO and have worked with companies that sell this marketing tech into Fortune 500 companies.The internet shopper's value is based on their previous intent to buy, their location, their predicted life-time value, the time of day and many other factors.Traditionally, marketers would place a fixed bid with the search engines for various keywords. And then hoped for the best. Bid prices were low and it was profitable.However now, by having more granular, personal data on customers - automated software can place different bids based on different factors we know about a customer. Bids are higher. And you need a software like Marin's to effectively compete.What this means is a CMO can use software like Marin's to effectively cherry pick the most profitable customers from search engines.Although Marin's products are currently centered on Paid Search, they are adding Social to their offering. The new product SocialMoov will help them optimize bids for their clients on Facebook and Twitter - which as newer ad mediums will be more profitable to clients.How Wall Street views this stock. And why we should view it differently.Traditional tech analysts, and normal investors would look at Marin's stock and go ""Yuk!"". This is a company with a market cap of $142 million, losing $33 million a year.But marketing tech companies are different. For many years they're likely to be unprofitable. Product development, marketing, and sales are expensive.But over time customer costs decline, product quality increases, customer numbers skyrocket and revenue goes through the roof.The nature of product development in marketing techI worked at an excellent email marketing tech startup last year. Three veterans spent 2 years in stealth mode building the product. And since launch they had a completely unrivalled product that got amazing momentum.The problem was in the sales team. It was hard to communicate the value of the product to brands ... because, well, nobody had seen anything like this before. When they had seen it they were awestruck.However, gradually the product gained product-market fit, cut deals with resellers and revenue was growing at 4x per quarter.(Tangent over) But the point is there's always a big delay between product development and full implementation by customers.Marin has recognised this and has spent time and money training sales teams. Marin's CEO said this in the Q2 earnings call:Potential downsideThe real risks investors and Wall Street see in a company like this, is the risk of bankruptcy. In other words, burning through the company's capital before reaching profitability.However the company is aware of this and they're now cutting costs so they can be breaking even.This is a signal to the market that 2016 and beyond should be profitable years, while maintaining growth.Personally, I believe Marin has bottomed out and shouldn't go any lower.Why buy Marin now?I expect to see Marin's stock gradually increase until they have a quarter where they break even. At which point I would expect the stock to rise by a significant amount.Long-term, I believe this is a great stock to be holding as digital advertising spend is set to continually rise. And the need for marketing technology software is only going to get higher."

2731675,25183,2014-12-05T11:03:10-05:00,,"(Editors' Note: This article was submitted in October as an entry in the Harvard/Seeking Alpha Stock-pitching competition held on Nov. 8, 2014).By George Liu, Matt Chen, Wina Huang, Harris Shabbir, and Lion FundInvestment Thesis:Amidst the premium multiples many companies in the technology sector are trading at today, Marin Software is an undiscovered gem with an astounding asymmetric risk/reward profile. Trading at a significant discount to peers, we believe that there have been a few key events affecting the company over the past year that the market has overreacted to. As a result, we feel the market has had a very narrow focused view on the company, and has been ignoring the larger picture. In the larger picture Marin Software has witnessed unprecedented support from venture capital firms and exhibited high revenue retention rates, both indicators of its continued operating strength. Most notably, Marin Software’s acquisition of Perfect Audience in June 2014 and its partnership with Yandex in September 2014 will allow the company to simultaneously expand its geographic standing and its product offerings. This dual focus will allow the company to extensively increase its market share, and thereby improve shareholder value. We have a one year price target of $14.91, providing an upside of 70.99%.Company History: Marin Software is a leading provider of software for managing digital advertising spend that works with 23% of Fortune 500 companies. The Company was founded in April, 2006 by Christopher Lien, Wister Walcott, and Joseph Chang, who currently serve as Executive Chairman,  Executive Vice President of Products and Professional Services, and Chief Technology Officer respectively. Following his work at an online ad firm in 2005, Lien realized the lack of viable software to help search advertisers manage their online campaigns. Marin Search Marketer debuted in April 2007, and the Company has since expanded operations in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Marin Software went public on March 22, 2013 at $14 per share, with the IPO raising a total of $105 million at a valuation of $425 million. The Company currently trades on NYSE under the ticker MRIN. In December 2013, the Company’s customers collectively managed $6.0 billion in annualized advertising spend on the Marin platform, a figure nearly equal to the next two competitors combined. Marin Software has achieved 22 consecutive quarters of revenue growth, with revenue in 2013, 2012 and 2011 reaching $77.3 million, $59.6 million and $36.1 million, representing period-over-period growth of 30%, 65% and 90%, respectively. According to 2014 third quarter results, a total of 825 active advertisers utilized the Marin platform globally across a wide range of industries, as compared to 610 in the third quarter of 2013.Industry:Marin Software is a software as a service company that operates in ad tech. With the online ad market growing quickly at a 5-year CAGR of 16% and capturing a larger share of overall ad budgets, Marin is at the forefront of reaping the benefits of the positive trends in this fast-moving category. At the same time, Marin manages less than 5% of global ad spend and still has significant potential to further penetrate the market.The software as a service (SaaS) industry in which Marin operates encompasses companies with a licensing and delivery model that allow users to access software via the internet on a subscription basis. According to Siemer’s 2013 SaaS industry report, 83% of all companies expect to adopt SaaS technology. The SaaS market is expected to grow as the business model rises in popularity and scope, reaching $21.3 billion by 2015. More specifically, bid management software providers have seen growing demand for their products. These providers not only can manage large biddable media programs across search, display, and social media, but also enhance competitor features. In addition, smaller firms have been shown to outperform market giants in the key areas of platform flexibility and vision and focus of vendor leadership. Competitors:Amongst its competitors, Marin is recognized for its superior algorithms, reasonable pricing, demonstrable ROI, rapid innovation, and comprehensive platform. Its competitive offerings such as the ability to autopause and correct campaign errors and its multilanguage interface also make Marin a firm with proven global exposure and greater potential for growth. Public filings and comments from management indicate that Marin Software compares favorably to its peers. Its largest direct competitor is Kenshoo, a private Israel-based company. The company has $3.5bn in advertising spend under management (Marin Software has $6bn), has no presence in the display advertising space (which Marin has due to its Perfect Audience acquisition), and sales between $50m - $100m, yet has plans to IPO at a $750m valuation, according to its CEO Yoav Izhar-Prato. This is another indication that there is a fairly large upside to Marin.Business Model: Marin stands out within the online advertising management industry due to its integrated advertisement management platform and extensive partnerships with major web platforms like Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Baidu and Yandex. Marin’s services are a one stop shop for businesses seeking to manage and optimize their online advertising campaigns, thereby providing a twofold value proposition. Firstly, customers can better manage and view the key performance indicators for their online advertising campaigns through Marin’s customizable dashboard. Marin’s investor relations has noted that customers are extremely satisfied with this feature of Marin’s product. Moreover, Marin’s proprietary predictive bid management technology allows customers to increase return on investment of their cross-platform online advertising campaigns, which has been proven to be widely effective by Marin’s high revenue retention rate over the past 3 years: 97%, 114% and 109% in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, with the projected revenue retention rate in 2014 returning back to over 100%. Marin derives its revenue based on monthly subscription service of subscription plus overage model with minimum commitments and fixed pricing set for each month, where an active advertiser is defined as a customer who generates more than $2,000 of revenue in at least one month during the quarter. While some may argue that this model does not hold the same visibility components of most SaaS companies with pure user subscription models, it nonetheless possesses certain advantages against other AdTech models that either take on inventory, pass through real-time ads and/or recognize revenues on a gross basis. It is important to note that Marin’s business model derives mainly from its cost structure. The monthly subscription cost aims to cover its client onboarding sales and initial investment cost, while additional usage fees can be netted as pure value generated from a particular client. Thus, Marin has been aiming to increase its average contract length per client. Since onboard costs are often fixed costs, a longer contract coupled with high revenue retention rate would imply higher net income generated from a particular client.Product:Marin Software develops and sells an industry-leading digital advertising management platform to advertisers and ad agencies. This platform has two editions: Marin Enterprise for online marketers spending $150,000 per month and greater on biddable media, and Marin Professional for marketers spending less than $150,000 per month on paid search. The major appeal of Marin’s software lies in its ability to create extremely comprehensive profiles of audience segments by combining search intent data, social affinity data, and website behavioral data. Moreover, Marin’s platform increases ROI for marketers through tools such as:● an intuitive dashboard to manage all digital advertising campaigns, allowing marketers to be more efficient in responding to dynamic market trends and giving them an expert overview on ad spend allocation across channels● audience targeting capabilities across Search, Social, and Display ads, allowing marketers to modify bidding strategies in one channel based on interactions in other channels and helps marketers find and target their highest value audiences● data aggregation and analysis tools that enhance audience retargeting capabilities, allowing marketers to follow their audience across the Internet● predictive bidding tools and recommendations that make sure advertisers maximize revenue● automatically generated inventory driven campaigns and bid-to-revenue goals; these tools replace tedious manual calculations by marketers with simple data imports● advanced multi-channel attribution, predictive bidding tools and financial forecasting; these tools allow marketers to optimize their ad campaigns for more revenue.Marin’s platform is widely considered to be the leading digital ad management platform in the industry. It recently won the title of 2014 Best PPC Management Software from the U.S. Search Awards, and has won multiple Best PPC Management Software awards from the European Search Awards and UK Search Awards. It services 23% of the Fortune 500 companies and manages more than $6B in advertising spend across more than 160 countries every year. Marin’s customers are also extremely satisfied with Marin products. Between 2012 and 2013, Marin has successfully increased its average contract length from 10 to 12 months and has recently achieved 14 months for this same figure. This implies that customers are generating more revenue for Marin after the investment heavy onboarding process, thus increasing overall Lifetime Customer Value over Customer Acquisition Cost ratio. Venture Capital Shareholders:Unlike some recent IPOs where VCs have sought the IPO as an opportunity to exit the position and realize their gains, all of Marin’s pre-IPO investors, including Temasek, Benchmark Capital, Focus Ventures and DAG ventures, have remained as shareholders despite the expiration of the lockup period on 9/18/2013. This gives us a sound reason believe that even its original investors believe that there is future value to be unlocked in the company.Management Stabilization:On August 7, Marin plummeted 15% to 52-week lows due to a slight $1.5M revenue guide down of the core business for FY2014. This was because of internal factors pertaining to the abrupt departure of the sales manager, which affected strategic account and agency bookings and the expansion of sales cycles. However, these issues were addressed directly by the CEO who acknowledged “a resulting sales reorganization that will take a couple of quarters to gain traction [were] key … for a resulting organic revenue guidance reduction.” Temporary issues of leadership which have been fixed with restructuring are not an indication of Marin’s products, competitive landscape, or market opportunity.Notably, the new CEO, David Yovanno, brings a wealth of experience to Marin Software. Having held numerous leadership positions at Conversant including executive vice president of sales and marketing, general manager and chief operating officer and served as CEO of Gigya, a high-growth social technology SaaS company based in Silicon Valley, Dave brings significant executive, operating, and digital advertising expertise. In the 2014 third quarter earnings report, Dave propounded Marin’s long-term vision and the steps the company has taken to continue its growth. He also noted confidently, “The Ad Cloud market is large and changing rapidly. We believe that we are the only independent vendor to support the three major components of this market – search, display and social – and are well positioned to capitalize on the evolving needs of advertisers around the globe.” These statements were made alongside a 28% year over year increase in revenues, improved operating margin, and significantly decreased net losses, amongst other metrics supporting management’s projection to reach breakeven EBITDA in the back half of next year. We believe the new CEO has a firm grasp of the ad-tech market and will bring tighter execution and greater TAM expansion. We also note the recent addition of Twitter Executive Daina Middleton to the Marin Software Board of Directors. With more than 20 years of industry experience, Daina is recognized as an expert in the digital marketing space. As head of global business marketing of Twitter, she oversees sales enablement, and prior to Twitter, Daina was CEO of Performics, Publicis Groupe's lead search and performance agency and had over 15 years of experience within Hewlett-Packard's marketing department. As CEO David Yovanno recognizes, “She's been right there at the forefront of the industry as digital marketing has taken on a more prominent role within marketing.” Daina's experience will be invaluable to Marin as it continues to expand upon its cross-channel capabilities and advertising cloud offering.Aggressive Expansion Strategy:Marin continues to pursue an aggressive expansion strategy to ensure its dominance in the ad tech industry. In order to provide its customers with the best platform, Marin has established an unparalleled foothold in fast growing international markets through establishing platform integrations of Baidu, Yahoo Japan, and most recently Yandex, Russia’s largest search engine. These additions allow Marin customers to comprehensively analyze, report, and automate bidding of paid search campaigns on these online services directly within the Marin platform, saving time and improving the financial return of search campaigns. Marin also has corporate offices in Singapore and Shanghai, and its platform is available in local languages.Recently, Marin also acquired Perfect for $23 million. This acquisition added crucial components to Marin’s platform, allowing it to offer customers multi-channel audience buying and retargeting capabilities across platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. This is extremely important because Marin largely specializes in ads in the search market, whereas this acquisition allows it to significantly delve into social and display advertising, thus building the ecosystem which Marin needs to better deliver its value proposition. Following the acquisition of Perfect Audience, the company is in a strategic position to bundle advertising packages and in turn to increase its Average Revenue Per User.M&A Outlook:There have been 882 SaaS M&A deals since 2010 and 151 SaaS deals alone this year, which means we cannot discount the possibility that the company will be acquired. Since it operates in an emerging market and has a sub $1 billion market cap, Marin is an attractive acquisition target for larger software (e.g., Adobe, salesforce.com, Microsoft), hardware (e.g., IBM), internet (e.g., Google, Yahoo!, eBay, Facebook), and advertising/media companies (e.g., Interpublic Group, Omnicom, Publicis, WPP). Marin’s potential as an acquisition target is elaborated upon in a later section. We focused on transactions with disclosed deal multiples and found the ten most relevant transactions to Marin’s business model. The average LTM Sales multiple for this set of transactions is 7.0x. A few select transactions in the advertising space include the acquisition of ExactTarget, a cloud-based marketing platform, by Salesforce.com on July 12, 2013 for $2.5bn, with an LTM Sales multiple of 8.6x and Oracle’s acquisition of Responsys, also a cloud-based marketing platform, on December 20th, 2013 for $1.5bn, with an LTM Sales multiple of 9.1x.Valuation: We valued Marin by implementing a Discounted Cash Flow Analysis (NYSE:DCF). We projected free cash flow for ten years, with a top line compound annual growth rate of 17.20% and a ten-year EBITDA margin of 20%. We applied a 15.0x terminal EV/LTM FCF multiple, which we extracted from the five year average EV/FCF of ten large cap US software companies (we applied a 33% to the 22.72x multiple of the large cap software companies). We assumed Marin would be able to use two thirds of its deferred tax assets due to the NOLs it has incurred since inception. Additionally, we accounted for stock dilution, as it is a technology company which implements stock based compensation. The DCF yields a fair trading price of $13.36, which represents a 53.25% upside to the current trading price of the stock. Assuming there is a 20% chance the company gets acquired with an EV/LTM Sales multiple of 7.0x, the blended price target is $14.91, which represents a 70.99% upside to the stock.Risks:Marin’s business prospects faces two main risks: heavy dependence on API of partners and competition from emerging and existing players in the industry. Firstly, Marin’s business relies on the API access terms provided by partners like Google, Yahoo!, Facebook and Bing, and its growth depends on the strength of its relationship with ad agencies, which require a substantial investment to build. Without access to these APIs, Marin would not be able to utilize its proprietary bidding algorithm to improve return on investments for its customers’ advertisments. While this risk would always be present in Marin’s operations, Marin became Google’s first API partner to support the latest retargeting technology from Google AdWords, remarketing lists for search ads (RLSA) in March 2014. This event mitigates the possibilities that Marin’s partners would terminate Marin’s access to their APIs. Moreover, Marin faces direct and indirect competition from other firms like Kenshoo, IgnitionOne, Adobe, and Google’s Doubleclick. Marin’s direct competitors, Kenshoo and IgnitionOne, though having a significantly smaller market share than Marin, could pose direct threats to Marin’s future domestic and international expansion. Indirect competitors like Adobe and Google’s doubleclick could potentially threaten Marin’s market share through lower pricing: a potential “Price War” from these indirect competitors could weaken Marin’s financial stability. Conclusion:Marin Software has suffered from temporary instability in management, which resulted in a poor fiscal year 2013 and loss of market confidence. We believe that Marin has significant upside potential based on the following reasons: high revenue retention rates and projected revenue retention rate growth, revenue synergies stemming from recent acquisitions, strong partnerships, projected transition into cash flow positive operations, strong VC shareholder support, attractiveness as a potential acquisition target, and position as a market leader in multi-platform advertising management.Disclosure: George Liu, Matt Chen, Wina Huang, and Lion Fund have no positions in MRIN.

EBITDA margins have also come down from 4.2% in Q4'15 to -20.9% more recently in Q2'17.Analysts often look at companies as either thriving, surviving, or dying. Analyzing a company's growth can help distinguish between these stages. Marin Software's deteriorating revenue basis implies that its services are losing demand and/or becoming irrelevant. This helps explain why the stock is down nearly 80% over the last three years.However, it is worth noting that shares have recently begun trading higher as a result of insider activity. There could be further upside for investors if a buyout were around the corner.

In addition, the company reported that the Chief Revenue Officer or more specifically the leader of the sales organization was departing the company. The news appears somewhat mixed for the SaaS company that provides a revenue acquisition platform for advertisers and agencies. The stock continues to trade virtually flat since my initial recommendation last October.The preliminary revenue number exceeds the $22.8 million reported for Q1 '14 and excluding the $300,000 from an acquisition matches the high-end of the previous guidance at $23.3 million. Marin provided the guidance back in early May in the Q1 '14 earnings release when the new CEO started so the executive is off to a solid start. The departure of another executive is concerning after recently hiring David Yovanno as CEO. The sales leader was a founding member of the sales team with eight years of experience at Marin. The executive was undoubtedly connected with the past CEO making this move difficult to analyze.While the market has been difficult for ad tech firms, the news continues to back the original thesis that Marin Software was an extremely undervalued stock. The preliminary Q2 revenue numbers for Marin Software has the company again producing nearly 30% top line growth. With the stock trading at an enterprise value of roughly 2.5x the current revenue forecast, the SaaS provider trades at one of the lowest multiples in the software industry. The growth rate continues to back the original thesis.Disclosure: The author is long MRIN. The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.

2403435,28921,2014-08-08T16:25:41-04:00,"Marin reports record Q2 revenues beating on the top and bottom lines and adding a near record number of new customers for the quarter.Despite a $1.5M full-year revenue guide down, all operating metrics have improved considerably including a YOY gross margin increase to 66% from 61%.The small guide down is an isolated event caused by a key staffing change and acquisition integration which allows investors the opportunity to buy in at historic lows.","On Wednesday after the bell, Marin Software (NASDAQ:MRIN) posted its Q2 report which nailed almost everything other than a slight $1.5M revenue guide down of the core business for FY2014, when taking in to account the expected $2M 2H14 contribution in sales from the recent Perfect Audience acquisition. While this is a little disappointing, it really does not warrant a sell-off, especially one of epic proportions. This is especially true given the extremely strong operational metrics that were illustrated in the report.There really was so much happening behind the scenes at Marin during Q2. Starting with the departure of the sales manager during the quarter to the new CEO taking over the reins, and finishing with the acquisition and integration of Perfect Audience. It was really the perfect storm of events that led to the company effectively dropping the ball on sales execution. As the CEO explained on the call, the deals are still in the channel, just extended out due to poor sales execution. However, this softness is not likely to repeat and ultimately with rapidly growing ad tech companies it is the metrics that matter and these prove that the business fundamentals are as strong as ever.The most important metric that I look at when evaluating an opportunity in this space is gross margin. Marin grew gross margin from 61% to 66% YOY in the quarter. Also, the number of advertisers ballooned up 33% over the same period last year. Revenue was up 31% YOY and 5% sequentially and the net loss came in less than expected. The CFO reiterated that the company expects to be break even by 2H15 and has sufficient cash to meet this goal. Nothing in the long-term plan has changed. In fact, the projected net loss for FY2014 is less than what was originally anticipated. Most importantly, Marin saw a small uptick in its effective take rate in Q2. Metrics like this are vital when evaluating these companies. Strong key metrics is the reason you won't likely see the analysts rushing to downgrade Marin. In fact, I can only find one analyst note on the earnings and it was a reiterated Buy from Stifel Nicolaus. The analyst lowered the price target on the stock from $16 to $14, which still represents a nearly 100% gain from current oversold levels.Furthermore, the key revenue retention metric remained over 100%. This tracks the YOY revenues derived from previous period advertisers and includes growth of spending net of churn. A reading over 100% is phenomenal any way you slice it and is indicative of a very strong and sustainable business model. As the Goldman Sachs analyst on the call pointed out, excluding the net advertisers from the Perfect Audience acquisition, the company added 59 new additions. This represents the second best quarter in company history in relation to this very key metric. Clearly, this $1.5M in the full-year core business guidance is an anomaly. I'm not discounting it completely as it represents about 1.5% of the projected FY2014 revenues, but considering that all the key operating metrics have significantly improved both YOY and sequentially and the net loss is better than expectations, I have to concur with the CEO that it is an isolated incident relating to one-time sales execution and acquisition integration issues that are not likely to repeat.So let's look at what this sell-off does for the value proposition. It is hard to think of any tech company, let alone an SaaS, as a value play. But suddenly this unwarranted sell-off has offered investors an unprecedented opportunity to buy this company for nearly the same valuation as the original venture capital partners paid several years ago. Marin raised $79.5M in 6 rounds of venture capital dating back to 2006. The company further raised an additional $105M just over a year ago in an IPO at a valuation nearly double the current market cap. Adding these numbers together and you are not too far off from the current market value of the company. And remember that this company is not only growing at 25%-30% per year, but firing on all key operational metrics and still on track to become cash flow positive by 2H15.Really this slight FY2014 revenue guide down is simply a small blip on an otherwise impeccable quarter. With all of the recent consolidation in the ad tech space, I believe that Marin is a distinct acquisition target. Companies like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) can plug Marin's industry leading Saas platform in to existing marketing suites and Marin would benefit from the increased operating leverage that an acquisition by a more established entity would provide. Lets not forget that Marin is at the top of the technology pyramid. It is an industry pure play on the fundamental shift to programmatic. That is why the margins are so high and the customer growth and retention is so robust.Like my recent article on Jive Software (NASDAQ:JIVE), which has since moved off the lows, I believe that investment today in Marin stock can represent a 50% short-term gain once the panic dies down. Medium-to-longer term, Marin can very well double or triple in value. Given the strong cash balance and only moderate losses with a clear path to profitability, I'd predict that the bottom is likely in. For this reason the downside risk is negligible from these levels. Marin Software is now my top investment idea. I intend to follow up with a more detailed report that will include a specific acquisition theory that I believe has a very good chance of playing out.Disclosure: The author is long MRIN.

Though their was some initial hesitance in the stock surrounding Q4 guidance, the stock bounced back for a solid rebound following the earnings release. At $9, Marin trades at roughly 50% below the initial IPO price back in early 2013.For Q314, Marin Software reported that revenue surged 28% YoY to $25.7 million. The number was slightly above both analyst estimates and company guidance. EPS came in at a loss of $0.18, providing for a slight improvement over last year and a large $0.06 beat on estimates. Active customer accounts defined as ones that spend $2,000 during a month in the quarter grew over 35% from last year to 825. Compared to actual Q3 results, Q4 guidance was seen in a slightly disappointing light, though the conservative nature of past guidance probably led the stock to rebound from the initial sell off. The company provided mid-point guidance of revenue at $26.0 million and a EPS loss of $0.20. Marin suggests that a foreign exchange headwind will cost them roughly $500,000 in revenue during the quarter. Though dangerous to assume, a similar beat to Q3 guidance would produce an EPS loss of $0.14 in Q4. The CFO was clear that the revenue numbers were very conservative around holiday retail spending due to the volatile and unpredictable nature of digital ad spending over the last half of the quarter.The original investment thesis in the article, ""Marin Software: Getting Ready For Prime Time"", is further enhanced by another strong quarterly report. Marin Software continues to progress towards profits with strong revenue growth in the upper 20% range. Considering the potential for a strong holiday shopping season on the backs of lower energy prices, the guidance provided by the company has plenty of upside from retail clients spending higher amounts on digital advertising to grab shoppers. At an ex-cash valuation of $250 million, Marin is very attractively priced at roughly 2.5x 2014 revenues and only 2.0x 2015 predictions."
2246783,66133,2014-05-30T18:46:35-04:00,"Marin Software has posted outstanding growth over the past few quarters.Costs for acquiring customers are declining, and value of the customers increasing.They are poised to turn the corner toward profitability with strong momentum.","The Nasdaq has had a choppy performance over the past few months after an incredible bull run (which appears poised to continue). Companies operating on the software-as-a-service (SaaS) model felt the brunt of this downturn, and now may be a good entry point for holdings in some of these companies, specifically Marin Software (NASDAQ:MRIN). With its low debt, increasing customer base and lifetime value of customers, and expectation of being at breakeven EBITDA in the second half of 2015, Marin Software has strong upside potential.Business BackgroundMarin Software plays in the digital marketing space, focused on revenue acquisition management for companies via the cloud, providing analytics and optimization across display, social media or mobile ads on the likes of Facebook and Google, among others. They have a business model similar to other SaaS firms, with customers signing a contract for X amount of months, and then billed on usage of the platform. MRIN does have a unique clause in their contracts where they set a minimum they will bill their customers each month (~50% expect average monthly invoice amount), which gives them a good cushion on expected billings.Financials and SaaS MetricsClick to enlarge images.Sources: MRIN's Q1 2014 10Q filing, 2013 10K filing; the graph is my own creation.MRIN's revenue growth has continued to excite, with Q1 2014 reported at $22.8M, up 33% from previous year. That's coupled with a corresponding increase in their ""active customer base"" of up 30% (to 704, up from 584 in Q1 2014), while increasing their gross margin to 63%, up 6.2 points from the previous year with steady, incremental margin expansion in the intervening quarters.However, like many young companies in their sector, they have large operating cost hurdles, posting an $8.1M net loss in Q1, but this too has a strong bright spot when one looks at their customer acquisition cost (CAC) and the lifetime value (LTV) of their customers. MRIN has had to steadily spend less and less on acquiring new customers on a per customer basis, with CAC on a rolling one-year outlook going from ~$278K in Q2 2013 to ~$192K in Q1 2014, down 31% (assuming 70% of sales and marketing spend is on acquiring new customers). Conversely, the LTV of each customer has been increasing over this same time period, from ~$645K in Q2 2013 to ~$697K in Q1 2014, up 8%.Sources: MRIN's 10K, 10Q filings, and previous earnings transcripts; graph is my own creation.So the company is spending $192K to acquire new customers, and receiving over 3x that value in gross margin over its discounted lifetime -- a fantastic ratio for an SaaS company. And it is still trending upward (calculations assuming a 3% yearly churn rate and discount rate at 8.35%).Though it's certainly difficult to tamp down on these types of numbers with the information publicly available, the fundamental growth in customers and revenue, coupled with the increasing gross margins and decreasing growth of operating costs all implies a higher upside than the current price. Customers are clearly happy, as MRIN disclosed their revenue retention rate was above 100% in Q1 of this year (net of churn), while it has historical clocked in at the high 90% area. All this good news, plus the added bonus of steadily increasing the length of their average contract, up from ~12 months in early 2013 to 14 months as of Q1 2014. The company has also reiterated their expectation to be net zero on the EBITDA line in the back half of 2015, which their financials' trends agree with.The positive outlook continues when looking at the balance sheet. MRIN currently holds $96M in cash and only $5.3M in interest-bearing debt as of Q1 2014, thus providing plenty of liquidity for years to come. Deferred revenue is not a huge metric for MRIN in comparison to other SaaS companies, but it still showed healthy growth in Q1 2014, up 27% to $2.1M from Q1 2013.ValuationYou might being thinking, ""All these SaaS-y metrics are sound well and good, but what about classic valuation? Forget this mumbo-jumbo hand waving!"" And one should be delighted to see Marin Software shows substantial valuation upside discounted cash flow analysis, somewhere to the tune of 50%-plus.Making some key assumptions, such as:a price of $14.50-$15.50 is where you end up when discounting the cash flows you'd see, significantly above the low $10s the stock is currently trading at.Source: My model -- for the full model, click here.RisksYou may also be thinking, ""This sounds like a risk-less investment! Where's the fun in investing in emerging cloud-based companies without the risk?"" However, there are certainly items that could be flies in the ointment.My assumption of 25% revenue growth over the next five years is below the 30% they did in 2013, and below the 33% growth they showed in Q1 2014, but they could run into some roadblocks down the road or stronger competition. However, their current roster of customers just broke the mark for $6B of advertising spend under management, up from $4.7B in 2012, so there is certainly plenty of money in the market for MRIN to continue to take on, with only their existing customer base.MRIN could also fail to attain management's commitment to breaking even on EBITDA in the second half of 2015. I don't think this is a huge risk, as gross profit quarter-over-quarter growth has been converging with operating cost quarter-over-quarter growth, but has not consistently overtaken it yet to balance the scales on the operating profit level.Source: MRIN's Q1 2014 10Q filing and 2013 10K filing; graph is my own creation.Management will need to continue this improvement to get themselves back to even on the bottom line in their time frame. However, this cost profile is consistent with what you'd expect to see in a young SaaS company. SaaS companies do not have the luxury of recognizing a huge slog of revenue in the same quarter they spend money to woo their customers, but instead recognize this revenue over the ensuing years the customer is under contract. Thus, they have a delightful backlog of revenue that comes cascading in over the years, with associated costs that are significantly lower as MRIN only needs to maintain the relationship and continue their roll-out of new versions of the platform. With MRIN's continued increase in the value of each acquired customer, and decreasing acquisition costs (as shown above), the risk of MRIN never turning the corner and becoming profitable seems less and less likely.Wrap-UpMarin Software significantly underperformed in 2013 against the major indices, and lost a lot of its value in the Nasdaq sell-off earlier this year, but they have continued to string together robust growth, customer retention and margin expansion while making headway toward becoming a profitable business. This company's financials stack up to a strong upward trend.Disclosure: I am long MRIN. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

As of today, Aug 19, 2014, the company is trading at a share price of $7.78. This translates into an enterprise value of 1.98x LTM revenues. Compared to other SaaS companies, and considering the company’s high growth rates, this valuation is a bargain.The company has recently been downgraded by Goldman Sachs from buy to neutral as well as by TheStreet from hold to sell. However, insiders have been busy purchasing stock for more than $1 million in the last days. In particular, experienced board members and venture capital investors have purchased significant stock.Here on Seeking Alpha, Charles Moscoe posted a positive article on this company, with which I basically agree. In this article I’d like to take an in depth look at two questions:• Why is the market undervaluing the company and what is it missing• What the company’s success factors are and on which risks investors should focusWhy does the market value the company at such a low price?When a company is valued at a low price, there must be a reason. In Marin’s case, there are two apparent reasons. One reason caused the company to trade at a continuous low EV of around 2.4x LTM revenues for quite some time now. The second reason caused the stock to fall more than 10% after the company’s earnings call on 6 August.Let’s have a look the first reason, the rationale for the continuously low valuation.Marin is a SaaS Company, which means that Marin’s offering is not sold as a product but as a service. The revenues, which the company generates from a customer, are distributed across those years, in which the customer pays a subscription fee. However, to generate those future cash flows, the company needs to invest today. Today, Marin is spending huge amounts of cash to acquire customers. Marin needs a significant sales force. Their sales cycle from initial contact to close ranges from one to nine months. It will take a certain time until Marin earns back the investment for the acquisition of that customer. After Marin has earned back its investment on acquiring a customer however, each customer is highly profitable for the company.The negative cash flows that result from this investment in customer acquisition seems to scare investors away. For example, TheStreet downgraded the company on July 30 to ‘sell’, referring to the increase in negative cash flow and low return on equity as a reason. I believe that this is in line with what a large part of the market thinks.Yet, negative cash flow and low return on equity are indicators, which do not take into account the specifics of Marin’s business model. They are lagging indicators, which do not tell us much about a company that invests today’s money in future cash flows. When we analyze this company we should focus on metrics that are more appropriate for a high growth SaaS company, which we will do further down below.Now, next to the continuously low valuation, the company’s valuation dropped after the most recent earnings call as of Aug 7, 2014. This happened because the company recently saw a decline in sales growth rates. As Marin’s CEO, David A. Yovanno, pointed out in the call, they saw some weakness in bookings, some expansion in sales cycles as well as some delays in the productivity ramp up of sales executives in the last quarter. The management team believes that these issues are “self-inflected and not an indication of the market opportunity we are pursuing, our products or competitive landscape”. The team has taken action and is working on sales and operational processes.The key question here is, whether this decline in growth is caused by internal problems or whether the market causes it. Internal problems can be controlled by a good management team, which is in place. The company has both an experienced executive team, as well as an experienced board. External problems however cannot be controlled by management and thus present a bigger risk to investors. It would have a bigger impact on the company, should the slowdown be driven by the market. We will explore the impact, which this could have further down below. In order to do this properly, we should first get a good understanding the business model of the company. If you are already familiar with the business, please feel free to jump to “Metrics”.Value add of Marin’s offeringMarin Software is a Software as a Service company, which benefits from the shift of advertising budgets to digital advertising and from the increasing complexity of the digital advertising space.The digital advertising market is becoming increasingly fragmented. In the past, companies and advertising agencies could focus their efforts on search and display advertising. Today, advertisers who want to target their audience efficiently have to juggle with advertising on several search engines, plus social media platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. This creates complex workflows for the execution of campaigns, and it requires tracking and understanding metrics across many channels and add units.In response to these challenges, MRIN offers three types of solutions for big advertisers:• Marin’s reporting and analytic tools help advertisers measure campaigns across multiple advertising channels• Marin helps advertisers execute their campaigns by automating tasks across multiple advertising channels• It helps them optimize their campaigns for maximum revenue across multiple channelsMarin’s positioning and competitionAs discussed above, MRIN is a fast growing SaaS company, which is investing heavily to acquire a customer base and build leadership in its market space. Due to this high growth and heavy investment, we do not have many reliable historic metrics that could help us determine Marin’s future prospects. The factors, which determine its long-term success, are basically the requirements of its customers and the value that Marin’s offering generates for those customers. Understanding how these customers tick and how they perceive the Marin’s products is therefore key to assessing this business. A number of authenticated reviews are available on Marin’s software. While a limited number of reviews is not representative for a whole market, they do help gain a better understanding of both customer requirements and of Marin’s positioning.CompetitionMarin and Kenshoo seem to be two of the dominant players in the market. Other competitors were only rarely mentioned in the reviews. They include Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE), Double Click (Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)), and Acquiso.The reviews show that the key purchase criteria for products in this market are i) the quality of analysis and reports that if offers and ii) the simplicity of the user interface.The competition seems to be carried out around the simplicity of use of the platforms as well as on its features, which the companies are constantly upgrading. Marin and Kenshoo each seem to have their unique strengths and weaknesses as regards product features. Each player is constantly improves its offering, since this is quite a dynamic market.Customers are positive on Marin. According to the reviews, Marin offers a very intuitive layout, which is easy to customize. Marin’s strength also seems to be the efficient handling of workflows across different channels (e.g. activating campaigns, editing bids, change landing sites or performing analysis). Its customer service and training are also very well received.Entry BarriersThis is a dynamic market where each company is improving its offering all the time. The key players seem to compete head-to-head. Yet thanks to switching costs, there are some protections for existing players. Several reviews mention that transitioning from one supplier to another requires a learning curve. Marin’s platform needs to get integrated into the customer’s business. Also, Marin mentions in its filings, that a sales cycle may take up to nine months, since customers undertake a significant evaluation process. This confirms that the platform is not commodity products. As long as a company does not screw up and a competitor has only a marginally better offering, switching is most likely not worth the effort for customers.The necessity to integrate with third parties offers some additional, while probably minor entry barriers.Marin and its competitors enable customers to use various major advertising platforms and publishers, such as Google or Bing, through one single interface. To develop that offering they need to be integrated with those platforms and publishers. However, as Google and the likes constantly change their APIs, Marin needs to respond quickly to any changes. From the reviews it becomes clear, that major search engines like Google, Yahoo (YHOO) and Bing seem to be working closely with Marin because of Marin’s size. This should enable Marin to implement changes quicker than smaller competitors.MetricsAs explored above, Marin invests today’s cash and human resources to generate future cash flows. This investment is successful, as long as each customer is profitable for the company in the long term. A customer is profitable, when his acquisition costs are lower than the net profit his generates over his entire relationship with the company (customer lifetime value). This means that the longer the customer will stay with the company, the more the company can invest to acquire him. Let’s have a look at both:Customer lifetime value:Understanding the company’s products and customers can help us determine how likely customers are to stay with the company in the long term. The reviews, which were solely positive as well as the above mentioned switching costs ,give us some comfort on that side.Also, Marin provides information on the revenue retention rate, which indicates how profitable an acquired customer is in the long term. The revenue retention rate is calculated by dividing this period’s revenues by prior period’s revenues for all customers that are customers in both periods. While the retention rate fell below 100% in 2013, it was up again above 100% in the last quarter, which is a positive sign.Efficiency of customer acquisition:Detailed figures on customer acquisition cost are not available. However, what I would like to see in such a company is some form of organic growth. That means ideally the sales and marketing cost stay stable or decrease over time while the revenue growth increases due to partial organic adoption by customers. Let’s compare Marin’s year on year revenue growth with the marketing spend as % of revenue from the prior year. While throughout 2011 to 2013 marketing spending as percent of revenue has remained steady, revenue growth has decreased from 89% in FY 2011 to 30% in FY 2013. In the last quarter, we see that quarter on quarter revenue growth rates have stabilized at close to 5%, however this was only due to the acquisition of Perfect Audience. Without the acquisition, quarterly growth rates are down at 3%. While this reduction of growth rates can be somehow natural, it raises questions on whether competition might have increased and/or the market might have become more saturated. A change in the market environment would have implications for the company’s track to reach profitability in 2015.As discussed above, the last earnings call as of Aug 7, 2014 shed some light on these questions. David A. Yovanno has pointed out the weakness in bookings, some expansion in sales cycles as well as some delays in the productivity ramp up of sales executives in the last quarter. Management’s statements in the earnings call, indicating that these are internal problems, are plausible. However we don’t know for sure what caused the slowdown of growth and the extension of sales cycles. I have seen extensions of sales cycles indicate economic uncertainty on the side of customers in other industries. Those uncertainties can result in decreased budgets of customers in the mid term. While Marin generates revenues from subscriptions, customers usually have no or a relatively low fixed monthly fee. The majority of revenues are generated through a variable fee. As a result, Marin’s revenues depend on the spending of advertisers, which is closely linked to the economy. A downturn would affect Marin’s revenues accordingly. It would have an impact on their timeline to break even and on their cash requirements accordingly. Without having first hand access to Marin’s customers it is difficult to build an assessment of this risk. However I believe that the company’s low valuation and its otherwise excellent positioning compensates for this uncertainty if an investor is willing to face some risk.ConclusionMarin is a strongly growing company with a solid value proposition and which seems to be well perceived by its customers. The stock is trading at a bargain valuation right now.As described Marin faces some short-term challenges with a short-term decline of growth rates. If these declines are caused by internal weaknesses in scaling the company, as assumed by management, then there is little reason to be worried. The company has an experienced executive team as well as an experienced board, which is taking action right now. Internal factors are more controllable than external factors. However, as described, this slowdown of growth rates could also be caused by decreasing budgets of customers or by increased competition, which would have a larger impact on the company.As a result, I believe that the company provides an interesting opportunity for any investor who has a either a good inside understanding of the current shape of the advertising space or who is willing to take some risk in return for a good upside opportunity with this undervalued company.Disclosure: none."

This includes a wide variety of stocks from mobile to video ad networks and now a revenue acquisition management (RAM) leader. In the case of Marin Software (NASDAQ:MRIN), the company might fit better in the Software-as-a-service (SAAS) category, though it definitely trades like an ad tech stock.Marin Software provides a leading RAM platform used by advertisers and agencies to manage more than $5 billion in annualized ad spend. The platform allows advertisers to measure, manage, and optimize their digital advertising investments across search, display, social, and mobile channels. Basically it allows marketers to execute the full spectrum of ad spend within one platform that eliminates the complexities of the digital ad world and saves the advertiser time and improves the ad effectiveness. The company claims impressive customers including Microsoft, Hulu, Vistaprint, HSN, and PayChex.The big question from investors is why the stock trades at software industry low multiples though it has compelling growth rates and an industry prime for growth. Is it possible for the stock to double or triple n order to match the multiples of some other recent software IPOs that have similar growth stories?Results ReviewBefore going to far, lets review the highlights from the Q213 report:Q213 Financial Highlights:Q313 and FY13 Financial GuidanceThe interesting part about the quarterly results compared to the stock action has been the relative weakness in the stock after the company beat guidance and raised the yearly guidance. Typically a fast growing stock will soar higher on such results.A couple of potential disappointments for the investment community were the number of active accounts (defined as accounts spending over $2,000 in the quarter) and the negative operating cash flow. The active accounts increased to 584, but the number only increased by 20% over last year. Investors prefer to see fast account growth that leads to accelerated revenue growth. The negative cash flow is disappointing as that is typically the benefit of a software firm that collects revenue up front. Later in the article, more details will be discussed regarding the cash flow scenario with comparable stocks.Market SegmentThe digital advertising market for search, display, social, and mobile is expected to see continued fast growth, as the market moves from television and print ads to online. According to the data from a Marin presentation via Magna Global, the digital ad market should soar to $174 billion by 2015. More importantly, the amount of enterprises with opportunities for spending over $100K per month will jump from 5,500 in 2012 to 8,500 by 2017.In reality, the digital advertising bucket has the potential to grow faster than Magna Global forecasts. The total global advertising market was estimated to have reached $480 billion last year. The success of platforms such as Marin could only encourage a faster migration to digital ad methods that only accounted for 20% of the advertising budgets.Weak Ad Tech SectorThe ad tech sector as a whole remains extremely weak; even though, the results so far don't suggest the weakness is reasonable. Stocks from Millennial Media (NYSE:MM) that operates a mobile ad network to Tremor Video (TRMR) and YuMe (NYSE:YUME) that focus on video ad networks have had negative IPO results. As mentioned in the opening, only Rocket Fuel has done exceptional with a 100% opening day gain. Ironically it took a company with 150% revenue growth to achieve success in the post-IPO trading.An important note worth pointing out is that the difference between reported results and the stock action is like night and day. Millennial Media has been reporting 50% growth while Tremor Video exceeded 40% growth. Clearly, the market is negative on ad tech stocks though it doesn't appear warranted. While Millennial Media has had some issues hitting extreme growth targets, the company is still growing much faster than a stock that should be trading at an enterprise value of 1x forward revenue.The below table highlights how analysts continue to view the growth opportunities for these ad tech stocks as enormous, yet the valuation multiples such as enterprise value to forward revenue is extremely low.Comparable SaaS StocksThe multiple valuation discrepancy gets very large when comparing Marin Software to some other recent software IPOs that have performed exceptionally well. Both ChannelAdvisor (NYSE:ECOM) and Demandware (NYSE:DWRE) match reasonably well with Marin other than the valuation.ChannelAdvisor provides a SaaS solution that enable retailers to integrate, manage and optimize their merchandise sales across numerous online channels including Amazon.com and eBay. The stock has surged to a market value of nearly $800 million and an enterprise value of around $700 million. Similar to Marin, the company is growing around 30% with a revenue base expected to hit $66 million. At that valuation, the stock trades at an enterprise value of over 10x revenue. Gross margins exceed 70% so it does have a slight advantage over the 60% margin generated by Marin. Sales and marketing expenses reached nearly 60% of revenue placing it slightly above the 57% by Marin.Deferred revenue is a slight differentiator providing ChannelAdvisor with more upfront payments. The company has had positive operating cash flow in the first six months of the last two years making the operating losses more sustainable.Demandware provides SaaS e-commerce solutions that enable companies to design, implement, and manage their own customized e-commerce sites. Similar to the other two stocks, the company is growing in the 30% range with gross margins of 72%. Demandware is slightly larger with revenue expected to touch $100 million this year. The stockholders though have been extremely rewarded with a market value of over $1.5 billion. Based on the enterprise value, the stock trades at roughly 14x current year revenue estimate.Investors like that Demandware is operating cash flow positive, thereby allowing customers to fund growth by prepaying for annual subscriptions. The company is under less liquidity stress as cash comes in to match the high level of sales and marketing expenses. Ultimately though, the balance sheet and income statement doesn't care about whether the money is paid upfront or in arrears.The below chart highlights the vast differences in enterprise value multiples:MRIN Price to Sales Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsStock ActionThe below chart probably showcases the difference between the cloud-software stocks and ad tech stocks the best:MRIN data by YChartsWhile the ad tech stocks struggled to gain any traction over the summer, both ChannelAdvisor and Demandware have seen massive gains in that time period. In fact, ChannelAdvisor has surged 114% compared to the best ad tech stock only gaining 25%.RisksThe risks are normal for any tech related stock. A big software provider could enter the space and crush Marin Software. That risk exists with ChannelAdvisor and Demandware so it wouldn't justify the others trading at higher multiples. A fear exists that Google will dominate the digital ad market space, but if anything Marin provides a service that Google can't likely replicate. Marin provides a way to optimize digital ad spending across Google, Facebook, and other platforms. Advertisers would be very unlikely to utilize Google to manage ads on other platforms.Clearing up that risk, the real concern is that the company isn't able to reduce the operating cash flow burn. With a push towards obtaining more upfront payments of minimum contract fees, Marin might be able to quickly eliminate those concerns in the next year. The balance sheet is solid with $120 million in cash after the IPO funds so it has a couple of years to eliminate these concerns before they become legitimate issues.ConclusionThe incredible discrepancy continues to exist between ad tech and other tech stocks though the actual financial results don't showcase any differences. The growth rate of Marin Software is right in line with the other SaaS stocks, yet it has actually seen a loss during the time period the other SaaS stocks have soared. The data suggests that once ad tech stocks obtain more confidence by investors, Marin could easily double and only reach a enterprise value to revenue of half that of Demandware. At a enterprise value of only 8x forward revenues (low end of the comparable stocks), Marin would be worth $870M or $26.75 per share. Investors might not be able to purchase the stock this cheap for much longer.Disclosure: I am long FUEL, MM, MRIN. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1526812,22148,2013-06-28T13:05:03-04:00,,"Any time a stock falls 50% shortly after an IPO one has to wonder if the market isn't offering a bargain now. Currently the IPO process is so subjective to market forces and short-term market momentum that a stock can move 50% in either direction irrationally. Typically the process of deriving the offering price is built for obtaining a reasonable price though it usually leaves money on the table for those buying at that price.In the case of Marin Software (NASDAQ:MRIN), investors at the IPO price haven't seen much to smile about as the stock peaked at nearly $20 on the opening day and has done nothing but drop to $10 in the three months that it has been public.Failed IPOThe company raised $97.3M from its IPO back in March helping increase the cash balance to $115.5M. The offering was priced at $14 with the company selling 7.5M shares. The amount was increased 500K shares above the original plan to offer 7M shares between $11-$13.The stock opened the day at $19 and surged to $19.95 before eventually collapsing and ending the day at the lows of $16.26. The stock held in that range for a couple of weeks before declining to the $14s prior to earnings and below $10 after the report on May 8th. The stock currently trades around $10 or 50% below the all-time high on opening day.The stock reminds us of Millennial Media (MM), another exciting advertising firm that peaked on the offering day to only fizzle over the next year. In both cases, the IPO pricing can be viewed as a failure, but alert investors can now pick up these shares at much cheaper prices.Huge Market OpportunityAccording to Magna Global via the Marin presentation, the global advertising market is set to expand from $480B in 2012 to $619B in 2017. More importantly for Marin is that the digital portion should grow from only $98B to $174B during that time period. Search will remain the primary ad spend bucket, but both mobile and social are expected to grow at CAGR in excess of 20% through 2017.Considering digital advertising will only account for 28% of all advertising dollars spent by 2017 one can assume that plenty of conversions from traditional ads will continue in the decade after. In fact, one expectation should be that at some point the conversion grows to where traditional advertising declines year-over-year. Interactive digital ads and location-based ads using mobile should eventually become more attractive than traditional, immeasurable ad methods.Market LeaderThe company is a next generation firm focused on the Revenue Acquisition Management (RAM) sector. A sector coming into focus as digital advertising becomes more and more complex due to the intersection of mobile and social ads commingling with display and search. This expansion of digital marketing out of search is requiring the development of platforms to allow digital marketers to manage their search, display, social and mobile ad investments on one platform. In addition, the added complexity of the numerous mobile devices and multiple social networks makes a cloud-based technology that applies big data tools as an ideal solution for agencies and marketers to save time and improve efficiency.The below chart highlights the intersection of Marin with other digital players in the ad industry:Marin booked $4.7B of ad spend on its platform for 2012 making it a leader in the sector. The company though still obtains 90% of revenues from search with over 20% of managed media focused on mobile. Considering the limited social and mobile revenue generated currently, the need for a platform such as that of Marin is only starting.Mounting LossesWhile Marin reported results slightly ahead of estimates, the market appears concerned that the mounting losses will eventually lead to cash problems. Though the losses for 2013 are actually lower than expected, it doesn't appear that most investors understood that the loss from operations will reach an incredible $34M. A pace that will quickly eat up the $115M cash balance if not quickly reduced. In addition, the company will still be far from reaching profitability by the end of the year. As well, the growth rate of only 28% probably isn't as fast as investors expected in order to quickly erase those losses.With a market cap of $320M, the stock offers a compelling valuation at these levels where a fast growing cloud software firm only trades at 4x revenues. The key will be the company reducing the $9M quarterly losses to a more reasonable level that provides for sustainable growth without the concerns over a cash crunch as 2014 rolls toward the end. The goal of reaching breakeven in 2015 appears far-fetched with the predicted losses for this year.Unfortunately the public markets aren't as forgiving as the private markets when it comes to short-term cash issues.Other Cloud Software StocksWhile losses are common in the cloud software space, the operating margin typically isn't as negative as Marin. Therefore, the other cloud software stocks are able to maintain higher valuation multiples as investors are able to focus on growth without worrying about an eventual cash crunch.Some examples include Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) that trades at roughly 26x 2013 revenue estimates and Guidewire (NYSE:GWRE) that trades at 8x current year revenues.In the case of Guidewire, it provides internet-based software for core insurance operations with expectations to grow revenue 28% this year. The company though is very profitable eliminating any cash crunch concerns and allowing for the pricey multiples.With Workday, the company isn't profitable, but it holds a cash balance of around $800M and generated free cash flow of $15M for the last quarter. The provider of enterprise cloud applications for human resources and finance benefits from customers prepaying license fees to the current tune of $300M in unearned revenue. Likewise, Marin is pushing direct customers into prepaying monthly minimum fees to some success so far. The ability to generate cash up front could help solve any long-term cash issues.Workday expects revenue to grow up to 80% for the year further supporting higher valuations as the market can more easily overlook losses.On the flip side, fellow advertising IPO failure Millennial Media trades at only 2.5x current year revenue estimates in a sign that Marin could even trade lower. Though Millennial focuses on the mobile ad market that came under significant pressure due to lower rates than expected, the company still expects revenue growth in the 40-50% range over the next couple of years. This level far surpasses Marin's current expectations.Scary Stock ChartWhile picking a bottom in this stock appears interesting, the following chart suggests the stock isn't done declining. When the moving average lines are down sloping investors are usually wise to watch and wait for a better and likely lower entry point.Bottom lineMarin Software has an intriguing product that could see substantial growth over the next 5 to 10 years as advertisers increasingly move to digital formats from traditional media. The stock though is struggling as investors are increasingly concerned with the path to profitability. Revenue growth below 30% is generally concerning to the stock market when the company looses a substantial portion of revenue. While the stock might not be ready for prime time yet, the potential exists for a strong stock in the future.As examples of other cloud software stocks highlight, Marin could see significantly higher prices once it turns the corner on cash flows. Workday might be an extreme example, but Guidewire provides a solid goal for Marin and even Millennial Media as the market becomes more comfortable with these independent leaders in the advertising sector.Disclosure: I am long MM.

1690352,21136,2013-09-12T10:48:19-04:00,,"Marin Software Inc. (NASDAQ:MRIN) stock may be in a precarious position and may present aggressive investors with a shorting opportunity. A number of factors underlie this thesis:LOCK UP EXPIRATIONOn September 18, 2013 the lock up period expires on 23,411,322 shares for Marin Software insiders and major shareholders.These major shareholders include five different venture capital and private equity firms that together hold 13,127,687 shares and the executive officers and directors own 8,507,173. Investment firms are under pressure to return capital to their investors after the drought created by the great recession. The executives and directors may also want to sell some of their shares for diversification reasons. (See also our recent published story on Model D (NYSE:MODN) and Silver Springs Networks (NYSE:SSNI), which provided our readers with good shorting opportunities.)BUSINESSMarin Software offers an online platform to manage revenue acquisition for advertisers and ad agencies, managing over $5 billion per year in ad spend. Its platform handles search, display, social, and mobile advertising in an integrated format. The online advertising market is very competitive and expanding rapidly, having grown some 15.1% over the course of the past year, providing MRIN with many opportunities to expand its operations. MRIN seemingly has taken advantage of those opportunities with an $18.2 million year-over-year increase in revenues (a 30% increase).IPOMarin Software's successful March IPO, in which the company raised $105 million by selling 7.5 million shares and beating its expected price range of $11-$13 with a price of $14, seemed to presage a strong value in the stock. However, a brief honeymoon period during which the stock traded around $20 proved to be a mirage, as the stock plummeted beneath $9 within mere weeks of the IPO after its first quarterly earnings report disappointed its shareholders. It is unusual and a very bad sign for a new public company to miss estimates so soon after an initial public offering especially after it gaps up on the first day. The stock still hovers over 10% below its offering price, which raises the question of what might occur if the company were to have another bad quarter.GOOGLE COMPETITIONSo why has MRIN failed to convince the market of its worth? It suffers from the same problem as every other ad tech company on the market: it must compete with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). Google controls over 40% of the entire online ad industry, and, far worse, is perhaps the most recognizable corporation on the planet. Few investors are willing to bet against Google, and even fewer have done enough research to understand that Marin is actually a beneficiary of Google's success - the Marin platform supports both Google's Product Listing ads and Enhanced Campaigns, along with Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) homepage, mobile, and newsfeed ads. Marin's revenue numbers indicate that its business operations haven't suffered from Google competition, but its dismal stock prices reveal a deep lack of investor confidence.That lack of confidence is likely to continue and even grow worse with recent media coverage on the supposedly crushing competition Google presents. Bloomberg released a devastating report on August 8th detailing Google's dominance of the ad tech market and the recent failures of ad tech IPOs. MRIN had the dubious honor of being mentioned by name, which will no doubt keep its price depressed for as long as potential investors continue to find the article in the course of basic research.MRIN isn't the only stock suffering from this phenomenon; numerous ad tech companies have seen disappointing IPOs in recent months. YuMe Inc. (NYSE:YUME), a video ad company, landed at an offering price of $9, 25% beneath the low end of its $12-$14 expected range in its August IPO. Tremor Video (TRMR), which reported a 40% Q2 revenue increase that blew away expectations, nonetheless suffered an IPO that priced at $10, a dollar beneath the expected range of $11-13. TRMR proceeded to fall as low as $6.81; despite continued strong numbers, the stock still sits at $9.Ad tech companies considering IPOs have pulled them off the table. Exponential Interactive, a parent of the wildly popular Tribal Fusion web ad company, refuses to set an IPO in light of market conditions. Adap.tv, another video ad company, chose to throw in the towel rather than face the brutal ad tech market, accepting a low $405 million offer from AOL, (NYSE:AOL) on August 7th.Disclosure: I am short MRIN.

1296651,24100,2013-03-24T01:00:31-04:00,,"On Friday, Marin Software (NASDAQ:MRIN) completed its oversubscribed IPO at a much higher valuation than expected and with great enthusiasm from the market. Originally planning to sell 7M shares at $11-13, it ended up selling 7.5M shares around $14 and closed at $16 for the day after hitting an intraday high of $19.95. The $16 closing price gives the company a market cap of around $450M and an 8-10X ttm revenue valuation versus market cap.From the Marin Software S1:Mobile advertising is expected to be one of the largest growth segments as noted by this information provided in the S1.Marin Software has been a development stage company since 2006. Revenues have grown from $7.5M in 2009 to $36M in 2011. Revenues for the first 9 months of FY12 were $42M vs. $24M in 2011. Current growth rates were 152% from 2009 to 2010, 90% from 2010 to 2011 and currently 72% in the first 9 months of FY12 compared to FY11. Using 72% as the growth rate for all of FY12 would put revenue estimates at $62M. While this growth is impressive, it does show a slowing trend, and what should really be looked at is how the company is doing to get to a positive bottom line. Looking at earnings, the company has only delivered losses to the bottom line. In fact losses have been increasing as revenues have ramped upward. In FY10 losses amounted to $11.9M on revenue of $19M; in FY11 losses totaled $17.4M on $36M in revenue and it has already lost $19M on $42M in revenue for the first 9 months of FY12. From a recent interview on Techcrunch, breakeven operations are hoped to be reached in 2015.We spoke to Marin CEO Chris Lien after the market closed, and he said the goal of the IPO was to ""raise our profile and raise the profile of our category."" He added that as a public company, it will be ""more of the same"" - Marin has been steadily improving its gross margins by 10 percent annually, and he has ""an aggressive plan for growth,"" with hopes of bringing the company to the breakeven point in 2015.Another area to possibly be concerned with is Intellectual Property. Currently, the company has one patent issued and one patent pending and as mentioned in the S1. IP generation has not been a priority for the company. As has been seen in recent years, Intellectual Property can be very important for a young company. Augme Technologies (AUGT.OB) has sued and successfully settled with AOL (NYSE:AOL) and Pandora Media (NYSE:P) and is working to settle outstanding cases with Millennial Media (NYSE:MM) and Velti (VELT).Two other companies in the digital advertising space are Augme Technologies and Millennial Media. Both of these companies have shown exactly the same growth trajectory as Marin Software and are also planning for robust growth in this year, but the big difference is both plan to be profitable in their current fiscal year. Augme Technologies believes it will break even by the end of its second quarter and Millennial Media is predicting a profitable year.As has been seen in IPOs over the last several years, investors are initially excited by huge revenue growth in explosive growth areas but eventually the focus returns to the bottom line. Growing revenues at the expense of larger losses will only be tolerated for so long before the market decides it has had enough. Marin Software is already selling at a trailing twelve month figure of revenue versus market cap of around 8-10. It is not expecting to break even for at least another 2 years. Augme Technologies is selling at approximately 1.5 ttm revenues and Millennial Media at 3 ttm. Given these facts it would seem like more established companies that are close to making money might be a better bet for stock appreciation.Disclosure: I am long AUGT.OB, MM, VELT.

2054503,60481,2014-02-28T12:33:43-05:00,,"Technical things happen for fundamental reasons.We believe Marin Software (NASDAQ:MRIN) will be materially higher in 12 months. We have a price target of $17, or 3.7x EV/Sales (enterprise value) which is the mid range of EV/Sales 2.8x (currently) vs. other SAAS companies of 4.5x. Comparable valuations are relative, but they only shed light on the opportunity.In our research we do not use valuation as an investment tool. Our ideas are generated by both price and fundamental momentum.Marin seems to be the forgotten name in SaaS (Software as a Service). The company is the leader in Managed Paid Search Advertising.Due to the ""orphan status"" of forgotten names, the valuation relative to the group is significantly less, expressing the ""show me"" status of the institutional investor.Since going public, the company has reported small beat and raise quarters, but nothing that makes estimates go up substantially, therefore the decline in the shares. The company came public a year ago at $14, traded to $20 that day, and closed the week at $16.Shareholders were disappointed expecting better numbers than a small upside to models. The first public quarter report was treated unfavorably and the stock tanked, breaking below the deal price. It finally flushed out and bottomed at $8.50, or 40% below the IPO price into year end tax selling.Execution is everything. Provided that management can fundamentally execute the opportunity in front of them, we believe that revenue growth year over year will re-accelerate to 30%+ (Street consensus ranges from 24-28%) and with that we would expect improved margins.MRIN closed out a strong above consensus 4th quarter as fundamentals returned. After the quarter analyst estimates were raised above previous consensus and the stock responded up 11%. This is the first public quarter report where the stock found upside momentum, combined with a turn in fundamentals and a new large opportunity ahead. This got my attention.The best metrics that the company uses to measure itself are both number of acquired advertisers and the managed spend ad dollars. The number of advertisers at the end of the quarter was 673, up 10% sequentially and 27% year over year. Those 673 advertisers have approximately $6 billion of spending dollars to manage. Sales growth both sequentially and year over year is another metric besides managed spend and ad client acquisition. These are the numbers we will focus on.The company has plans to build out additional sales capacity.

1301861,25120,2013-03-26T15:51:54-04:00,,"On Friday, Marin Software (NASDAQ:MRIN) made its public debut. Shares of the provider of internet advertising services ended their first trading day with gains of 16.1% at $16.26 per share. Shares initially rose to highs of $19.95 at the start of the trading day, but gradually lost terrain to end its opening day with much more modest gains.After a slight correction in Monday, shares have rebounded on Tuesday, currently exchanging around $17 per share.The Public OfferingMarin Software has developed and provides a cloud-based digital advertising platform which helps advertisers to improve their business revenues by providing optimized solutions. Marin's Revenue Acquisition Management platform measures the effectiveness of advertising campaigns and helps to optimize advertising budgets of its clients.Marin Software sold 7.5 million shares for $14 apiece. The company raised $105 million in gross proceeds in the offering, valuing the company at $433 million.The offering has been a great success. The offer price was set above the preliminary $11-$13 price range set by the firm and its bankers. Some 24% of the shares outstanding were offered in the public offering. At Friday's closing price of $16.26, the firm is valued at $502 million. Demand for the shares in the offering was large. As a result, Marin has increased the planned offering size from 7.0 million shares towards 7.5 million shares.The major banks that brought the company public were Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, UBS, Stifel and Wells Fargo.ValuationMarin Software had 531 active customers at the end of 2012 who used the company's platform to manage their online advertising. Combined, these customers spend $4.7 billion in advertising for the year of 2012. According to a research report from Magna Global (which references can be found in the S-1 filing), the global digital advertising market is expected to almost double from $98 billion in 2012, towards $174 billion in 2017.Marin believes that the multi-channel and multi-devices environment will grow demand for its services, in an ever complex growing online world. It therefore becomes more important for advertisers to know their online advertising budgets are well spent.The company reported annual revenues of $59.6 million for the full year of 2012, up 65% compared to the year before. A 76% increase in total operating expenses resulted in widening losses. Net losses widened to $26.5 million.The company raised $105 million in gross proceeds in the offering process. The company will use the public offering to increase access to capital markets and improve the public awareness of the business. The company has not yet specified a direct purpose for the capital being raised, but will most likely use the proceeds to expand the business and to finance losses in the meantime.The company operates with $31.5 million in cash and equivalents and total debt of $10.8 million at the end of 2012. Adding to that roughly $95 million in net proceeds from the offering, and Marin will operate with a net cash position of approximately $115 million.Based on Tuesday's valuation of $523 million, the market values the firm's operating assets around $410 million. This values the firm at 6.9 times 2012's annual revenues.Investment ThesisThe offering of Marin Software has been a great success. Shares were offered above the preliminary offering range, and after witnessing a first-day return of 16%, are trading some 41% above the midpoint of the preliminary offering range.Marin reported fourth quarter revenues of $17.1 million, which is still up 50% compared to the year before. The growth momentum continues, but is slowing down as fourth quarter revenues rose 10% compared to the third quarter.The rapidly growing user base is resulting in a decent diversification of revenue streams among its customers. Yet the company heavily relies on key relationships with publishers include Baidu, Bing, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Yahoo (YHOO), among others. Some of these competitors even offer competitive solutions for their own services, such as Google's ""Adsense"" program.While the company is still reporting growing losses, Marin's public offering has raised enough capital to finance growth in the coming years. The revenue multiples are high, but not extremely high given the still very decent revenue growth rates. Investors will most likely continue to focus on revenue growth rates and improvements in profitability in the short term.The successful public offering has boosted investor expectations for a strong first quarter of 2013. Yet the overall valuation is not that high in comparison to some recent hot technology public offerings. Given the strong public offering and subsequent returns, I would hold off making an investment at this level.Opportunistic investors could buy on significant dips in the $13-$15 range as revenue multiples become acceptable at those levels.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1209731,24394,2013-02-21T04:01:17-05:00,,"It’s a Wall Street fact of life: Initial public offerings (IPOs) follow the broader market. During downturns, IPO activity stalls out. And during rallies, activity heats up. Right on cue, the rip-roaring start to the year for stocks is inspiring an IPO boomlet…Case in point: Last week was the most active week for IPO filings all  year. Six new companies filed plans to go public with the SEC. That’s  just one shy of matching the total number of filings for all of January. Granted, not every IPO is destined for greatness. But there’s one  company in the latest crop of filings that warrants your immediate  attention. And here’s why…Advertising Ultimately Follows Eyeballs…And eyeballs have certainly shifted away from PCs and TVs to smartphones and tablets in a major way. Consider that the average American now spends 127 minutes per day on mobile devices, up 98% since 2010. Sure enough, mobile ad spending is ramping up, too.Venture capital firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, estimates  that mobile advertising could top $20 billion by 2015. In comparison,  last year the total market size checked in at just $3.2 billion,  according to IAB. So any way you slice it, we’re in store for hefty double-digit growth ahead.Eyeballs aren’t enough, though. Just because consumers are spending  more time with their smartphones and tablets doesn’t mean that companies  are going to spend recklessly on mobile advertising.They’re going to want to track their spending closely in order to optimize results. And that’s where Marin Software (NASDAQ:MRIN) comes in…Founded in 2006, the company provides a leading cloud-based digital  advertising platform to help companies “effectively manage their digital  advertising spending across search, display, social and mobile  advertising channels.”Put simply, its software allows customers to measure and understand  which advertisements are producing the best marketing results. And as  mobile advertising continues to ramp up, what company won’t want  on-demand access to that type of intelligence?The question is, however, does Marin’s forthcoming IPO represent a compelling investment? Well, that depends on how it stacks up against the five hallmarks of a hot IPO that we previously identified.So let’s find out…Hot IPO Hallmark #1: Age The first hallmark is all about staying power.You see, the older and more established a company is when it goes  public, the better the stock tends to perform. Logically, it makes  sense. Being able to stay in business proves that the company’s product  isn’t some “flash in the pan” phenomenon.As a rule of thumb, I routinely shun any companies with less than five years of operating history. Based on that, Marin Software passes muster, as it’s entering its seventh year in existence.Hot IPO Hallmark #2: Verifiable Growth OpportunityWhen you invest in an IPO, you’re making a bet on the future growth  of a company. So not only should it be growing now, but it should also  be positioned to keep growing down the road.For Marin, that’s certainly not a problem.The company has increased sales for 14 consecutive quarters (and  counting). Given the multi-billion-dollar size of the mobile advertising  market, I’d say there’s still plenty more growth potential ahead, too.Hot IPO Hallmark #3: RevenueUniversity of Florida professor, Jay Ritter, makes this hallmark cut  and dry. He found that shares of companies with more than $50 million in  sales before they go public perform best in the aftermarket.Companies either meet that requirement, or they don’t.Marin officially makes the cut. Over the last 12 months, the company  generated $53.9 million in sales. By the time it goes public, that  number should be even higher.Hot IPO Hallmark #4: ProfitabilityHistory is instructive when it comes to IPOs, in that roughly 70% to  80% of companies that went public and flopped during the dot-com period  were unprofitable.Keep in mind, that doesn’t mean we should ignore unprofitable  companies altogether. It simply means we should give preference to  companies that are already profitable and boast a clear path to  profitability in the future. When it comes to the mobile advertising space, though, virtually no  company has turned a profit yet (it’s still a very young industry). And  Marin is no exception.So the key thing to focus on here is the trend in losses.Unfortunately, they’re increasing - up 48% over the first nine months  of 2012. But the spike can be largely attributed to a 63% increase in  sales and marketing costs. In other words, the company is aggressively  ramping up spending to secure future sales.So instead of dismissing the company outright, I’d be on the lookout  for an update to the IPO filing with fourth quarter results. That way,  we’ll see if the increased spending does, indeed, translate into higher  sales - and, in turn, fewer losses.Hot IPO Hallmark #5: ValuationAs Warren Buffett famously said, “Price is what you pay. Value is  what you get.” And when it comes to IPOs, we never want to overpay for  growth. At this point, it’s hard to determine a fair value range for Marin  because the underwriters haven’t revealed the expected pricing range for  the IPO yet. We can’t even establish a rough estimate since its most direct competitors, such as Acquisio Inc., are privately held.Bottom line: We’ll have to wait until Marin updates its results and  finalizes its IPO plans before we can determine whether the stock is  poised to be a top performer."

1296201,24394,2013-03-22T18:16:02-04:00,,"One month ago, almost to the day, I shared this little Wall Street  fact of life: The pace of initial public offerings (IPOs) always follows  the broader market. So it should come as no surprise that, as the S&P 500 Index has  already charged 9% higher this year, IPO activity is heating up, too. This week alone, nine companies plan to go public.Who cares? Well, you should. Because one of those companies happens to be Marin Software (NASDAQ:MRIN). In February, I singled out Marin as a possible “hot IPO,” thanks to  its leverage to the mobile advertising boom. (Remember, mobile  advertising spending is expected to surge from $3.2 billion last year to  $20 billion by 2015.) However, there was one big caveat: price.Since overpaying for an IPO never makes investment sense – and Marin  hadn’t provided a proposed pricing range yet – we couldn’t determine  whether or not it represented a bargain. But we can now. So let’s get to it before the company begins trading tomorrow.Survey Says…Later tonight, underwriters plan to price Marin’s IPO between $11 and $13 per share. Is that a fair price range? Normally, we could tell in a flash. We’d simply pull up everyone’s favorite valuation metric – the trusty  price-to-earnings ratio – for each of the company’s competitors and the  broad market. Then we’d compare it to the IPO in question, based on its  earnings per share.In Marin’s case, however, it’s not that easy. As I previously noted, much like every other small-cap, mobile advertising company – including Augme Technologies (AUGT), Millennial Media, Inc. (NYSE:MM) and Velti Plc (VELT) – Marin isn’t profitable yet.Given the infancy of the mobile advertising industry,  though, we shouldn’t immediately shun these companies because of their  lack of profitability as potential investments. I assure you, the growth  and, in turn, profits are forthcoming.Thankfully, we do have two alternative and meaningful valuation  proxies that we can use to determine a fair price to pay for Marin. More specifically, we can evaluate previous investments by venture  capital firms and price-to-sales (P/S) ratios for similar companies.Valuation Proxy #1: Venture Capital InvestmentsIn November 2012, Marin raised almost $20 million through a private  placement with existing stockholders. Its official purchase price?  $13.5312 per share. And since Marin has increased its sales since November, it’s not a  stretch to assume that the stock is more valuable as a result. So, based on previous investments, the proposed range of $11 to $13 per share represents a modest bargain.Granted, the venture capital firms’ average cost per share is  actually lower than $13.53. That’s because they had invested in previous  financing rounds (dating as far back as 2010) at lower prices (as low  as $5.53 per share). Nevertheless, if we get a chance to buy in at prices equal to their most recent investment, we should take it.Valuation Proxy #2: Price-to-Sales RatiosThe going P/S ratio for a mobile advertising firm is between 2 and 3. But that’s based on an extremely small sample size. In a broader context, Marin is really a software-as-a-service (SaaS)  company. And if we include those companies in our analysis – including Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), Guidewire (NYSE:GWRE) and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) – the range of P/S ratios checks in at 8 on the low end and 36 on the high end.Now, I’m always a bit conservative when it comes to valuing an IPO. Accordingly, let’s use a P/S ratio range of 8 to 10 for Marin. Doing  so values shares at about $15.80 to $19.75. So, again, the proposed  pricing range of $11 to $13 appears to be a bargain.Granted, underwriters might be underpricing the deal to produce a  one-day pop. They’ve been known to stack the deck, so to speak, to make  their track record appear more impressive. But that’s precisely why we’re completing our valuation analysis in  advance of the stock’s debut. It’s the only way to remain rational with  our purchasing decisions.You see, if the IPO does, indeed, pop out of the gates, we know at what point the price becomes prohibitive. As for most other investors, who usually don’t hear about an IPO  until it begins trading – well, they’re left to their own devices (i.e. –  human nature). When they see a dramatic price run-up for an IPO, they often buy in,  thinking it’s a momentum play that should be purchased at any price. And  more often than not, such an investment “strategy” yields losses, not  profits.Bottom line: Based on previous venture capital investments, the  explosive growth on the horizon for mobile advertising firms and  prevailing price-to-sales ratios, Marin is a compelling investment for  under $20 per share.Ahead of the tape,Louis Basenese"
1339851,24100,2013-04-14T08:45:24-04:00,,"Back in March I wrote a story called Marin Software: Successful IPO Inside The Numbers on the very successful IPO for Marin Software (NASDAQ:MRIN). The stock has done reasonably well, holding on to much of its initial IPO jump, and is currently selling at $14.90. At that time the article was based on the original S1 filing and I was waiting for the fourth quarter numbers to be released. This past week Marin Software announced their first public conference call for May 8th that will cover the first quarter of FY13. Wondering if I had missed the release I went back through the filings and found that they had put the fourth quarter numbers in an updated prospectus released on March 22nd. Since the data is now available let's take a quick look at how they did in the fourth quarter.Courtesy of stockcharts.comAs mentioned in the original article, growth year over year has been outstanding. Current growth rates were 152% from 2009 to 2010, 90% from 2010 to 2011 and with recent numbers - 65% in FY12. The fourth quarter numbers that were not part of the original S1 filing break down like this. In 2011 fourth quarter revenues were approximately $12M and the loss was about $4.4M. In the fourth quarter of 2012 revenues were $17M and the loss around $7M. Revenues grew at a 42% rate while net loss continued to increase.While revenue growth continues to greatly outperform a vast majority of companies, it is probably wise for investors to understand that Marin Software currently sells at 8x recent 12 month revenues, and other high growth stocks that have not been able to generate profits even with excellent growth have significantly lost their shine in the public investing eye. The good news for Marin is they are now well funded with $128M in the bank and relatively low debt at $10M. Now being well capitalized they should be able to convert their high growth rate into bottom line improvements. The first quarter numbers that will be released on May 8th should provide a good clue to how the company is doing and how the investing public perceives them.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

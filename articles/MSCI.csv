The company splits its business into 4 distinct segments, seen below:(Source: MSCI Q4 2019 Earnings Release)Index (59% of revenue): MSCI makes most of its money through license fees on AUM tracked against its proprietary indices. As of the end of 2019, MSCI calculated more than 226,000 daily indices and more than 12,000 real-time indices for different markets and industries, with over $900 billion in equity AUM tracking against them. MSCI’s royalty revenue model allows it to scale along with growth in ETF and passive index fund popularity - when more institutional and retail investors park money in MSCI-branded funds, the asset managers operating those funds send MSCI a portion of the fees. Some of MSCI’s most popular indices include its Emerging Market and Europe & Asia benchmarks, which are licensed by managers like BlackRock (BLK) and State Street (STT) to offer ETFs to the public.(Source: MSCI Investor Presentation)MSCI also licenses its indices to global futures exchanges, allowing tradeable products to be created against its benchmarks. Similar to its ETF customers, exchanges pay MSCI a fee based on contracts traded in products using its name.(Source: MSCI Investor Presentation)Analytics (32% of revenue): A smaller but growing part of MSCI’s offerings include providing market data and risk analytics to buy-side customers. Similar to FactSet, MSCI provides tools that allow portfolio managers to find better trade and investment opportunities, integrate compliance and risk monitoring into their trading systems, and automate low-complexity trades. While Analytics is normally a lower-margin business than MSCI’s other segments, the upside is it diversifies the company’s income away from purely macro-driven factors towards products that can have a more classic sales model and growth trend.ESG (~6% of revenue): A recent growth driver for MSCI comes from its first-mover advantage in providing ESG market data and company ratings to buy-side customers. ESG is a movement many say is still in its early stages, with a promising runway ahead; MSCI is capitalizing on this trend by licensing ESG indices to asset managers and improving the ESG data feeds distributed through its platform.Real Estate (~3% of revenue): Similar to ESG, MSCI has carved out a separate segment for market data sales and index products related to real estate performance, mostly focused on analytics for the buy side.As referenced above, MSCI touts a highly attractive royalty business model through its index offerings. Growth in index revenue is almost directly linked to higher assets under management in linked funds, allowing the company to scale in direct proportion to broader demand for its products.Because of this unique model, in order to predict what MSCI’s future holds, we need to take a closer look at its top customers - the large asset managers holding the AUM and paying MSCI ever-growing license fees on its indices. Among MSCI’s index customer base, the top 3 asset managers - BlackRock, State Street, and Invesco (IVZ) - far outpace the rest of the field. BlackRock, in particular, stands out as MSCI’s largest customer, with this one asset manager alone accounting for ~10% of MSCI’s total revenue since 2009:(Source: MSCI 10-K Filings)BlackRock’s iShares ETF business has experienced strong growth in AUM amid client demand for passive index funds and lower management fees. As more AUM flows into iShares ETFs that rely on MSCI’s indices, BlackRock’s license fees paid to MSCI grow in tandem:(Source: BlackRock Investor Relations)As of mid-May, there was close to $390 billion of AUM in iShares ETFs linked to an MSCI index, with Emerging Markets and EAFE funds holding the most assets.A notable outlier from MSCI’s customer base is Vanguard, the 2nd largest asset manager by AUM globally. In late 2012, Vanguard announced it was cutting MSCI as an index provider and moved its funds to FTSE, a competitor now owned by LSE with lower fees. MSCI stock dropped 20% in a single session on the news:(Source: Reuters)Data by YChartsI want to point this out to show what the downside looks like if MSCI’s big customers erode and to stress how important the big asset managers are to its business.There has been plenty of academic research published on the passive investing boom and its impact on financial markets, and I want to highlight a particular paper to show how this boom is likely to continue and benefit both the big asset managers and MSCI by extension.The paper, titled “The Specter of the Giant Three” and written by researchers out of Harvard and Boston University, examines the recent explosion in size and influence over the market by the top 3 asset managers: BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street (the “Big Three”). Below are some interesting facts highlighted by the paper:These facts are stunning to me - almost all new inflows into investment funds go to the top 3 asset managers, and these companies are already large enough to have major influence over the directors of every company in the S&P 500.The “Big Three” are also likely to stay big and continue to grow in size and influence. The paper details how the economics of the asset management industry favor large incumbents over smaller potential challengers:For these reasons, unless there are structural changes in the industry, it seems very likely the Big Three asset managers - BlackRock #1 among them - stay large and in charge.When it comes to the passive boom we’re seeing accelerate in the industry today, the paper argues there are structural tailwinds in place to keep this adoption continuing in the near future.Passive index funds have become so popular due to two primary factors: low expenses and superior returns to actively managed funds. Investors are logically gravitating to the funds that give them the best risk-adjusted returns for the lowest cost, which explains why the ETFs that track the S&P 500 - both State Street’s SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (SPY) and BlackRock’s the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) - are the top two ETFs in the world by AUM. Both funds offer extremely low expense ratios for the ability to track the broader equity market, which active managers consistently underperform.What’s bullish for MSCI long term is that these factors don’t seem to be changing anytime soon. Unless active managers find a way to outperform the market consistently in the near future or ETFs become overly expensive, new inflows will continue to flow to passive instruments and ETFs in general. This means AUM is expected to continue to rise for MSCI-linked products, and index fees along with it.The powerful secular trends at play are partially why MSCI has issued such aggressive long-term targets, as seen below:(Source: MSCI Investor Presentation)Revenue growth in the low double digits and EBITDA growth in the mid-teens? Long term? No wonder the stock trades at such a high multiple:Data by YChartsIf management is confident enough in the success of its asset management client base to hold itself to mid-teens EBITDA growth over the long term, investors are going to pay top dollar for that kind of story. Not many companies or business models can achieve that kind of growth over long periods of time, which speaks to the extremely valuable royalty model MSCI has built.Now, it would be remiss of me to not focus on the risks 2020 and COVID-19 presents to MSCI’s guidance this year. During Q1’s earnings release, the company tweaked its free cash flow guidance lower to reflect the difficult operating environment for its Analytics customers, as buy-side market data spending takes a hit amid the passive investing boom and COVID-19 economic slowdown. As I detailed in an article last week on FactSet (FDS), the analytics industry faces headwinds in 2020 across the board, and as a result, I think MSCI’s Analytics segment may drag down any strength seen in its Index segment this year.There are also potential macro challenges in MSCI’s index business as AUM swings with market movements. The company receives license fees based on AUM levels in linked funds, which can go up or down depending on both flows and price movement. For example, at the end of February, MSCI reported ~$943 billion in equity-linked AUM - in March, after the steep market selloff, it reported a $200 billion drop in AUM, mostly driven by price declines:(Source: MSCI Investor Relations)If market prices drop substantially and stay low for extended periods of time, MSCI’s license fees will take a hit. However, apart from the market rebound we’ve seen in the subsequent weeks on Fed optimism, the long-term trend of passive investing beating active will boost sales even if market volatility hurts AUM levels in the short term.MSCI operates a powerful royalty model in its index business and has relationships with the top asset managers in the world, most notably BlackRock’s iShares ETF business. Passive index investing should continue to gather steam and increased AUM, which benefits the Big Three asset managers and MSCI by extension. The company touts aggressive (and achievable) long-term targets and sports a high multiple as a result. If COVID-19 and a global recession brings valuation down from current levels, I would consider building a position. For now, I think this attractive company is fully valued and am watching for pullbacks before getting more bullish."
4358815,102404,2020-07-16T10:22:18-04:00,"MSCI is a global provider of equity, fixed income, hedge fund stock market indexes and multi-asset portfolio analysis tools.Due to a wide economic moat, which is built on brand names and switching costs, MSCI could report impressive growth rates in the past.But with an intrinsic value of $275, MSCI is overvalued at this point.","Very recently, I published an article on FactSet Research Systems Inc. (FDS), the financial data and software company. In this article, we are looking closer at one of its competitors in the analytics segment - the investment research firm MSCI Inc. (MSCI), which is most famous for its equity and fixed income indexes.(Source: Pixabay)In this article we will follow our usual structure of describing the business, looking at the growth potential, the wide economic moat, barriers to enter and try to provide an intrinsic value calculation, but we start with the description of MSCI.MSCI, Inc., which was founded in 1969 as Capital International, published indexes covering the global stock market and in 1986, Morgan Stanley (MS) licensed the rights to the indexes from Capital International and branded the indexes as the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) indexes. Finally, the business was spun off from Morgan Stanley in a 2007 IPO and we now have a leading provider of mission critical investment decision supporting tools and services with 50 years of expertise in research, data and technology.MSCI is a global provider of equity, fixed income, hedge fund stock market indexes and multi-asset portfolio analysis tools. The clients of MSCI are asset owners like pension funds and family offices or asset managers like mutual funds or hedge funds. Its clients also include financial intermediaries like banks, broker-dealers or investment consultants as well as wealth managers (including an increasing number of ""robo-advisors""). MSCI has about 3,300 employees in more than 20 countries (about 200 researchers, 1,500 technologists & data scientist and 700 coverage & marketing professionals) with about 60% of employees being located in emerging market centers.(Source: MSCI Investor Presentation)MSCI is reporting in three business segments (chart above shows first quarter operating revenue of 2020) - Index, Analytics and All Other (including ESG and Real Estate):The revenue of MSCI stems from two different sources - asset-based fees on the one side and recurring subscriptions on the other side. In the last four quarters, MSCI generated 73% of operating revenue from subscriptions and 24% of operating revenue from asset-based fees. Recurring subscription revenues represent fees earned from clients primarily under renewable contracts or agreements.(Source: MSCI Investor Presentation)When looking at the global distribution and the firm-wide subscription run rate, 46% stemmed from America, 37% of EMEA region and 17% from the APAC region. MSCI always had low rates of cancellations and high retention rates, which means a highly sticky client base. In 2018, the retention rate has been 94.1% - the highest number during the last five years.(Source: MSCI Investor Presentation)One of the most important aspects when analyzing a company is the growth potential the industry and especially the business has. In case of MSCI, we can assume, that the business will profit from several trends, which will lead to revenue growth in the coming years. First of all, the trend towards passive investing was a strong tailwind for MSCI in the past few years and it is likely it will also be a tailwind in the years to come. Within the next few years, the share of passive investing AUMs might surpass the market share of active management AUMs and the trend towards passive investing is very stable (especially universities and endowments have been switching more to passive investment solutions). The ETF market is projected to reach $7.6 trillion in 2020 and has been growing with a very high pace during the last decade.(Source: S&P Global Investor Fact Book)A second strong trend from which MSCI can profit in the years to come is the increasing popularity of the environmental, social and governance (BATS:ESG) criteria to evaluate companies in which people want to invest. Several asset managers are expecting the share of global assets operating on ESG principles to more than double in the next few years. Morningstar (MORN) is also expecting the environmental, social and governance products to grow at a CAGR of almost 30% over the next few years (and Morningstar is estimating $330 million in revenue for MSCI from that segment). And MSCI reported an organic ESG Run Rate growth of 23.3% in the first quarter of 2020.(Source: MSCI Investor Presentation)A third positive trend is the strong interest in private asset investing. MSCI is uniquely positioned in the private asset investing segment as it has built several investment management decision-making tools (mostly in the real estate market), which will help its clients to allocate capital. Over the last few years (and most likely also in the years to come) institutional investors are increasing allocations to private assets to achieve desired returns.(Source: MSCI Investor Presentation)MSCI is not the only company offering indexes and there are also competitors offering indexes in the same categories as MSCI. Although MSCI has wide array of different index categories and is offering the greatest variety of indexes, it is still facing major competitors like FTSE Russell, a subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange Group PLC (OTCPK:LDNXF) and S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC - a joint venture company owned by CME Group, Inc. (CME) and by S&P Global Inc. (SPGI). And these are definitely two competitors MSCI has to take serious with strong brands like S&P or Dow Jones. Additionally, we see growing competition from industry participants like asset managers and investment banks, that tend to create their own indexes to use them as benchmark.MSCI's Analytics offerings compete with the offerings from a wide range of companies including Axioma Inc., BlackRock Solutions, Bloomberg Financial L.P. and FactSet Research Systems Inc. (FDS). And similar to the indexes business, large broker-dealers are also developing proprietary analytics tools for their clients.Aside from existing competitors, MSCI also faces the threat of new competitors entering the market - especially if the market offers above average growth rates. When analyzing what it takes to enter the business, we have to admit, that the barriers to enter are rather low as it is not very difficult to create an index or simple analytics products. But strict licensing and legal requirements are making it much more difficult for new competitors to enter the market and sell the products. And even then, it is questionable if anybody will use the indexes or analytics products due to the branding companies like MSCI (or S&P Global) achieved in the past. Economies of scale also play a role as they give MSCI an advantage over smaller, newer competitors. To create similar products as MSCI in a simple form might not be extremely difficult, but to get people in the investing community to use these products is a little more difficult and offering similar quality and differentiation as MSCI is quite a challenge.Similar to every other company, MSCI has business relations with buyers and suppliers and it is also important if any side has bargaining power over MSCI as this would lead to price pressures. When looking at the supplying side, MSCI needs data and prices about the securities, but as the differentiation is low (different stock exchanges offer prices) and there are not just a few competitors, these suppliers don't have much bargaining power over MSCI.On the other hand, MSCI definitely has some bargaining power over its customers (buyers). For the analytics segment we have rather high switching costs due to steep learning curves (see segment below) and this gives MSCI some form of bargaining power. In case of the index business, there are several competitors offering similar products which is undermining any bargaining power MSCI might have. But the product differentiation is quite high and MSCI is offering a huge number of indexes and this high level of differentiation could make it in some cases difficult to find another company offering a similar index, which could result in bargaining power over the customers for MSCI.MSCI reported, that about 98% of its revenue was recurring in 2018, which is a very high rate and indicating a stable business. MSCI has a leading competitive position and is a market leader in cross-border index licensing and according to Bloomberg it is number one among index providers in number of equity ETFs. But much more important is a wide economic moat around the business, which will guarantee defensibility against new competitors and stable growth. The economic moat of MSCI is built on two sources - its brand name and switching costs.The first source of its wide economic moat are the intangible assets the company has - mainly the MSCI-branded indexes, which many asset managers use to benchmark their own performance when displaying results. The MSCI-indexes are used as a benchmark for investment performance especially for markets or sectors where no index like the S&P 500 or Nasdaq-100 exists. The company did a great job to insert itself as the leader in benchmarking for these markets and the resulting brand name is creating an economic moat around MSCI. The brand name is like a short-cut for the decision, which index to use: The recognizable brand name of MSCI will lead investors, asset managers and other participants in the financial industry to use the MSCI indexes instead those of some other provider. Aside from the brand name, increasing regulations could also add to the wide economic moat as regulations are another competitive advantage. The more difficult it gets for new competitors to enter (as they have to apply to a lot of regulations), the better for MSCI.While the indexes have a strong brand name, which might be helpful attracting new customers that will choose MSCI instead of some competitor, there are low switching costs for existing customers and the risk of switching to other indexes is a problem (although the high level of product differentiation might lead to stickiness as customers sometimes can't switch as no similar product exists). But the switching costs are high for the other services MSCI offers - mainly the Analytics segment. The company offers different tools where it takes quite some time to learn the whole functionality and clients have to insert a lot of data. Switching to a competitor's product would lead to high switching costs for any company - and especially smaller companies don't have the time or financial resources to duplicate already made investments (financial and temporal). Aside from the brand name, MSCI's moat is therefore based on procedural switching costs - learning costs and setup costs - which companies are trying to avoid.When trying to estimate what growth rates might be realistic in the years to come, we can take a look at management's own long-term growth model. Over the long run, MSCI is expecting a low double-digit revenue growth and an adjusted EBITDA growth rate, which is even in the mid-teens. When looking at the different segments, revenue growth will especially come from ESG (mid-twenties growth rate), Real Estate (Mid-Teens revenue growth rate) and Index (low double-digit growth).(Source: MSCI Investor Presentation)Aside from management's expectations about future performance, we can also look at the actual performance of MSCI during the last recession. First of all, MSCI could increase its revenue every single year and only in 2009 revenue growth was a bit slow (2.8% growth), but in 2010 MSCI could increase its revenue almost 50%. When looking at net income, we see a decline of almost 16% in 2008, but in the following years growth was strong again - 19.8% growth in 2009 and 12.7% growth in 2010.When looking at the long performance since 2003, revenue increased with a CAGR of 19.41% and net income increased even with a CAGR of 27.61% (and this is not including share buybacks). In the recent past, growth slowed down, but during the last decade, revenue still increased with a CAGR of 13.42% and net income increased with a CAGR of 21.29%. In the last five years, revenue CAGR slowed down to even 9.39%, but net income still increased with a CAGR of 22.39% (and this is once again not including share buybacks).When trying to make assumptions, I would assume free cash flow to stagnate in 2020 and be the same as in 2019 ($656 million in free cash flow). Despite net income growth above 20% in the past, I would be a little more cautious and assume ""only"" 15% free cash flow growth in 2021 and then assume that growth will slow down over the years and be only 6% for perpetuity. Taking these numbers and a 10% discount rate leads to an intrinsic value of $275.08 for MSCI.We definitely can argue, that these assumptions are too cautious. Especially, when looking at the index subscription run rate growth, which was extremely stable at 11-12% over many quarters or the organic subscription run rate growth for the ""All Other"" segment, which increased with a stable trend over the last few years and is now at about 20% growth, the assumption of a growth slowdown seems too pessimistic. About 2-3% growth will also stem from growth buybacks. But I am rather cautious (always have been) and calculating with so exceptional high growth rates (which are possible, but very rare) would make me uneasy.(Source: MSCI Investor Presentation)Similar to FactSet, which I covered very recently, MSCI is also overvalued. And even if MSCI is not as extremely overvalued as FactSet, this stock is also not a good investment at this point in time. If you have to choose between FactSet and MSCI, the later one is probably the better choice, but like I said, I won't invest in neither of these companies. It could be the case, that I underestimate the growth potential in the years ahead as MSCI certainly could report very impressive growth rates for a long time and we don't see any signs for a slowdown of this trend. Nevertheless, I am rather cautious and assuming 15% growth for a long time is a dangerous assumption in my opinion as we never know what might happen."
4379506,50662,2020-10-19T09:35:00-04:00,"MSCI saw its revenue, net income and free cash flow grow.At 60 times its net income and almost 35 times its free cash flow, the stock has become expensive.I'm taking profits through a combination of selling and writing an in-the-money call option.","About four years ago, I had a look at MSCI (MSCI) when the company was trading at just more than $76/share and although the free cash flow had dropped to just under 5%. Not cheap, but considering MSCI’s strong position in providing analytic tools and benchmarks for institutional investors, I figured it made sense to only sell a small portion of the position while keeping the rest. With the share price now in excess of $350/share, I wanted to have another look at MSCI as this is becoming a prime candidate to sell and boost my cash position.While we are still waiting for the Q3 results, MSCI’s first half 2020 results indicated the company’s revenue (and profit) continues to grow at a fast pace. In the first semester, MSCI reported a total revenue of $826M, an increase of almost 10% compared to H1 2019. Additionally, the operating expenses increased by less than 1% to $403M and this caused the operating margin to increase sharply as the operating income increased by almost 20% to $423M.Source: SEC filingsWhereas the operating margin was approximately 47%, the margin in H1 2020 came in at in excess of 51%, thanks to an exceptionally strong operating margin in Q2 (52.5% despite a slightly lower revenue compared to Q1). The net income in H1 2020 came in at approximately $263M or$3.12/share. So on an annualized basis, MSCI is trading at just under 60 times its net income.And although MSCI has a low-capex business model, I wasn’t expecting to get much happier from the cash flow statement.Indeed, the company did report an operating cash flow of $375.4M and after taking the changes in the working capital position into account, the adjusted operating cash flow was approximately $385M.Source: SEC filingsThe capex was just $22M, resulting in a free cash flow result of $363M. And that’s good, very good. But even if the annualized FCF will come in at $750M, the current share count of 83.6M shares means the FCF/share would be just around $9, for a FCF yield of less than 3%.MSCI is a quality company, and quality companies deserve to be trading at a premium price. I’m just not so sure I’m willing to pay 60 times the net income and almost 35 times the free cash flow for the company.Additionally, the company continues to spend vast amounts of cash on dividends (understandable) and share repurchases (perhaps not the best use of the cash considering it’s repurchasing itself at a high multiple these days).As of the end of June, MSCI had $1.38B in cash on the balance sheet but also $3.36B in debt for a net debt of around $2B. Considering the H1 interest expense was just more than $80M, the gross debt will be costing MSCI in excess of $150M this year, for an average cost of debt just below 5%. While I understand there’s no debt maturity ahead of 2026 (see below), I’m cringing to see the company paying almost 5% interest on debt, while it’s using its free cash flow to buy back stock at a free cash flow yield of just half the cost of debt.Source: SEC filingsGranted, if there are no other purposes for the cash. Rather than buying back stock, I think it would make sense for MSCI to also repurchase some of the bonds on the open market as well (on weakness, and only if the YTM is higher than the free cash flow yield). And just to be clear: I’m not worried about the net debt level at all, it’s very manageable both from a debt ratio (net debt/EBITDA) perspective as well as the net debt versus free cash flow.MSCI has been and still is an excellent company, and me taking profits is just a personal decision based on the current valuation and preference to restart building my cash position. I currently have 120 shares which I purchased at around $45/share. I think it makes sense to sell 20 shares on the open market for an immediate cash infusion while writing a call option on the remaining position of 100 shares.Looking at the option premiums, I'm considering writing an in-the-money call option and I’m particularly looking at the C350 for November (for a $26 option premium). This would result in an average sale price of $376 (roughly 3% higher than the current share price) as long as MSCI trades above $350/share. Additionally, with a cost base of $5,400 for 120 shares, writing the call option and the sale of 20 shares will result in a cash inflow of $9,900, so even if the call expires out of the money, I will be taking $9,900 out of the market for a position which originally cost me less than $5,500."
4379631,21702,2020-10-18T17:17:06-04:00,Many investors may be surprised (as I was) that MSCI refers to not only a group of indexes but also the name of a publicly traded company that manages them.MSCI has a very attractive subscription based service that is growing its recurring revenue base - and its operating margin.Wall Street has noticed: the stock is up 60% this year.,"Index provider and manager MSCI Inc. (MSCI) is thriving in the current market environment in terms of both increasing subscriptions and its stock price - which is up ~60% over the past 12 months. While the company's growth rate is solid, the rich valuation should give investors pause. That said, MSCI is more than an index manager: it has a substantial and growing recurring subscription model that is somewhat akin to the SaaS based model that the market is currently so fond of. As a result, some of MSCI's valuation is based on a rational long-term perspective that is based on the strength (and endurance) of its brand and its subscription based revenue growth.Most investors are aware of at least a few MSCI indexes - primarily the popular market-cap indexes. But they may be surprised at the total breadth of MSCI's offerings that span across multiple categories:MSCI has benefited from the shift from active investing to low-cost, transparent, and typically more tax-efficient passive investing in major market indexes. The popularity of indexes such as the Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ), BlackRock's iShares ETFs, and sector based ETFs like the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLP) are examples of ETFs that have been warmly embraced by investors. Meantime, educated investors - who may have been burned by their individual stock picks - have learned about the benefits of investing in low-cost funds over time:Source: dqydj.comThe strength of the MSCI brand across the global investment horizon is what makes the company's research and analytics valuable to wealth managers, institutional clients, and asset managers and asset owners. After all, money managers are most likely to work with an asset manager that actually manages the market index that directly aligns with their funds' stated objective. This is why MSCI's subscription service - and recurring revenue model - is so strong and resilient whether the market is up or down. And that business is growing - as are operating margins.That is evident in the latest EPS report despite the fact that revenue grew 8.6% in 2019 but decelerated somewhat in Q2FY20 (6.2%):Source: Q2 EPS Report As can be seen in the above graphic, operating income, operating margin, and adjusted EBITDA all posted impressive growth yoy. That's primarily due to the increase in recurring subscription revenues (+7.2%), non-recurring revenue growth (+34.4%), high retention rates, and - critically - new recurring subscription sales growth of (+15.5%).That's critical because new recurring subscription rates figure into the reported Q2 ""total run rate"", which is MSCI's current projection of fee revenue over the coming 12 months from subscriptions and product licensing revenue. The total run rate, as of end of Q2, was $1.65 billion - up 8.5% yoy. The increase was fueled primarily by a $112.7 million increase in recurring revenue from subscriptions.In Q2, MSCI boosted the quarterly dividend with a 14.7% increase to $0.78/share. The company's target is for a payout in the range of 40%-50% of adjusted EPS. In Q2, $88.0 million was returned to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends (diluted shares outstanding declined 1.2% yoy).Wall Street's embrace of recurring revenue models (like the software-as-a-service, or SaaS, models) has driven many companies to what I consider to be extreme valuation levels. See my Seeking Alpha articles on companies like Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS) as examples (here and here). That being the case, it is no surprise that MSCI has caught the attention of Wall Street and also been bid up to what I consider to be a very high valuation relative to its demonstrated revenue and earnings growth:The primary risk in my opinion is the current market valuation - based simply on price-to-earnings ratio - of a company whose revenue growth does appear to support a forward P/E of 50x.There is institutional client risk as well. Back in 2012, Vanguard switched 22 of its funds away from MSCI indexes in order to cut the cost for investors. News of the switch caused MSCI's stock to drop some 30%.Note that MSCI's latest 10-Q filing reported that BlackRock accounted for 10.9% of the company’s consolidated revenue over the first 6 months of 2020. If BlackRock were to take a page from Vanguard's book, that would likely have a large and material impact on the stock price.I like MSCI's brand and business model. And I am impressed with the growth in its recurring revenue base and its total run-rate metrics. The future looks bright. That said, the valuation seems very rich despite the very positive subscription service potential. Even if a client like BlackRock didn't pull a move like Vanguard did in 2012, BlackRock appears to be in a position of strength to negotiate more favorable terms, which would negatively affect MSCI's margins. So, even while I admire MSCI's business model and am bullish on the company's future, the company is currently overvalued in my opinion. To be fair, Oppenheimer has a different opinion and considers the company an ""outperform"" with a one-year price target of $416. That equates to a one-year return of ~14%. That is not worth the downside risk in my opinion."
4337400,104888,2020-04-14T07:30:00-04:00,"Solid recurring revenues despite market volatility.Leader in ESG, an increasingly important factor in investing.Stock has returned 400% over the past 5 years.Use market corrections to accumulate.","MSCI's stock (MSCI) has returned over 400% in the past five years due to its excellent cash flow generation, steady revenue flow and increasing margins in the investing industry. MSCI products, including its indexes and ETFs, are used by many asset owners, managers, and investment professionals globally.The stock is highly correlated with the market as a portion of its revenue are directly tied to the AUM of its products which fluctuates with the markets. But, the need for indexing, performance attribution, ESG and factors in investment processes provide more and more demand over the cycles. That's why we see the stock climb to new highs after steep market sell-offs.MSCI delivered a beat on the topline and the bottom line (on a non-GAAP basis). Total run rate grew 14.2% yoy to $1,635M with Index segment leading organic growth at 17.3% yoy, accounting for 58% of the total.In terms of subscription run rate, Index increased 11.3% yoy organically, and within this segment, Factor and ESG grew the strongest at 25.4% yoy. Factor and ESG is now 9% of this segment, increasing from 8% in 4Q18. Analytics grew 7.2% yoy.4Q19 AUM reached $934M, increasing from $815M in 3Q19 and $696M in 4Q18, with $56M inflows on a sequential change and $91M inflows on a yearly change.Adjusted EBITDA grew 16% yoy with a margin of 54.2%, increasing 170bps yoy. Much of the improvement in margin has been due to the robust adoption of higher margin Factor/ESG products. Adjusted EPS increased 27%.MSCI has the key ingredients of a good financial model which boasts high recurring revenue with good retention rates, improving operating efficiency and high, stable cash flow generation.1. Recurring revenue is ~97% of total revenue during 2015-2019 and that includes both asset based fees and subscription revenue. In 4Q19, total recurring subscription run rate reached $559M vs. asset based fee of $396M. A growing part of recurring subscription fees is helping reduce revenue volatility due to changes in AUM (ETFs, non-ETFs, futures/options) from market fluctuations.2. Retention rate is stable about 92%. Around two thirds of subscription run rate growth come from new clients and upsells to existing clients.3. High operational efficiency with adjusted EBITDA margin at 54.6% in 2019 compared with 44.8% in 2015. This is because the business is highly scalable. Effective tax rate has been lowered to 17.6% in 2019 from 34.2% in 2015.4. Free cash flow generation is steadily growing, hitting $656M in 2019 from $257M since 2015.For almost every product line they have, the businesses are margin accretive with revenue growing faster than expenses.Source: Company, Himalayas ResearchOverall, the company is expected to generate adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid teens with EBITDA margin in the 55-60% range.ESG is becoming an important factor in investing, particularly in respect to climate change, which is increasingly used in the investment process as capital flows remain large and the globalization of the investment industry.Given that the existing penetration rate is about 30% among asset managers globally, much of the growth would come from new clients. This is expected to grow to about 50% in 2021E. New use cases among existing clients would sprout within their organization as they scale up ESG integration efforts which leads to upsell opportunities.Analytics product is strongly positioned to take advantage of $20B+ TAMMSCI's analytics are extensively used by asset owners, asset managers and intermediaries globally to solve a broad range of investment issues. The content, data and analysis help clients in their portfolio construction, performance attribution and risk assessment.There are many ways for MSCI to reach the global $20B+ TAM which includes:1. Greenfield opportunities - investment innovation (e.g., factor investing, ESG), regulation (e.g., liquidity), and increasing adoption of best practices and technology (e.g., asset owners becoming more sophisticated)2. Replacing client internal spend on internal software development or outsourced managed services.3. Displacing niche providers by offering single asset class products or narrower products addressing specific problems like performance attribution.The company only guides expense items as they do not predict asset changes which is essential to their asset based fee income.Free cash flow is guided down 7% mainly due to the increased capex in 2020 due to higher investment into the tech platform and absence of certain tax benefits.Adjusted EBITDA expenses are projected to grow 7.5% in 2020. This compares to 6.8% in 2019. The number of ADS linked MSCI ETFs have grown considerably so as it is helping the topline grow, the expenses are also increasing to support this.These figures are broadly inline with their long-term targets.MSCI is a solid buy because of the growing importance of ESG and factors in investment processes which will create a large opportunity along with their analytics offering. Asset owners/managers are increasingly becoming more sophisticated and will demand more of such tools. Globalization of the investment industry, capital flows and indexing are creating a surge in demand for MSCI asset-linked products (e.g. passive ETF buying) and subscription fees (more seats within an organization)."
4348678,24937,2020-05-19T10:25:35-04:00,"Index providers have made a fortune catering to the rise of passive investing.It is one of the most significant investment themes shaping financial markets since the great recession.The passive gold rush has made the index providers hugely powerful. Their decisions direct trillions of dollars of flows, turning them into de facto gatekeepers within global finance.The index revolution is still in its embryonic stages, and I believe the shares of index providers will continue to outperform the indices which generate their profits.","A titanic shift is currently taking place - investors are pulling trillions of dollars out of expensive and underperforming actively-managed funds and placing it in lower-cost index funds. During the past decade alone, the global index industry has grown five-fold to $11.4 trillion to the end of November 2019, according to data from the Investment Company Institute. The growing disillusionment with active fund managers is understandable, and the underperformance of actively managed funds during the pandemic induced bear market will only serve to accelerate this trend. In my view, the rise of passive investing has been the most significant theme since the global financial crisis, and I have identified three companies which are capitalizing on the index revolution.The shift into passive investments has been aided by countless studies highlighting the prolonged and abysmal record of active fund managers. The index vs. active research scorecard released by S&P Dow Jones indices (better known as SPIVA) measures the performance of actively managed funds against their respective benchmarks. It reveals that approximately 90% of all actively managed funds (US and international) underperform their benchmark over a 10-15-year horizon. Worse still, should you be fortunate enough to select a top-performing fund, the majority have failed to maintain it over both short and longer-term horizons. The ability of successful active managers to deliver above-average returns consistently over multiple time periods is a key way to distinguish luck from skill. The S&P Dow Jones indices produce the 'persistence scorecard' to measure this - their latest 2019 Mid-Year report paints another grim picture, highlighting that, over a five-year measurement period, none of the top quartile funds in the large-cap, mid-cap, and multi-cap space maintained this status.In the new age of passive investing, public attention has been focused on the growing success of the big passive fund managers like Vanguard Group, BlackRock and State Street - but the real beneficiaries, lurking quietly in the background has been the index providers themselves. The three major players: S&P Dow Jones Indices, a division of S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), MSCI Inc. (NYSE:MSCI) and FTSE Russell indices, a subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange Group (LSE) (OTCPK:LDNXF) - have made a fortune catering to the rise of index investing. This is reflected in their share prices, which have substantially outperformed the indices they create.For example, since December 2009, the share price of MSCI Inc. has increased more than eight-fold vs. 180% return for the S&P 500, and pre-tax profits rose by twenty-nine-fold over the last 10 years. Over the same period, shares of S&P Global and LSE have appreciated seven and ten-fold, respectively.MSCI Inc., the leading benchmark indices provider and software firm most known for its internationally-recognised MSCI (Morgan Stanley Capital International) stock market indices, is the purest index play. In their latest annual report to December 2018, the index segment accounted for the lion's share of its revenues, at roughly 40%. This has grown by an average of 14% since they began reporting index revenues separately in 2015. Over the same period, S&P Dow Jones Indices and FTSE Russell have produced equally stellar returns, increasing index revenues by an average of 12% and by 22%, respectively.Reassuringly, these rapid rates of growth are helped by an additional tailwind, which is the explosion in the exchange-traded funds industry that has grown six-fold since the financial crisis. In 2019, global ETF's assets under management reached a milestone of $6 trillion, according to EPFR, and BlackRock projects it to double by 2023.Source: BlackRock, Global Business IntelligenceThe 'big three' construct stock market indices such as S&P 500, the FTSE 100, and MSCI emerging markets - from which trillions of dollars of assets are benchmarked against, receiving a small licence fee in return. They design the criteria that determine which companies and countries are included within their indices. An inclusion or exclusion from an index will automatically trigger billions of dollars of inflows or outflows, turning the big three into de facto gatekeepers within global finance.The large shift into index funds since the financial crisis has made index providers hugely powerful, and their role in directing capital flows will have important ramifications for regulators and economies in the near future. One early such example of their growing influence was a report by Bloomberg magazine that the Peruvian finance minister, on rumors that MSCI Inc. was going to oust the country from its globally recognized emerging markets index in September 2015, took an eight-hour plane ride to meet with MSCI directors in New York. The fear was that reclassifying Peru from an emerging market to a 'frontier market' could trigger a catastrophic outflow of capital, leading to a potential devaluation in Peruvian securities and increased costs of capital for businesses. Ultimately, MSCI Inc. decided not to downgrade it to 'Frontier' status, but this is nevertheless a demonstration of their enormous clout in the age of passive asset management, where they have become the new gatekeepers of finance.Similar to the big three in passive asset management, the global index provider industry is concentrated around three main players. These companies operate an oligopolistic industry; with high barriers to entry and significant pricing power, the dominant players have exercised this power by raising licensing fees above the rate of inflation. However, this is coming at a time when there is a relentless cost-cutting pressure on passive fund managers to reduce fees. This has driven some firms to experiment with creating their own indices in a bid to save costs.In terms of market share, their grip shows no sign of abating, rising from 60% in 2012 to more than 70% in 2018, according to data from consultants Burton-Taylor. Furthermore, they collectively exhibit exceptional profit margins of upward to 60%, indicating a strong competitive position. And the trillions of dollars of assets pouring into index funds guarantee them a profitable and recurring revenue stream.The global index provider industry is not impregnable. Fierce competition and the growing recognition amongst investors about the importance of costs to long-term performance have driven a race to the bottom in terms of fees. This has driven some passive managers to experiment with 'self-indexing', where they build their own benchmarks to save on money that would have gone to the large index providers.For example, Vanguard Group announced in 2012 that it would switch 22 of the biggest index funds away from benchmarks provided by MSCI to cut costs. At the time, Vanguard said the move should ""save millions of dollars in licensing expenses for the fund savings that will ultimately benefit shareholders."" Shares of MSCI plunged 27% on the day, the largest decline on record, although the shares recovered in less than 12 months to hit new all-time highs. Elsewhere, in October 2017, State Street ditched FTSE Russell indexes for three of its own products, opting to build in-house equity indexes instead, and BlackRock is also creating propriety indices to save money. With cut-throat competition, stopping payments to third-party index providers to save a few basis points in fund fees could prove crucial in securing an increasing share of the burgeoning market for passive investments.While the idea of creating your own indices to save money sounds good in principle, in practice, it introduces a multitude of problems. First among them is the potential for huge conflicts of interest, the temptation to manipulate the performance of an index fund by tweaking the index rules might prove too great. Alex Matturri, chief executive of S&P Dow Jones Indices, believes that ""self-indexing would bring back Libor"". Referring to the Libor Scandal where banks were fined billions of dollars for the manipulation of a global benchmark, which is used as a basis to price financial products worth trillions of dollars. The best way to avoid these conflicts is to outsource index capabilities to a neutral and independent third-party benchmark.What's more, there are questions as to whether self-indexing saves costs at all. Susan Quintin, managing director of product management at FTSE Russell, believes the ""complexity of developing and managing indexes remains underappreciated in some pockets of industry"". It would require large investments in data, expertise, governance, and infrastructure. I don't see this as a long-term threat, as the prohibitive costs of building and maintaining the index mean that only large asset managers could justify doing this. Furthermore, institutional investors tend to prefer well-known branded indices that are trusted by the international community and will be reluctant to benchmark against an unknown index.The investing lesson from the Californian gold rush was that it was more lucrative selling picks and shovels to the miners hoping to strike it rich, as opposed to prospecting for precious metals. The equivalent play in the age of passive investing is to buy shares of index providers, to capitalize on the passive gold rush.This migration into index funds is one of the most under-appreciated trends shaping global markets today. And it's not too late to capitalize on the wave indexing, while the headlines will portray passive investing as an unstoppable force that is taking over the world, the hype is overstated. By some estimates, passive funds still account for less than 15% of global equity markets; active management remains the dominant mode of asset management. Whilst the transformation is still in its embryonic stages, I believe the shares of index providers will continue to outperform the indices which generate their profits."
3999636,88746,2016-08-15T13:55:12-04:00,MSCI has run nearly 20% year-to-date.They recently reported stellar numbers which boosted investor sentiment.Their operating margins reflect a strong business with excellent fundamentals.Valuations are stretched and a pullback of 10% would be reasonable.It's an excellent company for the long term.,"BackgroundAccording to MSCI's (NYSE:MSCI) website, they are an independent provider of research-driven insights and tools for institutional investors. They have a broad product line that supports clients' needs across all major asset classes and provides them with a consistent way of looking at risk and performance from front to middle office. They are in the financial services sector.Quarterly Results OverviewRevenue for the quarter was up 7.4%, year over year, to just over $290 million. This was driven by double digit growth in their Index segment. Operating expenses were down 4.2% to drive 27.6% growth in operating income. This allowed EPS to increase by 37.5% ($.77 per share).Perhaps most impressive of all, was that their operating margin increased 6.9%, or 690 basis points, to 43.3%. Adjusted EBITDA margin rose 660 basis points to 50.3%. That is a staggering feat by any stretch of the imagination. This demonstrates that the company is growing revenue rapidly and containing their costs.Their capital allocation strategy was featured in the quarter as well. They reduced shares outstanding by 14% year over year. In the quarter, they bought back 1.6 million shares for $122.2 million. They still have $423.8 million left on their authorization. In addition, the board of directors increased the dividend by 27.3% to $1.12, on an annual basis. This signals that the company is confident in their future.Quarterly Results by SegmentMSCI has three main segments: index, analytics, and all other. To provide some context on the makeup of the business, I will review the 2015 full year results by segment. Index accounted for 52% of the revenue and 81.6% of adjusted EBITDA. Analytics accounted for 40.3% of total revenue and 19.8% of adjusted EBITDA. All other has 7.7% of revenue and -1.4% of adjusted EBITDA.IndexRevenues were up 8.6% to $152.1 million. Recurring revenue subscription were up 11%, or $9.6 million. This was driven by growth in benchmark and data products. Non-recurring revenues were up $3.9 million. Asset based fees were down by $1.5 million, or 3%. The decline was due to less revenue from their ETFs linked to MSCI exchanges. EBITDA margin for the segment was a robust 70%, up 10 basis points year over year. At the end of the quarter, assets under management totaled $462 billion.AnalyticsRevenues were up 4.5% year over year to $112.4 million. The increase can be chalked up to more revenue from equity model products and RiskManager. This makes sense given the current global economic backdrop. I would expect the strong results to continue given that. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 29.6% up near 1000 basis points, or 10% from the previous year! That is astounding and should be applauded. Management controlled the expenses and increased the revenue, a true win-win.All OtherRevenues were up 14% to $26.1 million. The increase is primarily due to ESG and real estate. Foreign currency impacted growth by 1.4%. Adjusted EBITDA was 23.8%, up 28% year over year.ValuationAt the time of writing, MSCI has risen 19.35% year to date. This has pushed valuations to 27.4x forward twelve month earnings. 2017 earnings are expected to be $3.41 compared to an estimated $2.93 for 2016. This would be a 16.4% growth rate, making the PEG 1.67. This would bring it up to the higher end of the range as a PEG of 2 is considered expensive.ChartsGiven MSCI's monster move, it is prudent to look at the charts. If we look at the chart below, we will find that the stock is currently overbought. After reviewing similar trends from the previous two years, when the stock has run for two months in a row, the move has been consolidated. Often times the stock has gone down by 10%. With the stock well above the 50 and 200 day moving averages, it would not surprise me to see a pullback to the first support level (indicated by the straight blue lines). This would indicate roughly 8% of downside.Source: StockChartsConclusionMSCI had a phenomenal quarter by all measures. All three business lines increased substantially, in both revenue and EBITDA. Index continues to be the main profit driver, with improved margins from analytics and all other helping. While I do expect growth to continue for this proprietary financial services company, the share price seems to be ahead of the fundamentals, for now. The charts seem to indicate a move downward is imminent. Throw in the fact that the market is at all-time highs and the global backdrop is uncertain. There will be a better time to buy, ideally in the $80 range. Long term I think this company will continue growing and taking share, rewarding investors along the way."
3999995,96536,2016-08-16T14:56:05-04:00,"MSCI is a provider of investment tools and research to institutional investors.MSCI operates in a unique niche with high margins and growing sales.Shares of MSCI are richly valued, but this stock may be one to keep in mind and consider on a pullback.","MSCI (NYSE:MSCI) provides investment decision support services to the financial services industry. Solutions offered by MSCI include indexes, portfolio analytics and risk management tools, and corporate governance products and services. As an investor, you've probably relied on MSCI for information at one point or another.Over the last 10 years, MSCI has been able to grow the top and bottom line consistently. I think this is in large part due to their unique business niche. Not only are financial services immensely profitable, but the highly specialized and regulated nature of the industry can also make barriers to entry high.To confirm this strong competitive position, I'm hoping to see a company with a consistent track record of compounding capital and no signs of slowing down. After all, something must be driving shares to all-time highs.MSCI Business OverviewFor over 40 years, MSCI has created research-based indexes and analytics to help institutional investors build and manage better portfolios. MSCI counts 97 of the 100 largest asset managers as clients. From institutional risk managers to passive investors: MSCI serves a large swath of the investing market.What I like about this business is that MSCI leverages expertise, research, and knowledge to deliver value-added solutions. Generally, MSCI has well-funded clients who are hungry to get an edge. With this kind of economic backdrop, its no surprise MSCI has been a profitable company. The capital-light, knowledge-intensive traits of this business ensure it can really keep growing cash returns to shareholders.And since the 2010 acquisition of RiskMetrics Group, MSCI management has continued to pursue growth through acquisition. While many investors are skeptical of growth by acquisition strategies, I'm open to it as long as results have been accretive. Not only has this been the case, but since MSCI already has a large client base, buying new adjacent products to distribute to existing customers could be a cost-effective way to upsell, complementing internal product development.So with a better understanding of how MSCI makes money, and how it may be poised to continue capturing share of client wallet going forward, let's take a look at the historical hard numbers. I'm eager to learn how the competitive traits mentioned above show up year after year in the key financial and operating metrics (source).MSCI Financial HistoryI like to take a longitudinal look at financial and operating results because it gives an unobstructed view of how the business has performed. And one of the most unbiased metrics is revenue. That's because top-line sales give a clear view of how the company's services are in demand. Below are results for the last 10 years and trailing twelve months:To my eye, that trend looks pretty strong. I'm always encouraged when companies can continue to grow their top line, year after year. It's not happening by accident. And based on management commentary from the most recent conference call, there appears to be ample opportunity to continue launching new analytic and ESG products and services to fuel growth. Consensus estimates also indicate more of the same (source).As mentioned at the outset, due to the highly regulated and specialized nature of the MSCI business, combined with the profitable financial services industry, I expect that sales should be profitable. So let's see what the margin numbers reveal.Impressively, the high gross margins have only gotten better over the last few years. This kind of profitability gives the company a lot of room to maneuver and affirms its strong competitive position.Further, the consistently improving operating margins indicate the underlying business is continuing to operate more and more profitably as the top line keeps growing. Given this track record and the mature nature of the business, I don't expect this trend to reverse anytime soon.As a shareholder, these high margins let a lot of money drop to the bottom line. And the historic EPS data illustrates how the recent uptick in margins have resulted in more income for equity owners. I expect the intermediate term future, at least, to be more of the same.Despite the slight dip recently, this historic trend looks quite strong. And as long as it keeps heading up and to the right, I'll continue to give MSCI the benefit of the doubt.One of the reasons I think this profitable growth can continue is because the nature of MSCI's business is very capital-light and highly specialized.Since MSCI is building financial services products and solutions, they don't have big infrastructure or equipment capital expenditures. Unlike a cyclical industrial company, MSCI doesn't need to spend a high percentage of revenue on plant and equipment. Here's a graph of capital intensity as measured by capital expenses over revenue.Since capital spending is such a small amount of revenue, this leaves a lot more money for shareholders. In my experience, this consistent free cash surplus is another sign of a high quality company with a meaningful competitive advantage.As you can see above, this kind of capital-light business means the company has more money leftover to return to shareholders. I expect MSCI's fledgling dividend and ongoing share buybacks are more likely to continue, due to the consistently profitable nature of the business. Now while this scenario does sound appealing, you must remember an investment in MSCI is not without risks.The Biggest Risk To Investing in MSCILike any investment, MSCI comes with risks. And to my eye, I think the biggest risk is valuation. At over 24 times cash flow, you can convincingly argue that MSCI is expensive. And while shares of MSCI are consistently traded at a premium to the S&P 500, the rubber band appears particularly stretched at the moment. Just take a look at these historical multiples from Morningstar (source).Given that kind of price tag, I find it hard to buy shares of MSCI at current prices. While the company is doing a lot of things right, the market seems to have priced that and more into the current share price. So what's a potential investor to do?Conclusion: Holding Shares of MSCIFor me, this is a tough one. I like the company, but the shares are expensive. My current holdings of MSCI are relatively modest, and I'd be eager to get more exposure on a sustained pullback. However, for the last few years that unfortunately hasn't bee the case. So I'm holding on but not putting more money to work here right now. But what do you think? Is MSCI a company that you could see yourself investing in?"

(ADBE). Its digital imaging aids permeate the digital marketing community and the non-professional individual photographing community. Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Systems for macOS and Windows. Photoshop was created in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll. WikipediaHere is how dozens of software vendors' prospects are currently perceived by investment-market professionals.Figure 1(note: all materials from blockdesk.com have been approved for use in this article)Upside price rewards come from the behavioral analysis (of what to do right, not of errors) by Market-Makers [MMs] as they protect capital they must put at risk from possible damage from future price moves. Their forecasts of potential reward (best upside likely price change) are measured by the green horizontal scale.The risk dimension is of actual-experience price drawdowns at their most extreme point while being held in previous pursuit of upside rewards similar to the ones currently being seen. They are measured on the red vertical scale.Both scales are of percent change from zero to 25%. Any stock or ETF whose present risk exposure exceeds its reward prospect will be above the dotted diagonal line. Best reward-to-risk tradeoffs are to be found on this map at the frontier of alternatives, down and to the right.Currently the most-advantaged on just a risk~reward basis are MSCI, Inc. (MSCI) at location [5], MicroStrategy Incorporated (MSTR) at [9] and Ellie Mae, Inc. (ELLI) and LogMeIn, Inc. (LOGM) at [2].This map is a good starting point, but it can only cover some of the investment characteristics that often should influence an investor’s choice of where to put his/her capital to work. The table in Figure 2 covers the above considerations and several others.Figure 2The Figure 2 table has two distinctive parts. The first 4 numeric data columns [B]-[E] are products of the analysis of current behavior of market professionals. Those columns and the one headed Range Index report what that behavior implies about the current expectations of investment professionals for the likely range of stock or ETF prices in the coming 3-4 months.The remaining columns report what actual market price activity produced when prior forecasts for each stock similar to those of today were used to manage investments under a common portfolio discipline. The Range Index column tells what percentage of each stock’s current forecast lies below the current market price. Under the Sample Size column heading a count of the number of prior forecasts with Range Indexes like today’s is indicated, along with the total number of all forecasts available from the past 5 years of market days.Thinking about the credibility of the current forecasts, the proportion of those similar prior forecasts that could produce a capital gain profit becomes a significant measure. It demonstrates the capability of the forecasters to be helpful to the wealth-building investor. Its proportion as a percent of the prior forecasts sample is in the column headed Win Odds.The Win Odds has an important impact on the Realized Payoff column next to it, where the NET gains of all the prior forecasts in the sample are reported. These results include the actual losses taken under our standard portfolio management discipline TERMD, applied to all forecast situations. TERMD sets the top of each implied price range forecast as a sell target for that single forecast. When first reached within the next 3 months’ closing market price that forecast position is closed so that the expanded capital can be immediately reinvested the following market day. If not reached in 3 months the position is closed and reinvested, regardless of gain or loss.The Risk~Reward Tradeoff map of Figure 1 presents upside forecast prospects to be pitted against actual prior worst-case downside price exposures during TERMD holding periods. The flavor of the prospective reward carrot, the column headed in the Figure 2 table as %Upside Sell Target, was muted there by the worst-tasting next-column experience headed Maximum Drawdown.That point is viewed as the most likely high-stress point to cause an untimely termination of the adventure. A termination then would be at the least productive, most damaging point. Instead, committing the discipline’s full 3-month time investment (but not beyond) might achieve potential recovery to profitability, perhaps even to reach the forecast sell targetBetween the target “cup” and the %Payoff “lip” serious adjustments to commitment enthusiasms can (and usually may) occur. They are indicated by the column headed Cred.Ratio where the Realized Payoff accomplishment is contrasted with the %Upside Sell Target offering.This more critical Reward~Risk comparison draws on the Win Odds (and its complement) to condition the Realized Payoff and the Maximum Drawdown as indicated in the Odds-Weighted columns.Figure 2’s rows provide all these important dimensions issue by issue for the more promising securities in Figure 1. They are accompanied by similar boldfaced measures of SPY to give a taste of “the market” as most frequently observed by the investing public.At the bottom of the table simple averages of the listed stocks offer comparisons of the group with SPY and with a much broader population of over 2,700 stocks and ETFs as measured on this day. The full population data often reveals overly optimistic sell targets and abysmal payoff results. In contrast, the population’s “top10” issues, ranked by their odds-weighted prior forecast histories, typically present annual rates of capital accumulation in the +75% to +90% range and even above, as they do now.Often the more attractive issues fairly quickly resolve their (for whatever reason) underpriced condition, producing a “speed” of capital gain which enriches the CAGR of a portfolio. A more useful condition to those investors whose situations face potential time-defined financial needs to be met by the portfolio sooner than it would likely be able to satisfy. An Active Investment Management strategy able to selectively shift capital into and out of such opportunities often is a solution to such needs.One tool to identify the presence of such opportunities, and to choose between them, is show in Figure 3.Figure 3The orientation of this map is like that of the Reward~Risk Tradeoffs in Figure 1; good is down and to the right, not-so is up and to the left. Items in the white Payoffs area at left have achieved average Win Odds by amounts less than 80 out of 100, and those in the extreme upper left corner may also have had negative % payoffs from prior forecasts at current RI-levels.Present market prospects, as represented by SPDR S&P500 Index ETF (SPY) at location [1] offer coming price change payoffs better than some Software stocks and less than others. But it does so at very high historical odds of performance in the next 3 months, based on its past 5 years’ price performance following forecasts like today’s.The more interesting alternatives here are those with high odds for a profitable investment experience, but with a better-than-market-index prospect. Best of the group in payoff prospect is MSTR at [4], but its profitability odds fall to only 2 out of 3. The odds for ELLI at [9] rise to 8 of 10, and MSCI at [2] has an almost 19 out of 20 history.Best odds in the group is Blackbaud, Inc. (BLKB), provider of software support to organizations seeking donations from supporting charitable donors. Its only caution is that the stock’s current forecast is so attractive (a low Range Index of 1) that in 5 years that has only happened 24 times – less than once in ten weeks, on average. But it has been followed by reaching its sell target each time, in about two months – 45 market days. A small, but powerful, credible sample.Perhaps best-known to investment professionals is MSCI, Inc.(NYSE:MSCI), a spin-out of Morgan Stanley which originated from the creation of price indexes for groups of market securities, used by analysts and money managers internal to the parent. The independent (?) company now offers investment decision support tools to the entire investment industry.More familiar to individuals may be LogMein (LOGM), a provider of internet cloud-based communication services assisting group meetings free of attendee re-location inconveniences, along with other communication services.Opportunities for near price-change capital gains appear to be better among less-well-known vendors of software and related services than for some giants, like Adobe (ADBE) or Microsoft (MSFT). The prospect for double-digit gains at a double-digit basis-points per day rate exist in BLKB, MSCI, and LOGM, making them attractive as buys in an Active Investment Management strategy such as TERMD."
4314747,104855,2019-12-31T17:03:49-05:00,MSCI is the sole leader with the most technically advanced products in the ESG related portfolio construction and analytics market.We anticipate that strong upsell opportunities of the recently acquired large fund customers will accelerate the revenue growth rate of ESG related products in the near future.The stock price can reach new all-time highs above $270 over the next twelve months.,"In our first article on MSCI Inc. (MSCI), we will focus on the market opportunity and business development activities regarding the ESG related products and solutions. Our bullish investment thesis is built around the fact that the company has an early market advantage as well as a competitive edge over its competitors when it comes to strong deep domain knowledge of the ESG analytics solutions market. The company will continue to bring to the market new sophisticated ESG forecasting models and other analytics solutions. That will simplify the entire investment decision process for portfolio managers so they can construct investment portfolios with a high share of companies with excellent ESG ratings. Given that MSCI is trading at a premium compared to its direct peers, we believe that the company can offset some potential headwinds of its passive investing business. Furthermore, we anticipate successful commercialization of ESG related products to large enterprise customers including funds over $20 billion in AUM over the next several years.(Source: Investor Presentation)We believe that there is a lot of upside potential in the ESG addressable market opportunity as plenty of major asset management firms are significantly promoting their ESG related funds to clients and raising ESG integrated AUM as well. For instance, the UBS Asset Management division (UBS) is already involved in the sustainable investing business for the last 20 years. It has managed to raise $231 billion in ESG integrated AUM so far. MSCI management stated that market penetration of ESG ratings in use among large investors (more than $20 billion in AUM) is expected to expand from 30% to 50% between 2018-2021. In addition, it believes that it has a great upsell opportunity to existing clients by offering them additional advanced ESG related analytics solutions or industry themed reports combined with any kind of mandatory regulatory or compliance-related solutions. Given the increasing market demand for ESG related financial instruments over the last decade, plenty of data providers other than MSCI are trying to dominate the market and expand their market share as well. However, MSCI management is confident that it can maintain its leading position in the market due to its deep domain knowledge of the portfolio construction business.One of the unique angles the company has over its competitors is an intelligent use of a vast amount of data to fit the entire investment decision framework whether a certain company meets ESG criteria or not. For instance, minor data vendors might offer certain ESG related metrics; however, MSCI does a better job to incorporate that vast amount of data into the broader context of asset allocation, risk management, and portfolio construction. Another example is a recent acquisition of Carbon Delta, which enables the company to help its customers to properly evaluate portfolio impact of climate change. Management stated that the government of Japan already promotes a climate-related financial disclosure and there are no other solutions currently present on the market. We believe that the company will be able to address and solve complex problems when it comes down to ESG related asset management or risk analytics in the near future. Therefore, it will be able to maintain a strong market leadership position due to the widening of its domain knowledge gap compared to its key competitors and smaller data providers.(Source: Investor Presentation)MSCI offers a wide range of ESG products including ESG ratings and research reports of plenty of publicly listed companies, various equity & fixed income indexes for construction of ESG related portfolios, as well as risk analytics solutions and ESG reporting capabilities. Consequently, portfolio managers have all of the available tools to construct market-leading ESG portfolios or to meet increasing ESG regulatory requirements.(Source: MSCI website)According to the figure above, MSCI offers an ESG rating scale which helps investors to determine whether a company has a poor or excellent ESG related governance. If we take for example an oil mining company with a poor ESG rating, then a particular company would most likely face the following issues: (1) a corruption of its management board, (2) has a bad procedures when it comes down to pollution of the environment by spilling oil into the sea, or (3) have a low safety requirements of its production facilities leading to a frequent injuries of its workforce. If investors or large asset management funds hold such a company in their portfolio, they might face significant losses because of its operational inefficiencies. In addition, they might even destroy their public reputation, in the case of a major oil spill. Such an example was the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 when an oil rig operated by British Petroleum (BP) exploded. Therefore, we anticipate that ESG related indicators or ratings will become even more important for investment decision purposes in the near future, which puts MSCI on a very strong position to capitalize on this emerging trend. Management has been very active in the M&A market so far by looking for new opportunities to bring additional ESG analytics solutions to its customers.MSCI has recently acquired a Swiss company Carbon Delta which will help the company to maintain its leading position in the ESG analytics market by providing additional information on climate change metrics to investors. As a result of this acquisition, MSCI will receive a modeling technology to run a forward-looking climate scenario analysis that will enable the company to create a new tool for investors - MSCI Climate value at risk. A particular tool that basically quantifies a climate risk for the company’s market value and helps investors to diversify away particular climate-related risks. We believe that MSCI will prioritize any kind of similar acquisitions in the near future with a key focus on climate change-related analytics.That will enable fund managers to make wise investment decisions when constructing ESG related portfolios. In addition, they will have an easier task to explain to their clients why a certain investment fits certain ESG criteria as well as to comply with any kind of mandatory ESG related regulations or requirements.Management has been looking to expand existing partnerships with well-established stock market data providers to offer innovative indexes which include ESG ratings and investment criteria as well. The company can offer its ESG related analytics to stock market data providers for an exchange for certain data licenses, which MSCI uses to construct its indexes. One such example is a recent partnership with Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).MSCI has already developed ESG themed Bloomberg Barclays fixed income indexes on the market. Investor can select the following indexes:Bloomberg Barclays MSCI Socially Responsible (SRI) IndicesBloomberg Barclays MSCI Sustainability IndicesBloomberg Barclays MSCI ESG-Weighted IndicesBloomberg Barclays MSCI Green Bond IndicesApart from partnerships with ICE and Bloomberg Barclays, we believe that the company is well-positioned to conduct similar deals with other global major stock exchange operators as well. For instance, the Hong Kong stock exchange might consider developing its own related HSI branded ESG equity indices and would most likely consider MSCI related ESG metrics to do so while offering an equity data licensing bundle at a discount. Therefore, we believe that additional investments in the development of the ESG metrics and analytics will have a positive impact on the operational leverage of the company. For example, it will be a major contributor to drive additional revenue growth. In addition, the management can use it as a bargaining tool to sweeten a deal when it comes down to data licensing products, thus leading to lower data licensing-related costs and the overall operational expenses.(Source: Investor Presentation)In general, MSCI has a very strong financial model with a high share of diversified recurring revenues. In addition, it has an efficient operating model that enables the company to increase its operational leverage as it grows in size combined with a robust free cash flow generation. For instance, the company has a very high FCF yield of roughly 44% because of supportive underlying market dynamics and the strong moat it has in the asset management and portfolio construction & analytics business. We anticipate that the company will be able to maintain a high cash flow generation in the near future because of its consistently improving operational leverage as it continues to grow recurring revenue. In fact, the operating margin has improved from 37.5% to 47.9% between FY 15 and FY 18.(Source: 10-Q Filing)According to the figure above, total revenue was up 10.15% y/y in Q3 '19, exceeding analysts' consensus estimates by a slight margin of 1.4%. The growth was primarily driven by both index and all-other segments both reaching a total revenue growth of more than 12% y/y in Q3 '19. The highest growing business segment was in the ESG related indices reaching a recurring subscription revenue growth of 31% y/y in the period between January and September 2019. We anticipate that the recurring subscription revenue mix will continue to increase to over 80% over the next couple of years. For example, it was 73.1% of total revenue in Q3 '19 compared to 67.8% of total revenue in Q3 '18. Such a high portion of subscription-based revenue makes a resilient business model, which could protect dividend payments in the case of the U.S. recession. In fact, subscription revenue is geographically diversified as well, as the highest growing region has been Asia-Pacific over the last several years. Future recurring subscription growth will be supported by the most recent BlackRock (BLK) contract extension for another 10 years, thus leading to a lower license rates BlackRock pays to MSCI. Therefore, BlackRock will be able to offer certain ETFs at lower expense ratios. Nevertheless, both companies expect a higher inflow in the particular ETFs that will offset any kind of revenue decline coming from expense ratios. In our view, extended BlackRock-MSCI strategic partnership will be of crucial importance for ESG related indices, as BlackRock might be able to offer ESG related ETFs at lower expense ratios thus leading to a higher interest among investors and fund inflows. Apart from that, market demand for ESG related investing products has been stronger in Europe, while in the U.S., it has been lagging so far. Therefore, there is a significant opportunity for future ESG related subscription growth once the preference of investors or even regulatory changes boost demand in the U.S.(Source: FinViz)If we take a look at a bullish rectangular pattern on the chart above, a purple line represents a key resistance point, while the blue line represents a key support level. After the better than expected Q3 '19 earnings results in November 2019, the sentiment has been excellent so far, as the stock price increased roughly 20% over the last two months. The current 50 SMA and 20 SMA are both around $250 level or roughly 10% above the longer-term 200 SMA line, which indicates a strong momentum of the present uptrend. We anticipate that as long as the current bullish sentiment persists, the stock price will most likely continue to test all-time highs above the key resistance level at $270.00. On the other hand, in the case of weaker-than-expected Q4 '19 earnings results or provided outlook for FY 2020, the stock price might decline below $240.00 and later on even below the key blue-purpled support line on the chart at approximately $220.00.Shares are now trading at forward P/E and EV/REV multiple of ~40.8x and ~15.3x, respectively. Both multiples are trading at a hefty premium compared to the direct peer group and the S&P 500 market average forward P/E multiple of ~19.1. We believe that a further market expansion of the ESG related business combined with an extracted value from the most recent or any kind of future ESG-related acquisitions might support the stock price to test new highs above the $270. Consequently, a forward EV/REV multiple might reach more than ~16.5x what makes up a ~10% upside or a price target of roughly $285 over the next twelve months. However, we would like to warn our readers that a particular forward EV/REV level is at a quite high level compared to both the peer group and the company’s historical multiple. Therefore, a better short-term trading strategy might be to wait for a potential momentum-driven dip in the stock price, without any kind of fundamental reasoning behind it.(Source: Morningstar)According to the figure above, the company has reported a record-high dividend of $2.72 in 2018 which makes up a dividend yield (TTM) of roughly 1%. In addition, the company reported a quarterly dividend of $0.68 over the most recent two quarters in 2019 or $0.10 higher on a YoY basis. On the other hand, major peers S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) and Moody’s Corp. (NYSE:MCO) offer a slightly lower dividend yield (TTM) of approximately 0.85%. The dividend payout ratio has been moderate at approximately 35% over the last couple of years. One of the reasons for such a lower ratio is the company’s plan to reward its shareholders with consistent share repurchases and to invest capital in additional growth projects like the ESG related analytics. As such, we recommend dividend investors to consider allocating MSCI in their longer-term portfolio, given that it offers a current total yield (TTM) of 5.25%, which is supported by (1) a strong moat when it comes down to the index investing business, (2) flexible business model to offset any kind of significant headwinds by controlling payroll related expenses, and (3) free cash flow generation.We believe that management has done an excellent job to acquire companies such as Carbon Delta to bring new advanced climate-related solutions to the market, which will create a strong value proposition for end-customers. In addition, it differentiates the company’s ESG related offerings even more compared to its competitors, which protects its leadership position in the market. In our view, the company is on the right track to successfully commercialize ESG products by targeting the new as well as existing accounts in the large fund market with a great upsell opportunities over the next several years. In our view, the revenue growth of the ESG business will be supported by positive underlying market dynamics. Furthermore, an increasing number of investors and asset management firms will have to include a higher number of companies with an above-average ESG rating in their portfolios due to a better chance of reaching a higher alpha or to meet regulatory requirements. Based on our valuation analysis, we see the upside potential of 10% to $285 and the downside potential of 15% to $220 over the next couple of quarters. Key risks remain worse than expected sales execution of the new large fund accounts, which might select other data providers on the market. Furthermore, any kind of changes in the underlying ESG market trends or investors' preference to not include a high share of companies with a strong ESG profile might negatively impact the company’s commercial activities."
4313812,104609,2019-12-23T09:35:25-05:00,"MSCI has been one of the best performing stocks as demand for their indices has risen with passive investing.Now that ETF issuers are struggling with expense ratio pressure, MSCI may struggle with its high licensing fees and lose AUM performance fees.While their Analytics business looks strong, the possibility of a pop to the ""Passive bubble"" could catalyze negative revenue growth for MSCI.Given the company's high valuation and my revenue expectations, I believe MSCI stock will eventually fall under $170.","MSCI (MSCI) has been a primary benefactor of the rise of index and ETF investing over the past decade. Since 2010, the share of the U.S. equity market in passive investing has risen from around 20% to over 50% today. The number of ETFs has also risen from 2500 in 2010 to over 6500 today. Most amazingly, the number of indices rose to over 3.7 million in 2018 (70X higher than the number of public stocks), however, this figure has since fallen to just under 3 million.MSCI is a leader in indices as that is their ""bread and butter"" business. This meteoric rise of passive over active has meant significant revenue gains to MSCI. That said, MSCI's stock price is now increasing at a much faster pace than the company's revenue as shown below:Data by YChartsIn fact, they now trade at the extremely high valuation of 14.6X TTM revenue. Investors are obviously expecting extremely large revenue and margin expansion over the coming years.But, what if that growth does not come? Looking at their 3Q 2019 presentation we can see that the bulk of their sales comes from their Index data (46%) and Analytics (42.5%). While these are mainly recurring revenue streams, pressures are mounting in the business.This includes loss of spending power on behalf of ETF issuers due to intense recent expense ratio cutting, which will almost certainly result in license fee reductions either by demand from clients or by growing competition. Remember, it is not very hard to create an equity index (speaking from personal experience).Even more, there is considerable evidence that passive investing has created market distortions that will eventually lead to its underperformance. If this occurs, it will be MSCI who takes the biggest hit.Given the expected pressures on MSCI's core business, I would not assume they will continue to grow revenue at the current pace over the next few years (if at all). That said, the market seems to believe that MSCI's growth will continue in an exponential line upward.To begin, take a look at the company's income data over the past few years:Data by YChartsAs you can see, they have seen their revenue nearly triple since 2010. While this is a very strong growth rate, there is little reason to believe it will continue into the 2020s for reasons that will be explained in the following section.Interestingly, they managed to grow revenue during the Financial Crisis which is logical considering many investors were moving toward passive investing. This may mean investors today do not believe MSCI has cyclical risk. This is partly true, but it seems clear they have more cyclical risk than in the past as data suggests passive investing itself may be in a bubble. More on this in the following section.Moving on, take a look at their margin data over the past decade and a half:Data by YChartsThey have grown gross and net margins likely due to growth in their higher-margin indexing business. That said, operating margins and revenue per employee which are my preferred metrics have been pretty stagnant. Because revenue per employee has not increased too much, they may have difficulty expanding revenue due to the historically tight financial services labor market.At any rate, the company is extremely expensive. Take a look at their valuation data below:Data by YChartsThe current average valuation for U.S. large-caps is 24X and the long-run median is 15X. This means that, given no improvement in margins, the company will need to increase sales by 60% to 150% in order to fit the large shoes investors have given them. Personally, considering the large squeeze on margins across the financial services industry and growing competitive pressures, I seriously doubt they will be able to achieve such growth.The major issue I see with MSCI is growing pressure in the Financial Services industry to cut costs. As I mentioned earlier, barriers to entry in the index providing business are extremely low.Issuers are becoming increasingly interested in 'self-indexing' where they simply design their own indices to avoid paying hefty fees for using MSCI's. There has been talk of this risk for years, but now that expense ratios have hit extreme lows it may override the ""network effect"" inertia of index providers. In fact, the company Research Affiliates is working on backtesting tools that aim to make the ""self-indexing"" process even easier for issuers.When secular economic trends are favorable, the big get bigger. As passive investing has become increasingly popular and ETF issuers have seen strong income growth, they have had little reason to doubt the high fees paid to index providers and really have limited incentive in self-indexing. That said, there is mounting evidence that money flows may shift back toward active.As a personal example, I mainly cover ETFs and see the great value they provide, but have found considerable valuation differences today between sectors that have increased my interest in stocks. Borrowing a chart from a past article I wrote ""Michael Burry Is Correct About Passive Investing: Here Is The Proof"" we can clearly see that the larger a company is, the lower is its earnings yield:(Seeking Alpha)As a company's market cap rises, it fits into more and more indices which means passive ETF flows will rise. This often further increases the company's market capitalization and sometimes ends with persistent outperformance in what is known as the well-studied ""index effect"".More research is needed to know the true extent of this problem, but considering a major value pitch of ETF issuers and index providers is the ""Outperformance of Passive"", this is highly problematic. Not only would a hit to total ETF AUM slow licensing growth and put negative pressure on fees, but would also directly cut their asset-base performance fee revenue.Now, one could rightly argue that the ""Analytics"" side of their business would gain from a move back toward active. Looking at their revenue gained from analytics and the specific tools they offer, this appears to be a stronger part of their business. Still, barriers to entry in the software business are relatively low and that they will be facing an uphill battle.MSCI is certainly an innovative firm, but we are reaching a point where customer growth in the industry is fading and businesses will need to more directly compete with each other.We are already seeing price competition among ETF issuers. Index providers have been generally immune, but a small crack toward self-indexing will likely quickly turn into a significant wedge as network effects supporting indexers fade. If there is indeed a ""Passive bubble"", its popping will likely act as a major catalyst for this.Again, I find MSCI's Analytics business impressive, but again it seems clear that growing competition will slow growth. Remember, for MSCI to be at fair-value today the company must achieve very high revenue growth so any negative pressures will likely drastically lower its valuation.In all likelihood, I believe their revenue and income five years from now will be about the same as it is today due to expected price pressure and difficulties finding new customers. Given the 15-24X ""fair"" P/E ratio for large-caps, this gives us a target price of $100-$170. Due to its high momentum, I would not short the stock today, but I may do so in the next few weeks or months."
4070544,76785,2017-05-08T08:34:32-04:00,"MSCI has a stranglehold on the institutional investor data content market.After a hiccup related to Vanguard moving assets off MSCI indexing several years ago, shares have tripled.EBITDA growth, however, has trailed the stock price expansion. Investors now must cough up 18x EBITDA to buy a piece of MSCI.While growth remains likely, shares do need to come down to get my personal interest on the long side.","MSCI (NYSE:MSCI) is a dominant player in the ETF and equity analytics space, but that position is not impenetrable. Shareholders have short-term memories, but many are not apt to forget when Vanguard moved a vast majority of its funds that were benchmarked against MSCI products back in 2012, instead deciding to utilize FTSE. As a result of that move, nearly $100B in AUM related to Vanguard ETFs suddenly shifted away from MSCI licensing - but it proved to be nothing but a tiny bump on MSCI's path, as revenue and EBITDA still grew despite that loss of business. Fears around a mass exodus away from MSCI products proved unfounded, and MSCI rallied.And, rally it did. While operating income increased nearly 50% from 2013 to 2016, the equity ran well ahead of those results; the stock tripled. EV/EBITDA valuation multiples have doubled, and the company now trades at nearly 18x EV/EBITDA. Valuations at those levels are incredibly steep, and even in this overheated market, tough to justify. Are there enough tailwinds to warrant buying MSCI today?Business Overview, Deep Dive Into Operating SegmentsSo, what makes MSCI so special? The company offers a wide variety of applications and services to support institutional clients that are trying to navigate the investment space. Analytical models, ratings benchmarking, equity analysis, asset class insight - these are all part of the MSCI product suite, and customers like hedge funds, endowments, and private wealth investors are more than willing to pay top dollar for it in order to get any edge they can on improving returns and limiting unnecessary risk-taking. Depth across MSCI product lines has been increasing, and the company has been having a much easier time of late cross-selling; 47% of customers had access to MSCI's full suite of products at the end of Q1 2017, as opposed to 38% a year earlier. Wells Fargo's (NYSE:WFC) cross-selling issues set aside, the technique is a viable and important tool in the business handbook, because the more a customer is intertwined with a seller's products, the easier time that seller will have with retention. Retention rates, while already high, are up 170bps over the past year (95.2% to 96.9%).The company organizes into three reporting segments: Index, Analytics, and All Other. Even though the company's products are targeted towards big money investors, even some retail investors likely recognize the MSCI name because of the company's Index products. In this segment, MSCI benefits from the use of its indexes globally, including index-linked product creation (where it receives a cut based on AUM) and performance benchmarking. Given the rapid rise in ETF products over the past decade, this is what I would call the growth segment of the company - and also the one most important to current operating revenue and EBITDA. Granularly, more than half of revenue and an incredibly four-fifths of EBITDA are generated within the Indexing segment. Because of this, MSCI exists as it does today primarily because of its market position here.As of the most recent 10-K, MSCI claims to calculate over 180,000 different global equity indexes, so it isn't a surprise to see management also claim that 97 of the top 100 global asset managers license equity indexes from the firm. Over the past several years, the aforementioned vigorous growth in the ETF space has driven continued strength in subscription revenue and usage fees. Asset-based fee revenue growth has been strong as well, as MSCI has benefited higher AUM in ETFs (12% CAGR over past three years) linked to MSCI indexes, which now stands at $555B. Margins, which are already stellar (adjusted EBITDA margin of 70.8% in Q1 2017), have continued to improve; no surprise, given the negligible marginal costs of providing further or expanded service to new and existing clients.There are risks, and the Vanguard incident may not be isolated. Increasingly, asset managers and investment banks are creating their own range of indexes via collaboration with index providers, or simply creating their own proprietary indexes. While MSCI currently relies on its brand recognition and deep integration of its products with current clients, there is no guarantee clients don't walk or push for lower rates, particularly in the current investing environment where focus continues to lie on cost cutting versus revenue generation. CEO Henry Fernandez had this to say recently about talk in the industry on self-indexing:The Analytics segment is, at least for now, stagnant. While there are bright spots (regulation use cases for banking clients, equity modeling), adjusted EBITDA fell marginally y/y on declining margin, primarily due to a competitive environment. MSCI has been investing heavily in new initiatives in order to drive future top-line growth, but management has acknowledged the continued pressure on pricing given the weak market for active management. I do, however, like the product mix here. The BarraOne product suite (which includes Portfolio Manager, Equity Models, and Aegis) is well-known, and my own limited experience with the products is quite favorable. Customers can utilize a variety of functions, from stress testing, performance attribution, backtesting, and data management. For investors that are looking to make informed investment decisions as quickly as possible, the products here are unrivaled in terms of helping guide investment decisions. To drive growth going forward, management is taking the common sense approach, looking to integrate client-facing applications and increase focus on client-centric services and solutions. Over the past several years, I suspect management focus has been elsewhere (the Index segment and high growth within ESG, spoken on below), and it's time for the Analytics business to get a little more love.The Other segment is relatively immaterial to performance results, but it does have some supportive businesses that likely help keep customers interested in the MSCI business. The two primary businesses here are MSCI's Environmental, Social, and Governance Reporting (""ESG"") division, which helps investors make decisions based on sustainability and social factors that may not be captured through conventional analysis, and the Real Estate product business, built upon real estate risk management and a comprehensive databank, which allows customers to improve returns and enhance understanding of their markets, all the way from a local to global level.Financials, Mergers & Acquisition ActivityEBITDA at MSCI has been on a steady rise since 2013, which (not coincidentally) coincides with a blistering ramp-up in Index subscriptions (13 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth). The sale of its ISS business for $367M in April of 2014, an EBITDA positive product line, also contributed to the slight stall seen throughout 2014. Since that time, however, strength in Indexing, driven by ETF inflow activity into MSCI-linked products, has consistently created strong growth in asset-based fee revenue in the Index segment, pushing EBITDA upward.EBITDA margins have expanded as well, in-line with expectations given the light marginal costs associated with handling new business, particularly in the Index segment where segment EBITDA margins are greater than 70%. Given MSCI's high-growth business is also its highest margin, EBITDA margin acceleration is only normal. Investors need to remember that long-run margin targets for the Analytics and Other businesses are only mid-30s, and any snap back in growth there, or a retreat in growth for Indexing, will be dilutive to margin. However, given targeted long-term growth rates there are mid to single digits, investors would need to see a significant about face in trends within the ETF business for that to become an issue in the short term.It is important to note that MSCI has essentially borrowed cash to repurchase stock. The company bought back nearly $2B in common stock from 2014 to 2016, while generating less than $1B in free cash flow. Net debt/EBITDA leverage remains low (2.2x), so there is little concern there, but it remains to be seen if management will continue to be willing to retire shares at the rate it has been, particularly with the company's valuation today being as steep as it is. No further debt offerings will be needed to continue on this path, as MSCI has $800M in cash on its balance sheet, and working capital/capital expenditure needs are light to maintain this business. Debt ratings remain a notch below investment grade, not unusual for small or mid-caps, with most ratings agencies listing customer concentration (25% of revenue within top 10 customers) as a main sticking point for avoiding an investment grade rating.ValuationFiscal 2017 guidance remained unchanged at the end of Q1, with management guiding for $340M in free cash flow at the mid-point. 3.7% free cash flow yield is incredibly thin, and it's a tough valuation to get behind, even with expected 10% growth in year/year operating cash flow. I've always had an incredibly tough time pulling the trigger on quality companies that never quite seem to get down to valuations I find palatable, and this one falls into that bucket as well. I'd snap at the chance to pick up shares 25% below where they are today, but that may not occur. MSCI is a great company with a solid moat and firm long-term prospects, but like many other companies in today's market, it has been relegated to my watch list as just a potential buy at the right price.For deep-dive research on asymmetric risk/reward plays in the Industrial and Basic Materials sectors (particularly small and mid-caps), consider investing alongside me and other subscribers within Industrial Insights.

(MSCI) delivered a strong quarter with mid-single digit revenue growth and double-digit operating income growth. The company should continue to thrive in the next few years thanks to (1) continual popularity of passive investing over active investing, (2) greater emphasis on ESG investments, and (3) strong interest in private-asset investments. However, its shares are trading at an expensive valuation right now. Therefore, we do not view the current risk and reward profile as attractive. In fact, we think investors should wait for a pullback.Data by YChartsMSCI delivered a solid quarter as the company saw its operating revenues increased by 6.2% year over year. Thanks to its economies of scale, the company was able to deliver a growth of 10.9% in its operating income. As can be seen from the chart, its operating margin increased from 47.8% in Q2 2018 to 49.9% in Q2 2019. The company also delivered quarterly retention rate of 95.5% This was the best we have seen in the past 10 years. The high retention rate and operating margin expansion are signs of the strength in its business.Source: Q2 2019 Press ReleaseWe continue to like MSCI for the following reasons:The shift towards passive investing continues to provide a long-term tailwind to its businessMSCI has benefited from the growing trend of passive investing in the past decade. In the past decade, passive management assets under management has increased from less than $1 trillion in 2009 to over $3.5 trillion in 2018 (see chart below).Source: CNBC via MorningstarIn fact, AUMs in ETFs linked to MSCI’s indexes have increased from $744.7 billion in Q2 2018 to $819.3 billion in Q2 2019. This was an increase of 10% year over year.Source: Q2 2019 ReportThe good news is that this trend towards passive investing appears not to stop anytime soon. According to a report by Moody’s, the firm projects that market share of passive investing AUMs will surpass the market share of active management AUMs in 2021. Therefore, we expect MSCI to continue to grow its revenue at least in the next few years. In addition, we also expect operating margin expansion in the next few years because operating expenses do not increase proportionately as the revenue increases.Source: Thereformedbroker.comThe increasing popularity of ESG in investing will become the next strong growth driverWe think MSCI’s entrance into providing ESG (environmental, social, governance) analysis is a big plus because according to a survey done to a group of attendants to an investing conference, more than a third of the asset managers said they expect to see the share of global assets operating on ESG principles to more than double from about 25% today to between 50% ~ 65% in the net five years. In addition, about 31% of the audience believe a lack of high-quality metrics is the biggest barrier to integrating ESG into mainstream investment. Therefore, we think MSCI is well-positioned to benefit from this growing trend in the next few years.Source: Investor Day PresentationPrivate asset opportunitiesAnother huge opportunity that MSCI can capture in the long-term is in private asset investing. This is because institutional investors are increasing allocations to private assets to achieve desired returns. MSCI is uniquely positioned as it has built an investment management decision making tools (mostly in the real estate market) to help its clients to allocate their capitals.Source: Investor Day PresentationThis opportunity is huge as the AUMs by private asset class is expected to grow from $6.8 trillion in 2017 to $11.5 trillion in 2023.Source: Investor Day PresentationAlthough MSCI managed to increase its revenue slightly even in the time of the Great Recession, we think things will be different in the next recession. This is because funds flow into passive investment strategies have increased significantly in the past few years. Passive investments represent over 45% of the market share in the U.S. equity today. At the beginning of the bull market (2009/2010), active investments still had a nearly 3 to 1 advantage over passive investments. As a result, MSCI benefited greatly from this passive investment trend, as many ETFs today track MSCI’s indexes. Now that passive investing has gained a sizable share, it will likely be inevitable to see revenue decline in a market correction or an economic recession. In such a scenario, investors may redeem capitals out of these passive and active funds. This will reduce the AUM of these ETFs that tracks MSCI’s indexes as well. This will negatively impact MSCI's revenue as the company's subscription and licensing revenue depends on the size of these AUMs.Shares of MSCI have surged by nearly 64% since the beginning of this year. As a result, its forward P/E ratio has expanded to 38.48x. This is significantly higher than its 5-year average of 26.39x. Therefore, we believe its shares are richly valued.Data by YChartsA 1%-yielding dividendMSCI currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share. This is equivalent to a dividend yield of about 1%. The company has consistently increased its dividend in the past 5 years since it started paying a dividend in late 2014.Data by YChartsWe continue to see MSCI to thrive in the next few years thanks to several trends that we have outlined in our article. However, we do not see the current price as an attractive entry point. Trading at a forward P/E ratio of 38.48x, MSCI is over 12x multiples above its 5-year average. We think investor should wait for a meaningful pullback before initiating a position."

Profit margins are now 39% of revenue.The continued shift to passive investing, ESG investing, and low mutual-fund to GDP ratios in China/India will likely propel growth for years to come.MSCI's business has a moat because new index providers have so far failed to gain meaningful traction.","Anybody involved in financial markets should be familiar with the name MSCI (NYSE:MSCI). MSCI stands for Morgan Stanley Capital International and was spun off from Morgan Stanley in a 2007 IPO. MSCI is known for its indexes but many people don't realize there is a company behind it - and a really profitable one. If you've invested in MSCI since the IPO in 2007, the total return would have been 851% -that's a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 20%. MSCI is still an $18 billion market cap company, and this article explains why this above average growth can continue.IndexMSCI has 2 main operating segments, Index and Analytics. Index is the part where MSCI constructs global (equity) indices that are well known globally. The company constructs indexes geographically (MSCI World, MSCI Europe, MSCI Emerging markets) as well as size and sector orientated ( MSCI small cap, MSCI utilities, etc.). The company earns money in 2 ways: asset based fees and recurring subscription revenue. Asset based fees consist of assets that are linked to or track the MSCI benchmark. Based on the recent Q1 2019 report, the company earns 2.88 bps from ETF issuers that link their ETF to an MSCI index.As per Q1 2019, the company had 7,000 clients spanning over 90 countries. The most important client is BlackRock, (known for its iShares ETF brand) which accounted for 11.9% of total revenues. 96% of the fees that BlackRock paid to MSCI were asset based fees. Not all revenues within the Index segment are based on AUM (assets under management). Actually 60% consists of recurring subscriptions and 40% is based on AUM fees. Clients subscribe to MSCI and use their indexes for many areas of the investment process, including index-linked product creation and performance benchmarking, as well as portfolio construction and rebalancing, and asset allocation.AnalyticsAlthough analytics and Index overlap in their offerings, the Analytics segment provides analytics such as risk management, performance attribution, risk and returns insights and various regulatory reporting data. This segment is comparable to companies like Bloomberg and FactSet Research Systems. Another growing revenue stream that is classified under “All other” is ESG and real estate. There is a growing demand among investors to invest ESG responsibly and MSCI's ESG indexes leverage this need.The analytics segment has less of a moat then the index segment because more companies provide the same analytics. The analytics operating segment is solely based on the subscription model.The main catalysts for MSCI are most probably growth of AUM in China and other emerging markets, and the continued shift to index-based investing versus active investing. For China and India, the mutual fund to GDP ratio is approximately 11-12%, whereas in the US this is 101%. These countries have ample room for growth and even a 5% increase in the ratio of China translates to $600 billion in extra AUM. Based on MSCI's most recent take rate of 2.88 bps this represents $170 million in additional revenue. MSCI's total FY 2018 revenue is now $1.4 billion. Of course this is conditional on the fact that the AUM is linked to MSCI's indexes. But it does outline the breadth of the total addressable market.Apart from geographical expansion, there is the continued shift from active to passive investing. Research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston shows that per December 2017, the passive share of global investing stood at 37% in the US, and this number is steadily increasing as shown below. The trajectory is clearly upwards and as the research explains, especially universities and endowments have been switching more to passive solutions.Source: MorningstarFurthermore, the shift is also happening in other countries where the passive share is still lower, so there should be ample growth left.The index business is a much better business than the asset management business. The main players in the index business are FTSE Russel, MSCI, Standard & Poor's and to a lesser extent Bloomberg. Compare this with the countless amount of ETF issuers and you can see that the indexing business is a better business than the asset management business.There are some threats. The Investors Chronicle reports that some ETF providers have begun to bypass the big indexing companies such as MSCI and have started to self-index. For example, WisdomTree and Goldman Sachs Asset Management manage funds, including ETFs, based on their own proprietary indexes.Also new index providers have emerged. For example, in the UK, BATS Europe launched 18 UK stock indices in June 2016 to compete with FTSE. However, evidence of ETF providers using smaller index providers remains limited. The MSCI brand does create trust and major wealth managers are noticing that clients are demanding the MSCI brand.These risks should be taken seriously, but for the moment, MSCI's index revenue that is based on AUM is growing fiercely as we will see below.MSCI Inc. is highly profitable. Revenue growth was 12.5% in FY 2018, but used to be in the high teens if you go back a couple of years. The index segment (58% of revenue), which earns money through asset based fees and subscriptions, grew 16.2% in FY 2018. Asset based fees specifically have grown the most with 21.9% while subscriptions grew 11.8%.Even in an environment where self-indexing has emerged and some ETF issuers have grown wary of index fees, MSCI has still managed to grow exceptionally. The analytics segment grew only 4.7%, but is only responsible for 33% of revenue. MSCI also creates ESG (Environment, Social and Governance) and Real Estate indexes and this is grouped under All-other. The segment is still only +/-10% of revenue but grew 22% in 2018. ESG is a major growth area because there is a growing need to inform investors as to what is ESG – responsible investing and what is not.Due to the nature of the revenue streams (subscription and asset based fees), margins are expanding as operating leverage kicks in. As you can see below, profit margins since the IPO have steadily increased upwards. EPS growth has been expanding very rapidly as well. EPS growth in FY 2018 was around 70%. This is also due to the continued repurchasing of shares. Total diluted weighted average share count at the end of 2018 stood at 89.7 million, while the number was 96.5 million in 2016.YChartsFurthermore, free cash flow grows consistently higher and is now at $560 million, approximately 50% of total revenue. The company is financially very stable. With regard to valuation, the current TTM PE ratio is 35, and as shown below, this is around its historical average. Considering the EPS growth, a PE ratio of 35 is quite reasonable, especially compared with some cloud stocks that are growing EPS with a slower pace or aren't generating any EPS in general.In my view, this company with an $18 billion market cap is still in its early innings of growth. Geographical expansion, ESG investing, and the continued shift to passive will support the growth. Revenue growth has actually been increasing to 12.5% in comparison to earlier years. Due to operating leverage (and share buybacks), profit margins are increasing and EPS growth is strong. The major threats are that ETF issuers are trying to find ways to bypass indexing fees by using smaller index providers and/or construct their own indexes. This trend has been going on for years but has not affected growth rates. At a PE ratio of 35, this stock is a buy and should be tucked away in your investment account. Take a look again in 5 years."
3986581,50662,2016-07-06T09:04:03-04:00,"MSCI remains a silent performer, with a 125% conversion rate net income:free cash flow in Q1 2016.
        Less than 1/3rd of the free cash flow is being used to pay the dividend, the remainder helped to fund a large buyback program.
        MSCI will reduce the pace of its share repurchase program, after 'overspending' on shareholder rewards.
        The current FCF yield is less than 5%, but due to the low capex intensivity of MSCI's business, I'm not ready to sell just yet.","IntroductionIn September of last year, I argued MSCI (NYSE:MSCI) could be an interesting addition to your portfolio as the company had a strong history of being profitable and generating a very respectable amount of free cash flow. I had a small position at $45/share and wasn't too keen in adding to that position at $60 and I preferred to wait for a pullback. That didn't come, and the company's share price is now trading at in excess of $75. Overvalued? Or was I too conservative?MSCI data by YChartsThe first quarter results are in, and MSCI remains an extremely capex-light companyMSCI's accompanying press release sounded very upbeat and after dissecting the financials in the SEC filings, the positive tone is definitely justified. The total revenue of MSCI increased by approximately 6% to $279M, but what's even more important is the fact the company was able to reduce its operating expenses by almost 5% to less than $166M. The lower operating expenses were predominantly caused by a lower COGS and R&D expense which mitigated the impact of the (slightly) higher amortization and depreciation rate.Source: SEC filingsYou don't need to be a rocket scientist to realize that a revenue increase combined with a reduced cost basis has a very positive impact on your operating income, which increased by more than 25% in MSCI's case. This also boosted the operating margin from 33.7% in Q1 FY 2015 to just in excess of 40% in the first quarter of this year. That's great, but the total result at the bottom line is less impressive as MSCI's interest expenses have doubled to almost $23M. The net income increased by 38% to $60.4M, which equalled $0.60 per share (thanks to the reduced share count).Based on the Q1 EPS, MSCI seems to be trading at approximately 30 times its annualized profit, which would be quite expensive, even for a relatively safe investment due to the robust business model. That's why it's also always important to have a look at a company's cash flow statements as well, and I'm particularly interested in the conversion rate of net income to free cash flow.Source: SEC filingsMSCI's operating cash flow in the first quarter of this year was $33M which would be a 50% decrease compared to the OpCF in the same quarter of last year, but as MSCI always have to deal with shifts in its working capital position, I feel it makes more sense to compared the adjusted operating cash flows, which isolate the impact of WC changes. By doing so, MSCI's adjusted operating cash flow in the first quarter of the year increased to $81M, and after deducting the $5.5M in capital expenditures (and capitalized development costs), the company's free cash flow was $75M in the first quarter of this year on an adjusted basis. And as you correctly notice, that's approximately 25% higher than the net income.Share buybacks seem to be the company's preferred way to allocate capital. Is this smart?With $75M in adjusted free cash flow in the first quarter of the year, you can do a lot to keep your shareholders happy. As MSCI's dividend is costing the company less than $22M (the impact from the dividend hike was mitigated by a much lower amount of shares outstanding), MSCI technically had $53M left to reward its shareholders.Source: SEC filingsIt didn't want to keep the cash inside the company but it financed approximately 15% of the total amount of buybacks with it. During the first quarter, MSCI spent almost $350M on share buybacks, repurchasing a total of almost 5 million shares (approximately 5% of the share count). It's obvious the company was overspending on these buybacks (it spent $300M more on share repurchases than it generated in 'distributable' free cash flow), but it's all part of MSCI's capital allocation plan.MSCI Shares Outstanding data by YChartsThese buybacks have been funded by issuing new debt, and that's why MSCI's net debt has increased from $801M to $1.14B. That's already quite high, but not alarming considering the relatively robust free cash flow profile of the company. It also looks like the most aggressive phase of the buyback program is behind us, as the company will not spend its cash 'smarter'. From the conference call:And I fully agree with this plan. I have never understood companies buying back stock no matter what the price was. I personally think a buyback program should always be implemented, but only be executed when the price is right and the company really is trading too cheap.Investment thesisThe annualized free cash flow is $300M, which actually doesn't make the company too expensive. Assuming the company will continue to repurchase shares but at a slower rate, it's not unlikely MSCI will end the year with just 90 or 91 million shares outstanding. This would result in a free cash flow of $3.33 per share, for an FCF yield of 4.5%. That's not cheap, but it's definitely acceptable for a company like MSCI.Once again, I won't buy more stock here, but I also won't sell my entire position. I will very likely reduce my stake by 25%, and perhaps write an out of the money call option on the remaining portion in my portfolio. I'm really glad I got in at around $45 per share which results in a pro forma free cash flow yield of 7.4%."
2136393,62463,2014-04-10T17:03:36-04:00,"MSCI, traditionally an index outperformer, has found it tougher since the Vanguard announcement.Fast forward to the present and the move has been, so far, more of a novelty with no other comparable changes to the benchmark landscape.It’s inevitably difficult to discern the appropriate valuation but at around $42 the market is implying 10% EPS growth annually for the next 10. We take a closer look here.","By Steven Carroll, Independent CommentatorIt is always difficult to evaluate an industry leader, as some kind of premium is embedded in the valuation to reflect its market share and industry-leading product. MSCI Inc. (NYSE:MSCI) is a classic example of such a challenge. How do you fairly account for the intangible value of its brand and assets and evaluate the likelihood of it retaining its flagship standards, particularly in an industry not overly enthusiastic about the commercial model it has historically employed?In one of the more interesting recent changes in the index business, Vanguard in 2012 made a change involving a large number of its funds that had been benchmarked against MSCI products. They moved to FTSE as well as to the University of Chicago's Center for Research in Security Prices (NASDAQ:CRSP). At the time, there were many commentators who heralded the end for MSCI and the stock fell 27% on the day of the announcement, assuming there would be a wave of benchmark changes as the large ETF players (Vanguard, State Street, BlackRock) started a broad trend of reducing their benchmark costs, at least in the equities space.Hedging the brandFast forward to the present and the move has been, so far, more of a novelty with no other comparable changes to the benchmark landscape. The challenge for an ETF vendor is ensuring that their brand is the draw for the investor, not the benchmark. Normally that is the case, but when a retail investor is thinking about large cap U.S. exposure, you can bet they're going to look for an S&P 500 product, with the issuer as more of an afterthought.MSCI has done well in adding other businesses that can capitalize on the use of its benchmarks, with a broad array of portfolio and risk analytics and dominance in ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) evaluation. That's an increasingly popular focus with developed market institutional investors, even if research on the investment performance of such an approach is mixed at best.The index landscape with a number of smaller providers is looking for a larger acquisitor. Barclays recently put its enormous (based on assets under management, or AUM) franchise on the block, the largest component of that being former Lehman Index products such as the Lehman Aggregate covering U.S. fixed income.In such a fluid environment, it's inevitably difficult to discern the appropriate valuation but at around $42 the market is still implying 10% EPS growth every year for the next 10. That seems pretty bullish to me. The U.S. markets continue to make all time highs and MSCI makes a large percentage of its revenue based on AUM. So we're assuming continued happy days for global equity markets as well as no significant margin compression or, heaven forbid, loss of market share.Nothing but blue skies?I can believe that thesis; but for the market, that's the baseline - i.e. that's not optimism, that's what's expected to happen based on the current stock price. So let's look at the bull case. Equity markets continue their bull market for years to come; ETF issuers and active investment managers continue to pay out to MSCI at current prices, with no significant change in margins, and MSCI's portfolio and risk analytics for active managers continue to win market share. Again - not farfetched but certainly not assumptions I'd naturally make when planning an investment - essentially an expectation that everything goes fantastically.Taking the market's temperatureMSCI is a well-run collection of businesses with premium positions - however it's a leveraged bet on the continued health of the equity markets as well as both the active and passive investment management industries. For those looking for safe positions that will perform well in the event of market volatility, or where Mr. Market has become overly pessimistic, I'd look elsewhere.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: Alpha Now at Thomson Reuters is a team of expert analysts that are constantly looking at the financial landscape in order to keep you up to date on the latest movements.

1953541,52262,2014-01-19T18:09:48-05:00,,"Investment products firm MSCI Inc (NYSE:MSCI) is probably best known for their pioneering development of global equity indices which they license to various asset managers. But while those innovative products have served the firm well for a long time and made shareholders a lot of money, revenue growth at the firm seems to be slowing and the company trades at a hefty 21.5X CY 2013 earnings per share. Given that steep price, investors should take a hard look at their stake in the firm and consider if this may be the time to cash out.MSCI has grown revenues pretty consistently and nicely over the last five years, and earnings growth has been fantastic as the chart below shows. For CY 2013, I see the firm's overall revenue growing 9%, but I think the firm will find it harder to maintain this level of growth going forward. In fact, I think 2014 growth could well disappoint, coming in at perhaps 4 to 5% based on limited growth in subscriptions for the company's products, and much of the post-Crisis shift into equities (and by extension MSCI's index funds) already completed.A lot of MSCI's organic revenue growth depends critically on rising equity markets drawing in new investors to the ETF's it licenses to firms like Vanguard and Blackrock and the addition of new customer accounts for MSCI's subscription products. Thus unless we get another banner year for equities (something we all hope for, but which I view as unlikely), then MSCI investors could be in for disappointing revenue growth. With MSCI's stock up so much over the last year, and the company now trading above its normalized historical multiple, any revenue or earnings disappointments could lead to short-term trouble for shareholders. To be clear, I like MSCI for the long-run, but I think investors may be set up for a disappointing 2014.MSCI has been creating equity index products for decades, but the firm only became a public company back in November 2007 - basically just in time for the recession. Prior to its public offering the company was owned by Morgan Stanley and Capital Group International (hence the name MSCI), and even subsequently the firm wasn't truly independent until it did a secondary offering in May 2009. The point here is that MSCI is a relatively young company without a ton of history, so it is difficult to judge its long run potential which is one of the things that makes the current rich valuation all the more risky.This difficulty in making historical comparisons was made all the more challenging when, in June 2010, MSCI bought RiskMetrics which provides risk management and governance products and services as well as proxy voting services (via RM's ISS division). This acquisition did give MSCI a broader portfolio of tools and research products beyond its equity ETF business though. The July 2010 acquisition of Measurisk added to this diversification.Despite the benefits of a diversified revenue stream (made all the more clear when Vanguard announced they were cutting MSCI benchmarks from 22 equity ETFs to cut licensing costs), MSCI management already seems to be interested in spinning-off or selling parts of the business it acquired just a few years earlier. In October 2013 for example, MSCI said it wanted to explore options for its governance unit despite that division's adjusted EBITDA growth of 12% and revenue growth of 7%. I'm not sure I agree with this strategy, but I also understand the appeal of making a complex business more intuitive for investors. And at its core, MSCI does have a very appealing business. The firm spends a tiny amount relatively speaking on capital spending ($45 million for 2012 and in the range of $30-35 million for FY 2013, for example, compared with $347 million in cash flow from operations). In addition, MSCI had tremendous certainty of revenues since most of its subscription and license products are already sold for the upcoming 12 months at the end of each fiscal year. MSCI's fees off these subscriptions and licenses are quite large, most recently set for $1 billion for the 12 months following 3Q2013. If MSCI's share price is to keep rising, it will be because of this mammoth free cash flow and the firm's use of that cash to pay down it's roughly $750 million in debt and buyback stock (targeted authorization of $200 million for 2013-2014).So with all that in mind, there is no question but that there are a lot of things to like about MSCI. Yet at the same time, this is a company trading at roughly 20X its forward EPS (my estimate is for $2.12 for CY 2014). The firm's subscription business is growing at a single digit pace (and facing increasing competition), and its asset-based fee products are highly dependent on the state of the capital markets. There is no question but that MSCI's products are good and that the firm is in a good business overall, but competition in the space is heating up and there is a real risk of major customer defections going forward (similar to what happened with Vanguard). I have a hard time justifying a price for the stock much above $38-40 given the challenges the firm is facing. MSCI is certainly not a short candidate at these levels, but I would be surprised if the stock saw much more in the way of multiple expansion and there are no obvious significant catalysts that are likely to boost earnings power greatly in the near-term future.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

3976858,85016,2016-05-22T11:50:09-04:00,,"On Thursday, May 12, MSCI (NYSE:MSCI) announced the exact stocks that will be included into their global indexes as part of the Phase Two inclusion of U.S.-listed Chinese companies (N-shares). This inclusion story has largely been ignored by the mainstream financial press, yet it has captivated a niche group of ETF experts who understand that billions of dollars will be set into motion on May 31st, 2016.There are $9.5 trillion in assets from both actively and passively managed mutual funds and ETFs tracking MSCI indexes, with $1.6 trillion tracking the MSCI Emerging Market Index alone.1N-shares were previously left out of MSCI's international indexes because their U.S. listing precluded them from being counted as international stocks. This absence became glaring after the highly publicized Alibaba initial public offering (IPO) in September 2014. Since Alibaba chose to list on the New York Stock Exchange, it was absent from virtually every international ETF, with the exception of our KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (NYSEARCA:KWEB) and a few other IPO-focused ETFs2.In addition to Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), N-shares comprise some of the largest and most recognized Chinese technology companies, such as: Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), Ctrip (CTRP), JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), and others. MSCI's move to include N-shares into their indexes is remedying the current gap in coverage for this important group of Chinese technology companies.In order to minimize its effect on the markets, MSCI pragmatically divided the inclusion into two phases. Phase One took place on November 30, 2015 and Phase Two will occur on May 31, 2016. After Phase One inclusion took place, billions of dollars from both passive and active managers were reallocated into N-shares. This meant that fund managers had to sell off their holdings of Hong Kong listed Chinese stocks to raise money to buy the N-shares.While this was not a mainstream news story there were a few ETF experts who wrote about the effect of Phase One inclusion.N-Share Inclusion Phase One CoverageAt Krane Funds Advisors, we were aware of the nuances in MSCI's index methodology when we launched KWEB on August 1, 2013. As we developed the fund we worked with KWEB's index provider to make sure our methodology included N-shares. As a result, KWEB was both the first China and technology ETF listed in the U.S. to hold Alibaba after its IPO2. We first wrote about N-share inclusion on June 30, 2015 when we launched our N-share inclusion countdown clock. Analysts estimate that $70 billion could potentially flow into the N-share names, $35 billion from Phase One and another $35 billion from Phase Two.3Outside our research, one of the few reporters who picked up on the trend was Elena Popina from Bloomberg News. Ms. Popina published an article on February 18th, 2016 that noted the 500% increase in the largest U.S. asset management company's holdings of the affected N-share stocks. This figure was calculated based on changes in the firm's third quarter to fourth quarter 2015 SEC filing of their stock holdings. In her article, Ms. Popina determined that this $4.3 billion increase was due to Phase One inclusion4. While the article quantified the effect of inclusion on one specific asset management company, fund managers around the world who benchmark to MSCI also had to buy the securities.Another ETF expert who took note of the effects of Phase One inclusion was Michael Krause from AltaVista Research, a New York based third party ETF research and due diligence firm. In his May 5, 2016 newsletter, Mr. Krause determined that Phase One inclusion caused the affected N-share stocks to rise by an average of 4.6% between November 27th and December 4th, 2015. Over the same period the non-included MSCI stocks declined by -0.8%.5We published an additional recap on the effect of Phase One inclusion in our Power of Indexing article published on December 18th, 2015.Phase Two Announcement detailsIn Thursday's announcement MSCI divulged the exact stocks that will be added as a part of Phase Two inclusion. The only notable change between the Phase One and Phase Two roster was the exclusion of Youku, which was acquired by Alibaba on April 5, 2016. Below we compiled a list of the exact inclusion stocks and their weights in KWEB.As of May 13, 2016, 57.84% of KWEB's holdings are comprised of the MSCI inclusion stocks. According to AltaVista Research this is the highest concentration of any U.S.-listed ETF5.Implications for A-share inclusionIn a much more high-profile decision in 2015, MSCI decided that it would hold off its inclusion of China A-shares, stocks listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, in order to give China's regulators time to clear up a few operational concerns we documented in our previous article: Not if, but when - A breakdown of MSCI's decision on China's onshore equity market. On June 14th, 2016, MSCI will make an important announcement regarding the timeline for when inclusion will commence.To put the magnitude of this inclusion into perspective China N-shares (labeled CHINA overseas in the chart below) will comprise 3.5% of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index after Phase Two inclusion. After China A-shares are fully included into this index they will represent 20.5% of the index. It is estimated that this move could add $400 billion to onshore equities over time6. The effect of full A-share inclusion would be over four times larger than N-share inclusion.Our fund, the KraneShares Bosera MSCI China A ETF (NYSEARCA:KBA) tracks the MSCI China A International Index, which represents the exact stocks MSCI will include into their indexes.*The KraneShares Bosera MSCI China A ETF does not hold any of the securities mentioned in this article."
3517996,50662,2015-09-18T14:31:40-04:00,"MSCI's cash flows are pretty robust, but despite the healthy situation, the company is a little bit expensive now.I currently own shares at around $45, but see no reason to 'average up' at the current share price.However, the continuous share buybacks will continue to boost the per-share performance, and at for instance $50/share I would again be interested to add to my position.","IntroductionI decided to have a look at MSCI (NYSE:MSCI) because even though 90% of the financial world knows the products MSCI is distributing, not a lot of attention is being given to the company. And I think that's wrong, and in this article I will explain the reasons why I think you should consider an investment in MSCI.Don't let the 50% drop in the net income fool you!The first half of this year was actually pretty good with an 8% increase in revenue and even though the expenses increased as well, the operating income increased by in excess of 10% as the operating expenses didn't increase as fast as the revenue. If you decide to have a look at the operating income, you'll notice the operating margin is a very impressive 35% and that's one of the reasons why MSCI got my attention.Source: financial statementsFurther down the road, you'll see the net income was $99.8M and that's approximately 45% less than the $188M in the same period last year. If you'd only have a superficial look at the results you'd be immediately disappointed, but you cannot and should not compare both results as in 2014 MSCI was able to report a net profit of discontinued operations of $84M, whilst it had the report a $5.8M loss from discontinued operations in the current year and this explains the $90M discrepancy in the net income of MSCI.Perhaps the cash flow statements could offer a bit more clarification and in the first half of the current financial year, MSCI's cash flow statements are indicating the operating cash flow was $90.7M, but this does take the changes in the company's working capital position into account. As you might remember from some previous articles, I always try to isolate the impact of the working capital changes to find the normalized operating cash flow to base my calculations on.Source: financial statementsThe adjusted operating cash flow was actually 55% higher at $140M and even after deducting the $18M in capital expenditures, MSCI's free cash flow was still pretty impressive at $122M and MSCI actually has the potential to reach a normalized free cash flow of a quarter of a billion dollar either this year or next year.Should MSCI buy back its $800M bond?MSCI seems to be spending its cash relatively conservatively as it paid dividends totaling $40.8M and used a net amount of $96M for share repurchases.Source: financial statementsWhen I had a look at the balance sheet (see above), I noticed MSCI had $800M in long-term debt on the liabilities side, and this is an 10 year fixed rate bond maturing in 2014 and carrying an interest rate of 5.25%. That's a little bit disappointing as 5.25% isn't exactly cheap and I'm convinced the company could now get a better deal. Unfortunately it's a bond and not a credit facility and repaying the bond before the maturity date would include some penalties which would result in no net gain in the longer term.So right now it's indeed a better choice to repurchase shares, and MSCI is doing a pretty good job at this. Whereas the company had a total of 120 million shares issued as of at the end of 2012, now, less than 3 years later, the total share count has dropped to less than 110M as of at July 23rd.This obviously boosts the per-share performance and if I would use a total amount of 108 million shares by the end of this year, the free cash flow per share would be approximately $2.31 and whilst that's not really spectacular with a share price of $60, this was pretty good at $45, the level where I bought some shares.Investment thesisMSCI is still generating a very healthy amount of free cash flow and is spending the entire amount on dividends and share buybacks. You shouldn't buy MSCI for its dividend yield as the current yield is just 1.5%, but the continuous share buybacks will continue to fuel an improving per-share performance.Should MSCI spend $150M per year on buybacks, it would reduce the share count by 7.5 million shares to 100 million shares by the end of 2017, boosting the expected free cash flow to $2.6 per share (based on an annual operating cash flow increase of 1.5%).I currently have a small position at $45 but won't increase it at $60/share. I hope the share price retreats a bit because I would definitely be interested to add shares to my position, but at a better price, like, let's say $50."

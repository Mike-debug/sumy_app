Going into details, there was a 13.5% decrease in combined product licenses and subscription services revenues.Equally important, product support revenues which constitutes more of a constant recurrent revenue source for software companies suffered a 2.4% decrease compared to the same quarter last year.Figure 2: Comparison with peersSource: Seekingalpha.comMicroStrategy's year-on-year revenue growth is the worst except for IBM which is amid a restructuring exercise.The COVID-led impetus to shift more workloads to the cloud by corporations in order to benefit from more flexible working environments (working-from-home) has been a key element of business continuity during the first half of the year.Also, the cloud subscription model with monthly subscription fees instead of full-year license payments allows reduction of upfront costs.Hence, COVID has mostly benefited public cloud providers like Microsoft which already provides Power BI as part of its offerings, as well as SAP with its Business Objects applications and Salesforce reinforced with Tableau's analytics tool.Furthermore, since making Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN) its preferred infrastructure vendor in 2016, Salesforce has made similar agreements with Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and more recently even with Microsoft with which it competes as a CRM play.On the other hand, MicroStrategy due to the fact that it used to sell its software under a more traditional and complex licensing model made it difficult for customers to grasp the cost implications of moving to the cloud. Consequently, while not necessarily being more expensive than competitors, its product pricing was viewed as ""opaque.""Also, the company did not want to be too aggressive in its sales strategy and ""force"" any customer to move to the cloud.But this is all set to change as part of the ""cloud first focus.""On a brighter note, while still dwarfed by the perpetual (traditional) licenses business, the subscription revenues has seen some strength (+12.7%) in Q2-2020 when compared with last year's equivalent quarter.Figure 3: Q2-2020 revenue per segmentSource: SeekingalphaFurthermore, product support revenues fell primarily as the result of a decrease in new product support contracts, not on existing ones. Interestingly, less support sales were made also due to customers converting from perpetual licenses to subscription services or SaaS.Hence, the executives now want to capitalize on this higher demand for subscription and going forward, the company will also institute incentive programs for existing on-premise customers to begin transiting workloads to their cloud platform.Additionally, the company should receive a boost in this endeavor with the work-from-home drive.However, the execution has to be watched carefully with the right message conveyed to customers who should not feel that priority is being given to cloud at the detriment of on-prem services. Failure to support on-prem customers during the transition period may result in loss of customer confidence.In this case, the executives plan a cautious transition strategy spanning over ""a few years"" in order not to adversely impact revenue mix constituted by product license revenues, support revenues and subscription revenues.There are also three positives in terms of financial efficiency for MicroStrategy.First, the company has been able to reduce operating expenses for the second quarter of 2020 by 17.4% compared to Q2-2019. This has been done mostly through reduction of travel expenses and providing support services remotely as well as attending online sales events rather than live (physical) ones.Second, MicroStrategy shares the top spot with Oracle in terms of gross profitability even beating the likes of Microsoft and Salesforce. This shows that its software developers and implementers have attained a high level of efficiency. Moreover, with a higher dose of SaaS through the cloud focus, operational costs should further fall down translating into better EBIT margins.Third, with a cash per share ratio of 57.36 and debt to equity ratio of 23.62, MicroStrategy is financially better off than all its peers.Finally, I take a look at product ratings from an independent review website.Figure 4: Comparison of ratings Source: Trustradius.comIn this case, while it does not have the scale of Salesforce or IBM, MicroStrategy's core analytics product is one of the best when compared to competitors.Despite suffering from a deficit of $34.8 million in the last quarter, MicroStrategy still has plenty of firepower with a cash position of $530.9 million as of June 30 2020.With this cash level, the company could also withstand the current macroeconomic storm with some customers resorting to budget freezes.The start of the third quarter did see some relaxation in customers' attitude but subsequent waves of COVID infections could bring further disruption and result in longer deal cycles.However, MicroStrategy may turn this challenging economic condition to its advantage as it starts to motivate its sales force to migrate customers from on-prem to the cloud and makes its ""cloud pricing more transparent online for prospective customers and make it easier for them to buy the cloud platform and HyperIntelligence in the second half of 2020 and into 2021""Also, technically speaking, there are two key enablers which should help MicroStrategy.First, according to the executives, the process of re-platforming the data warehouse layer, which is a common catalyst for switching to a cloud BI platform has reached a critical mass.Figure 5: Business intelligence platformSource: MicroStrategySecond, to facilitate customers' journeys and make them benefit from the wide array of infrastructure services in the cloud, MicroStrategy has an integration with Microsoft Azure which enables users to seamlessly connect with databases or other infrastructure services.This said, customers opting for cloud deployments sometimes do so at the expense of on-prem based subscriptions depending on how fast the company is able to add more customers.In this case, there are software companies like Solarwinds (SWI) which have managed the transition right through the pandemic as they were able to provide customers with products with lower upfront costs amid a period of budgetary cuts.Thus, by being able to expand cloud-based sales faster to offset potential shortfalls in on-prem (perpetual) revenues, MicroStrategy could avoid disruption in revenues.Also, this is no rocket science as others have already performed the same path successfully.Hence, with a Price to Sales ratio of 3.48, well below peers with the exception of IBM, MicroStrategy is a buy. I see a 10-15% short-term upside as the market favors stocks with cash, low debt and investors shying away from holding the dollar.To date, the company has bitcoins valued to about $425 million (based on the purchase prices) and as such, MicroStrategy is a stock for those wanting some bitcoin exposure but hesitant to purchase the digital currency directly."
4169057,104028,2018-05-03T08:30:08-04:00,"Positive changes are happening. Management has accelerated the pace of innovation, increased incentives for employees, expanded brand campaigns and added a new revenue chief.MicroStrategy's total revenue down 1.7% on an as adjusted, constant currency basis in Q1. Largest revenue component, product support was above our -0.3% projection coming in at 0.4% increase.Product license revenue (14% of revenues) was lower by 12% Y-O-Y. New head of sales should be focusing hard on improving new business pipeline. Subscription services (mostly cloud based) were down 5%.Gross profit margin holding up, coming in slightly above our 79.2% estimate at 79.5%.Higher sales and research expenses drove the earnings below our and street expectations which is a positive, as we expect improving revenue growth late this year or early next.","MicroStrategy (MSTR) is in the midst of a large sales/marketing and platform investment cycle in a bid to increase market share. We continue to see improvements taking place from these investments that point to better growth over the next 12 - 18 months.In terms of first quarter performance, total revenue was down 1.7% in the quarter. We expected a down 1.3% quarter. Results were impacted by managements adoption of new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 which accelerated recognition of term licenses from the OEM channel. The change added $15 mil. to 2017 retained earnings, $1.6 mil. to product license revenue and $0.7 mil to net income in Q1 2017.Product support revenues (61% of total revenues) grew 1% constant currency, primarily on double digit international growth. Domestic support revenues were down slightly. Margins were in line with our estimate at 93.5% and importantly, deferred support revenue on a current and non-current basis was up 2.3% sequentially.We anticipate that Kevin Norlin, the new head of sales (see our previous note), will want to put his mark on the sales/marketing operation which could possibly result in some level of reorganization. Considering that sales/marketing and research and development investments started to ramp in Q3 2017 and the excellent experience that Mr. Norlin brings to the organization (start date was April 3), we are maintaining that next quarter will be similar to this quarter and that signs of revenue growth improvement are possible in the second half.Management highlighted that lead generation quantity and quality were up on a Y-O-Y basis and lead conversion is now the focus. CEO Michael Saylor explained on the conference call that SAP's (SAP) decision to drop support for Business Objects 4.2 business intelligence, on-premises solution represented a material opportunity to present the MicroStrategy proposition to thousands of SAP enterprise accounts. Sales/marketing headcount is up 7.6% Y-O-Y from 620 to 667 and stock based compensation is up 44% Y-O-Y to $1 mil (see below).Not surprisingly, product license revenue was down 20% domestically in the quarter and 12% worldwide in constant currency and we projected a down 12% result. Deferred product license revenue and advance payments on a current and non-current basis contracted by 14.7% compared to year end. The trough in declines could perhaps be behind the company - foreign currency adjusted year over year declines were -28.5% in Q3 2017 and -24.0% in Q4 2017. Product license margins came in at 91% versus 92.5% for 2017 exactly in line with our estimate.Importantly, the company has accelerated the pace of innovation since platform version 10.0, increasing the frequency of releases and version 11.0 is due for release later this year. Investors should take note of the significant improvements being made to the feature set of release 10.11 announced in January. The company has opened up support to front-end BI self-service competitors Tableau (DATA), Microsoft Power BI (MSFT) and Qlik. On the one hand it could be perceived as tipping the hat to the big three but then at the same time the company has rolled out major improvements to its own front-end and other capabilities to strengthen its competitive position.MicroStrategy beefed up its visualizations with waterfalls, histograms and box plots which help power users (data scientists). Enhanced geospatial functionality by adding a brand new mapping component powered by MapBox - a popular GIS platform. This new capability is added to the current ESRI-based mapping facilities in the MicroStrategy platform. As we highlighted before the new ability to create, share and store dossiers (notebooks) in a content library was a big step forward and now dossiers are deployable as native apps on mobile phones (iPhones or androids) in addition to desktops, laptops, tablets, iPads. Dossier apps are being further enhanced with optimizations for faster performance using large data sets and users can pause and resume execution while editing or designing a Dossier.New connectors have been added to several Microsoft Azure cloud services as well as to Eloqua, Marketo, Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Hubspot (HUBS)and Shopify (SHOP). New MicroStrategy on AWS (AMZN) administrative features were added such as CPU stats, memory utilization, live database connections and free storage.Product subscription revenues decreased 5% and we modeled up 5%. Gross margins in constant currency came in at 53.5% in the quarter, we modeled 53.5%. Total other services which includes consulting and education services were down 1.3% versus our up 3.7% projection. However, margins expanded from 34.2% in the year ago quarter to 37.4% in Q1, we modeled 33.4%. Deferred revenues and advance payments both current and non-current were down 1.9% sequentially.Smartly, to attract talent, improve moral and align employee interests with shareholders, the company is adding $40 mil. to share based compensation for options that will be recognized over 3.3 years. Sales and marketing stock compensation expense should increase by $13.1 mil over 3.3 years, research and development compensation expense should increase by $8.1 over 3.2 years and general and administrative compensation expense should increase by $16.5 mil over 3.1 years.The company added $18.8 mil. in other long-term liabilities from extending its headquarters operating lease to 2030. Total other long-term liabilities now stands at $68.9 mil versus $50.1 mil in December. Cash and equivalents stand high at $695 mil. Cash flow from operations declined, mainly due to reduced net income, to $18.7 mil. compared to $26.5 mil. in year ago quarter.Expectations are low for MicroStrategy. Its business intelligence, analytics and mobile platform continue to improve at a faster pace and marketing and sales programs continue to expand. This is a turnaround in progress where the upside potential significantly exceeds downside risk. I'm maintaining a Buy opinion."
4161218,104028,2018-04-05T11:19:42-04:00,"We have explained that sales management needs to be improved for the MicroStrategy turnaround to work. US sales performance has trailed international results for many quarters now.Kevin Norlin will replace Mr. Rennyson as the Senior Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales, effective as of April 3, 2018.Mr. Norlin brings financial services sales management experience from NCR and vice president and general manager, worldwide sales, operations and strategy experience from Hewlett Packard Enterprise.Financial and stock price performance was positive during his tenure with both companies.  We suspect he will help fix the under performance in domestic sales and increase sales with financial services companies globally.That said, there could be potential for a restructuring in the sales group and perhaps volatility in sales performance near term, which could lead to better top line results later this year and next year.","MicroStrategy (MSTR) added two new board members who bring valuable backgrounds and increase board diversity. Ms. Breya served as COO of Ionic Security, a data protection and control software provider; she served as chief information officer at Informatica (NASDAQ:INFA) a big data infrastructure management and cloud solutions provider and partner to MicroStrategy; and she held senior marketing positions at Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPE).Mr. Rechan has served as CEO of Solace Corp., a smart data movement solutions company; president and CEO of Halogen Software (OTC:HGENF) which is a cloud-based talent management company and importantly, as vice president, sales, solutions and services from February 2008 to October 2011 of IBM Business Analytics (IBM). Prior to joining IBM through its largest acquisition, Mr. Rechan was the COO of Cognos a BI solution provider.  Executive marketing, data security, cloud technology, competitor business intelligence and analytics backgrounds from the number one analytics company in the world - IBM (some might argue for SAS Institute) will be highly valuable perspectives to have on the board.Recent technology share weakness is likely tied to trade war fears, Amazon (AMZN) regulatory concerns, Facebook (FB) data breach/security concerns and Oracle cloud growth. Stay the course on MicroStrategy as expectations are low and the risk/reward is compelling. Buy the weakness. First quarter results are due around April 26th."
4145747,104028,2018-02-12T13:33:00-05:00,"Big tactical and strategic investments happening that should allow MicroStrategy to win back lost market share.Q4 results were slightly better than we modeled and there are emerging green shoots. License revenues were down less than we forecast and subscriptions revenues picked up nicely.Total revenues were $138mm vs. our $130mm estimate and gross profitability was 82.1% vs. our estimate of 81.5%.Operating margins came in at 13.6% compared to our 14.2% projection on higher sales and marketing spend. Diluted EPS was $1.55 vs. our $1.33 estimate beating the consensus by $0.16.Importantly, current deferred revenues started to lift, international growth was solid and customer maintenance contract renewals were strong.","MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) shares are still discounting a zero growth in perpetuity scenario as reflected in the enterprise value/economic book value ratio of just over 1.0x, and we maintain our $175 price target. We are in the early innings of a two-year turnaround phase driven by stepped up spending on the MicroStrategy brand, sales, consulting, technology and service personnel. We are encouraged by improvements that are being made to its enterprise business intelligence/analytics platform which should make its solution more competitive relative to Qlick Technologies (private), Microsoft Power BI (MSFT) and Tableau (DATA). Our breakdown of the performance in the quarter is as follows: On a constant currency basis, product license revenues were down less than expected at -19.8% vs. our -28.0% projection. Our sense is that first half license revenues will be lumpy and maybe even light, but that better comparisons are likely to surface in the second half. Subscription services were better than expected at 8.6%vs.our no growth estimate. Product support was down 0.1% (but lower still as a customer made a catch-up payment in the quarter) vs. our +0.6% projection. On a non-FX adjusted basis, consulting services were up 6.5% vs. our +2.6% projection and education was down 22.0% compared to our -2.3 estimate due to price cutting on education products to expand product and resource knowledge in the customer base. The CEO, Michael Saylor, noted on the analyst call some progress on the new customer front but did not offer details. However, product license domestic middle size closings were up +8 vs. +3 count in year ago quarter and large deals were +5 vs. +4 last year but domestic license revenues were down 50% and highlights the weakest area of performance for the company. Still we expect this decline to bottom out in next few quarters then pick up on the back of better marketing, branding and more exciting platform enhancements. International product license deal count was up at +7 vs. +5 last year and importantly overseas revenues were up +29.2% vs. - 16.3% in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin comparisons were as follows. Product license gross margins came in at 93.8% vs. our 92.5% estimate and equivalent to year-ago margins. Product support margins came in at 94.2% vs. our 94.4% estimate. Subscription services came in at 60.1% vs. our 53.5% projection, in line with year ago levels but a big jump sequentially. Consulting margins were 33.9% vs. our 35.0% estimate which is in line with year ago margins. Education, which is being reshaped to lower customer training and knowledge acquisition costs, posted margins of 22.2% compared to our 37.0% projection but equivalent to last year's level. Overall operating expenses are running at levels that are consistent with the increased investment program articulated by management in Q2 2017. We projected sales and marketing expenses as a percent of revenues would be 36.0% vs. the 37.6% reported. The R&D percentage of 15.7% compared to 15.5% reported. A general and administration percentage of 15.6% vs. 15.4% actual. Operating margin came in at 13.6% vs. our projection of 14.2%. Management explained on the call that operating margins could sag to zero potentially, though we see this as a hedge if revenue growth is lower than planned or an attempt to lower profit expectations. In terms of one-time items, management took a $44 million charge due to the new tax legislation which they will pay over an eight-year period. They also had a one-time reversal of $3.4 million on previously accrued expenses. There are some points of progress here. International performance (approximately 42% of revenues) has been strong but there's potential to see improvement in North American growth this year. Product license revenues dropped less than expected and international license revenue growth was up 29% reflecting healthy new business overseas. Customer support backlog is at an all-time low, customer satisfaction is at an all time high and support renewal rates are in the mid 90% range. Management is smartly expanding its customer support, consulting and education bandwidth which we expect will lead to better product license, subscription, support and consulting revenue growth. Brand awareness and lead generation is improving from increased marketing investments. During the quarter, Dressner research's endorsed MicroStrategy as a leader in embedded analytics, reflecting better analyst relations efforts. Also we noticed that one of MicroStrategy's big customers is scheduled to be a keynote speaker at the upcoming Gartner Data and Analytics Summit and that MicroStrategy is on the BI Bake-Off: The Modern BI and Analytics Platform panel. Exposure is high here with more than 3,000 attendees so far, 60-plus Gartner analysts and 150 content tracks, and of course all the vendors. Our fourth quarter income statement analysis:Also on the marketing front, the MicroStrategy World 2018 conference was noteworthy. Over 2,000 mostly enterprise customers attended the Las Vegas event including AIG, Coca-Cola, Merck, Citi, Optum and UBS. To better compete with Tableau, Qlick Technologies and Microsoft Power BI the company is focusing on increasing adoption rates with innovative platform enhancements, dramatically increasing customer support capabilities, product education resources and showing organizations how they can broaden adoption of business intelligence and analytics content, speed deployments and quickly extract value out of the MicroStrategy platform. As we have noted in our initiation of coverage piece, MicroStrategy is playing a bit of catch-up with business users wanting to do business intelligence self-service, ad-hoc data exploration and visualization where Tableau and others have excelled. So as we expected, they are continuing to improve the ad-hoc user experience with better data discovery functionality on the free desktop offering. There are important productivity improvements emerging for enterprise architects and administrators by helping them to be able to deploy federated analytics apps to business users more rapidly via the new workstation offering. This also helps customers scale up solutions from the desktop to the departmental level to the enterprise level. What we think is most promising today from an end-user experience and productivity standpoint is the newer Dossier workbook functionality which significantly expands collaboration capabilities. Dossier could help broaden the use of the platform because it eases the sharing of analytics content, allows sub one second reproduction of analytics work streams and intelligence can be embedded in web portals, blogs, html documents and mobile applications. We think that the use of intelligent personal assistant platforms like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa and others could be a profound development in terms of how analytic content gets consumed and how users interface with their business intelligence platforms. Some forecast that in the near future as much as one-third of computer interfacing will take place through intelligent personal assistant platforms and Amazon is investing heavily in this area and aggressively lowering product prices. So it is good to hear CEO, Michael Saylor, recognizing the importance of these technologies to MicroStrategy and expect to see new user interface capabilities in this area in the future. Tableau is exploiting this opportunity now. We will have more to say about how important blockchain technology will be to BI/Analytics vendors in the future. Below is a revealing crowd sourced MicroStrategy customer review from IT-Central Station (we mine many sites) that shows why we like the company's technology: Self-service data discovery, enterprise reporting, scalability, security, stability, data governance, open protocals, mobile/embedded analytics and an in-memory architecture. We explained these in our basic report and have highlighted the customer comments that refer to these competitive advantages. The review also highlights the lack of awareness of the MicroStrategy solution which is a positive since marketing and brand building are starting to ramp up globally. MICROSTRATEGY REVIEW We've Rolled Out Self-Service To Business Teams To Help With Decision-MakingFeb 01 2018We have about 50-plus applications that we're currently running on MicroStrategy, and most of these are around tracking demand and supply, profitability, and growth for the organization. We've also opened it up as an open BI platform, so that all our business analysts can build their own dashboards and Dossiers and the like.We are a data-driven company, so a lot of decisions happen out of data at every level. Most of our tactical decisions are data-driven, our strategic decisions are definitely data-driven. MicroStrategy is now the de facto tool within the organization, it's the go-to BI tool in the organization.We have yet to explore the prescriptive analytics and the SDK. I expect we'll focus on these most, moving forward in 2018.I think what we're currently excited about is the ability to integrate R. Most of our data scientists use R for their modeling. I heard at one of the sessions, here at MicroStrategy World 2018, that you can put your R scripts directly into MicroStrategy, so any modeling effort that you've done in the past can be transferred into MicroStrategy. I'm hoping it will be a plug-and-play feature.We've already rolled out self-service to business teams with MicroStrategy. I think it's good. We just need to ensure that there are some security guardrails around any open BI setup. There's a tendency to screw up something when you just leave it open. You have to ensure that there are some processes and guidelines before you open it up for a larger platform. But there have not been any serious issues so far, so we're good.As part of this MicroStrategy World 2018 conference, we saw some of the VitaraCharts. If there are some advanced visualization features - maybe I'm not aware of them - but if there were a Vitara which could work on top of MicroStrategy, it would make sense for MicroStrategy to have that within their own library. So they should add more visualizations to the library.No stability issues so far.No issues with scalability. As I said, 50-plus applications so far, and it will probably get bigger and bigger from here on. No issues.We do use the community a lot in terms of understanding some of the best practices and the like. We've never really reached out to support because we also have a couple of partners that we work with, so they help us with the consulting and any support requirements.I was not involved in the initial setup, but I was involved when we increased the number of licenses from 260 to now almost 950. I was involved in that dealmaking.We prefer having the analytic capabilities in one platform, like MicroStrategy, as opposed to having them in many points. As it is, we deal with a lot of big data systems, tons of other vendors. It doesn't make sense to have to deal with multiple vendors and deal with different support issues. It's always better to have a single point of contact for our kind of use case.Regarding investing in the mobile platform, out of the 800,000 odd users that we have on MicroStrategy, about 25 are already mobile. We've limited it to our CxO audience so far, but we will evaluate whether there's a use case for extending it to the larger organization.We are still scratching the surface when it comes to our adoption. I would still rate it a 10 out of 10 for now. Once we get far and wide into the utilization of the product in the organization, that's when we'll probably realize this feature works better or that feature doesn't work better. At this stage, there are no complaints.What we appreciate most in a vendor is their being proactive in terms of understanding what the customer needs, and showcasing their product roadmap so that we are aware of what's coming up next and can be prepared for it.If a colleague were looking to implement this kind of solution, I would definitely ask them to evaluate MicroStrategy at some point in time. There's a lot of competition in terms of Power BI and Tableau. To be honest, the country where I operate in, not many people are aware of this. Although MicroStrategy has a big presence in India, obviously Power BI or Tableau become the de-facto choices. To be honest, even I hadn't heard of MicroStrategy until I started working in this organization. Maybe they should make their presence felt a little more."

See below.Would be a buyer.,"The key elements of our thesis are that MicroStrategy (MSTR) should benefit from stepped up investments in their enterprise business intelligence (BI) and analytics platform. And, increased spending to elevate sales, marketing, brand and customer support performance. In this year's Gartner Magic Quadrant of Analytics and Business Intelligence Platforms MicroStrategy received a more favorable review. BI buyers such as CIO's, CDO's (chief data officers), BI/Analytics competency centers, IT departments and line of business analytics leaders use Gartner's research to make purchasing decisions. They are and have been the leaders in the field of enterprise technology research. Compared to 2017 MicroStrategy moved up along the ability to execute axis and becomes the only vendor to occupy the challenger quadrant. Figure 1. 2018 Magic Quadrant for Analytics and Business Intelligence PlatformsSource: Gartner (February 2018)Figure 2. 2017 Magic Quadrant for Analytics and Business Intelligence PlatformsSource: Gartner (February 2017)They did move slightly to the left on completeness of vision also but the move up is more significant in our view. MicroStrategy has three main competitors it faces when trying to win new business - Tableau (DATA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Qlik (private).As we have projected Gartner found that MicroStrategy's ""improved ability to execute is due to its leading product capabilities scores across all use cases combined with successful investments in customer and operations experience initiatives that have translated into material improvements across most of these measures. MicroStrategy has among the highest product scores of any vendor in this Magic Quadrant, both overall and for all the evaluated use cases."" MicroStrategy has moved up into the top quartile for customer experience and jumped up on customer operations experience to an above average score due to it's investments in the new customer experience group, better quick start training packages for new customers and a better community sharing portal. All scores are based on reference customers surveyed. We have expected continued improvements in platform capabilities, ease-of-use, collaboration, for example. This is happening with an improved desktop discovery release with quick-start instructions, an improved design for visual exploration and dossier notebooks which make it easier to share, collaborate via social-like discussion threads and better organized analytics content. This was a key deficiency we talked about in our original piece. They also added an ability to certify and watermark content to maintain integrity, quality and a single version of the truth in the data being shared.Not surprisingly, Gartner observed that the company has new marketing and sales initiatives focused on winning new customers. However, they were critical in saying that despite gaining ground with existing customers, they saw limited market momentum and awareness outside the customer base. We expect this to change over the next 12 - 18 month.The company has more work to do to in improving ongoing administration; shortening the analytics content development process and migration time frames; adding AI driven automated data and analytics insights and increasing cloud deployments with its AWS offering. Strategically, the company should have a value proposition for decentralized BI and analytics deployments to step up into this faster growing market segment. Its cloud AWS offering might be the answer for decentralized line of business prospects and the company is looking for a sales person, account executive for the SMB market in Virginia. Some other interesting web statistics and hiring data we follow include: a 19% pickup in MicroStrategy.com total web site (desktop and mobile) visits increased from 840,000 in December 2017 to 1 million-plus in January 2018. This traffic rank is up compared to all other U.S. sites and rank is increasing in Poland, Japan and India though China rank declined. We suspect this is reflective of brand building and better lead generation practices. The company has had better sales success overseas so it is good to see traffic up in India and Japan. The company has job openings in sales in Virginia, Germany, Switzerland, Turkey, Dubai, Korea and Paris. Importantly, business development openings are posted for Virginia, Japan, Buenos Aires, Sao Paulo and London."
4245237,24157,2019-02-28T12:11:03-05:00,"Forget all the ""earnings season"" analysis you read last month. The real earnings season (annual 10-K filing season) is happening right now.From yesterday's research, our analysts parsed 100 10-K filings and collected 10,403 data points. In total, they made 2,085 forensic accounting adjustments with a dollar value of $600 billion.These adjustments allow us to assess a company’s true earnings and return on invested capital.","For February 26, our forensic accounting needles in a haystack come from a software company with multiple red flags hidden in the footnotes.Analyst Devyn Delange found three unusual items in MicroStrategy's (MSTR) 2018 10-K.On page 76, MSTR disclosed that the carrying value of its corporate aircraft and related equipment is $35 million, which equates to 68% of the company's property and equipment and 14% of its invested capital. It's hard to see how a fairly small company can justify such an expensive corporate jet.Not only does the expensive corporate aircraft suggest wasteful management spending, it also gives executives numerous ways to ""manage"" earnings. Delaying maintenance on the aircraft or changing the estimate for its useful life or salvage value could allow management to reduce expenses in a given quarter in order to meet EPS targets.Investors should be especially diligent in watching for this sort of earnings management with MSTR due to the second red flag we uncovered. On page 53, MSTR's auditor, KPMG, wrote that the company failed to maintain effective internal control over its financial reporting. KPMG found that ineffective process controls in the implementation of new IT systems meant there was a reasonable possibility that MSTR would be unable to detect or correct material misstatements in its financial reports.This weakness in internal control should worry investors for two reasons: (1) It suggests that management is not paying enough attention to ensuring accurate accounting, and (2) weakness in internal control is associated with an increased risk of a stock price crash.The last red flag we found for MSTR was a significant increase in the company's off-balance sheet operating lease liabilities, disclosed on page 77. Off-balance sheet debt increased from $64 million in 2017 to $152 million (61% of invested capital) in 2018. If you don't account for these operating leases, it would appear that MSTR earned a return on invested capital (ROIC) of 14% in 2018. Once we adjust for these leases, we find that MSTR's ROIC was just 6%.MSTR might look like a highly profitable company on the surface, but digging into the footnotes reveals that it's significantly less profitable and higher-risk than it first appears.We analyzed 100 10-K filings yesterday, from which our Robo-Analyst[1] technology collected 10,403 data points. Our analyst team used this data to make 2,085 forensic accounting adjustments with a dollar value of $600 billion. The adjustments were applied as follows:We believe this research is necessary to fulfill the Fiduciary Duty of Care. Ernst & Young's white paper, ""Getting ROIC Right,"" demonstrates how these adjustments contribute to meaningfully superior models and metrics.This article originally published on February 26, 2019.Disclosure: David Trainer, Devyn Delange, and Sam McBride receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, sector, style, or theme.[1]Harvard Business School features the powerful impact of our research automation technology in the case New Constructs: Disrupting Fundamental Analysis with Robo-Analysts."
4132765,104028,2017-12-20T12:50:14-05:00,"MicroStrategy shares represent a compelling value with catalysts investment case.Despite lower revenue growth and operating margin prospects near term, increasing technology and marketing spending should revive top and bottom growth.End market demand for its core business intelligence and analytics is growing smartly as companies in many industries seek to compete on analytics and big data competency.The shares are discounting zero-growth in perpetuity, and our valuation work produces a fair value target range that is 33-37% higher than the current price.","M I C R O S T R A T E G Y I N V E S T M E N T C A S EMSTR data by YCharts(Note - All images are created by the author using base company and industry data, unless otherwise noted.)The recently announced strategic shift to expand technology investment and marketing spend at the cost of lower operating margins has produced a favorable risk-reward opportunity for value investors. There are technology innovation and management issues needing improvement, but the company has healthy end-market demand, an attractive technology map, a core platform that can become more competitive with smart technology bets and more capital to spend to build its brand and increase marketing productivity. We project a recovery at MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) taking a bit longer than management projected so we carry lower than street revenues this year and next but see better top line comparisons and double digit operating margins returning in 2019. At these levels, the shares are discounting a near zero-growth prospect scenario and represent a compelling value with catalysts investment profile. Our fair value range for the shares is $176-185 over the next 12-18 months.Figure 1, 2Figure 3Figure 4MicroStrategy management has emphasized its profitable growth relative to competitor Tableau (NYSE:DATA) which has executed a more aggressive growth strategy with heavier marketing spending, negative operating margins and cash flows. In the 2Q 2017 earnings conference call, MicroStrategy disclosed that it would make the tradeoff of lower operating profitability to boost revenue growth. It means bigger sales and marketing budgets and greater investment in its core BI (Business Intelligence) and Analytics solutions. Specifically, management explained that it was willing to accept high single-digit operating margins in the near term to enable at least 10%-plus revenue growth two to three years out. 2016 operating margins were 21%, and 2017 operating margins should come out at roughly 15%. We are modeling 8.5% margins next year with double-digit margins of 11.7% returning in 2021 and higher thereafter. And, revenue growth of negative 2.6% in 2017 improving significantly to approximately 6% in 2021.The backdrop is that over the last three years, management embarked on a rebuilding, consolidation, and integration program. Operations and management were centralized, corporate systems were overhauled with the aim of positioning the business to scale to beyond the $1 billion revenue mark. On the technology side, it rationalized its product to a single platform, modernized its core BI and analytics platform moving from version 9 to version 10.4, added new APIs and data source connectors and implemented an enterprise analytics architecture (Aqueduct) on top of MicroStrategy 10. The company decided to offer a free standalone analytics and visualization desktop to compete more sharply with Tableau's desktop, Qlik's (NASDAQ:QLIK) View offering and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Power BI solution. Microsoft's Power BI solution is approximately 1/3 the cost of a perpetual BI license and 80% lower than competing solutions, and we discuss pricing, competitive implications below. By April, more than 200,000 MicroStrategy desktops were downloaded.Management rebuilt the sales team, increased symposium seminars and put over 16,000 people through free jump-start training programs since the summer of 2016. Given second and third quarter results, we suspect it isn't reaching its 2017 goals of tripling lead flow, doubling symposium attendance and reaching its one million user desktop download target. Stronger sales and marketing management performance is one of our key catalysts, and we believe this can be improved. We note underlying improvement in international license and subscription sales.Issues such as faster technology adoption rates, changing BI customer preferences, rising cloud BI subscription demand and more intense competition are affecting revenue growth (which we detail below). A key dynamic for MicroStrategy is the timing of a pick up in legacy product license revenues and the growth potential of cloud solutions. We have baked in conservative (lower than consensus) growth expectations in both revenue categories but we still see positive total revenue growth returning in 2019.Around the edges are the positive/negative factor of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Brexit. On the positive side, MicroStrategy should benefit from its AWS offering but at the same time, Amazon is disrupting many segments of the retailing industry thereby raising uncertainty in spending by MicroStrategy's retail customer base which include seven of the top global retailers (approximately 10% - 20% of bookings and maintenance revenues). It is also possible that Brexit has been having a drag effect on new business in Europe, and we have seen five quarters of revenue growth rate declines from the EMEA unit. However, we are encouraged by the double-digit third quarter revenue (up 15.5%) and profits (up 16.1%) improvement, see figures 5, 6 and 9.Figure 5Figure 6Figure 7Overall, revenue growth is declining and gross profitability is contracting this year. See figures 3 -7. Worldwide product license revenue growth shrank 6.2% in Q1, 18.3% in Q2 and 28.5% in Q3, see figure 9, both current and non-current deferred license revenue categories have weakened and license gross margins declined from 96.1% in Q1 2016 to a low of 90.3% in Q1 2017 but have recovered in Q2, Q3 - figure 8. Total new business wins are down in number and deal-size terms - figure 10. To be conservative, we factor in the competitive pricing environment and marketing dynamics and project product license revenue growth down 21.5% this year but increasing 4.4% next year and gross margins declining 60 basis points next year.Figure 8Figure 9Figure 10Subscription-based cloud services growth has been picking up overseas (small base though - figure 1) and domestic growth has turned down - a bank customers decision to end a cloud trial negatively impacted growth and margins in Q3 - figures 11-13. The current deferred revenue balance has fallen from $17.7 million to $15.6 million and the non-current deferred declined from 784,000 to 406,000. We see adoption from U.S. customers for its cloud solutions as lacking, and we outline why that is below as well as why it could improve. We look for 3.5% (below market) subscription revenue growth in 2017 and 0% growth next year with a 20-basis point increase in gross margins next year as the lost bank client effect lessens.Figure 11Figure 12Figure 13Product support revenue growth has been fairly stable in 2017, but there is a downtrend in gross margins (figure 14) and deferred revenues are down in the current and non-current categories. We look for fractional top line growth this year and a 2% decline next year with gross margins declining 70 basis points this year and 60 points next year.Figure 14In the revitalized consulting unit, revenues are turning up on higher domestic and overseas engagements and bill rates (headcount is flat), after negative comparisons domestically throughout 2016. We forecast consulting services growth of 10.6% this year and 5.3% next year with gross profit increasing by 40 basis points in 2018 and 40 basis points next year.Figure 15Education revenue growth has been uneven, and there's been a significant downdraft in gross margins, which we suspect has been driven by lower pricing to perhaps boost knowledge penetration at client accounts. We look for 1% and 2.5% revenue growth in this smaller revenue category in 2017 and 2018 and see gross margins declining 570 basis points this year and next.Figure 16Overall, we see a decline in total revenue growth this year (-2.6%), a 1.5% decline in 2018 and then a recovery in growth thereafter as new on-premise and potentially cloud technology investments begin to pay off. Importantly, our peak five-year revenue growth is 6.6%, which is below addressable market growth forecasts of 7.6%. We project gross margins declining from 80.5% this year to 73.9% in the next five years from pricing headwinds in on-prem, cloud, product support and education BI solutions segments. More on this below.There are strong drivers underlying BI and analytics market demand, and the biggest dynamic is well explained in figure 17.figure 17Big Data - The four V's of big data (Infographic) describes the exponential increase of digital assets that organizations are trying to leverage. The first V refers to the volume of data being created, e.g., 90% of today's data has been created in the last 2 years, and each day, we create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data which equates to 10 million blue-ray discs.Global revenue in the BI and analytics software market is forecast to reach $18.3 billion in 2017, an increase of 7.3 percent from 2016 - according to the latest forecast from Gartner, Inc. By the end of 2020, the market is expected to grow to $22.8 billion. The modern BI and analytics market (versus the older traditional BI solutions market) is expected to decelerate from the hyper-growth rate of 63.6% growth in 2015 to a projected 19% by 2020. We see MicroStrategy as a traditional vendor in the midst of modernizing its platform solutions.In this space, MicroStrategy is facing strong established vendors and venture funded startups vying for enterprise BI, Analytics spending. Figure 18 below shows the fragmented nature of the market. The main enterprise BI providers include Tableau, Qlik, Microsoft, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), SAS, Teradata (NYSE:TDC), and Informatica (NASDAQ:INFA). However, we are impressed with innovations coming from other challengers such as Sisense, Birst, Clearstory Data, Information Builders and Dundas BI - most are private and smaller than MicroStrategy.figure 18MicroStrategy's core BI and analytics platform has been satisfying many requirements of medium and especially, large enterprises. Its value proposition provides clients with the ability to build, deploy intelligent custom analytics applications to constituents with a common metadata, security and analytics model that allows for the creation of hundreds of dashboards and apps that use a single, centrally defined version of the ""truth"". Thus, for example, in a banking context, it makes sense to have a single definition of risk (although, we see innovation and time to market benefits from business units having multiple grass roots definitions as well.) Giving all analysts access to a single cube (logical data repository) drawn from the corporate data lake with the ability to run all the major business intelligence styles (visualizations, dashboards, desktop discovery and mobile) on premise or in the cloud. Market analysts are scoring the platform well on its reporting, data governance, security, scalability, high availability in memory architecture and its repository connectivity. It has a particularly strong reputation for its scalability, mobile exploration and authoring, ad-hocfigure 19 (Source: Microstrategy)reporting, personalized customer service and quality and availability of end-user training. Most recently Forrester (On premises BI leaders report) ranks MicroStrategy as the leader in enterprise BI platforms with a majority of on-prem deployments in its September 11, 2017, wave report and Dresner Advisory Services ranked MicroStrategy third among 24 vendors for its embedded BI capabilities in its November market study. (Dresner Advisory Study) Gartner (magic quadrant study) had a somewhat less favorable view on MicroStrategy in its early 2017 review.While overall market growth remains healthy, there are cross currents making it challenging for traditional full stack BI vendors. Cloud computing has been one of the most important paradigm shifts for BI vendors to leverage.BI cloud computing growth is being fueled by lower cost-of-ownership, flexibility, reduced complexity, collaboration and speed to insight considerations. And, at the same time, it carries concerns for enterprises around control over data (especially customer data), data security, application functionality, customization, and vendor longevity to mention a few.The most significant cloud computing statistics we have found are as follows:• Joe McKendrick, With Internet Of Things And Big Data, 92% Of Everything We Do Will Be In The Cloud - (article)• Financial services, higher education, business services and retail are the four industries placing the greatest importance on cloud BI today. - 2017 Cloud Computing and Business Intelligence Market Study - Dresner Advisory Services. (article ) Retail is MicroStrategy's biggest vertical.• Dashboard-based reporting (76%), ad-hoc analysis and exploration (57%) and dashboard authoring (55%) are the top three cloud BI use cases. - BARC Research and Eckerson Group Study, BI and Data Management in the Cloud: Issues and Trends 2017. ( study ) MicroStrategy is competitive in each of these areas in on-prem environments not yet for cloud implementations.• Top planned investments in the coming year for cloud BI include advanced and predictive analytics (53%), operational planning and forecasting (44%) and strategic planning and simulation (44%) - BARC Research and Eckerson Group Study, BI and Data Management in the Cloud: Issues and Trends 2017. MicroStrategy trails competitors here.• In the coming year, 69% of companies plan to increase their use of cloud BI, and more than one quarter of companies that haven't implemented cloud BI say they will do so. - BARC Research and Eckerson Group Study, BI and Data Management in the Cloud: Issues and Trends 2017• Gartner found that active and planned cloud BI deployments jumped to more than 51% based on the 2017 respondents survey. (article) Research also shows that cloud BI software is mostly being used by power users, and this is actually a sweet spot for MicroStrategy.• Some workloads that reporting systems and BI middleware have been handling for years, often at costs ranging well into five digits per quarter, can be transported to cloud services for pocket change. - Finding the Best Cloud BI Solutions, Scott M. Fulton, III (article).Modern solutions include offering Software as a service (SAAS) and Platform as a service (PAAS) for building, deploying and managing business intelligence analytics apps in the cloud that access on-prem and cloud data sources.The primary cloud based BI tool competitors are: Cognos Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Oracle BI Cloud Platform, SAP Cloud Platform (formerly SAP HANA Cloud Platform), Domo Cloud, Hadoop MapReduce/hive, Birst, Sisense, and Yellowfin.MicroStrategy offers subscribers the option to host their data warehouse on-prem or in MicroStrategy's secure cloud. The company maintains the software and hardware infrastructure, hosts metadata, and performs most administrative tasks, enabling companies to implement their business intelligence solution more quickly and simply compared to a traditional platform. This is a hybrid model of sorts and it may be appealing to small and mid-sized accounts, but to us, it seems less efficient for larger enterprise accounts which are MicroStrategy's core market segment.MicroStrategy also has a cloud solution that rides on top of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure. It is in coopetition with AWS in that it offers a web-based provisioning console that allows administrators to deploy and manage a fully configured MicroStrategy project on the Amazon Web Services cloud platform. It has dynamic scaling inside AWS, users can connect and query on-premise and private cloud data sources as a single tenant. MicroStrategy currently lacks analytics deployment to the Microsoft Azure cloud platform, though this may be available in the future. Tableau is ahead of MicroStrategy with pre-packaged virtual machines for AWS, Azure, and VMware (NYSE:VMW) deployments and has support for Google Cloud (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). A question mark is how MicroStrategy, other traditional BI solution providers decide to cooperate and compete with the likes of AWS, Microsoft and Google with scope and scale advantages in pure cloud computing environments. AWS for example, provides a cloud platform with a wide array of services for compute, storage, networking, database, analytics (QuickSite), application services, deployment, management, developer, mobile, IoT, AI, security, hybrid, and enterprise applications. This begs the question of whether the infrastructure piece is outside MicroStrategy's core competency.Competitors such as Birst and GoodData have pure multi-tenant Saas on public cloud architectures and the advantage of being built from ground up for cloud deployment. In some respects, MicroStrategy is at a disadvantage with its single tenant model and its traditional BI architecture roots. Birst is probably the leader in pure cloud analytics and is ranked #1 by Forrester and Gartner for cloud/self-service BI. We have noticed positive reviews on Salesforce's BeyondCore offering which has smart-cloud automatic data discovery and native narration capabilities. On SoftwareAdvice.com, MicroStrategy was ranked 25th based on advisor recommendations over the past 30 days. Admittedly, a single data point but we review many simultaneously. So the MicroStrategy platform may lack maturity in some areas of cloud provisioning functionality (which facilitates the creation and management of virtual machines within a company's infrastructure), vertical packages and marketplace content features. Therefore, this mix of competition, technology and marketing issues are preventing the cloud value proposition from resonating well with domestic customers and prospects. Our hope is that stronger international sales performance and practices can be replicated domestically and further investment will close feature gaps.To be competitive, BI vendors must enhance solution intelligence, user experiences, data discovery, increase automation, exploit artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), virtual reality, bots and even blend technologies together. One impact of these newer technologies is that less sophisticated users can make better sense of their data environments, more easily build queries, utilize intelligent suggestions and receive feedback on their analytic discoveries.Natural language (NL) analytics processing, ML and AI are allowing business intelligence content to be consumed and utilized by a broader audience inside and outside of organizations. For example, NL analytics (which utilizes ML) allows spoken and or written queries on structured databases to speed understanding and discovery of decision making information. With natural language generation users get to run queries and receive spoken and text narratives that describes the findings in their data.MicroStrategy 10.7 has bolt-on functionality via NL analytics plugins from Narrative Science and Automated Insights that automatically convert structured dashboard data results into text. We find other vendors offering additional features that for example, let users control dashboards with their voice and receive spoken results using Alexa devices (Tableau). And, more powerful applications are emerging that use voice to automatically query structured databases. TIBCO is getting recognition for its Spotfire product which has AI-driven dashboard creation, point-n-click data science and streamingIntelligent analytics could potentially be a game changer. MicroStrategy's data discovery interface functionality is good however, smart data discovery means automatically finding, visualizing and communicating important findings (correlations, exceptions, clusters, links and predictions) in data in context without having to build the models or algorithms manually. Data exploration happens through visualizations, NL search and NL query technology. There are significant advances happening and so far, we have not seen anything better than Salesforce's BeyondCore or IBM Watson analytics offerings. BeyondCore analyzes millions of data combinations in minutes, for unbiased answers, explanations and recommendations. It automatically finds and explains statistically significant metrics and explains what happened in natural language, why it happened, what will happen and how you can improve it. IBM has incorporated smart discovery in both its Watson Analytics and Cognos Analytics offerings and it is the leader in ML enabled BI.On the demand side, BI buyers are weighing certain platform features more heavily than others in their purchasing decisions and real-time collaboration is becoming more important to buyers. As a baseline, collaborative BI tools allow users to analyze data and exchange information and ideas through Web 2.0 tools like blogs and wikis, support brainstorming through social networking-like features. Companies want to be able to do more, like combining publishing, sharing analytic content in a collaborative social media way. Users should be able to storyboard analytics and intelligence to better communicate findings. Therefore, embedding analytic objects, using annotations, colors, line art, highlighting to enrich, build and share content collaboratively through timelines and discussion threads is key. Domo has collaborative content development, Yellowfin has rich collaboration features that goes beyond basic reporting and dashboards. Pyramid analytics pushes this analogy further with an in-built social collaboration tool set that allows notes and comments (written, annotated, voice recorded) and external attachments to be added to visualizations at the book/report/component/cell levels. It can integrate with third-party applications yammer, chatter and Jive.MicroStrategy has good storyboarding capability in mobile quickstrike and now with its just released version 10.9 a new Dossier capability which has an innovative content library with search functionality for navigating and governing data and analytics that includes NL search, version control and collaboration capabilities to improve content creation and access. This innovation may have the potential to become a catalyst to increase license growth over the next few years.In a number of buyer surveys, data visualization is ranked as the number one feature of interest and Tableau is considered a best in class baseline enterprise BI solution that frequently gets compared to alternatives, so we evaluated MicroStrategy's Desktop 10.0 alongside Tableau 10.3 platform from a user interface standpoint.We used data from excel spreadsheets and a data set from the data.world website testing similar functionality with each tool. We have direct experience with data science software development and tools that helped us to quickly develop first hand knowledge of these offerings.First off, MicroStrategy has good capabilities that enable users to discover patterns, trends and relationships hidden in raw data with its discovery tool but specifically, we found MicroStrategy's all objects view somewhat less intuitive than the Tableau canvas metaphor. What we liked were auto metrics selection, auto linking of attributes repeated across tables, options to type in data directly or paste from a clipboard, the option to do manual database query or run a query using the graphical interface or selecting relational tables, data enrichment was easy, history scripting is very powerful, annotations were simple and summation calculations were easily performed with one click.Tableau was better in some respects such as importing data, one step data preparation, simpler filtering, creating and editing joins across database's, visualization construction, auto charting suggestions based on dimensions and measures, the quality and variety of suggested chart options, subcategory groupings, dashboard modification, the ability to maintain interactivity while doing a snapshot inside of a visualization as well as image sharing and color coding. We were a bit surprised that the Tableau community showed 140,000 users compared to 230,000 active users on MicroStrategy's platform though.Overall, the Tableau interface is more modern, user-friendly, simpler to navigate, easier for data exploration and it produced more interesting visualizations and dashboards. It took less time to build identical dashboards and felt like there was less work involved. It is easy to see how non-technical business people can quickly become productive with the tool. We also noted that immediately after downloading the package we received a welcome email and then many helpful follow-ups to learn more about Tableaus' tool. We are not sure why, but we didn't receive any followup communications after downloading MicroStrategy's desktop.While we evaluated the two desktop solutions it should be noted that BI software is complex and has many uses across multiple industries.Below is a short list of possible applications of BI tools.Schedule regular automated reports/Automatically share reports with clients/Visualize inventory and sales in real time/Pull data from multiple databases/Analyze eCommerce sales in real time/Integrate with cloud computing/services like Amazon Web Services/Pull and analyze data from a CRM/Data mining for deep layers of analytics/Create embedded dashboards in a separate internal system/Provide historical analysis on payroll, benefits and other employee HR data/Embed and/or generate professional reports for clients/Create predictive analytics dashboards and data visualizations/Transform various types of data into a standardized format/Predict trends using data forecasting to help with loss prevention efforts/Assess distribution statuses on-the-go with a mobile device/Visualize supply chain data over time/Analyze the results of your marketing efforts both over time and in real time/Optimize employee scheduling based on your highest and lowest foot traffic times/Analyze commonalities in routes for various truck types, bridge weight ratings/Provide clients with self-service data visualization capabilities and more.Another important trend we see is the broadening BI, Analytics user bases within enterprises which has led to the rise of the self-service data discovery and analytics model. End users used to have to rely on centralized IT groups (which could have different priorities and inadequate staff at times) for analytics reporting. Gartner foresees that by 2020, self-service BI platforms will make up 80% of all enterprise reporting. With advances in BI technologies, exponential growth in data, business units have found value in performing data analysis and reporting themselves. Now IT departments with BI competency are working alongside business unit managers and users who have more decision-making power. So, purchasing power is shifting from IT to business units where information workers with non-IT or data science backgrounds are evaluating and consuming the solutions. Because of this trend and the fact that its historic go to market strategy was IT-centric, MicroStrategy could be having challenges getting better performance from its marketing efforts, thereby becoming a catalyst for better performance.MicroStrategy V 10.0 has good self-service data preparation, visual data discovery and big data exploration on large, complex data sets. Still, leading edge functionality includes guidance in forming queries or data exploration, ML enabled auto semantic discovery for example, and we did find other tools available with richer functionality like IBM Watson Analytics with ML and AI features such as a smart data science assistant that acts as both a servant and guide, instant insights on data sets from pre-built algorithms (users can type in natural language questions to automatically retrieve relevant information and get suggestions that fit. Suggestions are explorable with automatic visualizations and infographics). Surprisingly though, Watson doesn't have real-time analytics. MicroStrategy does. Tableau desktop has guidance in forming queries and data exploration, but it doesn't have prompts for lower-skilled users or semantic NL querying the last time we checked. Power BI has prompts for lower skilled workers, guidance in forming queries and data exploration but lacks semantic NL querying. Niche vendor Logi Analytics has governed data discovery imbedded within its analytic apps, a quick-launch visualizer that smartly understands the data and creates visualizations, automatic data hierarchy creation and data animations.MicroStrategy has opportunities to advance its platform in a few other respects. We understand that MicroStrategy buyers need significant technology resources, business intelligence competency and that installation and configuration can be complex. (Of course, this depends on many factors linked to clients' goals and computing environments.) Some customer reviews cited a steep learning curve for administration and development, a need for key technology skill sets to scale the platform, design and build its core Metadata model and to handle server administration. Though the company has cited its strength in Agile development, there may be lingering quality of product issues such as a need to speed up its new feature and bug fixing cycles. Aside from pricing, these factors could be elevating the total cost of ownership of the solution. In March, the company did say that customer satisfaction rates improved over 2016 and that backlog volume was up, but second and third quarter results contradict this information. Hence our view that there needs to be better sales pipeline management, better backlog tracking as well as better sales and marketing productivity.Some other points of interest:We have been tracking ads for MicroStrategy developers on Dice.com and there has been a decline in demand. Ad count dropped from 29,000 daily in June to 21,342 so far in December 2017.Glassdoor reviews. Based on 714 employee reviews of the company has a score of 2.9 out of 5 stars, a CEO approval rating (46%) and a 53% recommend to a friend rating. There is a pattern of critical disclosures regarding a vacillating technology focus, platform shortcomings, employee turnover (sales turnover rate of roughly 40%), culture, lack of equity incentives for non-management professionals, et. al.The noteworthy criticisms that we saw were as follows:""The majority of employees in sales and marketing are critical and unhappy so it's a very demotivating environment.""""Don't expect to be in a typical high energy, fun tech environment. This might explain why employee turnaround is higher than average. Sales Managers do a poor job of leading & coaching.""""Bad reputation amongst southeast customers, was unable to sell much. Employee morale is low, turnover is high.""""Company lacks a strong marketing department, so a lot of good products and ideas go wasted and remain unseen, which means the company struggles to make profit, which means more layoffs.""""Company course changes are made on a whim and difficult to predict if you aren't in senior management.""To be fair, there were many positive comments, every company has unsatisfied workers, especially after reorganizations but the magnitude of complaints and their specificity makes them relevant. And human resources does explain that they are aware of problems and are working towards improving the situations and already in the month of December overall ratings are starting to improve.So, in summary, there are areas where solutions need to be enhanced to pull up to front-runners in on prem and cloud solutions spaces. We would not be surprised to see increased technology investment in AI and ML, particularly cloud provisioning, smarter data discovery/data preparation, interactive visualization, automation, benchmarking and perhaps fraud and threat protection (given the massive data breaches disclosed by the SEC, Equifax - which put about half the nation's population at risk of identity thefts, for example).One possibility for quickly improving the platform is to acquire new, faster growing technology (it has excess cash on its balance sheet) and it did make a significant return on its angel.com acquisition in 2013, but the company seems to have an organic growth bias. Perhaps this will change - witness technology acquisitions by Tableau, IBM, SAP, Microsoft and others.We suspect that for a period of time the market may reward faster growth and lower profitability, and this is what management is hoping to achieve per their announcement on the second quarter conference call. Their statements also made it clear that the company's focus is on BI and analytics, it is not entirely clear then what the plans and priorities are for the internet of things market where it has real-time analytics and streaming capabilities or with Usher, its enterprise access and authentication offering.These considerations collectively translate into our conservative near-term revenue and earnings views. More specifically, because BI migrations to the cloud are growing, it is logical to expect demand for traditional on-prem licenses to slow over time but there is expanding consumption of BI, Analytics throughout organizations which should keep on-prem seats growing. Plus, the addressable market is large, fragmented and MicroStrategy only has a roughly 4% market share. It is not unreasonable for MicroStrategy to be able to rekindle license growth back toward a 7.6% addressable market growth rate over the next three years through platform innovation, lower total cost of ownership, improved customer support and better sales and marketing campaigns.We see total revenue down 3% this year, down 1.5% in 2018 then picking up beginning in 2019. Our 2017 and 2018 revenue point forecast is $497 million and $489 million generating fully diluted EPS of $5.11 and $3.47 respectively. For 2019 we see $516 million in revenue and EPS of $4.05.On the product license line, we use -21.5% growth this year, -4.6% growth next year and then a return to a 7.7% market growth rate by 2019. On the subscription license line, we look for 3.5% annual yoy growth this year followed by 0.0% in 2018 and 6% in 2019. We think pricing pressure will present based on competitors policies (particularly Tableau, Microsoft Power BI) and growing cost driven enterprise BI migrations to the cloud, so we model marginally declining license margins each year. But we are mindful of the potential for MicroStrategy to increase pricing power from more highly valued platform enhancements.MicroStrategy has one of the highest return on invested capital levels in the peer group at 49.5%, so It has done a good job of allocating capital to high net present value projects. Its economic earnings margin is quite handsome at 40.8%. Not surprisingly, NOPAT, free cash flow and economic earnings are declining but the shares carry an attractive 8% FCF yield. Even though cash flow is declining MicroStrategy should not have a problem funding increasing capital expenditures (large cash and equivalents balances) and we captured this in our discounted cash flow valuation. Looking at MicroStrategy's price to economic book value ratio over the 2012-2017 range, the ratio has been as high as 7.0x and as low as 1.07x right after the negative earnings surprise in June. It now sits just above that low of at 1.09x. A ratio of one times implies a zero-growth expectation in perpetuity for the firm, so we are more comfortable that upside potential is significantly greater than downside potential.Overall, there is a good deal of disappointment discounted into the shares. The company's inability to transform the past restructuring, technology upgrade cycle and the cloud solution into faster revenue/EPS growth is a main overhang. And, investors should be asking whether or not the company can convincingly grow over the 500 million revenue threshold (which tends to be an important software company milestone), whether it can reduce its dependency on Amazon exposed retail customers, and most importantly, elevate license/maintenance/recurring subscription revenue growth through a more competitive solution with higher brand awareness marketed through a more productive sales force. We think these are hurdles that management should be able to make.The technology vision for the platform is strong, its core traditional enterprise BI stack is competitive, and we are encouraged to see the new dossier collaborative notebook innovation and business intelligence/analytics tech market analysts are turning more positive on the 10.9 platform upgrade which should help awareness and marketing efforts. In addition, shareholders could also potentially benefit from tuck-in technology acquisitions, repatriation of foreign currency holdings at favorable tax rates (then perhaps repurchase shares at these attractive levels), realization of a lowered top corporate tax rate pending congressional approval and perhaps, draw interest from a strategic buyer or private equity group.Our valuation methods produce a target fair value range of $176-184 for the shares. Under a takeover scenario, we observe that three businesses similar to MicroStrategy were taken private - Qlik, Informatica and Tibco in recent years. Qlik which had declining revenue growth, mainly from on-prem North American license sales went out in June 2016 at a $3 billion valuation (acquired by private equity firm Thomas Bravo LLC). Its shares were valued at 4.1x forward consensus revenues. Using our 2018 projected revenues and the same multiple translates into a 2.015 billion valuation representing a $176 price target.Since 2010 we have seen a market cap to revenue multiple that ranged from 1.7x - 4.4x. The shares currently trade at 3.1x our 2017 revenue estimate of $497mm. As the market anticipates growth the multiple should expand. We use a below average 4.3x multiple attached to 2018 revenues giving a target market cap of 2.103 billion which translates into a 37% upside - a fair value target of $184 per share. Also of interest, the EV/EBITDA multiple shows that at 8.2x TTM EBITDA, the company is the lowest in the group where the average is 14x but its TTM -EBITDA margin is higher than comparables IBM and Teradata.We also value shares using a 2-stage, free cash flow to the firm model based on Aswath Damodaran's framework. We derived our beta estimates used in our WACC by performing regressions of weekly MicroStrategy returns versus the S&P 500 index returns, adjusting the raw beta using the Bloomberg formula to account for the tendency of beta values to converge towards a value of one. We used 5 years of returns data. Our debt adjustment comes from our capitalizing operating leases and using the 10-year treasury bond yields as a proxy for the risk-free rate and an E&Y market premium estimate of 5.7%.While the company has maintained a negative non-cash working capital balance we modeled a gradual improvement back towards zero as we see the current position as unsustainable over our analysis time frame. We expect cash flows to contract on increased property plant and equipment expenditures and estimate the value of outstanding employee stock options using the Black-Scholes model. Here we use the 7- year treasury bond yield as a proxy for the risk-free rate.Using our estimates of growth and profitability, the model produces a fair value estimate for the shares of $184. Over the next five years (2018 -2022) we forecast a small revenue CAGR of 4% producing an earnings CAGR of 7%. Interestingly, if we assume zero growth in revenues over the 5-year growth stage of the model, the fair value equates to $177 per share.figure 20figure 21figure 22figure 23figure 24figure 25figure 26figure 27figure 28Thank you for reading this Seeking Alpha PRO article.

3875716,98236,2016-02-08T16:10:32-05:00,"MicroStrategy has achieved a significant, if unheralded, operating turnaround during the course of 2015.Q4 results demonstrated the potential profitability of the company's business model, with non-GAAP operating margins reaching 36% coupled with 20% growth in license revenues.The company has a significant relationship with Facebook which is both a significant customer and a development partner.The company continues to have what are thought to be leadership positions in various phases of big data analytics for large enterprises.The company leader, after years of dysfunctional behavior, has apparently aligned his interests with those of shareholders and has suspended his cash compensation and has been holding conference calls.","Introduction:MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) is one of the older enterprise software companies having been founded as long ago as 1989 and it has been basically run by a single individual, Michael Saylor, since its inception. In the late 1990s, it was one of the shooting stars of the dotcom era, and it went public at the height of that bubble at some enormous valuation. It was a poster child for all that was wrong with many of the IPOs of the era, making no money and never really creating a business franchise. That being said, Mr. Saylor, a graduate of MIT and in the top 1% of his graduating class, has undoubtedly been an industry visionary and he pioneered what are today standard solutions in the Business Intelligence space using what was then a new technology called ROLAP in which data is stored far more efficiently and at a greater scale than can readily be done in standard Relational Databases (RDBMS). Mr. Saylor's vision has encompassed such areas as mobile and data visualization. Needless to say, along the way there have been some clinkers in the stack that have cost MSTR more than a little in time, money and emphasis. Most recently, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has been a prominent customer and development partner of MicroStrategy. Other prominent customers of its flavor of Big Data Analytics include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), Lowe's (NYSE:LOW), Four Seasons, Target (NYSE:TGT), Hilton (NYSE:HLT), eHarmony, Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB), MetLife (NYSE:MET), Swift and Adidas (OTCQX:ADDYY). I would say that most of these customers chose MicroStrategy as their vendor because of what they perceived as the company's leadership in analytical technologies which apparently overcame its reputation as a vendor with whom it was difficult to do business.The company announced a significant upside surprise in both earnings and license revenues when it reported Q4 operating results after the market closed on Jan. 27th. At that time, the shares spiked by more than 20%, although they never quite reached the levels that they had sold for at the start of 2016. In the wake of the disappointing results announced by Tableau (NYSE:DATA) last Thursday evening, the shares have retraced much of that move and now sit 10% above where they had been before the company announced its earnings. Shares have decreased by about 14% year to date.BackgroundMicroStrategy has struggled for many years now and has had more transformations than some folks have had hot dinners. The company was a pioneer in what is called Relational On-line Analytical Processing (ROLAP) which is still the basis for many of the solutions that the company offers. It was one of the first vendors in developing mobile apps to display the answers to complex queries. It built an engine that combined its query capabilities with desktop visualization. It made its applications available for cloud deployment and on a subscription basis reasonably early in the game. Today, cloud revenues are running at a bit more than $30 million/year. MicroStrategy entered the social media space through a relationship with Facebook, a significant customer these days. And it recently introduced its ""Usher"" security platform in order to ensure the integrity of all of the data its analytic engines process. And with all of these product advantages, the company simply never made it into the first tier of business intelligence vendors. Q4, as I will discuss, may possibly have been a breakthrough quarter for MicroStrategy, with license revenues up 20% year on year, and up about 40% sequentially. But license revenues were still shy of the levels that were reached in 2011.Not to put too fine a point on the discussion, but I believe that the basic reason for the checkered performance over the past decade and more, and really for the lack of historic performance overall, has been the company's CEO, founder and control stockholder, Michael Saylor. There is little doubt that Mr. Saylor is an industry visionary as can be seen just by looking at some of the areas in which MSTR has been first to market with leading-edge technology. On the other hand, he has been more than a little arrogant, irascible and disrespectful of other stakeholders, including investors and customers and his co-workers/employees at various times. At the height of the dotcom craze, Mr. Saylor was worth several billion dollars and was reputed to be the wealthiest man in the DC area. He was trumpeted as the Washington area's most eligible bachelor and reputedly partied very hard. He is now 51, worth lots less (although still around $500 million according to various publications) and is married with two children. Even his yacht, the 154-foot long Usher is now part of a pool that is available for charter (Mr. Saylor has founded a company that is described as the Netjets of the nautical world). The company started to hold conference calls with investors for the first time in almost a decade in July 2014, and Mr. Saylor gave up his salary and bonus in September of that year.The company has seen multiple restructurings and changes in emphasis over the years. The last growth spurt that occurred back in 2010/11 was a function of an incredible burst of spending that basically did little to increase shareholder values. Since then, the company has been through a couple of changes of sales management and much of its field sales force turned over as well. The real issue for investors going forward is whether or not the company can take its assets - its technology, its visionary status and its customer roster - and create an engine for sustainable and profitable growth.Investment ThesisI have to confess that there have been times in my analytical career that I have pledged to avoid turnarounds and restructuring stories like the plague. The risks involved are not insubstantial, and explaining away one's premature or misplaced enthusiasm is always an uncomfortable exercise. But at the heart of my thesis is that although Big Data Analytics is no longer the Alpha and Omega of investing in enterprise software, it remains as one of the great growth opportunities, both now and in the foreseeable future, and MicroStrategy has a combination of the right technology and relatively reasonable valuation. Given the track record of the controlling shareholder, it would be impossible for me to suggest that there is a 100% chance that company will always be run on sober and rational lines going forward, but there is some evidence that at the least the CEO is in a phase of maturation and attempting to align his interests with those of shareholders.Trying to evaluate the plethora of Big Data Analytics offerings is tedious at best, and for me, it has to be left to professionals in the field. For better or worse, the company has been in the Gartner ""Magic Quadrant"" for years. I think the Gartner report on the BI space sums up MSTR's situation quite effectively. I will just quote an extract. ""MSTR offers an enterprise-grade and organically grown end to end BI platform that is well-suited to large and complex system of record reporting… It has a compelling product and vision for large-scale governed data discovery and has invested early in cloud and mobile BI...""""Executive turnover and restructuring may have contributed to eroding the customer experience… We need to see execution at MicroStrategy… if it is to remain a Leader in the Magic Quadrant in the future...""It is my belief that the company is on the cusp of a potential breakthrough, although my confidence level cannot be terribly high. There is an old saying about ""a single swallow not making a spring."" But I do think that some of the metrics seen in Q4 and frankly throughout 2015 are encouraging signs that need to be considered objectively and not as afterthoughts of Mr. Saylor's lengthy record of inconsistent performance.I should point out at the outset of reviewing the financials and the valuation that MSTR's shares are not going to be suitable for some investors. The company continues to be controlled by its founder Michael Saylor through his ownership of more than 2 million class B shares with options of several hundred thousand additional shares around current prices. The company has a float of just 8.6 million shares, a function of the company repurchasing much of its capitalization over the past decade or so. In total, 97% of those shares are held by institutions, a function of the high absolute price of the company's shares and its history of not being accessible to many investors until 2014. The company's shares are below both their 50-day and 200-day moving average. On the other hand, its short interest is above 10% of the float, a relatively high percentage and one that has led to significant upside gaps when and if the company is able to exceed consensus expectations. The company, while holding conference calls and presenting its product vision, has still not yet provided guidance, either of the short-term variety which is quite understandable, but not of the long-term variety either, which would be somewhat helpful.Valuation and Recent Business PerformanceIn the wake of the Tableau disaster and the concomitant meltdown of many tech shares, particularly those in any way engaged in enterprise analytics, MSTR seems to have achieved some reasonable valuation metrics as a combination of better financial performance coupled with some severe multiple compression. The company sells for 2.3X EV/S based on estimates for 2016 sales, a relative modest ratio, particularly if the company can restore its growth engine. (It should be noted that the company has 2 million class B shares outstanding and calculations for valuation ratios have to be adjusted to include the class B shares. The divisors that one sees in some screens are in error as they do not adjust for this consideration). It has a P/E of 16X on forward earnings, although for a company like this, which doesn't guide and has only five analysts covering it, I think the consensus is a less valuable marker than would otherwise be the case. It's worth noting that earnings surprises over the past 12 months, all positive, have ranged from 86% to 5% and were 54% last quarter. Earnings leverage for this company is significant and modest top line upside will inevitably lead to major EPS beats. Of the five analysts who are publishing estimates and reporting them to Thomson/First Call, the average expectation for revenue growth in the current quarter is less than 3%. While part of those estimates are based on declines on the services and support lines as part of the company's transformation process, the estimates suggest that analysts are loathe to extrapolate from Q4 license growth performance. That being said, the average rating at 2.1 on a scale of 1 to 5 combined with a price target average of $210, or more than 35% appreciation from current levels, suggests that there is a bit of inconsistency between published earnings and revenue estimates and real expectations.It is not too much to describe MSTR's Q4 as the best quarter that the company has printed overall for many years now. The company achieved significant product revenue growth in the quarter and was able to achieve improvements both in gross margins and in operating margins of some significant amounts. The improvement in gross margins was mainly a function of the changes in the company's mix between license and services revenues. What was most impressive and frankly under appreciated was that the higher license revenues came on the back of significantly lower sales and marketing spend which dropped by 16% for the quarter compared to 2014 and was down by no less than 34% for the year as a whole. It should be noted that with the strong performance of license and subscription revenues in Q4, and the likelihood that a fair cohort of sales personnel was making commission accelerators, the 16% decrease in sales and marketing spend was more remarkable than it might seem.This is not the place for commenting in any detail about sales productivity and the factors that might drive sales productivity for this company or for other software companies, but the improvement that MSTR was able to achieve last year in that category and the lesser but still significant improvements the company made in SG&A spending both during the quarter (down 12%) and the year (down 16%) are quite suggestive of a new approach to running the business which is perhaps not totally appreciated by investors after so many years of disappointment. The company shrank headcount by 20% last year and, in particular, shrank the sales and marketing headcount by 23%. The reductions in headcount bottomed out last quarter during which overall headcount and sales headcount were essentially flat. Overall, the company achieved non-GAAP operating margins of 36% last quarter and 29% for the year. While most software companies talk about the need to ""invest"" in order to grow, some of that is self-serving. Higher sales, particularly in the current era of the software business, are not always a function of increasing sales headcount - and one has just to look at Tableau to see the validation of that statement. While I would be reluctant to model for significant growth in operating margin percentage for this company if I had to publish an estimate, I doubt that it has reached an apogee in terms of operating margin performance and it still has work to do in rationalizing its delivery of consulting and services revenues.The company has had a decent balance sheet for years. It has $485 million in cash and equivalents which is equivalent to $42/share or 27% of the current share price. The company's operating cash flow for the year was just shy of $150 million, and for those concerned about the metric, net stock based compensation was just 11% of that amount. Free cash flow was greater than $136 million. MicroStrategy's capital expenditures are minimal, although it does capitalize some software development. The company has a free cash flow yield on its enterprise value of greater than 10%, although it is hard to imagine that the company will be able to continue to have greater free cash flow than earnings given the constituents of 2015's cash flow figures and the potential for future growth in revenues.ConclusionWhile MicroStrategy's shares are not in the deep value category, the recent pullback in the wake of Tableau's disaster, coupled with a remarkable year-long turnaround in operating performance that is unheralded and more or less unnoticed by many, has created an intriguing investment opportunity. Given the value of the company's technology stack, coupled with the favorable dynamics of the market in which it operates, I'm inclined to think that the favorable license sales results of Q4 are not a fluke but are a trend that might persist for some time. Further, the restructuring the company has achieved will allow any success to have a significant impact on earnings and operating cash flows which has not been the case in the past. I don't suggest that this company is going to have a straight upward path to a blue empyrean - I simply have had too much experience with the current CEO to ever imagine that - but I do think the risks and rewards are nicely valued in favor of investors at this point."
2554735,41741,2014-10-11T01:00:21-04:00,"MSTR rallied on news that it was cutting 20% of its BI workforce.This further confirms our belief that MSTR is struggling in the BI category.However, we’ve been taken to the woodshed since our initial article as MSTR continues to defy gravity with its valuation.","MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) broke the news that it was cutting a fifth of its business intelligence workforce, with the employees spread across various continents - shares jumped nearly 9% on the news. The deal is expected to save $75 million a year in operating expenditures. The other explanation for the pop is that the market is taking any news out of MSTR as good news. The company had a decade-long no-communication policy, but shifted away from that earlier this year in an effort to better appeal to Wall Street.In October of last year we called out MSTR as a potential short. We were wrong - dead wrong; with the stock up 47% since then. Were we just early? Maybe, but there are a couple of things keeping the stock propped up, and who knows for how long. One, is the relative strength in the term ""business intelligence,"" no matter where you rank, just being in the business is a positive; and two, is the activist investor presence.There is something to be said for business intelligence:But the argument remains that MSTR is a small fish among sharks - Gartner has MSTR behind the likes of IBM, Oracle and Microsoft in the field.We didn't like the valuation last year, and it's still grossly stretched. With the stock trading at 100x earnings and 39x EV/EBITDA. Regardless, the markets can remain irrational longer than investors can stay solvent. This is especially true for a company with $33/share in cash and no debt. In any case, we think the company is due for a correction, but with Apex Capital as an activist investor, there is a backstop to the share price. Sandy Colen of Apex Capital wrote in a letter to MSTR earlier this year:Co-founder Michael Saylor continues to run the company 25 years after founding it. Getting this technical co-founder out of the CEO spot would be a big positive for the company and could push the stock price even higher."
2613625,61281,2014-10-29T18:56:52-04:00,"MicroStrategy reported Q3’14 earnings results that beat analysts’ expectations.MicroStrategy's high operational expenses and unstable revenues drove the company's net income in the past few quarters.MicroStrategy underwent a thorough restructuring targeted to lower operational costs to increase efficiency and drive sustainable profitability.MicroStrategy is expected to increase revenues and improve profitability in 2015.Stock might be expensive to buy now, however, existing shareholders should expect a possible 10% upside in 2015.","Earnings Results OverviewMicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), a business intelligence software developer, reported its Q3'14 results after the market closed on October 27. MicroStrategy reported quarterly revenue of $151.2M, $4M above analysts' expectations with 7% year-over-year growth driven by higher cloud analytics revenues. As shown in chart 1 below, quarter-over-quarter growth in Q3'14 is higher than the company presented in the third quarter one year and two years before. Higher quarter-over-quarter increases out-performed the seasonal revenue trend that big data software vendors usually follow and may drive an annual revenue increase compared to 2013 overall revenues.MicroStrategy was able to reduce its net loss to around $1M from a $10M loss in Q2'14 and reported -$0.07 EPS, which is $0.11 above analysts' expectations for the quarter.As mentioned above, seasonality in MicroStrategy's revenues is not unique to the company. It is a broad common phenomenon across most of the big data software vendors. However, MicroStrategy's revenues fluctuations are sharper than its competition's, and that can indicate a sales execution problem. I compared the quarter-over-quarter change in four leading big data software vendors: MicroStrategy, Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), Informatica (NASDAQ:INFA) and Tableau (NYSE:DATA). As shown in chart 2 below, MicroStrategy's quarter-over-quarter revenue increase is usually lower and the decrease steeper than that of the other players.Even though the entire big data software market experienced high fourth quarter revenues and weak first quarter revenues, MicroStrategy experienced the biggest decline in first quarter revenues and the smallest increase in first quarter revenues for the companies compared above. Nevertheless, the problematic revenue trend is only part of the problem at MicroStrategy, the rest lay within the operational expenses.In the last 12 quarters, on average MicroStrategy spent 37% of its revenues on research and development, 21% on sales and marketing, and 18% on general and administrative. In total, the company spent 74%, coupled with a 25% cost of revenues expenses, every quarter in the last 12 quarters, and spent an average of 99% of its revenues every quarter.The unbelievable figure of 99% of revenues spent each quarter on operational expenses and cost of revenues, together with the fluctuations in revenue, result sin an instability of the company's bottom line. They are also a cause for the generation of a small net profit in one quarter and a small net loss in another quarter. In light of the financial status described above, a thorough, comprehensive change was required in order to drive sustainable growth and financial stability.Business OverviewMicroStrategy's management is well aware of the problems raised above and has initiated the restructuring of the company in order to address these problems and turn the situation around. The company will focus on three main areas: to improve process efficiency, reduce redundancies, and reduce costs.The company has reassessed the necessity of existing procedures and processes. As a result, MicroStrategy consolidated some overlapping procedures, eliminated others that were inefficient, and standardized any processes still active in the company. The re-thinking of existing processes and elimination of those with low added value can improve operational efficiency. MicroStrategy re-looked at its site strategy and decided to close and consolidate some sites. International locations in high-cost areas where shut down (Beijing and Moscow) while satellite sites were consolidated into the main locations of the company.As part of the restructuring, the company also will cut its headcount. The CEO, Michael Saylor, mentioned during the earnings call that he is positive that the headcount cut will not have any impact on the generation of future revenues as some of the headcount aims to eliminate redundancy and others are not in revenue facing departments. The company announced that it was going to implement new corporate performance analytics and budget and planning platforms. The platforms will track the benefits of the restructuring and maintain the level of operational expenses achieved with the change. Lower operational expenses as a result of the restructuring is expected from 2015, and, if MicroStrategy can keep the same level of revenues, investors should expect some improvement in the company's earnings. The company highlighted cloud analytics for enterprises and mobile services to be the emerging revenue streams for 2015. Cloud analytics revenues increasing in Q3'14 may act as a catalyst for 2015 earnings improvements together with the operational expenses reduction.Stock AnalysisAs shown in chart 3 below, MicroStrategy's stock rallied in the last two years and completed a 40% increase since 2012 and a 25% increase year-to-date. MicroStrategy is currently traded in a P/E of 118 and very close to its 52-week high of $165 is a bit expensive to buy. However, in light of restructuring and focusing on emerging revenue streams, investors should expect earnings improvement in 2015. I estimate that these processes will drive MicroStrategy's 2015 revenues 4% up from 2014 revenues to overall annual revenues of $630M, which is slightly above analysts' estimation of $626M. Annual revenues in product licenses and subscription services is expected to increase 9% year-over-year, while product support and other services are expected to increase 2%. Annual revenues of $630M reflect a 10% increase up to a $172 share price based on a 3.1 P/S.ConclusionsMicroStrategy reported better than expected third quarter results, beating analysts' expectations for EPS and revenue. The company was able to grow revenue beyond expectations even though it underwent a deep change. The company is currently focused on completing the restructuring successfully and generating revenues from its emerging revenue streams: cloud enterprise analytics and mobile. In order to deliver positive results in Q4'14 and 2015, the company should execute the revenues increase and expenses decrease it discussed in the earnings call. As a stock is a bit expensive in my opinion and the possible upside in 2015 is 10 percent, current investors should hold their position in MicroStrategy, but prospective investors may want to wait and see that the company delivers everything it has planned to do."
2423755,21620,2014-08-14T14:18:37-04:00,"MicroStrategy is going through both a management and product transition with some serious unknowns about restoring growth and margin.The shares have not corrected and discount everything going well over the next 12 months.An informed eye would say they will have trouble, particularly in expanding into the identity and access market.The company will survive, but the shares are vulnerable to a sell-off as investors wait for more positive results.","NutshellMicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) has had some challenges lately and is now working on both an organizational and product line transition that will take a year or more to play out. Meanwhile, the shares haven't had any meaningful pullback, which seems at odds with our expectations.MSTR has long been a bit of a cult stock in the business intelligence (BI) segment due in no small part to a small stock float and its eccentric CEO. As the stock price chart included later in this article shows, the stock often swings up and down by 20 to 40 points (or about 20-40% based on an average share price of $100).Recently, management acknowledged that revenue growth is low (+3% for June 2014) while expense growth is too high (+15% for the same period.) They announced a $40M restructuring, simpler product packaging, and have embarked on a brand new initiative called Usher, which is in the crowded identity management space. Management describes the transition as at least a 12-month period after which they believe they can generate 10% operating margins.If we give them growth back to $625M in 2015, the 10% margin, apply a generous 20x multiple, and adjust for the $367M in cash, we end up with a total market capitalization of $1.6B, which is right where the shares are right now.There are quite a few moving parts here and plenty of potential bumps in the road as the company works through the transition. We follow the identity management space closely and have a hard time envisioning high margin sales growth for MSTR in that market.Challenges and OpportunitiesBefore firing off bullet points about the company, the end markets are healthy. Business intelligence is quite mature, but still growing 8% or so per year according to Gartner Group. Firms with differentiated solutions like Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), Tableau (NYSE:DATA), Varonis (NASDAQ:VRNS) and Qlik (NASDAQ:QLIK) are growing revenue much faster. Identity management is a little harder to pin down, but it is certainly growing in terms of activity and priority. However, here existing platform technology and online service providers are extending their solutions into this space. At the same time, numerous start-ups and smaller companies (like LifeLock (NYSE:LOCK), for example) target this specific market.An excellent article by woodworker-analyst David Hernandez prompted our look at MicroStrategy, and it makes an excellent backdrop to our own views: MicroStrategy's Leadership Causing Company to Struggle.Challenges:· After a weak Q2 during a stated ""transition year,"" the shares remain near highs, making the share price vulnerable to a major decline before ""easy compares"" begin to materialize in 2015.· An increase in investor-related communication is probably a good thing, but the CEO might be prone to gaffs as a technical founder type. Sometimes it works out fine (as in Zuckerberg), or not (as in Andrew Mason.)· Competition in BI is as stiff as ever, and MicroStrategy will find it difficult and/or expensive to get back into a mode of gaining (or at least not losing) market share. Despite fairly heavy spending on sales and marketing ($215M in 2015), revenue growth is slight. Gartner Group has MSTR in its ""leadership quadrant,"" but behind eight other vendors including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL).· Pushing into identity management is risky. Industry analysts have pointed out that this has ""created an ambiguous product portfolio and blurred the company's marketing message"" and ""have diverted sales, development efforts, and focus away from addressing critical market requirements for ease of use and data discovery.""· To make matters worse, in identity management the strong players, notably IBM, are investing huge sums of money in being a leader in this market, including buying best-of-breed technology vendors and service providers. This is not a great market to attack without a 10-year plan.· Management restructuring and ""vacuum"" in Head of Sales role is often a situation that causes some operational shortfalls, particularly in booking sales and hitting quarterly numbers. Even if the new sales executive is announced today, it takes three to six months to review and revamp existing processes and staff (where required).Opportunities:· With over $360M in cash on the balance sheet, MicroStrategy is in a good position to acquire companies that might accelerate their execution. Purchase accounting can help with growth and technology, and service-provider acquisitions might create a strong brand message in either BI or identity.· In the BI space, firms like Datawatch (NASDAQ:DWCH), or even Veronis, would provide some new facets of functionality, growth and long-term positioning in the core market.· Activist investor Apex Capital is targeting MSTR. If it gets its way and forces an ouster of the current CEO and a big stock buyback (with such a small float) the shares would get a major lift. And Apex would enjoy a nice return on the 467K shares it owns. For example, a $300M buyback at thecurrent price would take out about 20% of the already-thin float.ConclusionIt seems unlikely that activist investors will be enough to unseat the current CEO, and the transition will proceed apace over the next year. If Apex Capital doesn't get satisfaction, then it will be tempted to sell off its shares. (Investors should be reminded that it's often the case that options are used in concert with outright share ownership, which can make ownership a murky issue.)The corporate strategy to go after a meaningful position in the identity management space, even while its core BI business is not growing, is at least risky even if it's not just a plain bad idea.At current prices, the stock appears to reflect a successful restructuring even though the company hasn't demonstrated much yet and has two to four more quarters to go. With management in the midst of an organizational restructuring and no announced Head of Sales, it may lose a step or two along with some of its better people.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

4140680,103480,2018-01-27T11:02:47-05:00,"MicroStrategy, a provider of BI and analytics tools, reported decent earnings that beat analyst consensus on revenue and earnings.However, the company's top line is still in a perpetual y/y decline, with no foreseeable path to growth.Earnings and cash flow have compressed sharply from the prior year.Even though MicroStrategy is trading under 2x EV/FTM revenues, the company doesn't really have much in the way of value creation opportunities to support a rally.","It's not the best of times for MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), the Virginia-based developer of BI and Analytics tools that allow businesses to derive insights from their data with drag-and-drop visualizations and graphics. The company managed to engineer a nominal ""beat"" to earnings - but at this point, expectations are so low that the beat was all but an inevitability.There's a fine line between balancing value and growth in technology stocks, especially in the enterprise software sector. On one hand, high-flying growth stocks that are trading at >10x revenue multiples like Workday (NASDAQ: WDAY) and Appian (NASDAQ: APPN) are terrible investments, at least in my opinion; but on the other side of the spectrum, the technology stocks that are trading at <2-3x revenues like MicroStrategy aren't much better either. The expensive stocks' potential is capped by their excessive valuations - sooner or later, when the bull market turns, investors are going to decide it's not worth paying 11x or 12x revenues to hold on to Appian. On the flip side, the cheap stocks' future is capped by their inability to keep growing.Other sectors in the market are able to survive revenue declines better because their businesses are cyclical, but in technology, it's a much more damning flaw. Take the example of two declining companies, for example: Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) and IBM (NYSE: IBM); one an industrial company and the other a technology company. Caterpillar is a good example of a company that can return to growth after a cyclical downturn: after years of declines in heavy machinery, Caterpillar came roaring back as capex spending jumped in response to the coordinated global growth that has plastered business headlines. Caterpillar's fate can rise and fall with the economic cycle; revenue declines in one year can easily be reversed the next. But with a software stock, revenue declines are symptomatic of a seismic technology shift, an uphill competitive dynamic, or general lack of demand - and these factors aren't cyclical; they are more or less permanent. For IBM, it took twenty-three quarters (six years!) for the company to show a positive y/y revenue comp, and that's only because it invested billions into new initiatives into cloud services to basically choke out some growth - and there's no guarantee that this growth can be sustained.MicroStrategy, a much smaller company with ~$500 million in annual revenues and under $700 million in cash, doesn't have the resources or the time to manufacture growth out of entirely new product categories.So the question for investors is this: does MicroStrategy have a path forward? A prior article on this site believes MicroStrategy is trading at good value. I take the opposite side of that coin: I think it's trading at a discount for good reason. MicroStrategy has fallen more than 30% over the past twelve months while the rest of the software sector has enjoyed a gain of nearly the same magnitude. Perhaps the only hope that is keeping this stock from completely falling through the carpet is the hope of an acquisition.MSTR data by YChartsBut I wouldn't get hopes up on a white knight to save MicroStrategy from its current doldrums: BI has become a fairly common technology asset (and that's part of the problem for this company - the ubiquity of strong competitors) and buying the one that's losing business probably isn't going to score any points for would-be acquirers.It's true that MicroStrategy has managed to hold on to its ~$500 million revenue base: a glance at MicroStrategy's featured case studies on its website showcases some of its anchor clients, including Tapestry (NYSE: TPR), eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), and the United Postal Service. But like some of its clients, MicroStrategy is old - nearly thirty years old now, having been founded in 1989. Many investors would be right to suspect that a majority of MicroStrategy's business comes from retained clients, not new deals. Eventually as these clients peel off faster than new ones come in, MicroStrategy will melt into nothing. Management has already embarked on a multi-year strategy revision in an attempt to revive the company - but despite their best efforts, the company still continues to shed revenues and contract its earnings power.The biggest reason, of course, is competition, especially from cloud-friendly services. MicroStrategy, like most original BI vendors, provides an on-premise software BI tool as its flagship product, but also now offers a hosted cloud option. Its transition to the cloud has been slow and clunky - in FY17, subscription revenues represented only 6% of its total ~$500 million revenue base, while the company continues to milk the majority of its revenues from product support like an old-fashioned software company. Compare this to Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE), which in the course of only a few years was able to convert nearly its entire revenue base to SaaS subscriptions.IT buyers now have a wealth of choices when it comes to BI tools - and the big three are called Tableau (NASDAQ: DATA), Microsoft Power BI (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Qlik, recently taken private by Thoma Bravo. All three of these players are ranked as Leaders in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for BI tools - while MicroStrategy occupies a much lower position, behind even IBM and TIBCO Software.Tableau is considered by most to be the ""premium"" option in BI, and it has a reputation for being best in class. While the company struggled in early 2016 from a sales execution stumble, momentum has since returned and the company's cloud hosted version, Tableau Online, has proven to be a success.Microsoft, on the other hand, has charged forward in its enterprise software business across many product lines in recent quarters, with a reputation for both quality and price. Microsoft's Power BI, in particular, is known as a ""budget"" alternative to Tableau - but buyers get the comfort and cachet from buying Microsoft. Reviews for the product have also been extremely positive as of late.The key point from the competitive discussion: between the high-end Tableau and the lower-cost-but-still-good Microsoft, there's not much room in the landscape for MicroStrategy. And that's not to mention all the other competitors (plus Qlik) that are vying for a small piece of the BI market.MicroStrategy's pain is evident in its most recent financial results, even if it can manage to pull off an optical ""beat"" in press releases. Here's a look at the company's Q4 and FY17 results:Figure 1. MicroStrategy earnings summarySource: MicroStrategy investor relationsAs seen in the chart above, revenues continued to decline by -2% this quarter to $138.1 million. Analysts - not expecting much - had an average target of $133.9 million (-5%) for the quarter. Yes, it's a beat, but that doesn't make it impressive. Also, bear in mind that the weak dollar had a positive FX effect on MicroStrategy's results - on a currency-neutral basis, revenues would have been slightly lower and the contraction slightly worse.MicroStrategy also increased its operating expenses - probably not what we want to see in a company that's declining on the top line. We do want MicroStrategy to invest in sales and marketing (which grew 15% y/y to $52.0 million), but it seems the company's sales efforts haven't yielded concrete results yet. What isn't as pleasant to see is the 29% y/y jump in general and administrative costs, to $21.2 million.A company that's declining should take measures to reduce costs, not increase its overhead. No investor likes the deterioration going on at GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO), but at least the company is implementing a workforce reduction to manage costs while it tries to figure out how to revitalize its growth. MicroStrategy's uptick in corporate spending hints at a company that is undisciplined in managing its downturn.Accordingly, operating income halved in the quarter to $18.8 million (a 14% margin), versus $36.7 million (a 26% margin) in 4Q16. Net income swung to a loss of -$26.2 million in the quarter (though this was impacted by a one-time tax charge from the passage of the Trump tax bill).Excluding the impact of the tax charge, MicroStrategy reported pro forma net income of $17.8 million, translating to a PF EPS of $1.55 (beating consensus expectations of $1.37). Again, it's a beat, but still not the kind of results that make investors too happy.Another poor indicator: MicroStrategy's operating and free cash flow declined to $78.3 and $74.3 million, respectively - both down about 30% from the prior year.MicroStrategy doesn't offer concrete guidance (probably a smart move for a company in its position), but analysts on average expect $2.13 in EPS for the coming year, as compiled by Yahoo Finance. That puts MicroStrategy's forward P/E ratio at an absurd 64x. I wouldn't shed a tear about paying that multiple for a company that is undergoing massive earnings growth, but why pay an ultra-premium multiple for a company that's experiencing massive earnings contraction?The outlook for MicroStrategy doesn't appear too healthy. With the competitive environment for BI continuing to intensify (a narrative that has weighed on stocks like Tableau for years), small legacy players like MicroStrategy will continue to be squeezed out.I see only two reasons why investors would hold the stock: one, in the extremely limited hopes of an acquisition, and two, because MicroStrategy's ~$680 million of cash and zero debt makes up nearly half of the company's market cap of $1.5 billion. Netting out that cash and calculating an enterprise value of only ~$900 million for the company, some investors might think that's a cheap ~1.8x multiple to pay for ~$500 million in revenues, especially when most software stocks are trading at 6-7x.But there's a reason that MicroStrategy is cheap, and that's because most investors and analysts don't think the company's shrinking BI business has much of a future. Don't buy into a value trap.There are plenty of cheap software stocks in the market. For ~5x revenues, investors can also acquire shares in Yext (NASDAQ: Yext) and Cloudera (NASDAQ: CLDR), which have also stumbled recently in the markets despite 30-40% revenue growth. It's better to buy loss-bearing companies like these whose robust revenue growth can fuel future earnings expansion than to buy a currently-profitable software stock whose revenue declines will soon turn cash flow into cash burn. With much higher-quality software stocks available on the cheap, there are few reasons to remain long in MicroStrategy."

        MicroStrategy is highly inefficient and will need to do more than their planned $40 million in cuts.
        Michael Saylor's increasing absent and disregard for shareholder money is severely impacting the company.
        New pricing strategy should increase expose but doesn't solve Microstrategy's lack of competitive advantage. Usher is an impressive product but will face stiff competition in the digital payment business.","Transparency Signs Of TroubleMicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) is a provider of Business Intelligence software. The software enables executives to analyze and interpret large amounts of data in order to make quicker and better business decisions. MicroStrategy has grown from a small startup in 1989 to a mid-size Business Intelligence company with revenue in excess of $575 million. Management believes their success can be attributed to focusing on long term goals. Since the company is only focused on the long term, management decided not to participate in quarterly conference calls and attend industry events over the last decade. Management thought conference calls and industry events lead to shortsightedness and would hurt the company over the long run. Yet despite their decade long objection, management decided to host a conference call for their second quarter results. Why would a company adamantly against participating in conference calls and events suddenly change their position?MicroStrategy is struggling. Over the last decade, the company has experienced rapid revenue growth. Revenue has grown 148.9% from $231 million to $575 million. However, MicroStrategy growth has slowed despite solid growth in the Business Intelligence industry. Revenue only grew 1.8% in 2013 while the Business Intelligence industry grew 8%, according to Gartner. The company is also experiencing significant margin issues. Despite more than doubling revenue, operating profit has fallen 71%. Operating profit has fallen 71% because operating margin has fallen 88.7% during the same period. From 2004-2006, operating margins were near or above 30%. Currently, operating margins are barely able to reach 5%. The company's declining profitability didn't occur suddenly. The decline has occurred over many years. Management has simply failed to address the issue. Although this appears to be changing, management announced a plan to cut $40 million in operating expenses and has a plan to address their slowing sales.Good Start But More Cuts NeededDuring 2004-2006, general and administration expense and sales and marketing expense were nearly 40% of total revenue. During 2011-2013, general and administration expense and sales and marketing expense have risen to nearly 55% of total revenue. These operating expenses have jumped nearly 15 percentage points despite the company's rapid revenue growth. Management plans on cutting $40 million dollars from operating expenses. The $40 million in cuts is a great start but the company still has plenty of room for improvement.MicroStrategy has gross margins of 76.8% which is 35.7 percentage points higher than the sector average, according to Reuters. However, the company has an extremely low operating margin compared to peers. Reuters reports MicroStrategy's trailing twelve month operating margin was 3.4% while the sector's average was 14.3%. Even with a $40 million decrease in operating expenses, operating margin would still trail the sector average by 3.1 percentage points. Additionally, the company's 11.2% operating margin would still significantly lag larger competitors like SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) 26.6%, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) 38.6%, and IBM (NYSE:IBM) 19.6%.MicroStrategy is in an unique position in the Business Intelligence industry. They are too large to focus on one single sub-sector like Tableau (NYSE:DATA). Tableau targets small to mid-size companies in need of data discovery tools. Yet, they are too small to offer a complete Business Intelligence package. MicroStrategy relies on companies to have their own enterprise resource planning software. Large competitors like Oracle can offer companies ERP software and plenty of Business Intelligence software options. MicroStrategy's current position puts them at a major disadvantage to competitors. They need to move out of the middle and become a larger vendor. The only way MicroStrategy becomes a larger vendor is by continuing to discover and create innovative product solutions which are difficult to replicate.This goal would be drastically aided by improving efficiency. Currently, sales and marketing and general and administration expenses represent nearly 76% of total expenses. Yet, research and development makes up only 23.5% of operating expenses. In order for MicroStrategy to grow revenue and remain profitable, they need to increase their research and development spending while increasing efficiency. Management's plan to cut $40 million in operating expenses is a good start but management needs to continue their efforts. However, there is one major issue with management's ability to sustain their efforts.CEO Needs To Focus More On OperationsCorporate policies, strategic direction, and corporate culture eminent from the top of an organization down to the bottom. Especially, when the CEO is the founder like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Larry Ellison. Michael Saylor is the founder, CEO, and majority vote holder of MicroStrategy. He has run the company over the last several decades. Michael Saylor believes in focusing on the long-term success of the company instead of the short-term fluctuations. A SmartCEO article demonstrates Michael's long-term focus, Saylor stated ""In our case, we pick the things we think we can sell thousands of for billions of dollars. If I don't think I can generate billions of dollars of revenue from it, I turn it off,"" The article continues to go through Saylor's vision for the company but the article hints at a major problem with Mr. Saylor. Michael Saylor is spending more and more time focusing on non-business related ventures. The article explains he is busy writing a sequel to his first book the mobile wave. Additionally, a Washington Post article states ""Two former MicroStrategy managers said the chief executive has been taking longer and longer trips away from the Tysons Corner headquarters in recent years. They believe that Saylor's trips have resulted in a disconnect from the day-to-day operations."" Michael's focus on non-business related activities is hurting the company. This lack of focus has caused several investors to call for his removal. Apex Capital wrote a letter to the board of directors and executives regarding his removal, according to the Washington Post. Apex Capital claims Michael spends too much time focused on were technology is going rather than the actual day-to-day operations of the company. The lack of focus on day-to-day operations has significantly decreased the company's profitability.Michael's distance from the office and focus on other projects is bad enough but he is using shareholder money to enjoy more non-business activities. In 2012, Michael amended the aircraft-use policy to include up to 50% non-business related flight time, according to the Washington Post. For a company suffering from profitability issues, corporate funds shouldn't be diverted to non-business related activities. The frivolous spending of shareholder money doesn't stop with corporate jets. According to Southern Investigative Reporting Foundation, the company spent $116,670 on company cars, $99,244 in alternative car services, $737,469 on aircraft and $52,000 for security services and equipment (Saylor has the right to spend slightly under $1 million annually on security). These expenditures were only for Mr. Saylor. Michael Saylor makes enough money as CEO to pay for these expenses himself. Yet, he has decided to spend shareholder money for his own personal benefit.MicroStrategy is suffering from a lack of efficiency. However, the CEO continues to frivolously spend company resources. Mr. Saylor's leadership grew the company into a multi-million dollar business. Yet, Mr. Saylor's lack of focus on day-to-day operations and blatant disregard for shareholder money are causing serious doubts about the company's future growth prospects. Management's willingness to continue to cut operating expense will come from the top. As long as Michael Saylor decides to focus on other ventures, the company will continue to lag competitors in profitability and revenue growth.Mr. Saylor attention and involvement is desperately needed at MicroStrategy. The company's recent efforts to improve revenue won't solve the company's growth issues.Price Scheme and Usher Not EnoughThe company recently announced the consolidation of their 21 products into 4 large software bundles. Management has simplified their product offerings to help expose customers to more of their products. Along with a simplified offering, the bundles include a massive discount. For example, MicroStrategy's Architect bundle is priced at $5,000 per user but before the bundle pricing the software would cost $50,000 per user. MicroStrategy's president Paul Zolfaghari believes the price drop won't significantly impact sales because many individual software sales were extremely low, according to a PCworld article. The new pricing strategy should help expose customers to more of the company's software but doesn't fix the company's major issue. They lack a sustainable competitive advantage.Larger competitors are able to offer more products with similar or better features. Although, the top 5 Business Intelligence vendor's market share decreased from 2010 to 2013. The top 5 still accounts for over 70% of the $14 billion industry, according to Gartner. MicroStrategy was the first company to release a mobile Business Intelligence application. Despite the company's early leadership position, the company has since given way to larger Business Intelligence vendors such as SAP. Currently, SAP is the leading mobile Business Intelligence vendor. MicroStrategy didn't offer a significantly better mobile application than their competitors could offer existing clients. SAP had to only offered their customers a similar mobile Business Intelligence application. MicroStrategy new bundling and especially the lower price should help increase their exposure. Yet, they need to offer a revolutionary product which can't be easily duplicated by larger competitors. This is why a company like Tableau's has been successful. Tableau's VizQL is difficult to duplicate and offers a real competitive advantage. MicroStrategy's Management believes their new product called Usher will be this revolutionary product. However, Usher market potential is debatable.Usher is an identity platform which can be used in a variety of ways. MicroStrategy believes it can be used to replace id badges, parking passes, other office related security, and mobile payments. The most lucrative possible market is in the mobile payment business. Management believes Usher has great potential as a digital payment software. Yet, Usher mobile payment prospects aren't very good. They are facing stiff competition and don't have a major competitive advantage over similar digital wallets.The idea for a digital wallet isn't new. Currently, the digit wallet space is filled with competitors trying various ways to gain access to this potentially lucrative business. According to Forrester Research, U.S. mobile payments will top $90 billion by 2017 up from $12.8 billion in 2012. Although growing fast, mobile payments represent a small portion of overall transactions (3.8%), according to Capgemini.The reason for the lack of digital transactions is due to the limited number of stores able to accept digital transactions. Retailers and restaurants are required to spend money upgrading payment systems and software. MicroStrategy's Usher has the same requirement. Although, Usher only requires a Smartphone and additional software. Many company's would have to upgrade their current computer systems or at the very least buy an additional company Smartphone. Usher like other digital wallets will require a significant user base in order to be profitable. Yet, Usher is competing with several company's willing to lose significant amounts of money in order to secure their place in digital payment industry. Since Usher lacks a true competitive advantage, large companies will be at an advantage due to their larger resources and ability to wait for profitability.Usher is entering a highly competitive market with company's better capitalized and willing to lose money for years. They need a major competitive advantage and the current Usher product doesn't appear to have one over competitors in the digital payment arena.Management Needs To Be FixedMicroStrategy has decided to increase transparency by participating in conference calls and industry events. Management's decision was forced upon them by the company's recent subpar performance. Management is trying to increase operating efficiency by cutting expenses by $40 million this year. Yet, the $40 million isn't enough to bring the company to sector averages let alone back to past levels. MicroStrategy will need a sustained and consistent effort to increase their efficiency. However, Michael Saylor's continued absence or lack of involvement in the day-to-day operations has placed these efforts in doubt. Over the last few years, Mr. Saylor's lack of attention has put the company in this predicament. Yet, Michael Saylor continues to place his non-business related ventures above the company's best interest. Unless Michael Saylor decides to get more involved or at least remove himself as CEO, MicroStrategy will continue to struggled due to a lack of leadership and direction. Even with his removal, MicroStrategy lacks a significant competitive advantage over competitors. They need to increase their efficiency which will enable them to increase research and development. This will help in creating a truly sustainable competitive advantage than a price cut and the Usher software will be able to bring.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

3297365,63483,2015-07-01T13:10:39-04:00,Data analytics provider.In the process of establishing a durable moat.Strong outlook in key markets.Cash burn may be worrying.Stratospheric valuation is not warranted given limited growth.,"Landscape of data analyticsIt's no secret that the sheer amount of data has been growing at an exponential pace. Large amounts of data (whether structured or unstructured) are currently being generated every day. Furthermore, once the IoT begins to ramp up (with the proliferation of sensors), I opine that the amount of data collected by these sensors would be far greater.Given this literal explosion of data, it would be simply irrational to hope that anyone would be able to translate, interpret and derive insight from the massive amounts of data by themselves. Following that line of thought, one would be fairly accurate in suggesting that much of this data is basically useless at the current time. Data can be extremely useful in aiding decision-making, but only if it can be interpreted.Furthermore, even if the data could be processed and analyzed, it would take weeks or even months (due to the labor intensity of the task) for a report to be generated, leaving a business unable to act quickly on the insights they have derived. This may not be a problem for a small enterprise, but if your business is global, it is not difficult to imagine what a tall order the aforementioned task would be.Additionally, there's the issue of security. Keeping in mind my discussion in prior paragraphs, the clever reader would have immediately realized that when the data has been ""mined"" the end-product, so to speak, is very valuable. Therefore, it becomes a requirement for corporations to not only be able to analyze the vast amounts of data available and disseminate the insights generated in an efficient manner, but also to ensure that the data and insights are secured.In a nutshell, I submit that three problems exist within the current data analytics landscape:Enter MicroStrategyMicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) has the solution. The firm provides enterprise-ready analytics, mobile and security software platforms, allowing businesses to analyze, visualize and interpret the vast amounts of data available to them. When this data has been mined, MSTR solutions also allow for quick and efficient dissemination. The question of security is also addressed. For more detail, I encourage readers to have a look at the company's investor presentation.On paper, one thus can conclude that the company seems to provide significant value to its customers.The next logical question would then be how does the company make money?MSTR's revenue model is rather simple. The firm generates cash from software and support sales. Software sales are split into license (non-cloud offerings) and subscription (cloud offerings). Support sales are derived from the provision of aftermarket services such as tech support, software updates, inter alia.The important points of note are that license revenue will generally be lumpy and hard to predict as they largely depend on the rate at which the company releases new versions of its software. Subscription/support sales are relatively easier to predict as they are generally recognized on a pro rata basis over a period of time. Given MSTR's revenue mix, it is safe to say that 75%-plus of its revenue is recurring in nature (license sales comprise of about a quarter of total revenues).In the process of establishing a durable moatWith the aforementioned business model, the clever reader would have correctly deduced that scale and switching costs are the main sources of competitive advantage. If these factors are particularly prominent, barriers to entry would be very high and the incumbent would possess a durable economic moat.A new entrant looking to enter the industry would not only have to spend a lot (MSTR's annual R&D is ~100m) developing a competitive offering, but also spend a fortune marketing (MSTR's annual sales/marketing spending was $220m in FY14) their offering.In other words, without a large installed base of customers, the challenger would probably operate at a loss for many years before achieving scale. If switching costs are very significant (i.e. incumbent offerings are deeply embedded within customer workflows), the new competitor will have difficulty stealing market share and would go out of business very quickly.Unfortunately, this is not the case. The market for such offerings has yet to mature - most industry players are busy vying for their piece of the pie. This applies to MSTR. If MSTR executes perfectly going forward, the above scenario would be their endgame.To sum up, we have a business that:Not really a business for the value investor with a long-term horizon but clearly a business with the potential to be one.Strong outlook in key marketsAs a quick reminder, MSTR operates in the data analytics, mobile and security space. According to research, these markets are poised to grow very rapidly. The cloud analytics market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 26% through 2019, while the cloud security software market is expected to clock in a CAGR of 48% over a similar period. In earlier paragraphs, we have established that these are the markets that MicroStrategy caters to. Given these tailwinds, the company should be able to exploit these growth opportunities if execution goes well.Cash burn may be worryingHowever, the company appears to be burning cash (recent annual FCF figures were ~30-70m in the red). Sales/marketing spend remains the largest line item on the income statement. One would expect that such a large amount of spending on sales/marketing would result in a corresponding growth in the top line. MSTR's revenues have remained more or less flat since 2011 (~$550m). Pre-tax earnings remain flat at ~$20m (after adjusting for FY14 restructuring costs). Currency headwinds play a role in this poor performance but given the sheer market potential, these headwinds should be offset by top-line growth. This has not been the case for MSTR.The company attributes this poor performance to the fact that it has been exiting low-margin businesses (e.g. Angel, a CEM business that is essentailly commoditized), but I remain skeptical as hardly any detail has been provided regarding this. The divested business generated <$5m in losses over its life, which clearly does not move the needle.Digging deeper into the company's annual report reveals that license sales are declining (fell $22m or 15% from $147m during FY13-14) while subscription fees are increasing (jumped $10m or 83% to $22m during FY13-14) . Therefore, it is perfectly likely that the company's customers are transitioning into a subscription-based model instead of the traditional software licensing model, resulting in a flat or declining top-line in the short-term. On the other hand, it might reflect a failure in execution. It is simply not clear. Regardless, I advise investors to remain cautious until further detail is provided.Stratospheric valuation is not warranted given limited growthMSTR currently trades at about 4x sales and 23x EBITDA. Companies that trade at these multiples usually experience double-digit growth in the top-line every quarter (especially so in a fast-growing space). This is simply not the case for MSTR. The company has implemented several restructuring initiatives to improve profitability. This has resulted in a meaningful improvement in EBITDA (the metric has doubled from $30m if one compares the TTM and FY14 number, per Morningstar data).Assuming no change in current valuation, this should bring the EBITDA multiple down to about 16-20x. Even then, the multiple is still far too high for a company that's not experiencing meaningful top-line growth in line with the broader industry. It appears that the market has simply priced the majority of data analytics companies at stratospheric multiples, whether or not they actually deserve it.For the reasons (largely the flat top-line) discussed above, I postulate that MSTR's current valuation is unwarranted. Avoid."
1777042,41741,2013-10-27T08:38:52-04:00,,"MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) is, in essence, a company that takes data and presents it in a more digestible manner. This is known as business intelligence. However, the market is flush with competition, and with its higher priced products, we don't believe that MicroStrategy has a clear strategy for being able to grow its customer base. What's more is that the stock trades at absurd multiples and has a verifiable record of earnings misses.MicroStrategy is a provider of enterprise software platforms for business intelligence, mobile intelligence and social intelligence. Effectively, the company delivers reports and dashboards to business users via a Web interface and mobile devices.MicroStrategy tends to focus on larger enterprises that consider it to be their enterprise BI standard. And its deployments are some of the most complex, in terms of functionality, large numbers of users, high data volume and wide deployment across an enterprise. Yet, it's not all that distinctive from competitors, but its pricing is premium.Get me off this rideThe past couple of years have been more than a roller coaster for the company. This includes two distinctly sharp pullbacks over the last three years. Going into 4Q 2012, MicroStrategy was trading close to $135, but ended the year below $90. And it has failed to garner a sustained recovery since.There's no getting back to $180. In three years, the stock is up a mere 10%. Yet, we believe the stock is still overvalued by 25%, where the company has failed to live up to the hype, and the stumblings will lead to an all out fall in the interim.The company's first large pullback came in mid-2011, when the company decided to revamp its IT operations and ""refocus"" the company. This includes selling its entire stake in an online software company for event management, event marketing and web surveys. It also decided to make a big push to the cloud. The move was expected to bring in more customers and increase the company's ""operational flexibility,"" which should have led to margin expansion, neither of which has happened (more on this later).The next sell-off came in late 2012, when a management shakeup and the first big earnings miss took place. The big news was that Sanju Bansal would be stepping down as COO. The other move included the fact that CEO Michael Saylor stepped down as president.BMO Capital Markets said it best back in '11, noting that Bansal's removal as the COO is ""a big deal, and not an incremental change."" Turns out Bansal was COO for 19 years and one of CEO Saylor's chief confidants. Bob Watts took over as COO. So, who's Bob Watts? Before taking over as COO of MicroStrategy, Watts served as the EVP of Worldwide Professional Services since November 2009. What is Worldwide Professional Services? Your guess is as good as ours.Industry headwinds and company misstepsAt the time of the COO shakeup, it was questioned whether the move was more financially based or whether it signaled a changing of the guard in the industry. Well, it appears that it was indeed a more fundamental change the company was trying to get out in front of. Of which, they have failed. Since then, the company has missed earnings, and missed badly.Part of what we're seeing is a slowing of spending on business data software. The novelty and buzz around BI is wearing off. As a result, sales growth is slowing. For the year ended 2011, sales grew at a 3-year average of 16% per annum, yet, in 2012 sales growth fell to 5.8% and for 2Q sales were down 2.8% year over year.Even still, investors have been overlooking the 3Q12 earnings miss, and the subsequent three misses, choosing to chalk it up to management shakeups.Is BI BS?One of the fundamental questions to be asked is; is business intelligence merely BS? Is it a tool you really need? After all, you have the data already. Business intelligence is business jargon that always makes us shake our heads, kind of like synergies.The other issue with BI services is that they are somewhat discretionary, where, companies don't have to have the product. Sure you can spat ROI figures, but at the end of the day it's not required to help you run a successful business.An '09 comic strip from Cornered illustrates the flipside to BI. There's a lot of data out there and it can be tough to interpret and analyze it all. A small change in one area can have a big impact in another. Granted this was 2009, and there have been a flood of competitors into the market. This opens MicroStrategy up to an entirely new level of headwinds.The company also has a pricing problem. The costs for licensing and implementation are well above peers. This is, in large part, holding MicroStrategy back. Tech support alone is around $10,000 per year. What's more interesting is that Gartner has found that the cost of software is the number one reason that is limiting MicroStrategy's broader deployment by its customers.It could manage to increase sales with reduced pricing, but under that scenario we'd be sure to see margin compression. Which is something the company can't afford. Operating margin is already down to 1.2% over the TTM, and gross margin was at decade lows for 2012.What it comes down to is that companies can use other reporting tools with lesser admin and implementation costs to get the same analyses. So while the slowdown in spending on BI services is part of the story, the other, more worrisome, issue is the rapid rise of competition in the space.Going back to the comic strip above, it reiterates the point that having the data in a neat and nice format/dashboard isn't everything, you really need some analytical capabilities. This is another point of weakness for MicroStrategy. Although MicroStrategy might be strong in the descriptive analysis area, it lags in the predictive analysis. Gartner notes that MicroStrategy has the lowest level of predictive analytics of all the vendors in its Magic Quadrant (below).The above Magic Quadrant also reveals just how crowded the BI market is, with the likes of Oracle and SAP in the market. So you have nimble companies like Tableau and QlikTech challenging them, and now there are the giants that are challenging them on the high-end market.A round peg in a square hole type of dealThe big news of late is that MicroStrategy is targeting Tableau. MicroStrategy is releasing a free desktop-based data visualization product. The move is another 'head scratcher' for investors. The stock appears to have a round peg that it's trying to fit into a square hole. Back in 2011, the company did a four month evaluation that eventually led it to focus strictly on the cloud space.And so the move to desktop is a step backwards. What's more is that MicroStrategy is offering the product for free. So why is MicroStrategy getting into the market. Is it a powerplay? Perhaps. Tableau has made it known that it will be targeting MicroStrategy's markets in the near future.While we understand the ""freemium"" model of offering a free service in an effort to get paying customers. Yet, our issue is why would anyone who's using a free service find it useful to pay for MicroStrategy's overpriced products.Even with the trend of major earnings misses, analysts appear to have mixed feelings. Over the last month three analysts have lowered their '13 and '14 EPS estimates, while two have upped their estimates. In any case, analysts have high hopes for '14, but we believe they are simply setting the company up for yet another big miss. This should help bring to light the serious overvaluation issues, and help guide the stock lower. Analysts expect EPS to grow over 200% from '13 to '14. In the very least, investors should be on the sidelines for now. Analysts have shown that they have no inclination what the company can do.Bottom lineWhat about price? Prior to the restructuring, MicroStrategy traded at an 20x average p/e, now it's trading in excess of 50x forward earnings. We see a more ""justified"" multiple as 25x, and adding back the cash, suggests a fair value of $76. That's 20% to 25% downside.With $28 in cash per share on the balance sheet and no debt, it's easy to see why investors want to love MicroStrategy. Yet, it's hard to judge where the company is headed. It refuses to offer any guidance, nor does it have quarterly conference calls to discuss results or its initiatives. We believe fair value is closer to $76 and believe the company is still overvalued from the 2011 investor over-exuberance. Sales are dwindling and competitive pressures should set the company up for further earnings misses in the future, and should go a long way in helping the market realize that a 177x p/e isn't justified.Worth noting is that we reached out to management and the company's investor relations to give them a chance to address our concerns and rebut any of our findings, but received no response. When, and if, the company reaches out to us, we will be more than happy to share their thoughts with readers.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

3992701,101905,2016-07-28T12:55:41-04:00,"Even before the company's earnings call this afternoon, the company is a rather safe bet.The coming months and years see strong market growth in BI and Cybersecurity.MicroStrategy's products will help the company to be among the winners of this trend.Earnings numbers and projections confirm this.","Today, MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) announces its post-quarterly earnings. I could have just waited till the earnings results are out to then write on Seeking Alpha that the stock is a buy, given the new numbers. Instead, MicroStrategy looks like a good investment already, as I will argue below. I expect the earnings to be good news for investors. The stock price will probably surge following the earnings call. What better time is there to buy than now?MicroStrategy is a global provider of enterprise software, founded in 1989. In its 27-year old history it has specialized on business intelligence, mobile software and cloud-based services. More recently, it has entered the security sector with its security solution Usher. The company's main product, MicroStrategy 10, consolidates analytics, mobility and security in a single integrated platform. It mainly competes with products by SAP Business Objects, IBM Cognos, Tableau and Oracle's Platform. It is now also increasingly in competition with newly emerging tech start-ups. A few years ago, this could have been dangerous for MicroStrategy, when the company had faced a low-growth period.Now things look differently. In Q4 2015 MicroStrategy's results have been positive and it was able to show good indicators of the company's performance, confirming that the company's has done it right. In the following I will show that the stock's surge since the beginning of the year will not end there. With its 3 main products, MicroStrategy is ideally set to benefit from market developments in the coming months and even years. I want to make several points to illustrate this.It is worth looking at developments in the market in which MicroStrategy operates. Gartner Inc. predicts that revenue in the BI and analytics market will grow to $16.9bn in 2016, which represents a growth of 5.2% from 2015. It shows the growing importance of analytics for a wider set of firms and their respective strategy. Business intelligence will hence become increasingly important for smaller business and other institutions. Even institutions like hospitals are now aware of the benefits BI has to offer for their day-to-day business. This development will be the last shift from an IT-led reporting to businesses' self-service analytics. While the general market developments in BI are probably benefiting most companies in this field. I would claim that MicroStrategy's BI software is more appealing to SMEs which will struggle with IBM's, SAP's and Oracle's more complex products. This is especially so, as cloud business intelligence seems to be a great success with smaller companies as part of their business intelligence strategy. MicroStrategy's product, integrating BI and cloud-based services, is a very good fit for these growing demands.A second market trend MicroStrategy will benefit from is cybersecurity. One just has to follow the news to realize the increasing threat, but also the increasing demand for cybersecurity solutions. Cyber threats, lack of focus in security systems and the dependency on information technology are the main drivers of this trend. According to Whatech cyber security is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8-11%, with a market value crossing $150bn by 2021. Some even think these numbers are not enough to represent the current spending and growth. MicroStrategy's Usher has accordingly brought enterprise-grade cybersecurity to its analytics platform last year. I'm positive that it will boost sales of its licenses and BI platforms in the next few months and years as cybersecurity issues become more important.The general market sentiment seems to agree on this. Of the analysts covering MSTR, 6 out of 8 people rate the stock a buy at the moment. The fundamental analysis by Finbox.io suggests a current fair value of $216 for the stock. A look at the data does confirm this. Analysts taken into account by Thomson Reuters have estimated a similar value, around $216.As I have mentioned before, MicroStrategy seems to be on the winning side of the BI game. If we look at the current price and both its earnings per share as well its forward earnings one can see that there is a lot of upside for MicroStrategy's share price, trading well below prices of its competitors like Tableau and Check Point Software Technology etc. The low P/E ratio of 21.2 emphasizes this. Given the market growth in the BI and cybersecurity market I expect MicroStrategy to be among the winners of these trends.With respect to earnings I think we can expect a very positive trend in the future. Dividing projected Net Income by the shares outstanding gives a good idea of future earnings. The latest poll indicates a new record earnings number of $2.290 per share for the last quarter. According to my projection, future earnings will still be higher than that. This is also the case, because MicroStrategy's current capital expenditures are trending lower once again, which improves the overall earnings position. At an estimated upside of 17% (see Finbox.io) MicroStrategy belongs to the safer stock bets.Overall, the company's outlook should be positive. In my investment thesis I have focused rather on the long-term than the short- or medium term. MicroStrategy surely did have problems in the past, but the company has proven its place in its market. It has moved into the right direction and has anticipated important market trends early enough to largely benefit from them in the future. If MicroStrategy can translate these trends well enough, it faces a bright future. I personally believe it can."
1590312,51992,2013-08-01T08:00:00-04:00,,"We're in a time when a lot of the technological advances available to developed countries will be readily available to 5 billion people. Technologies, like tablets, smartphones, the cloud, social networks, etc are penetrating both emerging and lesser-developed nations at a rapid pace. Today, 100 million people own a tablet; analysts expect that number to be roughly 500 million to a billion in the next 5 years. The cloud, mobile, social, and big data are leading the charge in creating a new society for tomorrow. The proliferation of these technologies is revolutionizing business, media, education, and a whole host of industries.A company that fully understands this is MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR). It positions itself to profit from these four disruptive technologies. MicroStrategy is a worldwide leader in the business intelligence industry. Its customers are the largest corporations and organizations from around the world. MicroStrategy was founded in 1989 by current CEO, Michael Saylor. Saylor is someone I feel has a clear vision for the future and has one of the best minds in tech. With Saylor's vision and leadership, MicroStrategy has been a very successful company to date.The business intelligence industry is extremely competitive. It is a space where top tech companies are innovating at a very rapid pace. Some of the top players within the industry are Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), SAP, and IBM. Business intelligence is also one of the fastest growing market segments in the software industry. Although MicroStrategy is not as large as the companies mentioned before, innovation is its edge. Michael Saylor states the goal for the company is to create applications that were inconceivable 36 months ago. This is no easy task, but says a lot about MicroStrategy and how it is challenging itself to stay ahead of the curve. Holding the company to this standard is why it is creating such amazing things.MicroStrategy is on the cutting edge of technology in the enterprise space. MicroStrategy takes in a lot of raw data and turns it into information that will allow users to make informed business decisions in real time. It is able to do this because of its advanced analytics and highly visual dashboards that are simple to create and interpret. The big data market is expected to reach $48.3 billion by 2018. There's a huge demand for software that can gather and analyze vast amounts of data in real time, which leads to informed business decisions.The three main solutions which I'm most excited about are the MicroStrategy platform, MicroStrategy Cloud, and Wisdom. MicroStrategy also developed products such as Usher and Alert. I feel these apps will bring in huge revenue as society becomes more integrated with mobile. It's products have been ranked #1 by Dresner Advisory Services. Gartner also recognizes MicroStrategy as a clear leader in the industry. This is no surprise since MicroStrategy invests heavily in research and development. Add that to a deep understanding of the business consumer's demands and the ability to produce applications that were inconceivable 36 months ago, and you have something special.MicroStrategy 9.3.1 is the latest update to the MicroStrategy platform. It's built around the idea that all business users want an app that's beautiful, mobile, agile, and fast. The platform is highly visual and great at integrating data with other apps such as Google Maps. What really excites me is how easily and quickly mobile apps and dashboards can be made. Also, how easy it is to share the data to all users at all levels of the organization, across mobile devices and even TV's. This has really given MicroStrategy an edge over the competition.With the advent of big data and burgeoning IT costs, MicroStrategy Cloud is an alternative for a company's big data needs. MicroStrategy Cloud is the best because it delivers data in record time with the lowest costs. MicroStrategy Cloud is beneficial because it cuts down the costs of building infrastructure, building a database, personnel, etc. These are projects that usually take months, even years to complete with costs in the 10's of millions. With MicroStrategy Cloud, MicroStrategy handles the infrastructure, data, personnel, etc. All the business owner has to do is log on to the internet to access all the data. MicroStrategy Cloud saves users roughly 3 million dollars a year versus building on premise.MicroStrategy Wisdom is a market intelligence app. More than anything it's a consumer data warehouse. Wisdom takes the data of various networks and gives you real time business insights. Wisdom's data base consists of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter, World Fact Book, Wikipedia, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Combining all this data with Microstrategy's analytics, Wisdom can give marketers months of market research in seconds. For example, if you wanted to know how many people like Cavalli, that live in Paris, that travel to San Francisco twice a year, Wisdom can answer that for you in seconds versus the months of research and all the costs that come along with it. Once again, Wisdom will do a lot of cost cutting, reduce personnel, etc. for marketing departments. Wisdom is great for media buying/planning, location planning, and other aspects of the marketing process. Wisdom is revolutionizing how we do market research. For the first time the small business can access or have even better market research than the Fortune 500 Company.Lastly, we have Alert and Usher. Alert is a mobile commerce platform designed for retailers who want a mobile store app. There's a new push to bringing a company's brand to mobile devices and allowing customers to shop and further engage with the brand. Alert is beautifully designed and easy to use. Of course, its cloud based and comes with the high performance and advanced analytics as all MicroStrategy products do. Rather than spend the 10's of millions on creating and managing a mobile store app businesses can use Alert at just a fraction of the cost.Usher is a mobile identity platform. The app is designed to be able to authenticate people and keep personal information secure. In time that will do away with ID's, key cards, even passports. With Usher you'll have all of a person's information that can easily be shared and verified with other devices. With Usher you can access buildings, rooms, cars, airports, etc. Usher is something that I feel will really take off as the world becomes more integrated with mobile devices.Taking a look at the books this is a company with $330 million in cash $546 million in assets and no debt. With revenues of 580 million for 2012, we're seeing an increase of nearly double from 5 years ago. Analysts are expecting a 25% annual growth rate for revenues over the next 5 years. Strong and growing revenues are expected being that the company has such innovative products that are impacting businesses on a grand scale. Be advised, this is a low margin business and industry. MicroStrategy had profits of $15 million for 2012. MicroStrategy also spent nearly $100 million in R&D in 2012. Clearly, this has been money well spent. As long as revenues keep growing and the company keeps innovating the low margins should not be a problem.MicroStrategy is well positioned for today and tomorrow. The short term trading of the company is very volatile, but its long-term growth prospects are undeniable. In 5-10 years from now I see this company being valued in the tens of billions of dollars. The long term growth will come from their ability to continue innovating. Anytime you have products that can largely impact the bottom line of a business there will always be huge demand, especially in the enterprise market. MicroStrategy allows their customers to leverage technology to run their companies more efficiently and saves them millions of dollars in the process.Below is an interview of Michael Saylor with Charlie Rose. The moment I saw this interview I knew MicroStrategy was going to be something special.Michael Saylor Interviewmicrostrategy.comDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

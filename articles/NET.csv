4363755,103359,2020-08-03T08:30:45-04:00,"Cloudflare is a mission-driven company, helping to build a better internet.Leveraging their initial cloud delivery platform, Cloudflare continues to innovate and develop new business applications.Extrapolating growth over the next five or ten years, investors could see double digit annual returns.","With the mission of helping build a better internet, Cloudflare (NET) is poised to be a significant player in the infrastructure for tomorrow’s internet. Founded in 2009, Cloudflare is based in San Francisco. The company had an initial public offering on the NYSE in September 2019.Cloudflare operates in the cloud infrastructure space, focusing on security, performance, and reliability.A cloud delivery network, or CDN, is a mesh of edge servers, caching application data for last-mile delivery to end users. Instead of hitting the main servers, requests resolve at an edge server in proximity to the end client, resulting in faster response times. While this concept is not new, Cloudflare has significantly simplified the implementation as well as expanding on the idea to add significant value.Q1 2020 Investor Presentation Cloudflare has data centers spanning the globe. Cloudflare’s CDN sits on top of any existing web application, implemented through a simple network configuration change. All requests for that service will hit Cloudflare first. The requests are either resolved instantly on the edge server or passed on to the application’s server in the case of dynamic requests.Extending into security, Cloudflare’s frontline platform acts as a gatekeeper, providing access rules to allow or block traffic. Cloudflare provides protection against common attacks such as distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS) and cross-site scripting (XSS), amongst others.Cloudflare provides comprehensive performance and security coverage for the entire web application. Legacy solutions are piecemeal and may require time-consuming changes to the application code and infrastructure configuration for implementation.Co-founder Matthew Prince serves as Cloudflare’s Chairman and CEO. Prior to Cloudflare, he co-founded Unspam Technologies, “a software and services company helping governments implement and enforce effective laws to control unwanted messages.” Matthew Prince holds an M.B.A from Harvard Business School (2007-2009) and J.D. from the University of Chicago Law School (1997-2000).Co-founder Michelle Zatyln serves as Cloudfare’s COO. Prior to Cloudflare, she launched two startups of her own and mostly recently worked at Google as an MBA intern. Michelle holds an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School (2007-2009).The Cloudflare team continues to grow quickly. As of March 31st, 2020, Cloudflare had 1,368 employees, compared to 960 a year earlier.While not the scoring the highest marks for word of mouth recommendations, Cloudflare boasts a strong CEO approval rating on Glassdoor. Employees have many positive comments, particularly emphasizing the strong, mission-driven team. Some of the cons seem to be rooted in the company’s rapid growth.Cloudflare Reviews, Glassdoor.comCloudflare’s mission is to help build a better internet. The company is consistent and persistent in their narrative, leading with their mission in press releases, quarterly and annual reports, investor presentations, and even in their ticker, NET. Their mission fuels the innovation and creativity to create an integrated cloud platform focused on security, performance, and reliability.Cloudflare 10-Q Filed May 11, 2020 SEC FilingsQ1 2020 Investor PresentationCloudflare’s core platform opens up many growth opportunities.It is estimated that Cloudflare is the first point of contact for over 10% of the ­internet, enabling Cloudflare to benefit from important network effects. Any additional customer brings more traffic, providing additional signals. Those signals can be used to increase the value of existing services. Consider website A and website B, both of which are on Cloudflare’s network. A bad actor attempting an attack on website A will be blacklisted on website B. Cloudflare refers to their competitive advantage with this data as “Shared Intelligence.”Cloudflare continues to innovate on top of their existing platform. Extending into more granular access management, Cloudflare announced Cloudflare for Teams in January 2020. This offering is a next-gen solution for virtual private networks, or VPNs. Instead of tunneling traffic through a particular server, Cloudflare can gate general internet access to protected internal applications allowing employees flexible and easy access while maintaining security. Considered critical infrastructure for enabling employees to work from home, Cloudflare made the offering free for small businesses in response to the coronavirus emergency in March 2020. Cloudflare is quickly becoming a significant player in the private networking space.Cloudflare first entered the cloud computing space in 2017 with Cloudflare Workers. In July 2020, Cloudflare announced the next evolution of the service, Workers Unbound.Similar to Amazon’s development of AWS, Cloudflare originally developed Workers out of an internal necessity. Built on top of its existing platform, this service provides on-demand computational power on its edge nodes. Limitless and cost-effective, Workers Unbound competes directly with established cloud platforms: “75% less expensive than AWS Lambda, 24% less expensive than Microsoft Azure Functions, and 52% less expensive than Google Cloud Functions.”As the world becomes more connected with 5G and IoT, execution latency savings provided by a delivery network will become increasingly significant.Cloudflare participates in a large and growing market. Considering their core operations, their total addressable market was $32 billion for 2018 and is estimated to grow to $47 billion in 2022. Their expansion into new areas provides additional opportunity.Q1 2020 Investor PresentationGiven their data moat, network effects, and vast opportunities stemming from their core platform, Cloudflare is poised for significant growth.Growing total revenue at a CAGR of 50%, Cloudflare has demonstrated a strong product-market fit since inception. All of Cloudflare’s revenue is subscription-based.Q1 2020 Investor PresentationCloudflare has been able to consistently achieve dollar-based net retention above 115%, demonstrating their ability to land and expand with their customers.For the first quarter of 2020, Cloudflare announced $91 million in revenue, 48% year-over-year growth. Reinvesting in the significant opportunities, the company reported a GAAP loss of $32.7 million. The company’s balance sheet is healthy, sporting $588 million in cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2020.Regarding guidance for 2020, Cloudflare expects revenue of $389-$393 million, the mid-point of which represents 36% year-over-year growth.As mentioned above, Cloudflare Teams, the company’s VPN-replacement offering, is free until September. Assuming conservative metrics on conversion, this offering has the potential to provide a boost in the coming quarters.As of August 2020, with the current stock price near $41, the company is trading at a market cap of roughly $11.7 billion. With estimated ARR of $391 million in 2020, the company is trading at 30x 2020’s revenue.Cloudflare is by no means cheap. However, given the company’s early stage and vast opportunity, I believe there is opportunity for significant upside. Cloudflare has established an extensible platform, on top of which they continue to innovate and provide critical infrastructure services.Cloudflare’s long-term operating model targets gross margins between 75% and 77%, and operating margins above 20%.Consider revenue growth continuing at 30% for the next 5 years. The company would have revenue of roughly $1.5 billion. Given the vast opportunity, assume the company would continue to trade on a revenue multiple. Given the company’s larger size, assume the revenue multiple compresses from 30 to 15. Cloudflare would potentially be worth $22.5 billion.Compared to today’s valuation of $11.7 billion, a valuation of $22.5 billion in five years would represent an increase of 92%, or CAGR of roughly 14%.Extrapolating further out to operating maturity provides another useful lens. Consider Cloudflare continues growing at 25% over the next 5 years after achieving $1.5 billion. Cloudflare’s revenue 10 years out could be roughly $4.6 billion. With an operating margin of 25%, the company would have $1.1 billion in operating profits.Considering the continued opportunity and growth, this company would still fetch a healthy multiple on operating earnings. The best way to gauge this is through comparison to larger peers – Salesforce trades for 63x operating earnings, Workday trades for 93x operating earnings. Conservatively, we will assume a multiple of 30.Derived from $1.1 billion in operating profit and a 30x multiple, Cloudflare's value could reach $33 billion in ten years. Compared to today’s valuation of $11.7 billion, this would be an increase of 182%, or potential CAGR of roughly 11%.Uncertainty, an inherent risk in any investment, is amplified in evaluating growth companies. More art than science, the growth valuation requires extrapolation and is particularly sensitive to assumptions.If growth continues or accelerates in future years, the valuation could be much higher. Conversely, if growth slows, the valuation could take a significant dive.The back-of-the-envelope calculations done above illustrate a potential outcome. It is difficult, perhaps impossible, to accurately project five or ten years out. While momentum is likely to continue, it is not guaranteed.For the reason mentioned above, investment in growth opportunities like NET tend to involve significant volatility. If revenue growth slows, or accelerates, in a given quarter, the market tends to react quite significantly.There are other systemic and company-specific risks that one should be aware of. This includes, but is not limited to, the actual growth of the market, increased competition, and other internal and external factors.That being said, Cloudflare is emerging as a leader in a growing market. With significant potential and a large opportunity, an investment in Cloudflare can prove fruitful over time."

Cestrian Capital Research, Inc. values both its independence and transparency and does not believe that this presents a material potential conflict of interest or impacts the content of its research or publications.Within our subscription service on Seeking Alpha we're following the content delivery network (CDN) market closely. Stocks in this sector have been on fire in 2020 as, quite reasonably you would think, investors have gotten all excited about the prospects for these companies. More people working from home, more enterprises distributing their workplaces, more people spending more leisure time at home, all means, network congestion on a scale at which anyone under the age of 35 is simply unfamiliar with. When the first internet boom started, the problem of trying to push rich content to the edge of the network was addressed by now-familiar names such as Akamai (AKAM) and other first-generation providers. Of late two relatively new names have risen to prominence in the CDN market, being Fastly (FSLY) and Cloudflare (NET). You can read our recent note on FSLY here.We turn now to NET. We have a number of software engineers amongst our subscriber base and we have work ongoing to figure out whether all or any of these CDN providers have a viable future. Our research is focused on how they can add functionality such that they aren't just an improved network layout that can be aped and emulated by other service providers. Ultimately if a CDN is simply leased network capacity with some fancy storage and servers at the edge, that's not going to prove out to be much of a moat. Today an enterprise customer can move from one CDN provider to another without too much trouble - it's not like having to unpick workflow from a software application and then having to rewire it into a new replacement application. We're trying to understand whether CDN providers can be truly sticky in nature - because today the stocks are priced as if the revenue is as good quality as cloud software, and to our eyes it is not; therefore we see risk in the stock prices of both FSLY and NET unless they up the degree of truly proprietary, defensible intellectual property delivered as part of their services.The numbers tell the story.Summary FinancialsHere's NET through to the end of June 2020, the most recently reported quarter.Let's run through some highlights.Source: YCharts.com, Cestrian AnalysisNET bulls will say, the capex bill is so heavy because this is an infrastructure company that needs to build out its network in order to support growth - and that is certainly true. But capex-heavy infrastructure companies, in order to make a good return on that capex in the out-years, need to know that at some point the capex stops and the return on capital rises - and in order for that to happen, usually you need some kind of temporary monopoly to arise. In telecom you see that with the regional monopolies in landline - and most recently in the L-band satellite comms market which has only two real players, Iridium (IRDM) and Inmarsat (currently private equity owned). In CDN? You have two new players slugging it out with big capex, AKAM in the background and other smaller players such as Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW) also seeking to grow share. Absent consolidation between vendors we aren't sure what will lead to that temporary monopoly position. One possibility is that NET moves deeper into enterprise security offerings. The work we're doing internally with our subscribers suggests that this is a likely ongoing move in the CDN segment - FSLY's recent $775m acquisition of Signal Sciences was an example of this. We can imagine NET also developing and/or acquiring further intellectual property in order to bundle more security-as-a-service with its CDN offering. (Pureplay security service providers such as ZScaler (ZS) could be at risk of being eclipsed or acquired if this trend continues in CDN). So - in short - growth superb, cash generation poor, route to sustainable cash generation not yet clear. It might become clear, but it isn't yet. That gives us pause on the fundamentals.Let's now take a look at the stock chart.Stock ChartNET has delivered a steady upward climb this year with a major breakout to the upside since early September which has survived a modest correction in October.Source: TradingView, Cestrian AnalysisUnusually amongst hot cloud stocks, earnings events don't seem to be a major catalyst. If you look at the chart above (where 'E' marks earnings dates), nothing happened as a result of the last four earnings releases that could not have been taken advantage of later - by which we mean at no point has an earnings release caused the stock to definitively move outside that steady-Eddie trading channel. With earnings approaching on November 5 and the potential for market turmoil around the election, this means we have no particular angst to buy in ahead of time. On this occasion we'd rather see what earnings brings and react accordingly.So - Neutral for now on both fundamentals and chart logic. But one we shall be watching closely and continuing to research.Cestrian Capital Research, Inc - 2 November 2020"
4374218,69905,2020-09-14T16:01:38-04:00,"The network security platform is looking to take market share from companies' on-premise VPNs.Cloudflare trades at north of 25x forward sales, which is an expensive premium, even in the SaaS world.Cloudflare's guidance puts the company on a path that is growing slower than both Fastly and Zscaler.On balance, the stock is close to fairly valued already.","Cloudflare (NET) is taking market share from slower on-premise VPN platforms.Indeed, there's a lot to like from the company's prospects, as its Network Flywheel means that the more Cloudflare grows, the more it can optimize traffic and long-term profitability.However, with guidance pointing towards a deceleration in growth rates by Q4 2020, and the stock trading for more than 25x forward sales, it's difficult to get excited by this opportunity. Look for a lower price point on this strong company.Cloudflare is a cloud-based network security platform. Cloudflare addresses the vulnerabilities of the internet by delivering security, performance, and reliability.As the world rapidly adapts away from slow on-premise virtual private networks (""VPN""), Cloudflare seeks to service these customers.Indeed, if COVID taught us anything, it is that the demand for reliable network infrastructure in a ""digital world"" is only going in one direction and that is up - and very rapidly.What's more, customers don't want latency and highly complex networks. For that, companies can use Cloudflare, which has a platform that is very user friendly with a low learning curve.Source: Q2 2020 Investor PresentationMoving on, as you can see above, Cloudflare is a single-point cloud platform that is highly scalable and focused on delivering security and reliability.Unlike some of its peers such as Cisco (CSCO) or Zscalar (ZS), Cloudflare is very easy to use for small teams. Also, the advantage of Cloudflare over companies' own network is that Cloudflare delivers the necessary performance while being highly reliable.Source: Q2 2020 Investor PresentationIn fact, a further driver for Cloudflare is its Network Flywheel, whereby the more scale Cloudflare has, the more effectively it can optimize traffic across its network.Also, Cloudflare estimates that its Content Delivery Networks (""CDN"") and VPN markets combined could expand its total addressable market from $32 billion in 2020 to $47 billion by 2022.Thus, even though outlooks are rosy and there's evidently much to like about Cloudflare, its near-term prospects are appearing to slow down.Source: author's calculations; **high-end company guidanceInvestors are undoubtedly expecting Cloudflare to low-ball its guidance.One could question that assertion, given that the above are already management's upwards revised guidance. Moreover, in 2019, Cloudflare was growing at very close to 50%, whereas its guidance ahead is now pointing to exit Q4 2020 at mid-30% range.Having said that, putting aside the question of just how fast Cloudflare's growth rates may be slowing or not, Cloudflare certainly delivers very high non-GAAP gross profits.To illustrate, in Q2 2020, Cloudflare's non-GAAP gross profits reached 77%, which is very close to Zscaler's non-GAAP gross profit of 78% - with Zscaler being a company with a reputation for being highly profitable.Also, let's not forget that while Zscaler is mostly aimed at enterprise customers, Cloudflare can be deployed by companies of any size.In fact, part of Cloudflare's strategy is to get customers onboard via its pay-as-you-go offering, with the idea of raising these customers to Contracted, as their usage becomes bigger. We can see this playing out favorably with its dollar-based net retention metrics of 115% in Q2 2020.After the tech sell-off we witnessed the past couple of weeks (although arguably now yesterday's news), we saw investors starting to question whether paying more 20x forward sales for just about any SaaS-based cloud investment left investors with sufficient upside potential?Presently, investors are being asked to pay 25x forward sales for Cloudflare, which is a substantial discount from Zscaler, which is trading at a close to 29x forward sales, post-sell off.In a world where something is totally overpriced as Zscaler, the argument could be made that Cloudflare in comparison is attractively priced.Having said that, compared with Fastly (FSLY), which trades at 27x forward sales, one may argue that paying 25x for Cloudflare is the going price for companies in this sector?However, as I noted in this article, Fastly is still expected to exit Q4 2020 growing at north of 40%, which is a substantially faster growth rate than Cloudflare.Of course, one could retort that Fastly's non-GAAP gross profit margins of 62% are nowhere near those of Cloudflare's.In a very fast growth environment, Cloudflare is most likely close to fairly valued.Investors looking to find meaningful upside potential backed by the necessary margin of safety are going to struggle for gains here, as they are being asked to pay more than 25x forward sales for a company that is facing a steady slowdown.That's not to say that there is no upside potential, simply that the stock is most likely already fairly priced, with better opportunities available elsewhere."

However, Cloudflare might still have room left to run, and we will see why that's the case in today's article. The major pros of investing in Cloudflare are listed here:I will use the following outline for this research note:So, let's begin.Think of Cloudflare as a collection of smaller data centers on the edge of the major data centers' networks; hence, the company is often referred to as an ""edge computing"" company. Perhaps calling them satellite data centers would be of use to the general reading public.Source: Cloudflare Q1 2020 Investor PresentationIn short, Cloudflare is building the infrastructure of the new Internet. The company offers an integrated global cloud platform with services across Security, Performance, and Reliability.Cloudflare's solutions include the following:(1) Security: Firewall, IoT Security, Bot Management, SSL/TLS, DDoS Protection, Secure Origin Connection, Infrastructure Protection, Rate Limiting, Zero Trust Security, and Gateway.(2) Performance: Cache, Mobile Optimization, Intelligent Routing, Image Optimization, Content Optimization, and Mobile SDK.(3) Reliability: Load Balancing, Domain Name System (DNS), Anycast Network, DNS Resolver, Virtual Backbone, and Always Online.Additionally, Cloudflare offers services like Serverless Compute, Cloudflare Apps, and Analytics.Source: Cloudflare Q1 2020 Investor PresentationCloudflare is disrupting legacy markets that include traditional internet infrastructure companies like Cisco (CSCO), Juniper (JNPR), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), etc.Let's look at some of Cloudflare's use-cases:1. Content Delivery Network (CDN):Source: How Cloudflare supports superior online experiences2. Cloudflare for Enterprise:Source: Cloudflare for Enterprise3. Cloudflare's TEAMS solution for Remote Workforces:Source: How Cloudflare Supports Remote WorkforcesAccording to Cloudflare, its total addressable market was valued at $32 billion in 2018. The company projects its TAM to grow to $47 billion by 2022, as can be seen below.Source: Cloudflare Q1 2020 Investor PresentationMoreover, the TAM figures do not include adjacent growth opportunities like Serverless, Internet of Things, and 5G Cellular. With TTM revenues of just ~320 million, Cloudflare surely has a long growth runway.In the last three years, Cloudflare's annual revenue grew from $85 million to $287 million (3.37x times) at ~50% CAGR. Just last quarter (i.e., first-quarter of 2020), Cloudfare's quarterly revenue reached $91 million, which yields an ARR of ~$360 million.Source: Cloudflare Q1 2020 Investor PresentationAll of Cloudfare's revenue is subscription-based, and 52% of it comes from outside of the United States. Thus, Cloudfare's revenues are well-diversified on a geographical basis. Moreover, a Dollar-Based Net Retention rate of above 115% (over the last nine quarters) illustrates the immense strength of Cloudflare's platform to garner more revenues from existing clients.A rapid rise in customer count underlies the robust revenue growth rate. In the last two years, the number of paying customers grew from 58,330 to 89,223 at ~24% CAGR. The more impressive growth is visible in the number of large customers, which is growing at ~68% CAGR.Source: Cloudflare Q1 2020 Investor PresentationIn addition to the rapid growth, Cloudflare also enjoys attractive gross margins of ~77%. The high gross margins show the unique value that Cloudflare's platform brings to its client's table.Source: Cloudflare Q1 2020 Investor PresentationThat is, the company's unique product offering allows them to command industry-leading gross margins.To determine the intrinsic value for Cloudflare, we will employ our proprietary valuation model, with which many of you are already familiar. For those of you who have not yet seen it, here's what it entails:Now, let's check out Cloudflare's valuation.Source: L.A. Stevens Valuation ModelAs you can see above, Cloudfare's intrinsic value is $25.75, i.e., the stock is currently ""Overvalued"" by 35.91%.But these are only steps 1 and 2 (the latter of which I've omitted as I don't believe dilution will be exorbitant without growth simultaneously accelerating).Let's check out step 3 to determine if we have a high probability of outperforming the market via an investment in Cloudflare.Now, we know that a traditional DCF model illustrates whether a stock is over- or under-valued; however, it does nothing in terms of demonstrating what one can expect in the way of future expected returns. For that, we must employ step 3 of the LASV model, the results of which can be seen below.Step 3 entails a simple process of projecting intrinsic value via the growth of free cash flow per share. In essence, we simply grow the initial free cash flow per share ($0.37 in this case) by the assumed growth rate for ten years; at the end of which, we apply an assumed price to FCF multiple.This creates a target price in 2030, by which we are able to create CAGR or annualized return projection.Now, some commenters may take issue with such a lengthy projection, as they might claim we cannot project that far into the future.In order to remedy the issues associated with projecting 10 years out, i.e., variable growth rates, unforeseen technological developments, we employ a financial concept known as ""margin of safety"".There are numerous methods by which one could implement a margin of safety; however, we simply implement it by using conservative assumptions, i.e., conservative growth assumptions and a conservative price to free cash flow multiple in the year 2030.This allows us to be very wrong and still be right.Now, with all of this in mind, let's check out what Cloudflare could offer us in the way of future returns.Source: L.A. Stevens Valuation ModelSo, if one were to buy Cloudflare at today's price of $35 and hold for ten years, he/she could expect base case returns at ~11% CAGR. These returns are not significantly higher than 9.8% - ""our hurdle rate""/ ""90-year annualized S&P 500 return rate."" Hence, I do not expect Cloudflare to outperform the market by a mile, and thus it is only a very modest buy at these lofty valuations.Cloudflare's operating margin is negative; however, the company is in a high-growth phase, and I expect it to maintain growth at 30%+ CAGR for the next three years. Edge Cloud Computing is emerging as an even more significant part of the digital transformation than it has been in the past, and Cloudflare is laying down the necessary infrastructure with a veritably disruptive global cloud platform.The expected return of ~11% CAGR conveys to us that it is still a solid investment at about $35. However, the total expected return is not significantly higher than our hurdle rate of 9.8%; thus, Cloudflare is only a modest buy at the current price. I recommend long-term investors to initiate a small position and add to it on any significant dips.Key takeaway: I rate Cloudflare a modest buy at $35.Please provide your feedback in the comments section below!As always, thanks for reading; remember to follow, and happy investing."

Website infrastructure and security company Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) is one such company. Its stock has climbed nearly 90% since its IPO in September last year. As more and more companies migrate to remote working options, they are turning to companies like Cloudflare to offer services such as firewalls, network routing, and traffic management.Revenues for the first quarter grew 48% to $91.3 million, ahead of the Street's estimate of $87 million. Adjusted loss of $0.04 per share was also better than the Street's estimate of a loss of $0.06 per share.During the quarter, Cloudflare added 250,000 customers, ending the quarter with 2.8 million total customers, growing 40% over the year.For the second quarter, Cloudflare forecast revenues of $93.5-$94.5 million, ahead of the market estimates of $92.5 million and a loss of $0.05-$0.06 per share, in line with the market's forecast of a loss of $0.06 per share. Unlike other companies that are not providing an outlook, Cloudflare stood firm on its fiscal year's guidance of revenues of $389-$393 million with a loss of $0.19-$0.21 per share. The market was forecasting revenues of $387.7 million for the year with a loss of $0.20 per share.The virus-related lockdown has helped Cloudflare grow its offerings. It has seen unprecedented growth of traffic on its platform in the past 12 weeks compared to the growth in the past year. It continues to improve the offerings available to these customers. For instance, its firewall team has released a series of improvements that have reduced 40% of the processing time off every request.Earlier this year, it also announced a partnership with Kentik, a provider of an AIOps platform for network professionals. As part of the agreement, the companies will integrate network traffic intelligence from Kentik with Cloudflare Magic Transit for fast mitigation of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The partnership will help prevent advanced and targeted DDoS attacks. Kentik leverages network analytics and insights to identify DDoS attacks in real-time. The integration will allow Cloudflare Magic Transit to leverage these insights to mitigate these attacks even before they impact the business.It also entered into an agreement with JD Cloud & AI, the intelligent technology provider of JD.com (NASDAQ:JD).

Moreover, Cloudflare's learning curve is pretty low.Conversely, Fastly's learning curve is basically vertical. But Fastly's target market is not small and medium-sized businesses in nearly all cases, so such a learning curve can be surmounted by the customers (large enterprise IT departments) to whom Fastly primarily sells its offering. Fastly targets medium and large (perhaps described as mega-enterprises) with an edge computing language that is currently considered the best of the CDN universe.In fact, Fastly's employment of its specialized Varnish Coding Language [VCL] prompted Cloudflare to follow in its footsteps with the creation of its own offering known as ""Workers"". Hence, with Fastly in the pole position of edge cloud computing in terms of its technological prowess, the market has traded the stock to astronomical levels.In the last couple of months, Fastly's stock has soared to new heights (up ~8x from its March low of ~$11), displaying early signs of what I might call dangerous exuberance. On the other hand, Cloudflare's price action has been relatively slower (up ~2x from its March low of ~15). Now, we know that at present, edge cloud companies look like one of the primary beneficiaries of COVID-19; however, investors should be careful when investing in these red hot stocks at such inflated valuations, regardless of whether their long term prospects are fantastic.I know this hasn't been popular with some of my readers, but entry points do matter. We cannot willy nilly throw money at the hottest trends and expect a good time.Just ask Cisco (CSCO)... Or perhaps Qualcomm (QCOM), both of which took 10-15 years to return to their all-time highs set in 1999-2000.In today's article, I will compare Fastly and Cloudflare based on some key financial metrics like revenue, margins, valuations, and total expected returns. Additionally, I will illustrate why Cloudflare is the better buy, solely based on growth rates and valuation. So, let's get the ball rolling.To truly appreciate why these stocks have become the topics of conversation (hence, I have been receiving requests to analyze them left and right), let's take a look at their returns heretofore.Source: YChartsIf an investor bought Fastly on 16th March at ~$11, they would have made ~8x on their invested amount. On the other hand, Cloudflare would have doubled one's money in the same time.To that end, they have become scolding hot at this juncture, but is it justified? Let's investigate their financials to ascertain whether such moves are in fact justified, and not just the byproducts of COVID-19 fever.Source: Created by Author using Investor PresentationsAs you can see in the image above, Cloudflare has grown faster than Fastly over the last two years. In the latest quarter, Cloudflare revenues were up ~48% y/y from a higher base while Fastly's revenues were up ~37% y/y from a lower base.This is likely the result of Cloudflare's age (founded two years before Fastly) coupled with its ""land and expand"" and ""masses not classes"" strategy.That is, Cloudflare's solution is truly oriented for the masses. In fact, I host my own website on Cloudflare, which you can find in my Seeking Alpha profile, and its a cinch to do. On the other hand, I tried Fastly and was confronted with the stark reality that I am not an experienced edge cloud computing programmer who could navigate the nearly vertical learning curve by which I was confronted upon loading my seemingly empty Fastly dashboard.As you will see later in this article, what I just mentioned is further borne out by the company's net retention rates, a number which I consider to be one of, if not the most, telling metrics by which I can ascertain the quality and nature of a company's business.For now, let's check out Fastly's revenue estimates versus Cloudflare's revenue estimates so as to determine some trajectory of intrinsic value.Source: YChartsSource: YChartsFastly is projected to outpace Cloudflare by growing at ~32.2% CAGR versus Cloudflare's expected growth rate of ~30.9% over the next three years.Of course, these are just projections and Fastly's customer count could rise precipitously in light of its technological advantages and the accelerant of COVID-19 being poured on the digitization of our realities.Now, we will look at margin profiles of the two companies:Source: Created by Author using Investor PresentationsAs can be seen above, Cloudflare wins this round with gross margins of ~77% compared to Fastly's 57.6%.Though I am not entirely sure as to what's causing this disparity, I would most likely attribute it to the fact that Cloudflare's data center network is significantly more mature and more robust. That is, Cloudflare's presence globally is much larger than Fastly's. The result of this dynamic is that Fastly's Cost Of Goods Sold is higher, as it continues to aggressively expand its network of data centers.Of course, one might retort that such costs would be housed within growth capex, with which I'd likely agree.So the second factor that might be causing this disparity revolves around the many more turnkey solutions Cloudflare offers, all of which are software-based and therefore higher margin offerings. As I've mentioned a couple times now, Cloudflare offers a suite of products to which one is exposed immediately upon registering for an account. On the other hand, Fastly does not offer these high margin software solutions immediately upon registering, and therefore does not reap the gross margin benefits of having them prebuilt and available.And this discussion affords us a perfect segue into the next item of concern: the respective companies' TAMs.Let's get into them!Source: Fastly's Q1 2020 Earnings PresentationIn line with our trajectory of logic heretofore, Fastly does not offer as many solutions as its competitor, and therefore, it does not have as large a TAM, as you will see shortly.With that being said, Fastly has a strong and obviously aggressive team of developers powering its solution, so I expect this TAM to grow incrementally each year as the company continues to grow its portfolio of solutions.Now, let's check out Cloudflare's TAM.Source: Cloudflare's Q1 2020 Earnings PresentationFrom the above images, you can see that Cloudflare and Fastly see their total addressable market at $47 billion and $35 billion respectively by 2022. The disparity here further illustrates Cloudflare's wider array of offerings for its users.Alright, so we've analyzed quite a bit so far regarding these two companies, but now let's check out my favorite metric: net retention rate.Source: Created by Author using Investor PresentationsWith regards to dollar-based net retention rates, Fastly is outperforming Cloudflare quite comfortably. This stat shows that Fastly's existing customers tend to consume more services from its platform when compared to Cloudflare.Now, with every net retention rate, we must use a surgical nuance in determining whether it's ""good"" or ""bad"". To summarily decide that Fastly is the better option due to its net retention rate would be a fallacious position to assume. Instead, we must identify why these two rates differ.My explanation revolves around the idea that Fastly has significantly less churn, as its customers are almost entirely larger, established enterprises. Conversely, Cloudflare, the company that services the masses and not the classes, provides solutions to small and medium-sized businesses (and large enterprises to be sure), which are notorious for being slow to accelerate their spend and are notorious for simply ceasing to exist (to be clear, I am discussing small and medium-sized businesses); the byproduct of which is a lower net retention rate begotten by higher churn and less upgrades.Furthermore, Fastly's higher net retention rate is also attributable to its focus on being a developer-first platform (developed by hardcore developers) combined with an expanding array of services, including security solutions as its platform continues to evolve. To that end, Fastly's net retention rate may slow as it begins to saturate its near term accessible enterprise market.To make an investment decision, one must determine the intrinsic value and total expected returns of a stock (read: business).To determine intrinsic value, we will employ our proprietary valuation model, with which many of you are already familiar. For those of you who have not yet seen it, here's what it entails:Source: Created by Author using L.A. Stevens Valuation ModelAs you can see above, Fastly's and Cloudflare's intrinsic values are ~$40 and ~$26, i.e., both stocks are technically overvalued. But years ago, I realized such a valuation method was not entirely sufficient to determine the movement of stocks; hence, I added the second and third components to the valuation model (and have since added a fourth which incorporates dividends into total returns).So let's employ the second and third components to ascertain whether we should deploy capital into these stocks.In both cases, I don't expect dilution to be rampant, and therefore, I omitted step 2 for this specific valuation (though I almost always employ step 2, as my loyal readers know).Now, we know that a traditional DCF model illustrates whether a stock is over- or under-valued; however, it does nothing in terms of demonstrating what one can expect in the way of future returns. For that, we must use step 3 of the LASV model. The results are depicted below.Source: Created by Author using L.A. Stevens Valuation ModelSo, if one were to buy Fastly (or Cloudflare) at $86 (or $35) and hold for ten years, he/she could expect base case returns at ~6.36% (or ~11.44%) CAGR. Fastly's expected return is well below our hurdle rate of 9.8% (long-term S&P 500 annualized return). Thus, Fastly is not worth buying at $86.However, Cloudflare offers potential annual returns of ~11.44%, which is slightly higher than our hurdle rate. From my perspective, Cloudflare will not outperform the market by a mile, and thus it is only a modest buy at these lofty valuations.Cloudflare and Fastly are very interesting companies to be sure; however, I am not sure either represent table pounding buys at present. Now, will these companies be successful investments over the coming 10 years? I am quite sure they will in that regard, as evidenced by my recommendation for Beating The Market subscribers to buy Fastly at $44.The edge cloud computing space is set to massively grow over the coming decades as the deployment of apps in localized areas, especially with the advent of 5G and the nature thereof, proliferates.In closing, as of today, I rate Cloudflare as having a much better value proposition.Key Takeaway: Buy Cloudflare, Hold Fastly.Please provide your feedback in the comments section below!As always, thanks for reading; remember to follow, and happy investing!"
4348730,105372,2020-05-19T13:06:34-04:00,"Cloudflare is well positioned to be a leader in edge computing, which is likely to be the next large wave in computing.Cloudflare has a large customer base and broad product portfolio which has yet to be fully tapped, providing a large growth opportunity.If Cloudflare can continue to attract large customers they are likely to reward shareholders with strong returns in the future.","Edge computing is likely to be the next important wave in computing after cloud computing and will be driven largely by the adoption of 5G. Cloudflare (NET) is positioned to be a leader in this market with its global network, large customer base and technology portfolio of security, performance and reliability solutions. Although Cloudflare trades on a high EV/S multiple and has had a significant increase in share price in recent months, I believe it is deeply undervalued based on its market opportunity and the vision of the leadership team.The internet was originally designed to deliver fault tolerance and robust connectivity, not to deliver the security, performance, and reliability required by modern businesses. To resolve this problem, companies have traditionally deployed hardware on-premise or in data centers to deliver functionality like Virtual Private Networks (NASDAQ:VPN), firewalls, routing, traffic optimization and load balancing.As enterprises continue to shift IT to the cloud, they require reliable, low latency, secure and private networks which are difficult to achieve with traditional approaches or by using multiple point-cloud solutions, as it is expensive and difficult to manage. Cloudflare aims to overcome these issues by providing a simple and scalable platform which offers a broad range of network services to deliver reliability, performance and security.Table 1: Approach to Networking(source: Cloudflare)The key markets currently addressed by Cloudflare's platform include:Figure 1: Evolution of the Enterprise Stack(source: Cloudflare)Cloudflare's current product and service portfolio addresses a large number of use cases, representing a large and growing total addressable market. They are also actively developing new products to address adjacent markets that are not included in the estimate of their addressable market which could expand significantly in areas like IoT and edge computing.Figure 2: Cloudflare Total Addressable Market(source: Cloudflare)One of the most promising future markets that Cloudflare's global network could address is the edge data center market. Edge data centers are small data centers located close to end users which aim to boost the performance and reliability of apps and services and reduce the cost of running them by shortening the distance data has to travel, thereby mitigating bandwidth and latency issues. While it is currently unclear how large the edge data center market will be, it is reasonable to assume it will become a huge market over the next decade, driven by applications which require high bandwidth and low latency (IoT, machine learning, augmented reality). Cloudflare is well positioned to be competitive in this market due to their large global footprint and expertise in network reliability, security and performance.Cloudflare was launched in 2010 and has since grown to be one of the largest CDNs in the world, handling an estimated 5-10% of internet traffic in 2018. Cloudflare delivers a broad range of network services to both free users and paying customers, which aim to increase security, performance and reliability while decreasing complexity. These services are becoming increasingly important to help companies manage public and hybrid clouds, avoid vendor lock-in and be able to utilize best of breed applications. Cloudflare's platform serves as a scalable, easy-to-use, unified control plane across on-premise, hybrid cloud, public cloud and Software-as-a-Service (SAAS) applications.Figure 3: Cloudflare Key Milestones(source: Cloudflare)To act as a CDN providing effective Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection Cloudflare had to build a network spanning 193 cities in over 90 countries which interconnects with over 8,000 networks globally, including major ISPs, cloud services and enterprises. Cloudflare estimates they operate within 100 milliseconds of 98% of the Internet-connected population in the developed world, and 93% of the Internet-connected population globally. This distributed network is a source of competitive advantage and positions Cloudflare to compete in growing markets like IoT, edge data centers and network security.Figure 4: Cloudflare's Global Network Coverage(source: Cloudflare)Cloudflare built services like a CDN and domain name servers not because these were target markets but because they were essential to deliver other services that their customers would require. Cloudflare is now leveraging their strong position in web infrastructure to deliver the broadest portfolio of products possible as they believe this approach will be superior to point-cloud solutions in the long run.Figure 5: Cloudflare Business Model(source: Cloudflare)Cloudflare is not only developing a broad product portfolio but also targeting a broad customer base, offering easy-to-use products across a range of service and pricing levels, including free. To some extent this can be considered a marketing initiative, as Cloudflare is developing relationships with free users, some of whom will go on to be paying customers. It is also largely a data acquisition strategy as the 20+ million internet properties using the Cloudflare platform act as a global sensor network, which can be used to optimize traffic and provide intelligence on cyber-attacks.Cloudflare's large user base and the amount of internet traffic that comes with it also allows Cloudflare to negotiate favorable agreements with Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that allows them to place their equipment directly in ISPs' data centers, which substantially lowers bandwidth and co-location expenses.In the past, achieving internet security, performance and reliability required expensive hardware and an IT team to manage it, which was prohibitive for many companies. Cloudflare has chosen to target this underserved market with their tiered services. This is a classic disruption strategy, where the needs of an underserved customer segment are met with a basic service which is improved overtime allowing the company to expand upmarket. Cloudflare's recent introduction of services targeting larger enterprise customers, like zero trust security and distributed storage is the beginning of Cloudflare's expansion upmarket.Figure 6: Cloudflare Product Launches and Large Customer Growth(source: Cloudflare)Figure 7: Cloudflare Growth Strategy(source: Cloudflare)Cloudflare has used less attractive markets to build the resources, processes and competencies necessary to enter more attractive markets. This could be considered analogous to Amazon (AMZN) where a dominant position in ecommerce has been used to build the company and enter a broad range of markets where the company could succeed.Figure 8: Amazon Share Price and Product Innovations(source: Created by author using data from Yahoo Finance)The question is whether Cloudflare has the necessary competencies to succeed as they target larger customers. Having been largely focused on self-serve customers in the past, they now need to be able to successfully sell and implement services for large enterprises, which is not easy for every company to accomplish, even if they have a strong product, as Google Cloud (GOOG) has shown.Signs of Cloudflare's strategy succeeding will include:Cloudflare offers a broad range of services which is expanding and aims to provide network security, performance and reliability.Figure 9: Cloudflare Products(source: Cloudflare)Performance:SecurityFigure 10: Cloudflare Security Products(source: Cloudflare)Figure 11: Cloudflare Security Products(source: Cloudflare)Figure 12: Cloudflare Web Application Firewall(source: Cloudflare)Figure 13: IoT Device Authentication(source: Cloudflare)Figure 14: Cloudflare Access(source: Cloudflare)TeamsTeams focuses on securing companies' internal systems and protecting their employees from threats like malware and phishing attacks without sacrificing performance. The service aims to transform IT security for the age of mobile devices, remote work, cloud computing and SaaS. Teams is comprised of two separate services, Access and Gateway.Cloudflare Access is an access management service based on a zero-trust architecture which secures, authenticates and monitors user access. This service is equivalent to a VPN but is faster and easier for end users to work with. Access management has become a focus area for network security vendors and this service places Cloudflare in competition with companies like Zscaler (ZS) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW). To implement this service Cloudflare works with identity providers like Okta (OKTA), OneLogin, and Ping Identity and endpoint security providers like VMware (VMW), Malwarebytes and Tanium.Gateway is similar to a next-gen firewall in that it secures and filters outbound internet traffic to protect employees from threats on the public Internet without sacrificing performance. Gateway negates the need for new hardware, eliminates expensive MPLS fees and delivers anti-malware scanning and software closer to the user, helping to stop threats before they reach the network.To help deliver the Gateway service, Cloudflare acquired S2 Systems for their browser isolation technology. This technology makes web browsing safer and faster by executing browser code on cloud servers rather than on endpoints keeping threats away from the device. S2 Systems technology allows browser isolation without causing noticeable lag or breaking web pages and allows less powerful devices to run complex applications while using less battery, bandwidth and CPU.Figure 15: Browser Isolation(source: Cloudflare)Cloudflare promotes the following as competitive advantages:None of these factors alone are guaranteed to create a sustainable competitive advantage but the combination of them appears to be driving Cloudflare's performance.Cloudflare is significantly expanding its network in the U.S. using Vapor IO and EdgeMicro (startups focused on small data sites for edge computing). Locations are selected to maximize latency reduction for as many people as possible based on proximity to end users and network architecture.Cloudflare is intent on building a truly global network and entered the China market in 2015 in support of this. Cloudflare is attempting to strengthen its presence in China and recently partnered with JD Cloud & AI (JD) to enable enterprises to deploy cloud-based firewall, DDoS mitigation, content delivery and DNS services worldwide. This strategic collaboration will expand Cloudflare's global availability across 150 additional data centers in mainland China, growing the company's data centers in the region by 700%. Traffic within China will be served from data centers inside of China, while traffic outside of China will continue to be served from the nearest Cloudflare data center. This should allow companies to deliver their content faster, more securely and reliably in-country. JD is a small cloud player in China and this partnership is unlikely to bring significant revenue in the short term but it is a strategic advantage as it allows Cloudflare to offer enhanced services to customers outside of China who provide internet content within China.Figure 16: 2019 China Public Cloud Market Share(source: IDC)Cloudflare launched the Bandwidth Alliance in 2018 to help reduce data transfer fees for shared customers. Bandwidth Alliance partners include Alibaba Cloud (BABA), Tencent Cloud (OTCPK:TCEHY) and Microsoft Azure (MSFT) and the program works by waving bandwidth fees on traffic that is transferred locally through a peering connection which has minimal costs. This makes Cloudflare an important provider of cloud mobility by allowing customers to select best of breed solutions without worrying about data charges from moving workloads between vendors. Unsurprisingly, Amazon is not a member of the alliance as they have the most to lose and the least to gain by reducing friction in cloud services. Cloudflare estimates this will save current customers $50 million a year and although this could be an important differentiator for them, they are open to having competitors like Akamai and Fastly join the alliance.Revenue is generated primarily from subscriptions to the platform. For self-serve paying customers, plans are per registered domain and it is common for customers to purchase subscriptions to cover multiple Internet properties. Cloudflare offers tiered services with the Pro plan providing basic functionality and the business plan providing additional functionality required by larger organizations, like service level agreements of 100% uptime, dynamic content acceleration and enhanced customer support. Customers can also subscribe to add-on products and platform functionality to meet more advanced needs, such as intelligent routing and code deployment at the edge of the network. Contracts generally range from one to three years in duration and are typically billed on a monthly basis.Cloudflare's revenue growth is strong and has so far shown little sign of decline, which should be expected given the company's small size and large addressable market. If anything Cloudflare's revenue growth should be expected to accelerate as adoption by large customers continues to grow.Figure 17: Cloudflare Revenue(source: Created by author using data from Cloudflare)Figure 18: Cloudflare Revenue Growth(source: Created by author using data from Cloudflare)Most of Cloudflare's billings growth currently comes from growth in customer numbers, not billings growth from existing customers. This may be due to most of Cloudflare's existing customers being small companies with limited requirements and limited IT budgets. New cohorts have significantly greater value than older cohorts though, primarily as a result of an increasing number of high value customers.Figure 19: Cloudflare Customer Cohorts(source: Cloudflare)Cloudflare should look to expand revenue from existing customers through upgrades to premium plans and the adoption of more products. Over 70% of Cloudflare's enterprise customers already leverage four or more of their products. Investors should look for an increase in Cloudflare's net retention rate as Cloudflare continues to introduce new services and focus on enterprise customers.Figure 20: Cloudflare Net Retention Rate(source: Created by author using data from Cloudflare)Cloudflare has achieved widespread adoption but so far this has been primarily amongst smaller businesses and websites. As of 2019 Cloudflare products are used by:Customer satisfaction appears to be high amongst existing Cloudflare's customers as indicated by their net promoter score of 68, which is comparable to some of the strongest brands in the world:It also compares favorably to Fastly's NPS of 64.Cloudflare aims to increase adoption amongst large enterprises as customers increasingly adopt cloud technology and replace legacy hardware with software solutions. Cloudflare's large customer numbers have grown significantly over the past 3 years and includes companies like Shopify (SHOP) and IBM (IBM). Continued large customer growth should drive revenue growth in coming years and indicate Cloudflare is successfully executing their strategy. Large customers are defined as customers having annual billings in excess of $100,000 per year and Cloudflare's largest customers have billings in excess of $3 million per year.Figure 21: Cloudflare Customers(source: Created by author using data from Cloudflare)Cloudflare currently generates relatively high gross profit margins, although has not yet achieved operating profitability. Cloudflare's gross profit margin is significantly higher than companies like Akamai and Fastly, which is surprising given the large number of free or low value users that Cloudflare serves. This speaks to the efficiency of Cloudflare's network and operations and should hold the company in good stead as they add services and high value customers.Figure 22: Cloudflare Profit Margins(source: Created by author using data from Cloudflare)Table 2: Cloudflare Target Financial Performance(source: Cloudflare)Cloudflare is currently focused on growth, not profitability and the current lack of operating profitability is not a concern. Sales and marketing and research and development expenses are elevated in support of future growth. Sales and marketing expenses should be expected to accelerate as Cloudflare continues to target larger customers which are higher touch.Figure 23: Cloudflare Operating Expenses(source: Created by author using data from Cloudflare)Cloudflare broadly groups their competitors into on-premise vendors, point solutions and public cloud companies with the most similar companies generally falling under point solutions. On-premise vendors are pivoting to cloud services with varying degrees of success, often making acquisitions to rapidly scale their competency in this area. Point solution vendors are expanding offerings to improve their strategic positioning and expand their addressable market in a similar manner to Cloudflare. It is this strategic group which is likely to give Cloudflare the most competition. Public cloud companies can offer niche services, like CDN, at low cost to attract business in other high margin areas, which is a threat to the economics of niche services. Cloudflare is in a reasonably strong position as its services are becoming increasingly important and can help companies to avoid cloud vendor lock-in.Figure 24: Cloudflare Competitors(source: Cloudflare)Cloudflare's competitive position is reasonably strong as they offer integrated solutions which help to lower costs for customers and simplify deployment. Their broad portfolio of services also offers economies of scope as they can introduce new services for very little marginal cost. There is also potential revenue synergies as their broad and integrated services can offer improved functionality compared to point solutions.Cloudflare promotes their large customer base as one of their key competitive advantages and they clearly have a significantly large customer base than their competitors. It is not clear they handle more traffic though as companies like Akamai and Fastly have more large customers. Akamai in particular is dominant amongst large customers, which explains their revenue leadership.Figure 25: CDN Customers(source: Intricately)Cloudflare is making rapid progress amongst enterprise customers (where enterprise is considered to be a company with more than 1,000 employees) and this customer segment will be an important driver of growth going forward.Figure 26: CDN Buyers by Spend(source: Intricately)Figure 27: CDN Growth in Enterprise Customer Count(source: Intricately)AkamaiAkamai offers a globally distributed intelligent edge platform with a portfolio of edge security, web and mobile performance and OTT solutions. Akamai has a larger footprint than Cloudflare, with more than 288,000 servers in over 136 countries. Akamai delivers daily Web traffic reaching more than 50 terabits per second compared to Cloudflare's network capacity of 35 terabits per second. Although Cloudflare has more customers Akamai generates significantly more revenue and likely handles more traffic due to their dominant position amongst large customers. It is estimated that 32% of Akamai's customers spend more than $100,000 per month on their services compared to 0.6% for Cloudflare. In addition 50% of the Fortune Global 500 are Akamai customers compared to 15% for Cloudflare. Akamai offers a similar portfolio of internet performance and security services to Cloudflare and is focused on similar growth areas like zero trust security and access management. Akamai is one of Cloudflare's strongest competitors due to their large footprint and leadership position in web application firewalls, bot management, zero trust security, DDoS mitigation and access management.FastlyFastly offers an edge cloud platform which moves data and applications closer to users and appears to be more performance than security focused. Their services include:Fastly is relatively small but growing rapidly and will provide strong competition for customers with large performance requirements, like audio and video streaming services.ZscalerCloudflare's security focus is increasingly placing the company in competition with cybersecurity companies like Zscaler. Zscaler is a cloud native cybersecurity company focused on zero trust security and access management. Zscaler's security cloud is distributed across more than 100 data centers around the world and allows traffic to be routed locally and securely to the internet over broadband and cellular connections. It is unclear how successful Cloudflare will be in the network security market as they will face strong competition from incumbents like Palo Alto Networks and Zscaler.Figure 28: Cloudflare Competitor Revenue Growth(source: Created by author using data from company reports)Cloudflare's valuation is not excessive given their growth rate but their EV/S ratio is at the upper end of its range since listing. Cloudflare's attractiveness as an investment depends on the extent to which they can gain traction amongst larger customers and continue expanding their product portfolio. Based on a discounted cash flow analysis I estimate that Cloudflare's intrinsic value is approximately $52 per share.Figure 29: Cloudflare EV/S Ratio(source: Created by author using data from Yahoo Finance)Figure 30: Comparable Company EV/S Ratios(source: Created by author using data from Yahoo Finance)"
4327634,20521,2020-02-27T02:54:55-05:00,"Cloudflare went public in September last year and recently reported a strong quarter.With a new acquisition and a PaaS edge, the company looks promising.Superior speed of development and flexibility is proving to be a differentiating factor in a large percentage of Cloudflare's new deals.","Website infrastructure and security company Cloudflare went public in September last year and recently reported a strong quarter. With a new acquisition and a PaaS edge, the company looks promising.Cloudflare's FinancialsRevenues for the fourth quarter grew 51% to $83.9 million, ahead of the Street's estimate of $79.1 million. Net loss was $28.2 million, compared with a loss of $16.7 million a year ago. Non GAAP EPS was $0.06 compared with the Street's estimate of $0.07.Fiscal year 2019 revenue grew 49% to $287 million. GAAP gross profit was $223.6 million, or 77.9% gross margin, compared to $149.1 million, or 77.4%, in fiscal 2018. GAAP net loss was $105.8 million, compared to $87.2 million for fiscal 2018. Non-GAAP net loss was $69.5 million, compared to $59.5 million for fiscal 2018. GAAP net loss per share was $0.72, compared to $1.08 for fiscal 2018. Non-GAAP net loss per share was $0.48, compared to $0.73 for fiscal 2018.The company added a record 300,000 customers during the fourth quarter and ended 2019 with 2.6 million total customers, up 34% y-o-y. It added over 5,800 paying customers in Q4 and now has over 82,000 paying customers, up 22% y-o-y. Its large customer count increased 76% to 550 total large customers with a net add of 237 large customers over the year and 75 over the quarter. Its large customers are defined as customers with over $100,000 in annualized billings. The number of Internet properties using Cloudflare platform grew by 10 million to 26 million in 2019.Dollar-based net retention stood at 112% in the fourth quarter, which shows that existing customers tend to renew their Cloudflare contracts at larger sizes. This metric is also on the rise, moving up from 110% in the third quarter.For the first quarter, Cloudflare forecast revenues of $87-$88 million with a non-GAAP net loss of $0.06-$0.05 per share. The market estimates revenues of $87.71 million with net loss of $0.06 per share. Cloudflare expects to end fiscal 2020 with revenues of $389-$393 million with a loss of $0.21-$0.19 per share. The market was looking for revenues of $510.89 million with loss of $0.14 per share.Cloudflare's New Offerings and AcquisitionSan Francisco-based CloudFlare was founded in 2009 by Harvard students Michelle Zatlyn, Matthew Prince, and their friend Lee Holloway as an online service that helps improve website performance while ensuring security. As the world shifts towards scalable cloud services, Cloudflare has also built a large cloud network that spans 200 cities worldwide and is within less than 100 milliseconds of nearly everyone connected to the Internet. Last month, it announced Cloudflare for Teams to ensure that the people and teams within its organization can access the tools they need to do their job while staying safe from malware and other online threats.The Cloudflare for Teams suite is built around two complementary products, Cloudflare Access and Cloudflare Gateway that leverage its unified, global platform and its extensive threat intelligence data. Cloudflare Access is a modern-day VPN, providing fast and granular access control for internal and external applications. Cloudflare Gateway is the modern next-generation firewall for malware and ensure compliance with organization policies on any device anywhere in the world without sacrificing performance. It has already won clients like Ericsson, Ziff Davis, and 23andMe.In January, Cloudflare announced the acquisition of browser isolation startup S2 Systems founded in 2018 by former Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) employees. Based in Kirkland, Washington, S2 develops remote browser isolation technology that executes browser code in the cloud rather than on the user's device. This solution keeps security threats safely isolated from end devices, protecting against one of the biggest enterprise security threats. The company expects S2 technology to enhance Cloudflare for Teams, ensuring it can protect even the most security-conscious organizations without slowing them down. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. S2's employees will move into Cloudflare's new Seattle office following the acquisition.Cloudflare's New EdgeOther new products gaining traction are Magic Transit and Workers edge computing platform. Magic Transit is a software-defined networking product that offers IP transit with DDoS protection, next-gen firewall, and traffic acceleration for on-premise and data center networks from a single, easy-to-use interface.Workers edge computing platform allows developers to build and deploy serverless applications on the Cloudflare edge network. Cloudflare Workers provides a lightweight JavaScript execution environment that allows developers to augment existing applications or create entirely new ones without configuring or maintaining infrastructure. The superior speed of development and flexibility that the platform offers is proving to be a differentiating factor in a large percentage of Cloudflare's new deals.Cloudflare's primary competition is from on-premise network hardware vendors such as Cisco, F5, Check Point, FireEye, Imperva, Palo Alto Networks, Juniper Networks, and Riverbed. Other competitors Zscaler, OpenDNS (Cisco), Akamai, Limelight, Fastly, Edgecast (Verizon), Dyn (Oracle), Neustar, UltraDNS as well as some services provided by the major public cloud vendors including AWS, GCP, Azure, and Alibaba.Cloudflare went public on the NYSE under the ticker NET at a list price of $15. Its stock closed 19% higher on the opening day at $17.9 for a market cap of $5.25 billion. Before going public, it had raised $182 million in venture funding and was last valued at $3.2 billion. Its stock is currently trading at $21.02 at a market cap of $6.33 billion.Original PostEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."
4327371,102101,2020-02-26T11:15:20-05:00,"Cloudflare's growth factor remains solid.Other investing factors will have to improve for its oversubscribed valuation to remain attractive in the near term.Cloudflare's land and expand thesis remains compelling.While valuation is oversubscribed in the near term, I remain bullish on the long term outlook of the business.","The investing thesis for Cloudflare (NET) to land customers using its reliability and performance solutions while expanding with security services remains intact.Cloudflare reported strong results last quarter. Its growth factor was boosted by strong double-digit growth in revenue and customer count. The number of paying and large enterprise customers also grew significantly, and the dollar-based net retention rate came in at 112%. Going forward, management is guiding for revenue growth of 41%-43%. Cloudflare is a bet of the need for web apps to deliver fast, reliable, and secure services to end-users. While this doesn't directly translate to revenue for customers like the lead generation platform offered by Facebook (FB) or Alphabet (GOOGL), the case can still be made that optimal, reliable, and secure access to web assets drives user experience which results in better customer sales conversion rates for revenue-generating platforms. This means Cloudflare will continue to grow as long as it delivers on its promises to its growing clients. The recent performance continues to validate the thesis that Cloudflare will continue to play a key role in the current web evolution. Revenue is now increasingly driven by its security solutions, though the company mostly lands with its reliability and performance offerings. The incentive to cross-sell its security solution is compelling given the capability issues and switching cost of combining various vendors when deploying web assets. This incentive mostly applies to Cloudflare's customers as most companies still go with the full cybersecurity solutions of pure plays like Palo Alto (PANW), Fortinet (FTNT) and new cloud players like CrowdStrike (CRWD), and Zscaler (ZS). As it stands, Cloudflare's strength tilts towards the mid-market. Therefore, its large enterprise-strength narrative will cause its valuation to lead growth in the near term. As a result, I am only comfortable acquiring shares on a volatility-induced correction.Cloudflare has been great at security threats involving vectors like denial of service attacks, botnet attacks, web security certificate attacks, and browser-based threats. This partly informs its recent acquisition of S2 for browser isolation. A lot of cyber plays are investing in browser isolation security solutions. This is due to the shift from desktop-based apps to cloud-based apps which are mostly served via a mobile or desktop browser. This is one of the fastest-growing trends in the software space and the market opportunity can only expand from here. Proofpoint (PFPT) acquired its browser isolation capabilities in 2017 via weblife.io while Zscaler acquired Appsulate last year. Cloudflare's margins sacrifice continues to reflect its market share acquisition strategy. Value investors will find it tough to make a decision on its lack of profitability. Though the path to profitability appears clear as more free users are converted to paid users. Key global traffic drivers were underplayed to drive demand during the last conference call. This includes large sporting events like the Olympics. Though, the company is guiding to sell more into the Fed space in light of the upcoming US election as parties set up security assets to thwart nation-state attacks.Cloudflare's balance sheet remains strong after the significant capital raise from its IPO. Going forward, the capital allocation strategy is geared towards the pursuit of more growth, and the case for Cloudflare to acquire more market share in the CDN and security space remains compelling using its freemium/land and expand strategy. The onus rests on the sales team to convert more free to paid customers. The level of competition in the web security space is huge. Therefore, having a foot in the door via its huge customer base is reassuring. I find valuation overheated at a market cap of $6 billion, given its lack of profitability and negative operating cash flow. Compared to most competitors, it is trading at a lofty sales multiple though the potential to continue its strong momentum is compelling given its strong market share acquisition momentum and reach in both the web security and content delivery space. It only has 10% of Fortune 1000 companies as paying customers, which implies the market share expansion opportunity is huge.I expect Cloudflare to keep outperforming in the near term. The dollar-based net retention rate will be a perfect indicator to measure the near term health of the business. With the huge forward growth guidance for Q1'20, the strong growth factor will continue to attract speculators in the near term."
4338820,104952,2020-04-21T11:24:42-04:00,"Cloudflare is a long-term disruptive growth story in a massive $47 billion network infrastructure market. It is disrupting the network hardware giants such as Cisco, Juniper, and Palo Alto Networks.The solid cloud offering focusing on reliability, security, and performance has been working well with the efficient go-to-market to create a recipe for disruption.Number of clients with >$100,000 in billings has increased by ~4x over the last three years and has been a growth driver. Cloudflare's 3-year CAGR is at a staggering 51%.","Founded in 2009 as a company well-known for its CDN/Content Delivery Network offering, Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) has since broadened its vision to be a global cloud platform with offerings in the growing cloud infrastructure and security markets. Growth has been solid, and network efficiency has kicked in. The company posted a 51% 3-year CAGR and a 78% gross margin in Q4. Moreover, the strength in offering and go-to-market will be the long-term catalyst driving sustainable growth. In recent times, the robust offering has allowed Cloudflare to increasingly land large accounts. Since 2016, the number of clients with >$100,000 in billings has more than quadrupled. All these factors provide a genuinely interesting secular growth opportunity for investors, despite the relatively high P/S.In our view, the combination of self-serve go-to-market and easy-to-use offering, glued together with the attractive pricing structure, has become the key growth factor for the company. The motivation for investing in a self-serve go-to-market approach is mainly strategic. By allowing as many developers/users as it can to sign up for the free services, Cloudflare is feeding its intelligent system with fresh network activity data points that are beneficial for its cybersecurity product. As of Q4, there have been ~2.6 million users with ~26 million internet properties using Cloudflare. In Q4 earnings call, we have also learned that 50% of large clients' spending is on the security product.(Source: Cloudflare's earnings call slide)The large user base also allows for more seamless account expansion that has been driving growth. By relying on this go-to-market model, Cloudflare has been able to maintain its net retention rate between 111% and 112%. Moreover, this is also a highly efficient acquisition model, given most onboarding happens online, and the enterprise sales rep is added on an ad hoc basis.(Source: Cloudflare's earnings call slide)Overall, Cloudflare's self-serve model is highly similar to Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX), which even relies on the model to land larger accounts. As seen in the illustration of one of its case studies above, Cloudflare was able to grow a particular client's ACV/Annual Contract Value by ~36x in less than three years. Since 2016, Cloudflare has grown its number of large accounts by 5x to 475. At the moment, 10% of Fortune 1,000 are also paying customers.(Source: Cloudflare's earnings call slide)In 2020, we believe that the efficient go-to-market will further support the strong product portfolio to hit the $386 million expected revenue. Given its competitive offering from the security, performance, and reliability standpoints, Cloudflare can easily hit the pain points of the new and existing large clients. As the CEO Matthew Prince has mentioned in the Q4 earnings call, half of the large account additions have been driven by new signings:In the near term, we are also of the view that the innovative security product will continue to gain traction. As we have learned in the most recent earnings call, about half of the large customer spends were attributed to the security product. Furthermore, the recently-launched Cloudflare for Team that is built around Access and Gateway products enables distributed teams to work separately with enough layers of security to avoid online threats and malware. As more companies work remotely during the COVID-19 outbreak, this increasingly becomes an important tool that operates like a modern-day VPN/Virtual Private Network. Adoptions of the product have been strong as companies like Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) and 23andMe have come on board.While gross margin has been solid, there are a lot of investments to be made across R&D and sales and marketing to maintain the growth. As a result, the near-term concern on the stock remains the lack of operating profitability and cash-flow generation outlook. These two items have been improving YoY nonetheless and are expected to turn positive in the future as the company gains more operating leverage. This makes a bet on the stock today as a bet on its disruptive product. Looking at the market landscape and Cloudflare's positioning as the disruptor, the narrative is mainly built around secular growth. Cloudflare is tapping into increasingly growing opportunities across IoT security, serverless computing, and 5G. Having raised ~$525 million in its IPO in 2019, Cloudflare will look to expand its share of the market.(Source: Cloudflare's 10-K)Therefore, positive operating profitability and cash flows are currently secondary objectives. Despite the improvement from 2018, OCF/operating cash flow is still in the red without any outlook for reversal. We saw the same thing in the company's operating margin in 2019, which was at -38% despite the ~600 bps increase from 2018. Loss from operations has also grown by ~10x since 2017.By delivering innovative unified network offering across performance, reliability, and security, Cloudflare differentiates itself from the cloud competitors such as Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) or Fastly (NYSE:FSLY). Indeed, as mentioned in its S-1, the real opportunity lies in disrupting the network hardware giants such as Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), F5 (NASDAQ:FFIV), or Juniper (NYSE:JNPR). Furthermore, the market trend of shifting away from hardware is also in Cloudflare's favor, and as such, justifies the investments. These incumbents provide the on-premise version of Cloudflare's unified cloud offering in a $47 billion TAM.(ZS vs NET vs AKAM vs CSCO vs F5 vs JNPR, source: stockrow)As the disruptive cloud services players, Zscaler and Cloudflare lead their peer group in terms of top-line growth by far. Both players grew their revenues by ~49%-60% YoY while the fastest-growing incumbent, Akamai (AKAM), only grew its revenue by ~6.6% YoY. As a result, the figure further shows that there is a market saturation effect for the on-premise giants and, conversely, a disruptive opportunity for cloud competitors. There is also an upside potential in gross margin, which stands at ~77.9% today. With its scalable and efficient network flywheel, margin expansion is highly possible in the long term.(Source: Google)At ~24x P/S, Cloudflare is not cheap. YTD, the stock has appreciated by ~33%. Fundamentally, stocks in this sector have benefited from the increasing internet usage during the stay-at-home activities due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Likewise, the other disruptive cloud security player, Zscaler, similarly trades at ~23x P/S. Given the catalysts driving the performance, maintaining the P/S at the end of 2020 will remain the best-case scenario for the stock. With the expectation of $386 million at the end of 2020 and ~302 million outstanding shares, we come at a target price of ~$30 per share, which represents a ~36% potential upside. Overall, we believe that Cloudflare's technology and offering are game-changing for the industry. The ~4x increase in the number of large clients over the last three years is validation for its disruptive potential. Our long-term view on the stock remains bullish today despite the high premium."
4331835,98236,2020-03-13T13:18:48-04:00,"Cloudflare is a company whose corporate mission is to make the internet a better place for its customers.It offers an edge computing service, a dev ops platform, a variety of security solutions and a work from home capability.The company reported a particularly strong quarter in February; it has yet to adjust expectations for the impact of the Covid-19 virus.I find it more than a bit of a challenge to offer valuation metrics that are likely to prove accurate in the fluid situation created by the economic impact of the Covid-19 virus.Cloudflare share should be on the shopping list of any investor seeking to take advantage of the irrationality and the panic engendered by fears of the impact of this virus.","This article was highlighted for PRO+ subscribers, Seeking Alpha's service for professional investors. Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.I decided to write about Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) at the request of several subscribers to my Ticker Target investment service. At the time that I decided to write this article, the Covid-19 virus and the oil-price war were not front and center in the minds of investors. So, the context has changed dramatically but the story hasn't. The Cloudflare story is one of rapid growth, initially coming from millions of smaller users trying to improve the performance of their web sites and to achieve an advanced level of cyber-security protection. The Cloudflare story is based on a freemium model; paying customers were last reported to be 82,000 which was up 8% sequentially last quarter. Last quarter's revenue growth was about 50% year on year and about 13.5% sequentially. The Q4 results actually showed a bit of re-acceleration at scale, always a hard trick to pull off.Looking ahead, most likely the growth of revenues for this company will have to come from its larger users; that is where the dollars are in this market. Like most companies of its kind, the company is in the midst of a noticeable pivot to the enterprise. Most recently the company reported that it had 550 larger customer (defined as those with an ARR of greater than $100k) up 80% from a year ago, and up 16% sequentially. It will be important to see if the company can further break into the Fortune 2000 with major deployments.It is the style today, and probably for some time to come into the future, to try to write about investments in the context of the Covid-19 virus. Indeed, an analyst at Wells, Fargo, as detailed below, raised his price target on Cloudflare shares because the company has a ""Work Remotely"" solution which was recently introduced. Evaluating Cloudflare shares because of a single specific solution, amongst a great many SKU's would be tendentious. Tying that logic to a one-time event, that is likely to be in the rear-view mirror in a quarter or two, is even more of a stretch.I continue to see analysts struggle with re-rating names in the software space based on the virus impact. There are some things in life that are unknowable. Trying to figure out what the impact of the virus might be on a specific company and over a specific time scale is one of these unknowable items. I have, in the course of this article, attempted to suggest a level of revenues for Cloudflare and with that derive an EV/S ratio. Honestly, readers, I have no real way of determining what the impact of the virus -- and the oil price war as well -- might be on Cloudflare revenues. No one does, because there are no real analogs to use in determining some kind of quantification.Completing this article during the period of earnings releases on March 12th I have been struck by the reaction of investors to forward guidance. It is somewhat irrational to sell Slack (NYSE:WORK) shares down by 25% based on concerns about the company's forward business due to the virus, and then sell the shares down another 20% because the company chose to be prudent and issue in-line guidance.Why do I mention this phenomenon in an article about Cloudflare? Simple. The odds are that Cloudflare will report a decent quarter, and provide in-line guidance and the shares could still go down. Do not buy these shares to play the quarter, or because this company has a work-at-home solution. Do not expect even strong earnings to provide fuel for the shares to rise. This is a time of basic risk-off irrationality. Cloudflare is considered a risk-on name. Do not try to mis-classify a Cloudflare investment as anything other than what it is-a high-growth name playing in a set of high-growth sandboxes.To an extent, as I will explain below, Cloudflare is a company that is quite difficult to classify. That makes trying to present some kind of virus impact on this company's business all the more of a guess. But there is help to come here. It is my belief that the impact of the virus, while unknowable, is also not of significance in trying to evaluate the shares. The virus will go-sooner rather than later I hope, as my town contains a containment zone, although mercifully not near where I happen to live. Even the price war between the Saudis and the Russians will get resolved, although apparently that will take longer. Despite all that has been written on the subject-and much has-the right way to value equities is some variant of a discounted cash flow analysis. And here is the thing: the future cash flows for Cloudflare looking over any kind of extended period which is the only way a DCF analysis can prove its value, aren't likely to change significantly, and indeed, the value might rise to reflect a lower discount rate. That is what the inevitable resort to quantitative easing-bond buying, or currency printing if you prefer-will mean.In the shorter term, self-evidently, equities are going to trade based on the fears of the impact of the virus on economic growth. But whatever investors have thought about Cloudflare before the impact of the virus, the valuation matrix that had been used will return more or less unchanged when the panic abates. Cloudflare is a highly valued, high growth name that will almost certainly see some impact from the virus. And when the virus leaves, it will most likely leave this company well positioned for multi-years of growth at a high level. I have every reason to believe that Cloudflare will see about the same impact from Covid-19 as most other software names, and its recovery from that impact will take the same trajectory.I think that the approach that this company has taken in terms of selling a broad-ranging platform to improve the internet experience of most of its customers is one that will continue to resonate. Of course, so do many other analysts with 11 buy ratings out of 14 analysts reporting their recommendations to First Call.Cloudflare shares are probably not the optimal investment for a strategy of playing a ""virus abatement"" rebound. The shares recently rose by 34% following the very strong quarter the company reported in mid-February, and have ""only"" fallen 18% in the recent panic. On that basis, if on no other, the shares may not see some kind of violent upside, because they aren't correcting from a violent downside. Sometimes, readers and subscribers ask me about my single ""best"" recommendation. I am loathed to provide that kind of recommendation given the many factors that make it basically impossible to find a ""best"" recommendation. But I wouldn't put Cloudflare in that category at this price.I think Cloudflare is another high-growth name that is worth owning amongst a portfolio of high growth names. I think it has some unique advantages that customers seem to find quite attractive. In some ways, it reminds me of DataDog (DDOG) in the fact that it has many elements of internet optimization and security on a single platform in the same way that DDOG provides its users with ""3 pillars of observability."" If NET's valuation weakens, this is an investment I would consider.Cloudflare is a company that can be a bit hard to define in terms of the specific niche that it fills for most of its users. The Cloudflare S-1 description calls the company's product a unified control plane that offers users capabilities spanning security, performance, and reliability. It offers an edge computing platform, but it doesn't really compete with edge specialist Fastly (FSLY) because it doesn't offer a CDN service. It has a broad range of customers both large and small. It has several security solutions including Cloudflare Teams that was introduced earlier this year.Cloudflare Teams includes Access and Gateway. Perhaps oversimplifying, Teams is a service that can be used as a modern replacement for Virtual Private Networks. Access provides Team members with…well access to resources-data primarily. And Gateways is the equivalent of a next generation firewall.The other day, as mentioned earlier, an analyst at Wells, Fargo actually increased his price target on Cloudflare shares by more than 20% because of his belief that with the advent of the Covid-19 virus, there will be a great upsurge of some permanence in work-from-home paradigms. Work from-home and work through teams are both clearly long-term secular trends. We have long maintained an investment in Atlassian (TEAM) just because of that trend and more recently established a position in Slack as a further commitment to those trends.That said, Cloudflare's set of solutions go far beyond facilitating a secure, remote work paradigm. If this writer, and the funds he manages, ultimately wind up buying Cloudflare shares, it will be for reasons far beyond Teams. We think the investment case to be made is a product of the totality of the platform and not of one given solution. And we do not think that attempting to create investments correlated to the spread of the virus is a particularly useful formulation. The virus will wane, if not in the next few weeks, then in the next few months, and companies will have to be able to maintain performance in all different kinds of environments in which there is no particular public health dimension to working from home. We do expect Teams to have some impact as one of many successful products that is offered by Cloudflare.In addition to the Teams software, which will be distributed without cost as an introductory offer, Cloudflare has solutions that enhance web performance through load balancing and other technologies. I will just mention some of the more significant offerings rather than attempting to discuss them in any detail.Cloudflare has a raft of different security solutions that include DDoS, something called a non-spoofable caller ID, Rate Limiting, what is called an Argo Tunnel between its nearest data center and an application's origin server and bot management. It competes in markets that include intelligent routing, caching and load balancing. So, it has a great many competitors and it is hard to suggest that it does one specific thing that everyone wants and in which this company has unique technology. That may not be such a bad thing, but it does make it hard to characterize this company and its specific value propositions. It is yet another way to invest in what this company describes as ""a better web.""Yes, Cloudflare will do less business this quarter and next quarter as well, and perhaps the quarter beyond as the impact of the Covid-19 virus and the current price war between the Saudis and Russians plays out. $20 or $30 oil probably means that oil companies don't buy IT, other than security, until they have better cash flow. Having lived for some years in both Tulsa and Houston, I am very aware of how those cities and the businesses in them rely on oil prices to sustain their economic activity. And financial institutions that have made loans to finance oil production are going to have further difficulties. All of that is true, and all of that is finite, and that doesn't do anything to building an investment case regarding Cloudflare.As I write this, Cloudflare shares, which went public in September 2019 at $15 and made a first day high of $19.53 have closed on Thursday evening at around $19. Share prices of high-growth names have been so volatile that I think it is best if I just choose a current price and attempt to relate that to valuation metrics.The company provided guidance for 2020 of revenues of about $391 million, or growth of 36%-37%. Will the various headwinds including those induced by the virus and other headwinds induced by the oil-price war make this number lower-and how much lower? It would take someone more arrogant and ignorant that I am to even think they might know how to answer such a question. The conference call was held on February 13, before the impact of the virus was a question perturbing investors and few had even thought the possibility of an oil-price war was on the horizon. So, what might a reasonable set of expectations be for this company.The first quarter guidance for Cloudflare revenue had been $88 million. That was a sequential increase of less than 5% from Q4 levels and was probably not meant to be considered a realistic forecast when it was initially made. In 2019, Q1 to Q4 growth was 11%, or $6 million, and it would be hard to find some logical reason why that number might diminish. The preceding year, which had an impact from a specific customer in Q3, the 4th quarter to 1st quarter delta was 8% or $3 million. Where will the impact of the virus be centered; certainly in some verticals, perhaps in some geos, but who can say if it will be more impactful in larger accounts than smaller ones.Again, as of Thursday evening, NET has an enterprise value of about $5.16 billion with projected sales this current year probably closer to $380 million than $390 million due to some estimated impacts of the virus and the oil price war. So, that suggests a projected EV/S ratio of around 13X. That ratio is probably within a few percent of average for a growth cohort in the mid-high 30% range, although at this point, I haven't tried to recast all of my growth expectations for different companies because of the material unknowable's involved in trying to make 50 or more such forecasts in the absence of any real analogs. I think absent the virus sales might have been more in the range of $410-$420 million, but writing alternative analysis is not something in which anyone can prove anything. I will leave it go that entering the panic and the concerns about the virus, NET shares had an average EV/S valuation for the company's growth cohort, and the company was about average as well in terms of its free cash flow which is still a burn, and will likely remain so for at least another year, regardless of the impacts of the virus.As mentioned, the Cloudflare platform includes many different solutions for different problems faced by users in their access to and use of the internet. One of the more important solutions offered by Cloudflare is what it calls its Worker's solution, designed to provide users with edge access and what is called serverless computing. Rather than try to do a deep dive into each Cloudflare solution, I have provided a link here for those wishing additional information. Cloudflare Workers is seen by many users as peerless in its space as the attached string suggests.Cloudflare recently added a security solution called Magic Transit. Other than its unfortunate name, the solution allows users to send all their network traffic through Cloudflare's network in order to defend against DDoS attacks and optimizing network performance. Magic Transit is somewhat similar to the ZPA offering of Zscaler (ZS).As mentioned earlier, Cloudflare's replacement for VPN has seen a noticeable bit of adoption with users such as Ericsson, Ziff Davis and 23 and Me. The market for VPN replacement is very large and is likely to continue to show substantial growth due both to issues of performance and issues of security.In looking at Cloudflare overall, about half of its customer spend is based on security, another quarter of its spend is based on enhancing web performance, and the final quarter of spend is based on insuring the reliability of applications developed on the Cloudflare platform.The thing that I believe that makes Cloudflare somewhat unique is that it offers solutions for all three of the above problems on a single platform. Users want to at least attempt to manage the number of vendors that they need to deal with and Cloudflare is an opportunity for users to find all that they need for dev ops, security, performance, and reliability from a single supplier. That can make for a very compelling offering.Basically, the opportunity that Cloudflare is exploiting is not in head to head competition with specific suppliers who may or may fill out a checklist of capabilities better or worse than NET in some highly specific category. But currently, the largest opportunity is to sell to those customers who are contemplating re-architecting their IT solution and replacing legacy hardware.At this point, the company has a DBE, one of my favorite metrics of 112.1%. The DBE rose 120 bps last quarter (160 bps year on year) and that is a function in whole or in part of the pivot to larger customers who can readily increase their deployment of Cloudflare by both expanding the number of Cloudflare products they use and increasing the scope of their networks that are re-architecting using the Cloudflare platform. The DBE for this company does not include the conversion of free subscriptions to paid products. One of the more significant tells of the success of the pivot to larger users is going to be an increase in the DBE.As mentioned, Cloudflare's revenue growth reaccelerated slightly last quarter, and this in turn, helped to improve some of the company's cost ratios. The company had forecast revenues of about $79 million for its Q4 and wound up achieving revenues of $84 million. Much of the extra revenue dropped down to margin with the non-GAAP loss coming in at $18 million compared to the forecast of $21.5 million-the kind of unit economics that analysts like to see. Overall, operating expenses rose 10% sequentially while sequential revenue growth was 13.5%. Non-GAAP gross margins have been consistent at just greater than 78%. The company has a rather high 49% of its revenues coming from outside the US. Just what this might mean in terms of the impact of the Covid-19 virus on growth is not something I can readily guess.Last quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were just greater than $84 million or 100% of revenue. Within that amount, sales and marketing expense was 52% and total sales and marketing spend rose about 57% year on year and about 9% sequentially. The company has indicated that sales and marketing expense ratios would be the last area in which to expect see positive operating leverage. The expense of building up an enterprise sales force as part of the pivot to larger users is likely to play a substantial role in preventing the sales and marketing expense ratio from improving in the near future.The company's non-GAAP research and development expense ratio was 26% last quarter. Research and Development expense rose by about a bit less than 50% last year, and by about 10% sequentially. It should be noted that the relatively slow sequential increase in Q4 was somewhat tied to when stock-based comp expense was recognized, but nonetheless, this was a quarter of leverage at scale in this metric. The company has outlined a policy of seeking leverage at scale from research and development before it does so for sales and marketing.The company incurred a non-GAAP general and administrative expense ratio of about 22% of revenues. General and administrative costs rose by 18.5% year on year and were up by about 16% sequentially. Again, a significant component of the quarter to quarter variation in reported general and administrative expense relates to the recognition of stock-based comp which was very significant in Q3 and fell in Q4. Actual cash general and administrative expenses fell sequentially in the absence of the IPO expense. The company has suggested that it would achieve the earliest leverage in the general and administrative category, and there is no reason to question that kind of a goal.During the February call/earnings release, the management provided guidance which has now been adopted as the consensus expectation for EPS. We are never going to be able to know how the quarters might have played out. Analysts had accepted management guidance for revenues, and for operating leverage in 2H of this current fiscal year. I simply do not know just how significant the virus impact will be and the cadence of its remediation. No one buying these shares today ought to try to do so based on some kind of specific expectation for a return to revenue growth and a concomitant expectation of seeing operating leverage as soon as 2H, although I would not be surprised if indeed, positive results started to flow by that time.I expect that to happen, and to happen simultaneously for this company and other enterprise IT vendors. It will not happen, I imagine, until economic growth stabilizes, perhaps in 2H of this fiscal year.The company had a relatively strong cash flow quarter in Dec. 31st period. Operating cash flow margin was a burn of a bit less than 10%. The company continued to generate deferred revenues, but in the last quarter, the improvement in cash flow burn was primarily a function of greater depreciation, offset by significant capex in the quarter, as the company has built out its network at a very rapid pace.Forecasting cash flow is never a simple undertaking and in current conditions, it is basically not feasible. The company will almost inevitably have free cash flow margins that are greater than operating margins as its pivot to a major account focus is going to generate a rapid build-up in deferred revenue, and it should be able to achieve network efficiencies at scale, allowing depreciation to overtake capex as a component of operating cash flow.It is now Thursday afternoon, March 12th and markets continue to implode. The fear of the virus has panicked investors. There seems no way at this point, that this country or any advanced country is going to avoid a technical recession. The almost complete cessation of travel and a standstill in many entertainment and hospitality categories, the fear amongst banks about their balance sheets, and the oil price war have permeated the investment firmament to a point where dissenting is not feasible.Many share prices have imploded to levels that are far below those that might be derived from looking at EV/S and cash flow calculations, primarily because everyone is trying to assess the level of free cash flow, and sales growth rates for most companies. Most of these new estimates are even more of a guess than is typically the case. There are simply no analogs that provide illumination about how best to develop a specific, company forecast.My advice to readers is simply to throw current revenue, cash flow and earnings forecasts to the side, and focus on the competitive position of different vendors, and some reasonable estimate for long-term growth before the virus impact had turned everything upside down. I would not necessarily recommend NET shares as the leading come back play in the IT space for no other reason but the shares have been proven to be less vulnerable, relative to other vendors, since its latest earnings release.I do think that over a term longer than the next couple of quarters, the company will outgrow other enterprise infrastructure vendors. It is likely not going to be possible to call a bottom for these shares (and many others come to that) but it is on my shopping list as having both a substantial moat and a formidable set of solutions."

The IPO priced at $15/share, which was above the initial range of $10-12 per share. At the midpoint of the IPO price range, much less the current price, NET currently earns our Unattractive rating.Cloudflare offers a variety of cloud-based services that used to be performed by many different on-premise solutions - such as firewalls, routing, virtual private networks (VPNs), traffic optimization, and load balancing - for businesses and websites. The company’s services have become integral to the operations of millions of websites around the world, but it has struggled to turn that global reach into positive cash flow.This report aims to help investors sort through Cloudflare’s financial filings to understand the fundamentals and valuation of this recently public company.Like many other recent software-as-a-service (NASDAQ:SAAS) IPOs, Cloudflare operates on a “freemium” model. The company’s free tier protects websites from distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, reduces loading times, and protects certain information from malicious attacks. Paying customers get more advanced security offerings, as well as mobile optimization, faster network speeds, and a variety of other customized features.As with any company that pursues this model, Cloudflare’s key challenge is to move its users up the value chain, getting free customers to pay and getting paying customers to pay more. The company currently provides services for over 20 million internet properties, but it only has ~75 thousand paying users.As Figure 1 shows, though, the company has rapidly grown its paying user base over the past two and a half years, especially among its highest-paying customers. Total paying customers have more than doubled, from 35 thousand at the end of 2016 to 75 thousand as of June 20, 2019. Customers that pay over $100,000 annually have more than quadrupled over the same time, from 95 to 408.Figure 1: Total and >$100k Paying Customers: 2016-June 30, 2019(Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings)However, as we saw with Slack (WORK), growing paid customers doesn’t always lead to positive cash flows. Cloudflare’s revenue grew from $135 million in 2017 to $193 million in 2018, a 43% increase. Its NOPAT, on the other hand, declined from -$8 million to -$83 million.Cloudflare’s mounting losses raise a key concern. Despite rapid top line growth, the company does not appear to have achieved any economies of scale. As Figure 2 shows, Cloudflare’s cost of revenue, sales and marketing, research & development, and general and administrative expenses all grew faster than revenue in 2018.Figure 2: Cloudflare’s Expenses Growing Faster than Revenue: 2018 vs. 2017(Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings)Part of the large increase in general and administrative expense comes from unusually high stock-based compensation expense recorded as part of a secondary stock sale, as well as IPO preparation in 2018, but these factors don’t explain all of the increase. The company disclosed that general and administrative headcount increased by 63% last year.Through the first six months of 2019, cost of revenue, sales and marketing, and research & development expenses continued to grow faster than revenue. Only general and administrative grew slower due to the unusual expenses in 2018, but it still represented 25% of revenue compared to 15% in 2017.It’s not abnormal to see early-stage companies such as Cloudflare spending heavily on marketing and R&D. What is highly unusual is the fact that the company’s cost of revenue and general and administrative costs, which should theoretically benefit from scale, are also growing rapidly. The company will need to find a way to reverse these trends in order to achieve profitability.Cloudflare’s relationship with the giants of the tech world could play a major role in determining its future. Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and IBM Corp. (IBM) all have major cloud platforms, and all but AMZN currently partner with Cloudflare. Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and IBM Cloud integrate Cloudflare into their platforms to deliver its services to their customers.However, Cloudflare notes in its S-1 that these partnerships may be temporary. On page 143, it writes:It seems unlikely that these tech giants will want to rely on a third-party for key elements of their cloud platform over the long term. This disclosure from Cloudflare clearly suggests the company expects GOOGL, MSFT, and IBM to try to replicate its services in-house before too long.Alternatively, any of those companies could be a potential acquirer. An acquisition would allow these large public cloud providers to more fully integrate Cloudflare’s technology into their platforms, while simultaneously denying that technology to key competitors. In the race to dethrone Amazon’s AWS as the dominant cloud platform, that technological edge could prove decisive. Cloudflare’s $3.2 billion market cap would be little more than a drop in the bucket for any of those companies.While an acquisition could be good for investors, Cloudflare’s poor corporate governance could derail it. The company plans to go public with a dual-class share structure that will give shares held by insiders and early investors 10 times the voting rights of the shares sold to the public. As a result, executives and directors will control 66% of the voting power in the company, preventing public shareholders from having any say in corporate governance.This dual-class structure could allow executives to block a potential acquisition that would be in the best interest of shareholders simply because they want to remain in charge.When we use our dynamic DCF model to analyze the future cash flow expectations baked into the midpoint of the IPO price range, we find that Cloudflare must achieve impressive growth and profitability in order to justify its expected valuation.As noted above, Cloudflare’s prospects for profitability as a standalone entity seem poor, so it makes more sense to analyze the company’s potential value to an acquirer.To justify GOOGL paying the midpoint of its IPO range of $11/share, Cloudflare must achieve 18% NOPAT margins - equal to GOOGL and up from its current margin of -43% - and grow revenue by 30% compounded annually for 8 years. See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario. These expectations are even higher as NET rose in its trading debut.If Microsoft acquired Cloudflare, and the company achieved Microsoft’s NOPAT margin of 30% while maintaining the same growth rate, the stock is worth $18/share today, a 67% upside to the midpoint of the IPO price range. See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario. This upside is now less as NET rose in its trading debut.While these scenarios suggest the company could justify or even exceed its IPO valuation, it relies on acquisitions, which may never materialize, to significantly boost margins. If Cloudflare doesn’t get acquired, it becomes much harder to see how this company creates value for its IPO investors.As investors focus more on fundamental research, research automation technology is needed to analyze all the critical financial details in financial filings. Below are specifics on the adjustments we make based on Robo-Analyst1 findings in Cloudflare’s S-1:Income Statement - We made $8 million of adjustments, with a net effect of removing $4 million in non-operating expense (2% of revenue). You can see all the adjustments made to NET’s income statement here.Balance Sheet - We made $115 million of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of $27 million. The most notable adjustment was $44 million in operating leases. This adjustment represented 19% of reported net assets.

4310120,99986,2019-12-02T15:04:12-05:00,"Cloudflare had its IPO debut earlier this year and reported its first quarter as a public company early last month.The company saw gross margins of 79% for Q3 2019, and revenue growth up 48% year-over-year.While the company continues have strong growth for a small-cap software name, its valuation is beginning to get a little expensive.Based on this, I believe investors anxious to own Cloudflare would be wise to be patient for a pullback rather than chasing the stock above $20.00.","It was a rocky third quarter for IPOs, with the Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO) down 11%, well below the S&P-500's (NYSEARCA:SPY) 1% return. Cloudflare (NET), unfortunately had its IPO in this period, but managed to buck the trend of sluggish performance of unprofitable software offerings like Slack (WORK), and Crowdstrike (OTC:CRWD). Cloudflare has so far returned 7% from its IPO opening price and is now up 20% off of its October lows. A strong Q3 report helped this performance, with 48% revenue growth year-over-year as well as exceptional gross margins of 79%, up 80 basis points on a sequential basis. While Cloudflare certainly provides a unique offering to the Software group (IGV), the company's valuation is beginning to get a little ahead of itself. For this reason, I believe the name is one worth keeping a close eye on, but I feel a better entry will present itself for those that are patient.(Source: TC2000.com)Cloudflare is one of the newest names to make its debut in the Software IPO arena, and currently carries a market cap just shy of $6.0 billion. The company was founded in 2010, and is an Internet security, performance and reliability software company based out of San Francisco. Cloudflare, like many other service as a software companies, benefits from roughly 100% of its revenue coming from a subscription-based model. The company released its newest product in Q3, Magic Transit, with the ability to protect against DDos attacks, as well as several other virtual network functions. The company's other offering, which has gained substantial traction is Workers.  One of Workers's key functionalities is that it gives companies that on-board Cloudflare the ability to write their own custom code for specific-use cases. This allows a company the capability to then route requests between new cloud deployments and their existing legacy infrastructure. Thus far, the company's products are certainly in high-demand. As of the end of Q3, Cloudflare had 10% of the Fortune 1000 as paying customers, and 77% paid customers worldwide, up 26% year-over-year. Let's take a closer look at the company's growth metrics below:Beginning with revenue, Q3 revenue came in at $73.9 million, up 48% year-over-year and just over 9% growth sequentially. This is roughly in line with the past three quarters, where sequential revenue growth has averaged 10.5%. Most impressive was the company's gross margins for Q3, which came in at 79%, an 80-basis point increase sequentially from the 78.2% reported in the most recent quarter. Notably, this is more than 300 basis points above the mid-point of Cloudflare's long-term target of 75-77% gross margins. Finally, net-retention rate came in at 111%, which is pretty much in line with the indsutry average. As the below chart I've built shows, quarterly revenues continue to grow at a steady pace. Based on Q4 estimates of $81.2 million, we should see another quarter of roughly 10% growth sequentially, a new quarterly record the company.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Chart)Moving over to annual earnings per share [EPS], Cloudflare is not yet profitable, but net losses per share continue to narrow. Annual EPS for FY-2019 is expected to come in at (-) $0.50, with annual EPS for FY-2020 expected to narrow to (-) $0.20. This is a relatively mild loss for the company and is not much of a drag at all, considering the company's nearly $600 million cash balance currently. If we look out further to FY-2021, the company is still not expected to be profitable, but we should see net losses narrow even further to (-) $0.18. In summary, while Cloudflare does not yet have positive EPS, this figure is at least trending in the right direction, and we could potentially see profitability by FY-2022.The only real negative in the Q3 earnings report was sales and marketing expenses, which grew 68% year-over-year, 2000 basis points above the Q3 revenue growth rate of 48%. It's clear that Cloudflare is ramping up its effort on the sales and marketing side, but it would be ideal to see revenue growth outpacing this or at least seeing a little tighter spread vs. the 2000 basis points seen in the most recent quarter.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Chart)If we move over to revenue growth rates, the life-blood of any new growth company, we can see that Cloudflare has exceptional growth rates, with average revenue growth of 47% since Q1 2018. While this is extremely impressive, the deceleration expected as we head into 2020 is not ideal. Q4 2019 revenue estimates are forecasting 47% growth year-over-year based on estimates of $81.2 million, but Q1 2020 and Q2 2020 estimates are currently forecasting pretty material deceleration. Revenue estimates for Q1 2020 are for $862 million, which would translate to 40% growth year-over-year, while revenue estimates for Q2 2020 are for $94.2 million, growth of only 39% year-over-year. It's important to note that deceleration is normal for any growth company, but that stocks can run into selling pressure when material deceleration rears its head. I would define material deceleration as a 500 basis point or larger slowdown on a sequential basis.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Table)If we look at Q1 2020 revenue estimates of $86.2 million, this will mark a 700 basis point deceleration, and this is also expected to affect the two-quarter moving average (white line). The blue line in the below chart represents the quarterly growth rate, while the white line represents the two-quarter average. I like to use a two-quarter average for revenue growth rates as it helps to smooth out any lumpy quarters and better dictates the overall trend. As we see from the below chart, the two-quarter average is expected to drop from 48.5% to 39.5% between Q3 2019 and Q2 2020. This is a bit of a red flag from a deceleration standpoint unless these analyst estimates end up being far too conservative.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Chart)While it is important to note that estimates are not set in stone, Cloudflare is going to need to deliver exceptional growth above forecasts to prevent any material deceleration. To avoid this, we are going to want to see a minimum of $87.9 million for Q1 2020 revenue, which would require a beat of $1.7 million vs. current estimates. This is quite reasonable and is certainly doable with a strong Q1 2020 report. It's worth noting that the company beat revenue estimates by $2.0 million in their most recent quarter, so it's possible analyst estimates are erring on the side of conservative. In summary, Cloudflare has put up robust revenue growth rates, but investors are going to want to see some reasonable beats vs. estimates heading into the next few quarters. We already see sequential revenue growth rates sliding from low double-digits to high single-digits in Q3 2019, and a drop to mid-single-digits would not be ideal if expenses keep up at the pace they are running at currently. While deceleration is not a deal-breaker, it can provide a headwind, especially when Cloudflare is now quite pricey for a sub 50% sales growth company. As we can see from the below image, Cloudflare is currently trading at 20.0x enterprise value to sales, and just below 23.0x price to sales on a trailing-twelve-month basis. This is based on a current market cap of $5.9 billion and $258.5 million in revenues over the past four quarters. While a revenue multiple of 22.8x is not exorbitantly high, it isn't cheap by any means for a company with the potential for a continued slowdown in its revenue growth rates. As a comparison, Docusign (DOCU) is currently seeing acceleration in its revenue growth rates and also in the 40% revenue growth range, but is trading at a 15.0x revenue multiple. It's also important to note that Docusign benefits from already being profitable, with 50% growth in EPS expected next year. (Source: Koyfin.com)(Source: Koyfin.com)If we move over to a daily chart of Cloudflare, we can see that the stock is currently trying to build a stage-1 base since its IPO debut, with support at $15.50, and resistance near $22.00. Given Cloudflare's already pricey valuation, I would view any rallies towards the $22.00 level as selling opportunities, or at a minimum, a spot to book some partial profits. While Cloudflare can undoubtedly grow into its valuation and shed some of this revenue multiple in the next few quarters based on 40% growth rates, it is expensive at current levels.(Source: TC2000.com)To summarize, Cloudflare is an emerging new company in the Software space with incredible growth in its customer space, as shown by the metrics in the Q3 call. Still, a combination of deceleration in revenue growth and a lofty valuation make the stock unattractive at current levels. I believe that any further rallies towards the $22.00 level are an opportunity to take some profits, and I would view the stock as quite overvalued if it made new highs before March. While anything is possible and a strong market could keep the relentless bid under Cloudflare we've seen over the past month, I do not believe that it's wise to chase the stock above the $20.00 level. Patience seems like the right move here, and over-paying for any stock rarely ever pays off, especially in an expensive market."
4291904,25120,2019-09-16T17:14:45-04:00,"Cloudflare joins the ranks of successful tech IPOs this year driven by strong growth and a large market opportunity.Investors like the growth of the company and the potential, yet expectations are very high.I am very cautious here despite the promise, not seeing a solid risk-reward here.","Cloudflare (NET) has gone public in an offering which was welcomed by investors. This came despite the strong pricing action seen in the weeks ahead of the IPO and the hiked initial offering price. The company touts great growth opportunities and does deliver on impressive sales growth, yet this cannot convince me to chase the shares at high valuation multiples, resulting from the strong pricing action and the opening day gains.Cloudflare has been founded to capitalise on the opportunities provided by the internet, but more so by the cloud. On the one hand, on-premise hardware and software are moving into the cloud and data centres, creating more efficient usage of those resources. On the other hand, this results in more complex and heterogeneous infrastructure environments. This means that Cloudflare is aiming to lead the transition from these more complex environments in terms of architectural network layers into simpler networks.The company has developed two major applications which is the network flywheel and product flywheel. The typical band-aid boxes used at the moment are no longer sufficient, given the complexity and latency issues caused by such fixes. The network flywheel is a network architecture solution being flexible and scalable, while the product flywheel leverages the network by easily deployable products.The company claims that 10% of the Fortune 1000 companies are a client of Cloudflare and that growth comes from its disruptive business model, ease of use, integrated offering and trust, among others.Cloudflare initially aimed to sell 35 million shares in a range between $10 and $12 per share. Solid demand made that the preliminary offering range was raised to $12-14 per share as final pricing was set as high as $15 per share. At this level, the company is generating $525 million in gross proceeds in connection to the public offering.The 293.3 million shares outstanding following the offering value equity of the company at $4.4 billion. Operating with $125 million in net cash ahead of the offering, I peg net cash holdings comfortably above the $600 million mark, implying that operating assets are valued at $3.8 billion.For the year 2016, the company generated nearly $85 million in sales on which it reported operating losses of $17 million. Revenues rose 59% to $135 million in 2017 as operating losses narrowed to $10 million. Revenues were up nearly 43% in 2018 to nearly $193 million, although operating losses exploded to $85 million. The combination of slower revenue growth and real deleverage on the bottom line is quite disappointing in my book.For the first six months of 2019, sales were up 48% compared to the year before and totalled little over $129 million, marking a modest growth acceleration from the results reported for all of 2018. Operating losses increased by 18% to $37 million, still being a sizeable amount of course. On the other hand, relative losses come down as the strong net cash holdings provides real comfort.Second quarter sales were up 49% to more than $67 million with losses flat compared to the year before, as sales run at a rate of $270 million. With operating assets valued at $3.8 billion, multiples are fairly elevated at 14 times revenues with growth approaching 50%.With shares having risen 20% to $18 and change on their opening day of trading, the operating asset valuation has risen to $4.7 billion, showing that valuation multiples have expanded to 17 times sales, elevated by all means.Do not get me wrong. The emergence of the cloud shows that there are many moving parts for all players involved, including network architecture infrastructure. Cloudflare aims and claims to be one of the major beneficiaries of this, yet for outsiders, it is hard to judge which platform/solution will be the long term winner in these developments.In my book, the 17 times sales multiple is the reason why I am cautious with growth coming in around 50%. Other risks include the simple fact that it is hard to see which company will become the dominant player in this field and the reported losses. Of course, the losses are no longer the major concern, given the funds raised with the IPO.In August, I last looked at Fastly (FSLY) which is a competitor of Cloudflare as I concluded to have a neutral stance on the shares of $17, although those shares have risen to $30 in the past month on the back of enthusiasm regarding the IPO filing of Cloudflare and aggressive buyer of its stock. At $17, those shares traded at 7 times sales although revenue growth in the mid-thirties is a bit lower than Cloudflare of course, with Fastly actually being just a little smaller compared to Cloudflare.Nonetheless, I continue to be cautious on the prospects for both firms despite the promise of their end markets, as both names trade at valuation multiples which look reasonable if they would represent earnings multiples, yet the trouble is that they represent sales multiples. As such, it is obvious that this creates sky-high expectations for Cloudflare and Fastly to deliver upon."
4292518,102101,2019-09-19T13:46:29-04:00,"Cloudflare's IPO is getting oversubscribed. Now is the time to get in.Cloudflare's diversification into other web security solutions will provide the needed cushion to take on bigger competitors.I believe in Cloudflare's game plan, though I'll be wary of moves from competitors going forward.","Cloudflare (NET) provides security, performance, and site reliability solutions for enterprises across the globe. Like its peer Fastly (NYSE:FSLY), it faces stiff competition from the trifecta of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), and Amazon (AMZN) that need to own the performance and reliability market of the internet traffic they generate in order to deliver a better return on ad spend for their advertisers by providing users with improved website browsing experience on their platform.However, unlike Fastly, Cloudflare is diversified by offering solutions in adjacent security segments. This will help Cloudflare stay competitive without feeling the full effect of the competitive onslaught that is coming. This will also help Cloudflare improve its pricing and average revenue per customer. Given its current market cap of $5 billion; if management continues to execute this, I believe we have more room for the valuation to expand.At first thought, the performance and reliability market looks like every other tech niche where these tech giants dabble to see what sticks. However, on taking a closer look, it appears this is a more serious market than imagined. All three tech giants make a significant portion of their revenue from advertising. To drive improved browsing experience, which will, in turn, drive conversions and marketing success for their customers, improving page load speed is critical.Source: CloudflareThis explains the reason Akamai (AKAM) lost Facebook, Amazon, Google, and some other big clients. These tech giants have all built proprietary CDN solutions. Given that, combined, these giants generate a sizable portion of overall internet traffic, it's not hard to fathom why they made this move.While small and niche CDN players like Cloudflare continue to win mid-market enterprises, there is a strong incentive for large enterprises to go with these tech giants. For example, media outlets which generate a significant portion of their traffic from Google will not think it twice before opting for Google as their choice CDN partner. It just makes logical sense. This includes the likes of the Washington Post, the New York Times, CNN, and other news aggregators.Brands with a significant presence on Facebook and brand awareness marketing objectives will also be tempted to go with Facebook. The same goes for Amazon. Brands that have some of their cloud assets on AWS won't think twice before sticking with Amazon. This significantly dilutes the pricing power of neutral players like Cloudflare and Fastly.Like Akamai has done, Cloudflare will have to rely on other services like cloud security to diversify. It's clear Cloudflare is already at a pricing disadvantage before the IPO. As a result, investors should get in when valuation is still cheap. Most SaaS and tech plays tend to be oversubscribed.Source: CloudflareCloudflare currently offers other cloud security services such as DDoS protection, WAF, network firewalls, bot management, and DNS security. While there are a lot of competitors who offer these services, I'm not worried about them as it's only logical and cost-effective to get your web security solutions from your CDN provider. Also, from a technical and security standpoint, it helps improve threat intelligence and data analysis. I expect Cloudflare to cross-sell and upsell its offerings using this rationale.Other services are more spelled out in its IPO prospectus; however, these are the notable mentions. Providing these added services is a good way for Cloudflare to showcase the full capabilities of its technologies while cross-selling to existing clients. It also helps to upsell clients who are on a free version of any of its solutions. Cloudflare's strengths lie in reliability and performance. This includes its services such as intelligent routing, load balancing, and site optimization.Cloudflare has clearly learned from Akamai's mistakes, and that's why its strategy has been to serve the broadest security TAM possible from the ground up. Some of its notable clients include Adobe (ADBE), The FBI, and IBM (IBM).Cloudflare valued the total addressable market of all its offerings at $31.6 billion using data from IDC. This is expected to grow to $47.1 billion by 2022. The company also stated its desire to develop new products to expand its TAM.According to its prospectus:Cloudflare is on track to record revenue of $300 million in 2019. Cloudflare has a gross margin of 77% (driven by facilities and equipment cost for its global cloud platform), which is way better than Fastly (55%). Cloudflare recorded a loss of $36.8 million (-29% margin) in the first half of the year. The bulk of the losses can be attributed to operating expenses ( 106% of revenue) driven mostly by growth in headcount, marketing, and research.Cloudflare has a healthy balance sheet with cash and cash equivalents of $42 million and marketable securities of $82 million driving the larger part of its assets. It carries no debt on its balance sheet. It has contractual obligations to the tune of $103 million. This includes long-term commitments for bandwidth usage and co-location with various networks and internet service providers as well as lease obligations.It generates negative free cash flow driven by negative cash flow from operations and capital expenditure of $18.9 million. Cash flow from operations was driven by negative net income of $36.8 million adjusted for non-cash charges of $20.1 million and net cash inflow of $4.1 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities.Source: CDNPerfCloudflare's pricing is free to moderate and that makes me worry about how much the average deal size will help grow revenue. Though, like Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), the advantage this strategy offers is a large market share. However, when you check the list of CDNs ranking alongside Cloudflare on CDNPerf, Cloudflare doesn't quite have the kind of market moat that Shopify has. As a result, I will be cautious when its valuation starts to bother on the overbought territory.Given the level of competition and limited pricing power in the CDN space, Cloudflare might not enjoy the lofty valuation multiple that has returned significant value for some other SaaS plays. Though the tech sector is in hot demand, I will be wary if valuation gets overheated as competition from tech giants will keep delaying Cloudflare's path to profitability. As it stands, its approx. $5 billion post-IPO market cap is bordering on the overvalued."

These technologies are particularly relevant for enterprise environments with sensitive information by keeping security threats separate from the user's device.Management is headed by co-founder and CEO David Harnett, who was previously a General Manager at Microsoft and Business Development Director at Experts Exchange.S2 offers a number of configurations of its flagship NetBox software for various environments and use cases.According to a 2018 market research report by Market Research Media, the market for browser as a service technologies is expected to reach $10 billion by 2024.This represents a forecast CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of a very strong CAGR of 30% from 2019 to 2024.The main drivers for this expected growth increased threat dispersion across enterprise and government workforces and improved technology offerings via content delivery networking and hybrid cloud deployments.Cloudflare disclosed the acquisition price and terms as $21.9 million in cash and 948,501 shares of its Class A common stock for total consideration of $39.2 million.Management didn’t provide a change in financial guidance as a result of the transaction.A review of the firm’s most recent published financial results indicate that as of September 30, 2019 Cloudflare had $647.5 million in cash and short term investments and total liabilities of $99.4 million, with no long-term debt and unearned revenue accounting for $30.6 million of those liabilities.Free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was a negative ($61.4 million).In the past 12 months, Cloudflare’s stock price has risen 28% since its IPO in mid-September 2019 vs. the U.S. S&P 500 Index’ 9.50%, as the NET chart indicates below:Source: Seeking AlphaBelow is a table of relevant capitalization and valuation figures for the company:Source: Company FinancialsNET acquired S2 to add its anti-phishing and brand monitoring capabilities to its Cloudflare Gateway system, which is a component of its Cloudflare for Teams offering.As Amit Mital, former CTO of Symantec stated in the deal announcement,With the new technology, Cloudflare expects that it ‘will be able to protect endpoints from zero-day vulnerabilities without sacrificing speed, website compatibility, or user experience.’While we don’t know S2’s revenue run rate, the acquisition was likely valued on a ‘team and technology’ basis.Cloudflare’s stock has performed in a volatile manner since its IPO pricing at $15.00 in September, 2019, with periods down as much as 20%.In its most recent conference call, the firm’s dollar-based retention came in at 111%, similar to previous results, and indicates the firm is continuing to sell existing customers on more of its services - generating negative net churn which is a good thing for subscription-based companies.Revenue growth continues at around 48%, although the next earnings call will provide more details on whether NET is maintaining this growth level.Its operating margin has been improving, up more than 300 basis points for the most recent reporting period, although still a negative 25%.So, the deal for S2 won’t necessarily move the needle on NET’s stock price in the near term, but the firm is using its balance sheet to acquire the technologies its needs to continue building out its suite of offerings enterprises.Given the firm’s growth trajectory, retention rate and improving operating margin (while still negative), my bias on NET is BULLISH."

A MarketsandMarkets report expects the global cyber security market to grow at a CAGR of 9.8% to reach $170.21 billion by 2020. CloudFlare (FLARE), which entered the billion-dollar club in 2012, expected to go public in 2017. But with the current turmoil in the market, it has delayed its plans.CloudFlare's OfferingsSan Francisco-based CloudFlare was founded in 2009 by Harvard students Michelle Zatlyn, Matthew Prince and their friend Lee Holloway. It is an online service that helps improve website performance while ensuring security. Web traffic for CloudFlare's customers is routed through their intelligent global network that automatically optimizes the delivery of web pages so visitors can get the fastest page load times and best performance.Instead of following the traditional method of getting organizations to set up firewalls or intrusion-prevention hardware, CloudFlare offers less expensive solutions over the cloud. Today, CloudFlare has a team of 200 operating a network in over 60 cities and 30 countries. It delivers nearly 1 trillion page views per month across 4 million Internet properties. It recently entered the Chinese market through a partnership with Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and has a presence in over 15 Baidu data centers in China.CloudFlare's FinancialsCloudFlare operates on a freemium subscription-based model. The basic package is available for free and comes with features such as a fast site performance, broad security protection and statistics about site visitors. For a professional, the service is available at $20 per month and offers additional features such as mobile optimization, real-time statistics and web application firewall. Organizations can opt for business packages which start at $200 per month and go up to $5,000 per month. The highest priced option comes with enhanced services such as an advanced denial of service attack mitigation, 100% uptime guarantee, dedicated solutions engineer, 24/7 phone support and multi-user access.Within three years of releasing its product, the company was seeing growth of 450% annually and adding over 5,000 new clients a day. It was trending at revenues of $40 million for 2014 and nearly 5% of its 2 million websites are paying customers. It has been profitable since 2014 and has a gross margin of 75%. Its customers include Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO).It has been venture funded so far, with $182 million in funding from investors, including Greenspring Associates, New Enterprise Associates, Pelion Venture Partners, Union Square Ventures, Venrock, Baidu, Fidelity Management, Qualcomm Ventures, Microsoft, and Google Capital. Its last round of funding was held in September 2015 when it raised $110 million at an undisclosed valuation. An earlier round in December 2012 for $50 million valued the company at more than $1 billion.In 2015, cyber security was considered one of the hottest sectors and received funding of $3.3 billion, up from $2 billion in 2014. However, the sector has cooled down now, and the valuations of several cloud and security companies has tumbled. The stock price of Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD), which went public in July 2015, has fallen by 50% to $13.73. Fidelity recently marked down CloudFlare's valuation by 30.55%. Following these developments, CloudFlare says it is more likely to take 36 more months to go public.Analysts say the cyber security sector is ripe for consolidation. Cyber security is a key concern for companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM (NYSE:IBM). IBM last month announced its plans to acquire Resilient Systems, which sells an incident response platform. Is CloudFlare an acquisition target for Microsoft, which incidentally is also one of its investors?"

NET’s dollar-based retention rate is 111% for the most recent period and has been over 100% for the previous seven quarters.A rate of more than 100% means that the firm is earning a ‘negative net dollar churn rate,’ or generating more revenue from the sale cohort of customers over time, which is excellent and indicates the firm’s products and services are gaining increasing traction within its customer base.The market opportunity for the company’s various services is large and growing quickly, although the competition is keen to pursue opportunities as well.Still, Cloudflare is growing revenue at a much faster rate than the markets it competes in, indicating the firm is taking market share at a fast rate.As to valuation, management is asking investors to pay an enterprise value of $3.1 billion, for an EV/Revenue of 13.22x, more than 2.5x competitor Akamai’s EV/Revenue.Cloudflare is growing at a much faster rate than AKAM, but on a much smaller base.While the firm has reduced its negative operating margin somewhat, it hasn’t made much progress toward operating break-even.So, the IPO appears somewhat overvalued, although I appreciate Cloudflare’s strong revenue and gross profit trajectory.For investors with a ‘risk-on’ approach, the NET IPO may be one worth reaching for.However, given overall stock market volatility and the pricey IPO valuation management is asking for, I won't be participating in this IPO.Expected IPO Pricing Date: September 12, 2019."

The company does not report positive FCF, which most value investors will not appreciate. With that, growth investors will appreciate this name. They will not worry about the company's losses if revenue growth continues at the same level. The only risks that we see on this name are the dual-class structure and the enormous stakes owned by the founders.Source: ProspectusSource: ProspectusFounded in 2009, Cloudflare offers a cloud platform providing different services to business clients all over the world.Source: Company's WebsiteBy sending their systems to the cloud, Cloudflare's customers reduce complexity and expenses besides obtaining secure, scalable, easy-to-use technology.See below for information on the solutions and products offered by Cloudflare:Source: Company's WebsiteSource: Company's WebsiteIn the chart below, investors can see the meteoric billing growth of Cloudflare. Notice that the company's revenue growth increased as the company increased the number of solutions sold. Besides, note that Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Baidu (BIDU) and Qualcomm (QCOM) appear in the image. These companies don't seem to be current shareholders of the company but had some agreement with Cloudflare. The market will appreciate it. There is no information about these agreements in the prospectus.Source: ProspectusNotice that the company works with very different industries including gaming, SaaS, Media and Entertainment, and Public Sector among others. Besides, it is worth mentioning that some of the company's clients are well-known corporations, universities like Yale, and state agencies like the FBI. With the FBI sharing information with Cloudflare, most investors will be willing to trust their money to the company.Source: ProspectusThe company is targeting different IT markets, including VPN, web security, distributed denial of service (DDoS) prevention, advanced threat prevention (ATP), and WAN technology. Using market intelligence information from IDC, corporate clients spent $31.6 billion in those solutions in 2018 and could spend 49% more in 2022. Cloudflare is operating in a growing market, which is ideal. If the company does not perform, it should grow as much as the market does.The company's revenue growth is quite impressive. Growth investors will most likely appreciate this name. Cloudflare reported revenue growth of 42% and 59% in 2018 and 2017 respectively. In the six months ended June 30, 2019, the company reported 48% revenue growth, which means that revenue growth could continue in 2019. The gross profit margin of 77% is also massive. See below for more on the top line of the P&L:Source: ProspectusWith that, value investors will not appreciate this name. In 2018, the company reported a loss of $87 million, 8x more than that in 2017. Also, the company does not expect to become profitable soon. Development costs and operating expenses will increase soon:The company's FCF is also not favorable. In 2018, the company reported FCF of -$68 million with CFO of -$43 million and $27 million in stock-based compensations.Source: ProspectusWith this in mind, let's review for a second the company's marketing expenses. As shown in the image below, Cloudflare increased its marketing expenses by 52% and 54% in 2018 and 2017 respectively. Revenue grew by more than 50% in 2017 and 2018. However, most market participants will wonder whether the company could achieve the same revenue growth without expending so many millions in marketing. The company is far from reaching its break-even point. It is very difficult to assess when the company will commence to be profitable. Besides, the company's rapid revenue growth may not be indicative of future performance. If the company does not invest in marketing, revenue growth will most likely decline.Source: ProspectusWith an asset/liability ratio of 3.7x, Cloudflare has a stable financial situation. The most appealing is that the company owned, in June 2019, $42 million in cash and $82 million in marketable securities. Keep in mind that investors are usually willing to give money to companies that already have money. The image below offers further details on the matter:Source: ProspectusOn the liability side, it is very favorable that the company has almost no financial debt. Also, the total amount of deferred revenue is small, $26 million, which means that the company gets paid faster than other competitors in the same industry. Most cloud providers sold shares in Wall Street, reporting a large amount of deferred revenue. The image below offers further information on the matter:Source: ProspectusThe list of contractual obligations is also not worrying. It is shown below. The company needs to pay a total of $105 million. However, it will have to pay less than $34 million each year. Taking into account the total amount of cash and the company's gross profit, Cloudflare will be able to pay its contractual obligations.Source: ProspectusCloudflare expects to use the proceeds to finance its working capital and capital expenditures along with other general corporate purposes. The company has not provided a lot of information in the prospectus. As shown in the text below, the text explaining the use of proceeds appears to be boilerplate text:Source: ProspectusThe following companies compete with Cloudflare:As shown in the image below, most competitors trade at 1.1x-7x sales with revenue growth of 3% to 51% and gross profit margin of 41% to 89%. See the images below for further details on the financial figures of competitors:Source: YchartsSource: YchartsSource: YchartsWith 42% revenue growth and 77% gross profit margin, Cloudflare should be trading at 5x - 7x sales. Bear in mind that it grows revenue at a larger pace than most competitors and has a decent gross profit margin. In our view, after the IPO, 4x sales would represent a trading opportunity for Cloudflare.In 2018, Cloudflare reported revenue of $192 million and revenue growth of 42%. Thus, forward revenue of $272 million appears conservative. With a ratio of 5x - 7x sales, Cloudflare will most likely have an enterprise value between $1.360 and‬ $1.904 billion‬. In our opinion, an enterprise value of $1 billion would represent a clear buying opportunity.Cloudflare, Inc. sold shares to well-known institutional investors, which other investment funds will appreciate. If others have performed due diligence on the company, it will be easy to convince new investors.With that, directors control more than 50% of the total amount of shares before the IPO. They have class B shares. Following the completion of the IPO, each share of Class B common stock will have the right to ten votes per share. As a result, the founders will be able to influence any critical decision inside the organization. If the management does not perform, it may be difficult to change it. The lines and the image below offer further information on the matter:Source: ProspectusSource: ProspectusWith that, it is very beneficial that the company has an independent Board of Directors. At least, the Board is independent before the IPO goes live:Source: ProspectusGiven that directors and founders own a significant amount of shares, market participants will study their trading behavior carefully. They will have to wait six months to sell equity. After the lock-up period, if they commence selling shares, the market will not like it. In this case scenario, the share price may decline quite a bit. The lines below offer further information on the lock-up period:Source: ProspectusIn 2018, the company had a free cash flow of -$68 million and net income losses of -$87 million. With these figures in mind, value investors will not be interested in Cloudflare. With that, growth investors will not care about the losses. If the company continues to report double-digit revenue growth, Cloudflare will most likely receive financing from investors.Competitors trade at 1.1x-7x sales. Cloudflare reports more revenue growth and gross profit margin than most of its peers. Thus, the company will most likely sell at 5x-7x sales and have an enterprise value of $1.360 billion and‬ $1.904 billion. In our view, with an enterprise value of $1 billion, Cloudflare is a buy.There is no reason to believe that the company could decline below $1 billion. Notice that Google, Microsoft, Baidu and Qualcomm collaborated with Cloudflare in 2015. The company seems to have connections with well-known organizations. With this in mind, it is poised to become a significant player in the cloud industry."

We think that these problems are behind us with the introduction of the New Relic One platform, which offers significant benefits of an all-encompassing view.We think that the company could revive its fortunes and the shares aren't expensive. However, short term, it is dealing with customers and potential customers facing considerable headwinds from the pandemic.We last wrote about New Relic, the APM (application performance monitoring) leader, a year ago, and quite frankly, the stock has disappointed since then, and even longer, as it happens:The stock has been basically been trading sideways in two and a half years, which is not something we'd expected. At first sight, the big decline in the share price in reaction to the Q1 2019 results (or more precisely, the guidance for the year) in August last year seems the turning point, and there is some data to back that up:Data by YChartsOperationally, the company stopped improving or even deteriorated (as for GAAP net income) in the last year or so, while revenue growth took another leg downwards from 30%+ to 20%.Data by YChartsCash flow growth slowed, but remained positive:The main reason for the disappointment was that the company was too focused on the introduction of New Relic One, which saw the light in May 2019. From the latest earnings deck:Apparently, the introduction was a complicated birth, and this led to execution problems which started to show up in the figures subsequently.But now that this introduction is in the rear-view mirror and management is aware of these execution problems, there is a good chance the company is being put back on the rails again, although the pandemic is throwing sand in the wheels here (see below). Here are the main initiatives that are making that happen:The evolution of New Relic is depicted in the following slide from the latest earnings deck:Some of the products that are recently introduced are:The AI solution goes through all the telemetry data that customers onboard on the platform and helps to reduce false alarms. This can really be a significant problem, as when something gets wrong, companies can receive thousands of alerts which in essence all stem from the same problem.The AI product sifts through that and brings it down to the essentials. So far, that seems to be working very well, as some customers have seen an 80% reduction.The Edge product with Infinite Tracing is (from Diginomica):It really cuts through the complexity by freeing customers from having to aggregate and inspect all traces. Instead, it automates the process (from company PR):Management revealed during the Q1CC that it has an exciting roadmap of upcoming products, so this isn't the last improvement we'll see. It's also necessary to keep the competitive edge the company has developed.The sales execution has been changed with new objectives like ARR, a focus on $100K+ customers and renewal yield. The process has been simplified as well as the market segmentation, and there was a lot of training as a result of the new product introductions.Once the New Relic One platform was available, management put emphasis on selling it, as platform customers use all three of its main vectors (application performance monitoring, infrastructure monitoring and log analytics).And since the last Investor Day in December 2019, there is a renewed focus on customers with an ARR of $100K+, and the company managed a decent result here with 67 new customers added in Q1 with ARR above $100K, despite demand tailing off in the last couple of weeks of the quarter.Corporate demand should be helped by the availability of New Relic One, providing a vision of APM and infrastructure and logs on a single pane of glass and even coming from the same database. The platform has multiple advantages:Indeed, this is what management argued on the Q1CC:So, management clearly has great expectations of the platform, and not without reason, as customers over $100K tend to have a higher net expansion rate and newer customers are proportionally more on the platform compared to older customers. Of the company's Q4 customers, half of the ARR is on the platform, while that figure is 1/3rd of ARR for overall customers.The impact was clear from March, as New Relic has customers in sectors that have been proportionally hit (airlines, tourism, hospitality, retail), although overall, this is a small percentage (10-15%) of its installed base.But selling cycles have trended upwards, as CapEx has been hit and some customers have asked for extended payment periods. Management has been really proactive here, coming up with a portfolio management approach that observes customer usage of the company's products as well as customer health.When risks are identified, a migration plan is set in motion, and this is repeatable so it gets more efficient over time. This obviously has an impact on ARR, but management deems it more important to preserve the long-term customer relationship.We agree here. It's basically like landlord lowering the rent or extending payment terms temporarily for customers in pandemic distress. Some smaller companies cannot even pay their bills at all.Overall though, the main drivers of New Relic - the digital transformation, the move to the cloud and the importance of operational resilience - remain in place and arguably have become more important still.Given the expected impact on upsells as well as the churn, the company's dollar net retention rate is likely to come under pressure in H1.New Relic withdrew guidance for the year and will only provide guidance for the next quarter (that is, Q1 2021), for which it expects revenue between $158 million and $160 million, non-GAAP operating income between -$3 million to breakeven and non-GAAP EPS between -$0.01 and $0.04. ARR growth is expected to be 13-14%.Management sees both a slowdown in close rates and a pick-up in churn, so Q2 figures are likely to be affected.Data by YChartsGross margin is already coming down a bit, and it will go to the high 70s in the subsequent couple of years as a result of the company sun-setting its own data centers and moving to the public cloud. This move does improve cash flow though, as it saves a considerable amount of CapEx.New Relic will keep on benefiting from its large cash position to keep investing in R&D and S&M (and even some in G&A), and will be hiring throughout the year.Data by YChartsAnalyst expect EPS of $0.13 this fiscal year (ending March 2021) and $0.43 for FY2022.The company has an iron clad balance sheet, having $805 million in cash and equivalents at the end of Q4 (up from $737 million at the end of Q3) and no debt. The share-based compensation is a substantial 16% of revenue, and this has led to considerable dilution:Data by YChartsShares are banging up an important resistance level though, and buyers might want to wait until that breaks:There are several reasons why we like the stock here:Against this are the headwinds from the pandemic, which have postponed up-sells and new customers, and the company has made some payment concessions to clients in distress."

Boxes from IBM or Dell or build-your-own depending on how cheap your CFO was. Some variant of Unix operating system or Windows NT if your CTO liked to spend his or her weekends in the office. Mail server from vendor A, file server from vendor B, an ERP system, some specialist stuff for your industry on top, all wired together with plenty of bespoke code written by an expensive consultant or the work experience kid, again depending on your CFO's wallet orientation.Well, that Dreamtime is over, if it ever existed. Today as everyone knows your plain vanilla enterprise stack is, well, raspberry ripple, rum & raisin and mint choc chip all swirled together, and worse, it all sits in various different bowls in different locations connected together by pipes of various kinds. Otherwise known as 'the hybrid cloud'. Which means some stuff at Amazon AWS, some stuff at Microsoft Azure, some stuff with Salesforce, some stuff in the basement room where Bob McShy The COBOL Guy lives and works, all interacting using something called microservices. Now, just to make things even more interesting, all users everywhere now use computers at home and in fact carry what in Bob's era would have been a supercomputer in their pocket, in the shape of their smartphone. So they all consider themselves tech-savvy and demand to be able to use all enterprise IT everywhere at all times and if something doesn't work then there is going to be A LOT OF CAPS in the internal emails to support. Enterprise IT has, in fact, become a nightmarish spaghetti puzzle.This is bad for most people but it is very good for some folks, including:The more distributed and fragmented that enterprise IT stack gets, the more you need APM software. Which then increases complexity still further. Which means ... oh you see where this is going.There are many companies that would claim part of the APM market but the key players soaking up market share are those four we name above. The market is as a result fairly concentrated and you can see the effect of that in the financials of these vendors. Each is growing, none are consuming cash in any big way (unusual in enterprise cloud software right now) and indeed DT is a prodigious producer of free cashflow.The hot stock in the above list is DDOG. It's a wonderful business with high revenue growth rates, highly visible recurring revenue and modest cash usage. We've variously been at Buy and Neutral on DDOG in our service and the stock has been good to us.DT is yesterday's hotrod but it still has some nitrous left in the bottle. Acquired in a grab-bag deal by renowned software investor Thoma Bravo, it was spun out and IPO'd in 2019, very successfully as it happens. We cover DT too and once again this name has been good to us.PD has been a mixed bag. The company has a narrow point solution built around alerting and in our opinion although the financial performance is solid it remains at an unexciting balance of modest growth and not-quite-cash-generative. The company lacks sparkle in its capital markets marketing and taking all those pieces together it's not surprising to us that the stock has yet to really shine. We've highlighted trading opportunities for this name and again we've enjoyed success with it.NEWR is relatively long in the tooth compared to the cloud hot stocks du jour. The company was established in 2008 and went public in 2014. Growing revenue at 50-60% p.a. in its early years as a public company, and consuming cash at rate of knots as a result, the business has slowed markedly in the last twelve months. Here's the slowdown in revenue growth since Q1 of the company's FY3/18.Source: YCharts, Company SEC Reports, Cestrian AnalysisThat 50-60% growth p.a. in 2015-16 has fallen to 21% p.a. on a TTM basis in the most recent quarter. Q1 of FY3/21 (the quarter ending 30 June 2020) showed growth of 15% vs. the same quarter a year back; so we expect that TTM growth rate to fall somewhat going forward. Deferred revenue growth, at 17% in the same quarter, supports that expectation.Commensurate with the slowdown in revenue growth, margins have improved. If you are spending less money chasing new customers, more revenue will fall through to the bottom line. TTM EBITDA margins stand at around 15% today vs. breakeven three years ago.EBITDA to cash conversion leaves something to be desired, mainly due to the company's degree of capitalization of spend.So at 15% TTM EBITDA margin the company sits at just 3% unlevered pretax free cash flow margin.The combination of slowing revenues and relatively low cashflow margin isn't ideal for cloud software stocks in the current environment. Here's how the stock price has moved lately.Source: TradingView.com, Cestrian AnalysisThe most recent drop came with the Q1 (quarter ending 30 June) earnings announcement and earnings call. The company declared that it was working on a substantial product revamp so that they could better interact with cloud-native enterprise applications and services; they also declared that revenue growth would remain low whilst investing in a product refresh. So the company told the market that growth will be low and cashflow margins will be low. Unsurprisingly the stock sold off.NEWR is in our view a very viable acquisition target. At yesterday's closing price of $57.35 the stock is valued at just 4.9x TTM revenue in exchange for 15% revenue growth. That makes NEWR one of the cheapest cloud stocks for its growth rate. Revenue is expected to grow a little faster than Alteryx (AYX) or Vertex (VERX) but whereas AYX trades at close to 20x TTM revenue, NEWR trades at just 4.9x.Source: Google Finance, YCharts, Company SEC filings, Cestrian AnalysisSo this is a superb set-up for a leveraged buyout by one of the usual software buyout leaders (eg. Thoma Bravo, KKR (KKR), Hellman & Friedman, etc). Low price, mid-teens growth, poor cashflow margins, company fallen from grace a little but not so far or for so long that some luster cannot be restored.Here, in a nutshell, is the LBO plan for NEWR. Observe NEWR datapoint in the matrix below. Buy company. Join board of directors. Have management move the datapoint to the right (by cutting operating costs and cutting profit leakage into working capital) and then upwards (by increasing revenue growth - by mechanical means such as price rises and contract changes, in addition to faster unit growth). Acquire a few smaller companies along the way with 100% debt funding, thus reducing the overall equity cost per unit of revenue and earnings. If the current management team prove incapable of or unwilling to deliver this plan, get a new management team. And once you have a company growing revenue at c.20%+ p.a. with pretax free cashflow margins of 15-20% - in other words when the existing management team or the new team you install have that dot move to be directly in the company of Salesforce (CRM), WorkDay (WDAY) and DT - sell the company.Source: Google Finance, YCharts, Company SEC filings, Cestrian AnalysisAnd the reason to do that is ... well look back to the first scatter plot. DT trades at a vastly higher revenue multiple. So if our buyer can get to work on NEWR and then sell it on not for the 6-8x TTM revenue that they paid (factoring in some acquisition premium), but at the 15-20x revenue multiple that DT commands; that's a great deal.The list of buyers will be long once the company is in this kind of shape. APM being the strategic battleground that it is, the final owners of this functionality are already jostling for position. Microsoft (MSFT) is cozying up to DDOG; NEWR to Amazon (NEWR's product is certified for simple deployment in the AWS environment); moreover we believe CRM will be an interested buyer in this segment, since they already acquired MuleSoft (MULE) to provide enterprise application integration functionality. IBM and others also ought to be interested. For all these reasons we believe a number of potential buyers are running the slide rule over NEWR right now.Whether a transaction takes place we don't know, of course. But a little signpost that says it might can be found here. If you scroll through the heart-warmingly retro ASCII text in that link you'll see the SEC filing wherein HMI Capital, a hedge fund with familial ties to Hellman & Friedman, and from whose windows in San Francisco you can see into the windows of Thoma Bravo, acquired 6.6% of NEWR in August this year. Now, as far as we can see, the last time HMI Capital bought 6% of a software company, it was Ellie Mae (former ticker ELLI) in November 2018. You can see that filing here. A few months later, Ellie Mae was bought out by Thoma Bravo. Who then applied the above buyout playbook - with spectacular results, as it turns out.Now, this is all probably coincidence and no doubt we are reading things here that don't exist. So let's take it back to basics regarding New Relic. Slightly faded software company. A ton of recurring revenue. 6x TTM revenue. Margins depressed. Enterprise value of $3bn or so. Perfect middle-market software buyout. End of basic analysis.In case we are wrong, we do see some downside protection in the NEWR stock chart. The stock has traded within an upward parallel channel for the last five years or so, save for a sustained breakout to the upside for about eighteen months in 2018-19, and a brief break to the downside as the Covid crisis hit. That lower parallel line you see below can, we believe, act as technical support for the stock.Source: TradingView, Cestrian Analysis.So in summary, we see upside from a potential acquisition, and a little downside protection from technical factors.All told, we rate NEWR 'Speculative Buy' and it features prominently in our M&A HitList, a new feature of our Marketplace service. We also own the stock personally with its buyout potential in mind.Cestrian Capital Research, Inc - 2 October 2020."
4375436,69905,2020-09-21T09:40:59-04:00,"New Relic's market is in high demand and rapidly expanding, although New Relic doesn't appear to be participating.Its growth rates are fizzling out at a rapid clip.Even at 5x forward sales, there's still not enough here to attract new shareholders to the stock.","New Relic (NEWR) trades for 5x forward sales.On the surface, New Relic appears to be very cheaply valued. However, the further we dig, the more challenging it becomes to find this investment attractive.New Relic was historically growing very fast, into a rapidly expanding market. However, right now, even though the market continues to expand, New Relic is being left behind, with its unattractive dollar-based new expansion rate.It will be difficult to attract new shareholder holders to this stock. Here's why:New Relic is an Application Performance Monitoring (''APM''). It allows customers to collect and analyze vast quantities of data flowing through and about their software.New Relic is well-positioned to benefit from companies' ongoing secular shift on their digital journeys.As companies are forced to digitalize and adopt cloud technologies in order to remain nimble, New Relic supports these customers by maintaining uptime and stability. Source: Fiscal Q4 2020 Investor PresentationDevelopers have demanding customers that require a rewarding online experience every time they engage with their brand, either through browsers or on mobile devices.To this end, the visibility into their software provided by the New Relic One Platform to analyze their applications and infrastructure creates the foundation for best-in-class digital experiences.Source: Shareholder Letter Fiscal Q1 2021Developers look to build attractive application experiences and through New Relic suite of products. Consequently, not only to monitor in real-time but to go beyond simply notifying teams when an issue occurs and to guide them towards what caused the issue and why.Source: author's calculations, **company guidanceMoving on, above we can see the undeniable trend that New Relic's growth rates are slowing down at a steady and consistent clip.If last year New Relic was a high growth story clocking in 30% y/y growth rates, right now New Relic just finished Q1 2021 with 15% y/y growth rates -- a marked difference.What's more, the company is guiding for 12% y/y growth rates for the quarter ahead.Even if we assume that New Relic is being conservative to allow for an easy beat next quarter, and we further conjecture that New Relic's Q2 2021 revenue growth rates reach 13% to 14% y/y revenue growth rates, we are still left with a company that has seen its growth rates halving over a period of 12 months. Moreover, right now, as many companies are supposedly benefiting from COVID and companies accelerating their digital journeys, that's clearly not benefitting New Relic.As an aside, as far as SaaS businesses go, it's highly surprising that New Relic is not able to offer investors full-year guidance. After all, one of the advantages of having a SaaS business model is to offer shareholders the predictability which investors badly crave.Source: Q1 2021 Press ReleaseAs a rough proxy for how attractive customers find New Relic's platforms we can cast our eyes on the table above where we see New Relic's ability to report high Dollar-Based Net Expansion Rates. With this important metric in mind, we can see that during Q1 2021 the figure came down from 109% in the same period a year ago, to flat 100% in Q1 2021.During the earnings call, management talked about COVID and the weaker economy playing a role and leading to its slightly underperforming. Having said that, if we compare this set of results with New Relic's close peer, Datadog's (DDOG) recently reported a dollar-based net retention rate of over 130%. This could mean that Datadog is taking market share away from New Relic, or that New Relic is having challenges in delivering strong execution in this highly very fertile environment. While investors are not being asked to pay a high multiple for New Relic, at just 5x trailing sales, this puts the stock in the bargain basement compared with many high flying Wall Street darling SaaS stocks, with many of its peers trading for north of 25x times trailing sales.For example, Datadog is being priced at 47x trailing sales, which puts New Relic's 5x trailing sales in the absurdly cheap territory.However, despite being cheap, it's not entirely without justification. In the past, I would have contended that any cheap stock, that it would only be a matter of time before investors would come to reappraise the stock at a higher multiple.However, the longer I invest, the more experience I gain, and the more I question those previous assertions of mine. Yes, stocks do mean reverse. Yes, value investing does work. But low valuation stocks don't always bounce back or at least in a timely manner.Source: SA PremiumConsider this, analysts estimate that New Relic is likely to report Q3 2021 and Q4 2021 at very close to 10% y/y growth rates. I believe this poses a problem for investors.Firstly, if those estimates are even close to accurate, that would imply a continued deceleration from the growth rates New Relic has recently reported.Secondly, investors will give a company guiding for close to 20% growth rates plenty of room for ''investing for growth strategy'' and to remain GAAP unprofitable for a prolonged period of time.However, once a company is reporting close to 10% y/y growth rates, investors will start to demand a clear path towards strong profitability. New Relic still has the shine from last year when it was growing at high 20s revenue growth rates. Consequently, for that sort of company a multiple of 5x sales is a bargain opportunity.However, it appears to be the case that New Relic may actually be eyeing up low teens growth rates in the near-term, and given that New Relic remains GAAP unprofitable, I fail to see much of a bargain opportunity here for new shareholders."
4365433,103480,2020-08-07T09:15:00-04:00,"New Relic shares have dropped off ~20% after the company reported fiscal first quarter results.Despite a strong beat to Q1 estimates (which has been rare for execution-challenged New Relic lately), negative attention zoomed in on the company's platform transition.To compete with the growing threat of Datadog, New Relic has rolled all its services under a new ""New Relic One"" platform with an added free tier.Though these wholesale changes are likely to impact near-term growth rates, we still like New Relic's deep expertise in infrastructure monitoring plus its value element.","This article was highlighted for PRO subscribers, Seeking Alpha's service for professional investors. Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.Very few hardcore enterprise software companies have reported earnings so far (due to a January year-end for most of the group), but New Relic (NEWR), the original infrastructure monitoring company that was quickly displaced by upstart Datadog (DDOG), has already emerged as one of the big losers. Despite a decent beat to Wall Street's estimates in the quarter - which, for New Relic has been rare over the past few quarters as the company works through sales execution issues, has been fairly rare - shares of New Relic peeled back ~20% in the immediate aftermath of earnings.Instead of focusing on the robust results, investors turned to the future and the risks associated with the rollout of New Relic One - an umbrella platform that now houses all of New Relic's products in an attempt to simplify and unify its sales strategy to compete with the growing Datadog threat.And indeed, in this infrastructure monitoring space it has been a dog-eat-dog world (forgive the pun). While Datadog shares have more than doubled since the start of the year on the back of incredible >80% y/y revenue growth, New Relic has been one of the few software stocks to actually decline in the year to date, logging ~15% declines as the company's revenue growth decelerated down to the mid-teens. Data by YChartsThe question for investors now: is New Relic beyond saving? Or is there reasonable hope that the company can rebound from the dip?I like New Relic for a number of reasons:What I'm getting to is that there's a strong value element for New Relic. At current post-earnings share prices of $55, New Relic trades at just a $3.36 billion market cap (less than half of all-time highs notched in mid-2018) - and after netting off $828.9 million of cash and $432.5 million of debt on New Relic's balance sheet, its enterprise value is juts $2.97 billion. Versus FY22 (calendar 2021) revenue estimates of $762.7 million for New Relic (per Yahoo Finance), the company trades at just 3.9x EV/FY22 revenues. That puts New Relic at least one turn below most other mid-teens/low 20s growth stocks. Right now, a lot of investors are concerned about New Relic's massive strategy change and platform migration onto New Relic One, and offering entirely new pricing stacks and a free tier. While it's true that these wholesale changes to go-to-market strategy can certainly produce lumpy results, I'd say that a <4x forward revenue multiple already prices in that risk.New Relic is the type of stock you have to be patient with. This year, momentum-based trades have only shot higher while penalty box stocks have remained stubbornly stuck in the shadows. But in the long run, New Relic still owns a valuable piece of technology in a hugely growing market (as demonstrated by Datadog's gaining popularity) and plus runs a business capable of producing near-breakeven profits and positive cash flows. That, to me, means the risk-reward ratio falls squarely on the side of bulls.Let's now dissect New Relic's second-quarter results in greater detail. I'll acknowledge it wasn't a perfect quarter, with some points of weakness to call out - however, I'd say the ~20% drop in share prices post-earnings more than compensates for that. The earnings summary is shown below:Figure 1. New Relic 1Q21 resultsSource: New Relic 1Q21 earnings releaseNew Relic's revenues grew 15% y/y to $162.6 million, beating Wall Street's expectations of $158.4 million (+12% y/y) by a solid three-point margin. We note, however, that New Relic has seen the same headwinds as many other backend-facing enterprise software companies have seen in the wake of the coronavirus, with revenues decelerating from 21% y/y growth in Q1 (and last year, New Relic's growth averaged around the mid-20s). Amid the remote-work surge, the priority among IT departments have been to ensure continued uptime and connectivity for all employees, as well as to continue supporting customers digitally. Backend projects like infrastructure monitoring have likely taken second fiddle in importance this year. At the same time, the increased reliance that we have placed on our digital tools have only cemented the long-term need for reliable monitoring tools. And at a time when many organizations are re-evaluating their IT stack to ensure business continuity, New Relic has decided to take the opportunity to simplify its product offering and consoldate it all under one umbrella called New Relic One.Here's a comprehensive roundup of the major product changes that New Relic is rolling out, per CEO Lew Cirne's Q1 earnings call remarks:A few thoughts here. Many investors are concerned that these radical pricing/go-to-market changes will introduce volatility, and while that assertion isn't wrong, it's near-sighted. On the open-source side, we've found that many other companies like Red Hat (now part of IBM) have continued to see success despite open-sourcing a portion of their technology. Offering a new free tier also helps to extend New Relic's sales pipeline potential, especially among smaller ""self service"" customers that New Relic may not have the sales bandwidth to prospect for proactively. New Relic is already well-represented in large organizations (several examples of large clients include the Hearst papers and tax provider H&R Block), but part of the company's new strategy is, per Cirne's commentary, ""renewed commitment to developers and startups at a grassroots level.""Of course, large platform changes will bring some underlying noise - net expansion rate in the quarter, for example, dipped to 100% (meaning neither net churn nor upsell). But I believe that once we move further past the platform migration, we will begin to see normalization.Figure 2. New Relic key metricsSource: New Relic 1Q21 earnings releaseWhile this new offering certainly introduces uncertainty into the picture, it also gives New Relic a marketing buzz and re-energizes its sales force, which is key in taking on increased competition against Datadog which has grabbed all the recent headlines.In the meantime, New Relic also continues to post strong profitability results. Pro forma operating margins remained flat at positive 5% despite the revenue deceleration, and the company's pro forma EPS of $0.15 resoundingly beat Wall Street's $0.03 target. And as shown in the chart below, New Relic's free cash flow still grew 23% y/y to $23.3 million, while FCF margins boosted one point to a respectable 14%.Figure 3. New Relic FCFSource: New Relic 1Q21 earnings releaseWith a ~20% drop in share prices and a resulting <4x forward revenue multiple, the market seems to be saying New Relic's platform transition will be ugly even though we've barely seen any results yet. I think investors can benefit from taking a contrarian position here and buying New Relic while it's still in the penalty box."
4367674,102101,2020-08-11T15:46:31-04:00,New Relic's pricing and product innovation will drive sustainable long term growth.The trend for enterprises to demand more optimization and product simplification is inevitable. New Relic's early prioritization of open-source will drive future success.The simplification of product usage and flexibility offered via its programmable platform will reduce churn while driving sustainable ARR.The current valuation offers a compelling entry point as the growth factor rebounds heading into 2021.,"Source: DevoteamNew Relic (NEWR) has grabbed the bull by the horns by redefining its competitive landscape in the coming years.New Relic's response to innovative moves from competitors includes the deployment of a series of tactics to simplify the way its brand is conceived. The bulk of these tactics were implemented over the past four quarters. The execution of these moves extends beyond coming to parity with new capabilities introduced by competitors. Therefore, expecting growth outperformance in H1'20 is asking for too much.Going forward, New Relic isn't just cleaning up its game; it is writing a new game plan which can change the way DevOps solutions are consumed in the future. By embracing open source as a growth hacking tool, it is making the customer onboarding phase of its marketing funnel as touchless as possible. Touchless lead generation and conversion are good for renewals and new logos. This will allow the sales team to focus on upselling and cross-selling new capabilities to drive ACV. The newly introduced offerings will reduce churn during product refresh. This will reduce the volatility of near term growth metrics reported during the quarterly conference calls.New Relic's conservative ARR guidance isn't supportive of its growth factor (near-term) when you consider the headwinds from COVID-19 impacting its SMB customers and clients in the hospitality vertical. Regardless, it is important to understand the long and short term implications of its new moves. In the SaaS space, solid revenue growth is how you enjoy lofty SaaS multiples when your GAAP margins are still volatile. Therefore, the rerating of valuation multiples is expected. This rerating is expected to be short lived as the ease of product consumption drives ACV.It is reassuring that New Relic is now at parity with its major competitors from a DevOps standpoint. To further differentiate, New Relic is relying on the programmability of its platform. It is also innovating with pricing. It is adopting a user-based pricing model that cleans up the inevitable consumption bloat as customers monitor more enterprise apps. This is likely the outcome of a thorough margin analysis to optimize consumption cost while driving customer lifetime value. This helps balance growth and growth sustainability as a more attractive pricing option will make customers less willing to churn.While this move is partly inevitable due to the growth of hosts and apps needed to complete and maintain modern tech projects, it also points to potential weaknesses beyond pricing that need to be examined. These weaknesses include sales execution effectiveness, product usability, and customer satisfaction. If churn stabilizes in the coming quarters, sales execution effectiveness should be analyzed in depth.The pricing update is good for IT managers who will be pushed by their CFOs to optimize the total cost of ownership of their IT tools. This trend will be a tailwind for future consumption of New Relic's offerings amongst cost-conscious enterprises. It isn't hard to fathom that enterprises care about cost, given the recent concerns about cloud usage optimization highlighted by Datadog (DDOG) during its last earnings call.Elastic (ESTC) is the closest reference when it comes to leveraging open source as a critical go-to-market strategy. Dynatrace (DT) appears to be focused on being the best of breed monitoring and observability platform. It further differentiates by bundling its capabilities to simplify consumption. Datadog (DDOG) is about granularity and coverage. App Dynamics gains from superior network monitoring capabilities due to Cisco's leadership in IT networking. Other top DevOps platform either gain from the huge salesforce or the brand advantage of their parent company. Going forward, while competitors are also embracing open source, it's not clear if they are placing as much emphasis on open source as New Relic.Another advantage of the open-source focus will come from New Relic's push for standardization. Achieving this goal will improve New Relic's brand prospect as it will be favored by developers if it succeeds in building with them. This is inevitable as these developers build the next generation of enterprise businesses.Going forward, some competitors will respond to New Relic's pricing move and its open-source innovation forays. Competitors with great product usability will be less worried as usability plugs the fear of customer churn and downgrades. Though, it appears New Relic will be challenging and redefining what passes for ""best of breed"" as it continues to work with developers. In this regard, the playing field might be leveled heading into 2021.New Relic's margins are already stretched. The pricing update has sent gross margins (GAAP) to the lower end of its long term target. Opex has also been accelerated to land large enterprise deals. Since a combination of pricing and COVID-19 headwinds will drive cash flow volatility, it is easy to understand why there was less emphasis on billings curing the last earnings. Investors have to be patient for the growth of bets around pricing to drive consumption and product stickiness. In the bull case, this will be achieved via a flurry of deals from enterprises adopting a cloud-first approach when designing their IT strategy. In the bear case, New Relic might not attract enough businesses with the potential to grow product usage to the point where New Relic benefits from margins expansion. The bearish scenario has a low probability because expanding the lead generation funnel, while simplifying the conversion journey, is like funding a million startups.The market has priced in the near term headwinds to growth. New Relic has disrupted the way DevOps products will be consumed. While all players will maintain customers, who are attracted to their unique capabilities, ""swing users"" will find a new abode in New Relic. This will drive a new era of growth. New Relic's depressed valuation is a good way to bet on this opportunity.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."

Its new go-to-market strategy will require more quarters to master. Investors should either maintain a long-term outlook or stay on the sidelines.Globalization-SaaS-Cloud-ARR-Observability-Automation-DBNERNew Relic has outperformed since it reported earnings last quarter. FY’21 heralds the beginning of the harvest of some of the investments (streamlining go-to-market toward $1 billion in revenue) planted in the previous year.New Relic now reports ARR which came in at $636m in Q4’20 (+17% y/y). ARR puts the DBNER trend in a better context. DBNER ticked up to 116% (vs. 109% in Q3’20). The uptick provides relief for investors who are worried about the churn rate of its <$100k/year customers. New Relic also reported RPO which came in at $635m (vs. $498m in Q4’19). RPO benefited from seasonality as more renewals happen in Q4.Going forward, NEWR expects ARR growth of 13-14% in Q1’21 and revenue of $158-160m. The current quarter will provide a better comparison for ARR given the tweak to ARR definition which now includes ARR from support and partners. The ARR guidance will be pulled by two levers: DBNER normalization and greenfield growth. The outcome will be driven by the percentage of existing customers who sign up for more products. Greenfield growth will boost ARR, while it will be less accretive to deferred revenue as customers demand more flexible payment options. These factors will only impact valuation in the short term. In the long run, New Relic’s revenue growth factor will be driven by ARR growth. The focus on acquiring more customers with ARR of $100k is possibly the outcome of market research that demonstrates the potential for New Relic to play in the large enterprise space. New Relic has been increasingly data-driven in recent quarters; therefore, there is little reason to doubt the feasibility of this strategy.Platform-SoR-Land & Expand-Margins-FCF-LiquidityNEWR’s brilliant land and expand strategy suffers from its huge exposure to SBM churn. New Relic's initial strategy was to grow ACV and margins by upselling/cross-selling its installed base. However, this strategy works best with small enterprises when the SaaS offering is a growth tool. NEWR’s platform is a productivity tool (reliability). As a result, churn and churn volatility impact growth metrics reported to investors. Small businesses distort revenue collection and renewal forecasts. When you do that for four quarters in a row, multiple expansion loses steam. To fix the problem, NEWR presented a new strategy during the last investor day. The strategy will drive growth in two ways:The gains from this strategy will require more reinvestment, and it will take some quarters to realize.FinancialsSource: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)New Relic's global expansion, in addition to the growth in data collected from customers, means more cloud hosting costs which might cause gross margin to fluctuate in the short term.Sales headcount growth and the incentive towards landing more mid to large enterprises will drive OPEX. The advantage of this strategy shift will reflect in RPO, billings, and operating cash flow as the mix-shift towards customers on annual payment plans grows. This will no doubt reduce churn. Investors should be prepared to stomach a short-term impact on EPS as the investments in OPEX to drive future cash flow ramp. In the short term, New Relic has enough cash on its balance sheet to meet its short-term obligations.Integrations-Acquisitions-Partnerships-International Expansion-ReviewsNew Relic has to contend with Datadog (DDOG), AppDynamics, and Dynatrace (DT) as it shifts into the large enterprise space. Dynatrace isn't relenting on adding new capabilities to its observability platform. Datadog has never had more momentum than it could have asked for. This has led to a flurry of product updates in user experience monitoring and security.New Relic's transition will be smooth given its adoption of third-party data sharing initiatives like open telemetry, and its full cloud focus. It needs to build out its partnership network to accelerate market penetration. This might explain the reason for onboarding a new CMO. The ease of deploying its APM offering meant little need to rely on partners or resellers. As it focuses on bigger accounts, partners will be needed to echo its brand in new RFPs.Network Effect-Economies Of Scale-Switching Cost-Momentum-AnalystsSource: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)There have been more upgrades than downgrades since New Relic reported earnings last month. Analysts have an average price target of $71. The bullish expectation reflects New Relic's strong product-market fit as enterprises adopt cloud platforms.Assuming New Relic can grow ARR from its installed base and new wins, its growth factor will remain attractive. This will come at a slight sacrifice to its profitability factor. The general trend towards cloud platforms will boost its momentum factor. Going forward, the numerator and denominator of New Relic's diluted EPS will reflect the impact of share-based compensation towards driving growth. In the absence of occasional sales execution issues as New Relic masters its new playbook, valuation will be in line.Besides the worry about the oversubscription to cloud stocks, investors should also watch out for execution risk. A land-and-expand strategy using a productivity tool is a bet that the installed base will increase spend as it grows. Given the volatile survival rate of small businesses, it's tough to predict future cash flow from SMBs. Upselling the installed base is only guaranteed if the underlying business models of its customers are scalable.The adoption of DevOps tools is still underpenetrated. New Relic's shift towards driving ARR requires improvement in sales efficiency. New Relic has solid momentum behind it. As a leader in the APM space, it's tough to go wrong on a long enough time scale. I'll be hesitant to play the short-term game until New Relic masters its new playbook.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."
4354491,104608,2020-06-18T10:37:18-04:00,"New Relic reported a strong Q4 with revenue growing 21% and remaining performance obligations growing 28%, both above expectations.The company provided Q1 guidance that was similar to expectations, though did not provide full year guidance, given the uncertain macroeconomic conditions.Even after the 25% post-earnings run, the stock remains attractive at only ~5.8x forward revenue, below other comparable software companies with 20%+ revenue growth and a path towards 25%+ operating margins.","Even though New Relic (NYSE:NEWR) reported strong earnings a few weeks ago and has seen their shares go up nearly 25% since then, I believe there still remains upside to the name over the long term. The company has faced challenged with their sales in 2019, which caused many investors to question to longer-term growth trajectory. However, during the recent quarter, revenue grew 21% as it appears many of the challenges are now in the past.Management provided Q1 guidance that was pretty close to expectations, though could ultimately prove to be conservative as the company remains cautious in the uncertain macroeconomic environment. However, current expectations call for ~23% growth during the year, which I believe is beatable, considering the 28% growth seen in remaining performance obligations during the quarter. This metric is a great indicator for future revenue growth, and in addition to net revenue expansion rate reaching 116% during the quarter (compared to historical range of ~110%), the company could be seeing an inflection point in the trajectory.Data by YChartsNEWR remains one of the leaders in the APM (application performance management) industry, meaning they essentially develop tools that help measure an application or software performance. Their software functions are in back-end processes, and the technicals are a bit challenging to understand. But, for most investors, NEWR is a name not well-known.When looking at FY21 revenue, the stock's current valuation implies only ~5.8x FY21 revenue, which does not seem unreasonable considering many other software companies with 20%+ revenue growth tend to trade in the 6-8x forward revenue range. NEWR does have near breakeven operating margins. However, over time, as the company continues to scale and better leverages their operating expenses, it is expecting longer-term operating margins to be 25%+.There are not many companies in the marketplace with 20%+ revenue growth with an operating margin trajectory of 25%+ that are trading below 6x forward revenue. Even with the recent 25% run since the company reported earnings, long-term investors should remain opportunistic about this name and should continue to hold in their portfolio.NEWR also has a large balance of remaining performance obligations, which are expected to translate into revenue over the next 24 months. With the RPO balance $635 million during the quarter growing 28%, the company's longer-term revenue prospects seem to remain on the rise, even if revenue and sales become challenged during the near term. After undergoing some sales transitions over the past year, the company seems poised to hit an inflection point, and long-term investors should continue to hold on.During the quarter, revenue grew 21% to $160 million, which was above expectations for ~$154 million. Impressively, the net expansion rate increased to 116%, after hovering around 110% for the past several quarters. This metric is closely followed throughout the industry as it is a great indicator on how much current customers are willing to spend.Source: Company PresentationDuring the quarter, gross margins remained at 84%, which is at the high-end of the company's 80-84% long-term operating target. Operating margins were 2%, consistent with last quarter. I believe, over time, as the company continues to grow revenue, operating margins will start to expand at an accelerating pace, leading to increased profitability and beating expectations. The stronger-than-expected revenue, combined with solid margins, led to EPS of $0.14 during the quarter, well above expectations for only $0.03.Investors seemed to be happy about the company remaining performance obligations, which I believe is a great indicator of future revenue growth. During the quarter, RPO increased 28% to $635 million, faster growth than revenue. This revenue stream is expected to be recognized over the next 24 months, which helps insulate the company's revenue growth even during challenging economic conditions.Source: Company PresentationManagement provided guidance for Q1, which includes revenue of $158-160 million, slightly below expectations for ~$161 million. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of a loss of $0.01 to a gain of $0.04, which was below expectations for $0.09.While management did not provide updated FY21 guidance, given the many uncertainties in the marketplace, the strong remaining performance obligation growth of 28% to $635 million places a theoretical floor on how low revenue growth can be.While the company is up nearly 25% since reporting earnings a few weeks ago, I believe the current valuation still undervalues the longer-term trajectory of the company. Revenue growth may be somewhat uncertain this year, given the macroeconomic headwinds, but a majority of companies in the market are uncertain where sales will end up a year from now.Over the past several quarters, valuation has come down quite a bit as investors have questioned the company's revenue growth trends and potential growth opportunities. Given the strong turnaround this quarter and solid RPO performance, I believe we may have hit an inflection point, and the company could continue their strong sales trend for many quarters to come.Data by YChartsThe company has a current market cap of ~$4.25 billion, and with cash/investments of ~$805 million and ~$425 million of debt, the company has a current enterprise value of ~$3.87 billion. While management did not provide FY21 guidance during the recent earnings report, current expectations call for ~$670 million in revenue, representing ~23% growth for the year. Using this as a replacement for guidance results in a FY21 revenue multiple of ~5.8x, which does not seem unreasonable.Because of the company's recent challenges with their sales and meeting expectations, the stock's valuation continues to trade well below peers. It is not uncommon for other software stocks with consistent 20%+ revenue growth and margin expansion opportunity to trade closer to 6-8x forward revenue. While it may take a few quarters for NEWR to see their multiple expand to that type of level, I believe the company has the right sales organization in place and right opportunities with their larger clients to maintain strong growth.While the RPO is expected to be recognized over the next 24 months, a majority of this will likely be recognized during the upcoming fiscal year. I believe the strong RPO performance during the quarter is a bullish trend on potential revenue growth over the next several quarters, despite the macroeconomic headwinds.With the stock now trading just under $70, some investors may feel like they have missed out on the post-earnings bull run. However, long-term investors should be more excited about future revenue growth remaining above 20%, which could drive valuation even high. Assuming valuation expands to become more in line with other comparable software companies, it would be possible to see the stock reach $95+ over the next year, which would still put the company below their all-time highs of ~$110.Risks to NEWR include the company reporting a weaker-than-expected quarter, which could send the shares down a lot (we have seen shares go down 20-30% in some quarters). This could cause investors to lose confidence in the longer-term model and may keep the valuation multiple from expanding, or even cause the multiple to contract."
4348463,103480,2020-05-18T11:03:25-04:00,"Shares of New Relic rocketed upward by ~10% after the company posted far better-than-feared fourth-quarter results.With all the attention showered on faster-growing Datadog recently, most investors had forgotten about New Relic's competence in the software monitoring space.Net expansion rates ticked up for the first time in three quarters, thanks to a renewed focus on sales execution.New Relic, already cash flow positive, has a goal of hitting >30% FCF margins.","The market is ready to give New Relic (NEWR) a second chance. Ever since the smaller, faster-growing competitor Datadog (DDOG) completed its IPO and leaped onto the scene, investors had discarded New Relic (a onetime Wall Street favorite) and devalued it to multiples seen in older, less relevant technologies. But with New Relic's recent fourth-quarter earnings release, the infrastructure monitoring company (whose software helps IT departments track the health and performance of their digital assets), New Relic has shown that it's still in possession of category-leading software and is still capable of executing to >20% y/y revenue growth. Post-Q4 earnings, New Relic shares leaped 10%, advancing its recovery from its March nadir below $40 to nearly 80%. Still, however, shares of New Relic are still down ~10% for the year to date (whereas most tech stocks, and the NASDAQ, are either near-flat or up since the beginning of January) and down ~40% from highs set in early 2019.Data by YChartsNew Relic has made no secret of the fact that 2019 was a challenging year for the company. Shares of New Relic started crumbling in mid-2019 due to the company uttering the dreaded words ""sales execution issues,"" that caused its ever-important net retention rates to sag after upsell rates to existing customers lagged (this metric improved for the first time in a long time in Q4, despite the coronavirus). But key for investors to note is that New Relic has addressed its issues head-on and revamped its go-to-market operations, putting in place new key heads of international growth, corporate strategy, and product - all with the intention of simplifying New Relic's core value proposition to customers and executing better on sales. The coronavirus has only highlighted how crucial products like New Relic are in a company's IT stack (Datadog's (DDOG) huge growth and ever-leaping share price is also bringing a lot of attention to the IT monitoring space, but there's plenty of greenfield market opportunity for both New Relic and Datadog. As of now, New Relic is still the company with the bigger revenue run rate). As more and more companies have relied on digital means of connecting with customers and to the workplace, tools like New Relic - which can give organizations a single pane of view into the health of underlying systems - have become more critical in ensuring IT operations run smoothly. New Relic also continues to innovate, having rolled an AI-driven product out into the market in Q4 out of beta that helps to predict and identify system anomalies. Stay long here - New Relic has room for a broad recovery rally ahead.Unlike Datadog and many other tech companies that have seen their share prices skyrocket this year, New Relic's current valuation still leaves a lot of room for expansion. At current share prices near $63, New Relic trades at a market cap of $3.79 billion. After we net off the $805.6 million of cash and $427.0 million of convertible debt on New Relic's balance sheet, we're left with an enterprise value of $3.41 billion. For the current fiscal year, meanwhile, Wall Street analysts have a consensus revenue target of $672.5 million, representing just shy of 24% y/y growth (per Yahoo Finance). That gives New Relic a current valuation of just 5.1x EV/FY21 revenue. Unfortunately there's a lack of pure sector comps as Datadog's much higher growth rate disqualifies it from comparison (though Datadog's >30x forward revenue multiple gives a good idea of how highly investors value the space). However, most other SaaS companies that are growing at a ~20% pace tend to trade at multiples in the high single digits:Data by YChartsIn my view, it wouldn't be unreasonable to see New Relic hit an 8x EV/FY21 revenue multiple (recall that prior to announcing its sales execution issues in mid-2019, New Relic at a ~30% y/y growth pace was trading at multiples in the mid-teens). An 8x multiple implies a price target of $96, and 52% upside from current levels - and still below highs seen in 2019. This should give investors plenty of comfort that New Relic's current prices leave a wide enough margin for error. New Relic's share price, obviously, has rallied in response to positive recent results - whereas consensus had converged on the idea that the coronavirus would heavily impact New Relic. Take a look at New Relic's results below:Figure 1. New Relic 4Q20 resultsSource: New Relic 4Q20 earnings releaseRevenues grew 21% y/y in the fourth quarter to $159.7 million, decimating Wall Street's expectations for $153.7 million (+16% y/y) by a huge five-point margin. The fact that New Relic's revenues showed barely any acceleration in Q3 is a validation of the company's new sales-oriented leadership and its companywide focus on sales execution since last year's missteps.One of the key underlying trends that improved significantly is New Relic's net expansion rate - whose decline last year was a major contributor to the fall in share prices. Net expansion rates are particularly a closely-watched metric in the software sector because it's far cheaper to produce an upsell to an existing customer than it is to land new business - and so strong expansion rates generally translate into margin gains. In Q4, after trending at a net expansion rate in the ~110% range over all of FY20, New Relic saw expansion jump to 116% in Q4. Now of course, we note that a Q3 to Q4 jump in expansion rate is well-documented in New Relic's history - but we weren't banking on it this time around, due to the impact of the coronavirus. It appears from these sequential trends that the coronavirus hasn't hampered New Relic's ability to sell expansion deals into its install base.Figure 2. New Relic expansion trendsSource: New Relic 4Q20 earnings releaseMike Christenson, New Relic's new COO in charge of revamping its sales org, has noted that despite the uncertainties posed by the pandemic, the company still expects improvement in sales execution through the rest of this year. Per his prepared remarks on the Q4 earnings call:One important point to note: as of the end of Q4, New Relic counted $635 million in ARR (annual recurring revenue), and expects ARR to still grow 13-14% y/y in FY21. That $635 million in current ARR alone covers ~95% of Wall Street's revenue projection for FY21 - so even though New Relic refused to provide full-year guidance, I'd say its revenue visibility is strong and the chances of deep misses to Wall Street's targets are slim.New Relic also has demonstrated a strong path to profitability. The company is already cash-flow positive - its FY20 FCF margin was 5%, but it plans over the long haul to take FCF margins up to >30%. Management noted that FY20 margins and FY21 as well will see a slight headwind this year as New Relic begins to cut down on its data centers and move toward the public cloud, but that this migration should produce a tailwind to profitability in the long haul. We like that New Relic is already above breakeven profitability and has a plan, shown below, to get to >30% FCF margins and >25% pro forma operating margins:Figure 3. New Relic long-term operating planSource: New Relic 4Q20 earnings releaseIn my view, paying only ~5x forward revenues for a company that has a nice growth/profitability balance like New Relic is a steal. We hope as well that some of investors' enthusiasm for Datadog carries over into enthusiasm for the whole infrastructure/application monitoring space - as this segment of enterprise software is still newer and relatively less competitive than areas like CRM or HCM, so there's room for a rising tide to lift all boats. Look for an entry point in New Relic."

Opex is now outpacing revenue growth, and cash flow margins have turned negative. The stock is approaching the dreaded penalty box of range-bound valuation multiples where most stocks linger for a long time become they are set free. Risk-averse investors should trim their position as another quarter of earnings miss will rewrite the narrative of the stock.While I had a bullish rating in my previous thesis, the risk-reward for short term investors is no longer favorable. New Relic is about to acquire a sentiment shift from a growth stock that deserves high valuation multiples to a laggard, which is transitioning to a mature company. While its valuation remains attractive when compared to other competitors in the DevOps niche, getting trapped in a dash for the exit if New Relic underperforms in the next quarter will be risky.Source: Author (using data from Earnings Slide)The adoption of the New Relic One platform has been less than anticipated. This is reflected in the DBNER trend. This isn't a demand weakness problem as competitors such as Datadog (DDOG) and Dynatrace (DT) have outperformed in recent quarters. I will chalk this up to sales execution issues that need to be addressed fast. Regardless, I expect demand to pick up as management invest more in its sales initiatives. This means New Relic's weak EPS and profitability factors will be negatively impacted.Source: Author (using data from conference call)Given that New Relic sells mostly into the SMB space, its product retention rate hasn’t been as strong as expected. Also, it is a pure SaaS platform, which means companies with privacy concerns can't buy an on-prem or hybrid offering.Most of the recent third party reviews of its products are great baring minor product bugs that can be easily fixed. Synthetics has garnered strong ratings on Gartner, though, customers are calling for improved integrations with third-party platforms. No evidence points to a serious product deficiency, which means New Relic needs to intensify its sales strategy to stay competitive.I'm not confident that New Relic will be able to withstand more competitive pressure as more players peek into the mid-market space. Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Overall, its financials aren't the strongest. Growth is decelerating, margins are collapsing, cash flow has turned negative, and its debt to equity ratio isn't the most attractive at 130%. Though, the long term guidance shared during the last investor day points to a rosy future if investors have the patience to hold on to the stock and wait for the full effect of its marketing and sales strategy to reaccelerate demand. Regardless, volatility will persist near term unless growth outpaces opex this quarter.I attribute the softness in the enterprise space to strong competition from the likes of Datadog, Dynatrace, and new entrants into the APM space, including Splunk (SPLK), and Elastic (ESTC). Analysts expect Datadog and Dynatrace to surpass New Relic in revenue by next year. New Relic is expected to grow by 17.5% in FY’21 compared to the 24% revenue growth in FY’20. This has contributed to the suppressed valuation multiple of the stock. The quant factor grades for New Relic are all negative except growth. This means New Relic's valuation is resting on weak support. Source: Author (using data from conference call)New Relic's valuation is attractive compared to competitors. The current broad market weakness has put more weight on the stock's suppressed valuation. Its double-digit growth guidance remains compelling, though further deceleration or guidance weakness will put the stock in the penalty box. At 4.7x FY'21 revenue, New Relic appears cheap; however, this is more of a reflection of the conservativeness of bullish investors who are pricing the stock for its limited market penetration capabilities compared to competitors who have more strengths with large enterprises. As it stands, analysts are still bullish about the stock with a consensus price target of $78. This offers a balanced risk/reward sentiment, given that most competitors are trading at double-digit sales multiples. Source: Author (using data from ycharts)New Relic's short interest has been on the rise. Investors seem to prefer competitors to New Relic. Also, the uncertainty around the uptake of its new offerings has driven its value at risk and daily return volatility. The sensitivity of investors to soft quarterly results has indicated that investors won't be pleased with any result short of a beat and raise. The likes of Datadog and Dynatrace have raised the bar for New Relic. As a result, investors should be wary of accumulating shares until New Relic's improved sales strategy has been proven to be a sustainable driver of growth in the near term.Source: AuthorThe payoff for a short term exit strategy is no longer attractive. The current valuation is already baking in slow revenue growth down the road at 5x P/S.Regardless, New Relic will come back; however, another miss next quarter will rewrite the narrative around the stock, and it will take a paradigm shift catalyzed by a consistent record of quarterly outperformance to revive the stock.

Billings growth did re-accelerate back to 12% during the quarter, which was a positive considering the flattish growth from last quarter.However, the stock has traded down ~15% since reporting earnings as the company provided Q4 margin and EPS guidance below expectations in addition to lowering full-year margin guidance. While full-year revenue guidance was raised, investors have started to look more towards the challenges around operating margins rather than the 20%+ revenue growth.Data by YChartsNEWR remains one of the leaders in the APM (application performance management) industry, meaning they essentially develop tools that help measure an application or software performance. Their software functions are in back-end processes, and the technicals are a bit challenging to understand. But, for most investors, NEWR is a name not well-known. Larger institutional funds have been able to capture significant gains by holding this name over the past few years.With the stock down ~15% since reporting earnings and valuation now ~5.4x FY21 revenue, I think investors are starting to realize some challenges the company may face throughout the next year. First, I think revenue growth will likely remain ~20% (FQ3 grew 23%) instead of the more historical ~30% growth. Also, the company's operating margins seem to remain under pressure given increased S&M expenses, which drives down profitability.Typically when a software company sees their revenue growth decelerate, operating margins become a beneficiary. However, this is not quite the case with NEWR. With the stock ~$60, I find it challenging to model too much upside in the name, however, I would become more opportunistic if the shares traded closer to $55.During the quarter, revenue grew 23% to $153.0 million and was nicely above consensus expectations for ~$149 million. Even though revenue growth decelerated ~3% compared to last quarter, the company still came in ahead of expectations. The company has started to reach a point where attaining the historical level of 30%+ revenue growth is very challenging, and I believe the company will grow much closer to 20% over the next 1-2 years.Source: Company PresentationGiven the company's software-centric business model, gross margins are naturally strong. During the quarter, gross margin of 84% was similar to last quarter and at the high-end of the company's 80-84% long-term operating target. Over time, as NEWR continues to expand and scale leverage, investors should start seeing operating margins expand. During Q3, operating margin was 2%, which was below expectations and below the ~8% operating margin last quarter.Even with the better than expected revenue during the quarter, the company's lower than expected margins led to EPS of $0.09, which was below consensus expectations for ~$0.12.Source: Company PresentationHistorically, Q3 has garnished dollar-based net expansion rates of 120%+, however, during this quarter, this rate dropped to only 109%. This is a good statistic to use to determine relative strength within the company's current customer base and investors typically look for this to be nicely above 100%. While 109% is still a strong metric, it came in lower than the past several quarters.However, investors continue to like this stock because of the recurring nature of the company's business model. With ~62% of annual recurring revenue coming from enterprise accounts, investors have more confidence in this revenue stream given the stickiness. NEWR has done a good job moving up the market lately, as demonstrated by paid business accounts >$100k of 926 during the quarter, representing growth of ~13%, down slightly from 15% last quarter.While margins and some metrics/growth rates came in below expectations and lower than last quarter, billings of $157 million came in slightly better than expectations. The 12% growth in billings also showed nice acceleration from the flattish growth seen last quarter.Source: Company PresentationFor Q4, the company is expecting revenue of $154-156 million which met consensus expectations of $155 million at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be a loss of $2 million to breakeven, which would represent a slightly negative operating margin. This led to EPS guidance of $0.02-0.06, which was below expectations for $0.08.Even though full-year revenue guidance was raised to $594-596 million (up from $588-593 million), which represents growth of ~24%, non-GAAP operating income was lowered. The company now expects non-GAAP operating income of $19-21 million, which represents a margin of ~3.4%, down from previous guidance of ~3.9% margin.Even though revenue growth came in ahead of expectations, disappointing margins led to EPS coming in below expectations. In addition, the company's Q4 and revised full-year guidance was lower than expectations, which has caused the stock to go down ~15% since they reported earnings over a week ago.While I have previously written about valuation becoming a bit too high given current expectations around the company's growth, investors have seen valuation come down after the most recent earnings report.Data by YChartsThe company has a current market cap of ~$3.60 billion, and with cash/investments of ~$750 million and ~$400 million of debt, the company has a current enterprise value of ~$3.25 billion. With full year revenue guidance now at $594-596 million, this implies a FY20 revenue multiple of ~5.5x.However, with the current fiscal year only having one quarter left, investors should be starting to look at FY21 revenue as a starting point. With revenue growing ~23% during Q3, I think revenue growth will decelerate closer to ~20% during FY21. Assuming FY20 revenue comes in at the midpoint of management's guidance and grows ~20% in FY21, this would represent FY21 revenue of ~$715 million, representing a FY21 revenue multiple of ~4.5x.While this revenue multiple appears a little cheap compared to other software companies growing revenue 20%+, I think this name still has a few questions around their longer-term growth profile. The company is facing increased pressure on their operating margin, which is pushing profitability closer to breakeven compared to other software companies expanding margins and profitability.With the stock currently trading ~$60, I believe valuation is fairly pricing in the risks, however, I am not fully converted into a bull with this name. Even though the ~15% price compression since earnings has pushed down valuation, I believe this correction was likely needed to bring more bullish views into the long-term growth potential. An optimistic investor could argue that valuation has pulled back enough that once we pass the bad operating margin spell, we could see a brighter future.Risks to NEWR include the company reporting another weaker than expected quarter, which could send the shares down another 20-30% and cause investors to lose confidence in the longer-term model."
4323320,105235,2020-02-11T22:11:53-05:00,"New Relic reported its Q3 2020 results in February 4, with disappointing results.Revenue growth is slowing down, the net expansion rate is at historical lows, and the profit margins are not expanding.According to the guidance, the company expects further deceleration in the growth rates of revenue and deferred revenue.The valuation seems attractive relative to the overall SaaS space, but its profitability profile and Rule of 40 appear to justify a low multiple.","New Relic (NEWR) has reported disappointing earnings with deceleration in revenue growth and substantial deterioration in profitability margins. Customers are not expanding their use of the company’s products as in previous years, and the competition seems to be heating in the APM space. The former factors are making the company’s numbers erode. The company’s guidance for the next quarter and full year implies continued deceleration in the top line and weakness in the growth of deferred revenue. The valuation, although lower than most software stocks, could be considered fair or even a little expensive to other peers with similar growth profiles.(Earnings Release)The revenue for the quarter was $153 million, a growth of 23% Y/Y. This signifies 4-point and 12-point declines in the growth rate from the previous quarter and the same quarter of the prior year, respectively.It is difficult to show strength in revenue growth while small-size businesses are leaving the company. The growth in customers reporting more than $100,000 in ARR is not strong enough to offset the former, and the net expansion rate is at historical lows.(Investor Presentation)NEWR ended the quarter with 926 of such customers, representing a soft growth of 13% Y/Y, when compared with the 30% growth rate that the company reported in the same quarter of a year ago. It gets worse on a Q/Q basis, with a tiny growth of 2%.The net expansion rate for the quarter was only 109%, a significant decline from the 122% of the year-ago quarter, and a historical low for this company (the same as in Q1 2020). This is a result of customers reducing their spending on the company’s products (literally a higher churn) and a decline in upsell activity. But, everything is “fine,” here is the CEO on the quarterly earnings call (emphasize the last two words): “We believe we have the most complete observability platform in the market and our customers are responding favorably.”The truth is that weakness in net expansion rates is a red flag for SaaS companies when combined with fierce competition. See, over time, this ratio tends to fluctuate, and a one-quarter weakness is no reason to worry. But, this is not an isolated quarter, this is the third consecutive quarter of net retention weakness at NEWR (Q1 109%, Q2 112% and Q3 109%).In addition to this, Dynatrace (DT) and Cisco (CSCO) – through its acquisition of AppDynamics – are pushing hard in the competitive environment. A few days ago DT reported that its net expansion rate was at or above 120%, in line with previous quarters, and showing that it is strong in the market.If NEWR is not able to improve its net expansion rate over the next few quarters, the revenue growth will decrease rapidly. Although the company is taking steps to turn the situation (new executives and the recent New Relic One platform), this writer doesn’t expect the numbers to improve.Moving to profitability, the company saw its margins worsen sequentially and on a Y/Y basis. During the quarter, the gross margin was 82.8%, almost 100 bps lower Y/Y and flat Q/Q. The operating margin was (16%), down from (7%) Y/Y and (12%) Q/Q. This decline was influenced by an advance of 400 bps in both S&M and R&D expenses, on a Y/Y basis. Non-GAAP operating income remained positive at $3 million, representing a margin of 2%, which was substantially lower than 6% Y/Y and 8% Q/Q.After achieving positive free cash flows for two fiscal years, the company has returned to red numbers. The free cash flow margin for the quarter was a disappointing 22% (see the table below).(Earnings Release)Declining growth rates and profit margins is not a good sign for a growth story. As a company matures and its growth rate slows down, operating expenses should decrease relative to revenues, and hence, profit margins should increase. Investors may not be happy with the underlying performance of NEWR over the last year, and the stock price certainly has reflected this:(finviz.com)Looking forward, the company’s guidance for the next quarter and full year is as follows:(Investor Presentation)That outlook means revenue growth of 17-18%, or a five-point deceleration on a sequential basis. It also means a significant recovery in the FCF margin in Q4. Also, the sequential growth of 30% in deferred revenue means only a growth of 13% when compared with the same figure of Q4 2019.After the earnings report, NEWR remains one of the lowest valued stocks in the SaaS space. As I write these lines, the stock trades at $62.63 per share. With a net cash position of $315 million, the enterprise value is $3.5 billion. The expected revenue for the next twelve months is $669 million (17% growth), so the forward EV/S multiple is 5.2x. The average forward EV/S for a SaaS stock is around 10x, so it would be reasonable to expect some price appreciation as the multiple expands. But, when compared to other software stocks with similar growth expectations, the valuation seems rather in line (see the table below).(Author)(*) The Rule of 40 for this table was calculated by adding the growth (NTM) and the FCF margin (TTM)And, to say “in line” is to be soft on NEWR. The table below offers some insights on how it stacks up against some of its software peers. NEWR has a superior gross margin (at least by 800 bps), but has an inferior FCF margin, thus, a significantly lower Rule of 40.As a reminder, the Rule of 40 for software companies is sort of a benchmark that states that a financially healthy company must have a balance of growth and profitability of at least 40% (which is the average across the SaaS sector). In other words, the sum of the revenue growth rate and the FCF margin should be no less than 40%. In this case, the ratio is not only lower than peers', it doesn’t even get to 20%, while the peers above are in the 30%s.In conclusion, the valuation is fair at most. If you think that it can go up to 6-8x, bear in mind that it may go down to 3-4x as well, or even lower.In conclusion, the quarter was disappointing with overall deceleration in revenue growth and net expansion rate. The growth in the number of top customers is slowing down, and the company needs more of them as SMBs are leaving. Deteriorating profit margins are not benefiting a growth story that is fading away. Free cash flow, that was positive for two fiscal years, is back to red territory. As a result, the stock has been underperforming as of late. Furthermore, the guidance implies further deceleration in the growth rates of revenue and deferred revenue. Do not get caught in a value trap. The valuation remains low for a SaaS stock, but this name may sink deeper."
4321634,103480,2020-02-05T13:04:13-05:00,"Shares of New Relic sank more than 7% after the company reported Q3 results.Despite beating revenue estimates for the quarter, investors worried about the deceleration in New Relic's growth rate as well as a slowdown in its all-important revenue retention rate.Still, New Relic remains a technology powerhouse in the application monitoring space. Its recent platform expansion into the ""New Relic One"" takes its TAM to an estimated $21 billion.Shares look incredibly attractive at ~5x forward revenues.","This article was highlighted for PRO+ subscribers, Seeking Alpha's service for professional investors. This article was highlighted under our Tech vertical. Find out how you can get access to the best content on Seeking Alpha here.New Relic (NEWR), the mid-cap software company best known for its monitoring tools that help IT departments gauge the health and performance of underlying applications and infrastructure, has just reported third-quarter results. As has been a common theme over the past year, investors aren't overly impressed. New Relic's growth rates have come down considerably since last year, and the stock price has reflected that tough reality. In response to a mixed Q3 print and wavering optimism for next year, shares of New Relic are down ~7% post-earnings:Data by YChartsIn my view, however, little has changed to the bullish thesis for New Relic. The stock remains one of the best value plays in the software sector. Having rapidly moved from one of the best-loved darlings of the stock market into the ""penalty box"" for its lower growth rates, New Relic shares have suffered through a vast dislocation in its share price that improperly values the company for all its merits. To me, the case for New Relic can be summed up in a few key points:Given all these merits, New Relic is a strong buy-the-dip candidate.Let's zoom in a bit closer on New Relic's valuation. At current post-earnings share prices of ~$65, New Relic has a market cap of $3.82 billion. After we net off the $742.7 million of cash on New Relic's balance sheet against $421.7 million of convertible debt, we arrive at an enterprise value of $3.50 billion.New Relic's updated guidance for FY20, of which only one quarter is remaining, calls for $594-$596 million in revenues:Figure 1. New Relic FY20 guidance updateSource: New Relic Q3 earnings deckLet's assume New Relic can grow at a ~20% y/y pace in FY21, showing a few points of deceleration to this quarter's 23% y/y growth rate. This gives us a revenue estimate of $714 million for FY21 (for comparison, Wall Street consensus for FY21 calls for $695 million in revenues, or +17% y/y growth, per Yahoo Finance)Using the higher revenue estimate, we arrive at a current valuation for New Relic of 4.9x EV/FY21 revenues. Even if we apply the lower 17% consensus growth rate, that valuation only stretches up to 5.0x EV/FY21 revenues.In any case, New Relic's valuation is several turns lower than other software peers that are currently growing at a mid-20s pace:Data by YChartsIn my view, New Relic is worth at least 6.5x EV/FY21 revenues, implying a price target of $84 and 30% upside from current levels. With that being said, we do have to acknowledge some mixed results in Q3 that made investors cautious - my thesis, however, is that New Relic's ~7% dip and its already-cheap <5x forward revenue valuation adequately prices in this slowdown.Take a look at New Relic's third-quarter results below:Figure 2. New Relic 3Q20 resultsSource: New Relic Q3 earnings release Revenues grew 23% y/y to $153.0 million, beating Wall Street's expectations of $149.6 million (+20% y/y) by a respectable three-point margin. As expected, however, New Relic experienced significant deceleration from last quarter's 27% y/y growth rate.One of the major drivers behind this revenue deceleration is a reduction in the company's net revenue expansion rate - which is a closely watched indicator across all software companies, measuring their ability to retain and upsell current customers.Figure 3. New Relic key metricsSource: New Relic Q3 earnings deckAs seen in the table above, New Relic's expansion rate showed three points fo sequential decay to 109%. In FY18 (which was a much stronger year for New Relic, in which revenues grew in the high 30s), net expansion rates had trended as high as the 120s. Because expansion business is often a more profitable source of revenue growth (consuming less sales dollars than new business), this reduction in expansion rates has an implication for margins as well. In the Q&A portion of the Q3 earnings call, CFO Mark Sachleben directly addressed the slowdown in the net retention rate:Nevertheless, New Relic's lower contribution from expansion deals this quarter did hit margins - compounded on top of the fact that the company has continued an ""investment period"" as it adds to its headcount. Pro forma gross margins dipped one point this quarter to 84% (albeit still high), while pro forma operating margins dipped to 2%, down from 6% in the year-ago quarter. At the same time, New Relic's pro forma EPS of $0.09 also missed analyst consensus of $0.12. This being said, however, we still note that New Relic is among few mid-cap software companies that are still in growth mode, but are capable of producing positive pro forma operating margins. We note as well that the company has a plan to reduce sales and marketing costs, over the long term, by as much as fifteen points as a percentage of revenue, giving the company target operating margins above 25%. Figure 4. New Relic target marginsSource: New Relic Q3 earnings deckOver time, New Relic's huge gross margin profile gives it the capacity to produce tremendous profits. Key for us to track as FY21 progresses will be its progress toward reducing these core expense buckets down to the long-term targets. Despite several disappointing results from New Relic's third-quarter earnings release (a reduction in net expansion rates, partially contributing to a slight decay in operating margins), the stock remains sufficiently cheap at <5x forward revenues to warrant a long position. The days when New Relic was valued at double-digit revenue multiples are far behind us, but the stock remains one of the true value plays in the software sector. Use the post-earnings dip as an opportunity to add to your position."
4336632,105400,2020-04-08T09:30:40-04:00,"New Relic has fallen roughly 58% since its 52-week high.The company has grown decently with revenue growth rates above 30% in recent years.Moreover, New Relic is undervalued by 50% based on my estimates.","New Relic's (NYSE:NEWR) stock price has fallen roughly 58% from its 52-week high, mostly due to multiple adjustments from the recent market turmoil and slowing revenue growth. Despite the big drop in share price, I believe that New Relic has growing switching costs. At $44.5, it is undervalued by roughly 50% based on my base-case assumptions.(Source: Google)The company has achieved decent revenue growth in recent years. Revenue has grown from $11.7M in 2012 to $572M in 2019, compounding at roughly 60% year on year. Throughout the same period, gross margins have stayed above 80%.New Relic believes its total addressable market is roughly $21B. At its revenue for $572M, New Relic has only penetrated 2.7% of the entire market. This market is likely to be expanding as well as more customers move towards software and the cloud. As such, New Relic's products and platforms have a long runway for growth.(Source: New Relic 3Q20 Presentation)New Relic's dollar-based net expansion rate was 109% in 3Q20, indicating that customers are sticking with its platform. This highlights that New Relic likely exhibits some brand loyalty and switching costs from its customers. As companies become more entrenched while using New Relic's platform, they become increasingly unlikely to switch even if cheaper competing services emerge. Companies generally do not want to risk losing data and productivity, which leads to business disruption. If New Relic continues to attract large enterprise companies, it increases the switching costs for New Relic's platform.To ensure that smaller companies like New Relic do not run into liquidity issues, one way to determine that is to monitor its cash and debt balances, as well as its cash burn rate.Looking at its latest balance sheet, New Relic has $179M of cash, $557M of short-term investments, with $421M of convertible senior notes. Since New Relic had positive cash flow in 2019 of roughly $72M, this provides a large cushion for New Relic to invest in growth. It also helps New Relic tide through any operational difficulties in this volatile period.(Source: New Relic 3Q 10Q)When the economy experiences a downturn, customers might cut back on non-essential services to preserve cash. If these businesses deem that New Relic is not crucial to their operations, it might lead to a larger-than-expected churn rate for New Relic's customer base.According to the Gartner Magic Quadrant, New Relic also faces competitors like Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). Without a strong value proposition, it may lead to slower customer adoption on its platform. New Relic has to ensure that its platform continues to delight customers to gain market share and keep them from switching over to competitors.(Source: Gartner)1) Revenue growth at 20% for the next five years, then dropping to 2% in perpetuity starting from the year 2025. The high growth rates in the first five years reflect New Relic's decent track record of sales growth and its ability to penetrate its total addressable market. However, intense competition might put a lid on high sales growth in the future as New Relic continues to expand its offering.2) Operating margin of 25% from 2026 onwards. Software players generally have high operating margins due to their high initial fixed costs and low incremental costs. New Relic's gross margins have remained above 80% since 2016. Once New Relic scales further and profitability becomes a priority, the company should experience a high level of operating margin expansion through operating leverage. However, if New Relic has to incur higher customer acquisition costs due to strong competition, there could be some downward pressure on its margins in the near term.3) A sales-to-capital ratio of 2 is in line with its software peers. Developing software is not capital-intensive, so I estimate New Relic will be able to generate $2 of sales with every $1 in incremental capital.4) New Relic has an initial weighted cost of capital of 9%, which drops to 8% in the terminal year. The higher cost of capital reflects the higher risk of New Relic having negative operating income and losing money. However, once the company achieves profitability and higher free cash flows, the risk should be reduced as reflected in the lower cost of capital.(Source: Author creation using New Relic financials) (Figures are in $millions except per share data and percentages)The value I derived for New Relic is roughly $3.9B for the entire company. This represents a 50% upside from its current price. As with all DCFs for high-growth companies, my point estimate valuation of $66.90 is likely to have a large spread of possible outcomes. To overcome this shortcoming, I compare its pricing multiples against other software companies.(Source: Author creation using data from Seeking Alpha)Compared to other high-growth peers, New Relic's pricing looks fairly reasonable in terms of price/sales and EV/sales ratios. New Relic is much less profitable than the software peers but has higher growth rates as compared to them. It's priced roughly the same as Cisco and Broadcom but much cheaper than Microsoft.Potential investors have to decide if they believe New Relic will be able to execute according to my base-case assumptions in the long run. If competition turns out to be stronger than expected and pushes down future sales growth, the recent pullback might not make New Relic a great buy."

The jury is out.,"Back in July, I made one of my worst calls in recent memory by giving New Relic, Inc. (NEWR) a bullish rating. 8 months later, this company is trading 40% lower than when the article was published.Admitting when one is wrong, and learning from one's mistakes are important attributes for making it in the world of finance. I admit that I was wrong but it remains to be seen if I have learned anything. Today I am taking another look at New Relic and updating my rating.One striking observation that I have made is the clear drop in the dollar-based net expansion rate for the last three quarters. Coincidentally, this lines up with the introduction of New Relic One which gives the product a new front and paves the way for addition of new apps. This is the company's attempt at converting to a Platform-as-a-Service offering.(Source: New Relic)Rewinding the clock back to earlier in the year, management indicated that:It is safe to say that the issues have not yet been rectified and in a broken record kind of way, management is still calling for a rebound in the coming quarter, 2020 Q4.It appears to me that New Relic is struggling a little bit and I dare say the company has had ""sales execution issues"". New applications have been introduced prior to a ramp in sales rep hiring and training.And here is what may turn out to be a very prophetic statement by Kayode Omotosho back in December:In response to the recent drop in the net expansion rate, the company has brought in new management to help strengthen the company. The changes include a new President/COO and also a new Chief Product Officer.Not only has the net expansion rate been impaired but the company's annual growth rate is slowing rapidly.(Source: Portfolio123)Annual sales growth of 28% has dropped from a 5-year average of 50%. And in Q3 2020, the growth of its coveted large customer base was pretty anemic.New Relic has a free cash flow margin of 2.7%, down from 13% less than one year ago.(Source: Portfolio123)The drop in free cash flow margin is due to two factors: increased spending and lower net expansion rate:One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help software companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. For a further description of the rule and calculation, please refer to one of my previous articles.In New Relic's case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 28% + 2.7% = 30.7%The calculation comes out below 40% which is disappointing because New Relic scored well above 40 when I calculated it 8 months ago. Most companies that score below 40 never recover to achieve the Rule of 40.Cash burn is one area of concern that I have for New Relic, especially since revenue growth is decelerating. I evaluate cash burn based on the SG&A expense margin. Note that the SG&A expense margin includes R&D.(Source: Portfolio123)Anaplan (NYSE:PLAN) has an SG&A expense margin of 95%, meaning that it is spending almost all of its revenue intake on SG&A expenses alone.The following scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated forward Y-o-Y sales growth illustrates New Relic's stock valuation relative to the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red on the scatter plot and represents a typical valuation based on next year's sales growth. As can be seen from the scatter plot, New Relic is very undervalued relative to its peers based on forward sales multiple.New Relic has been struggling for the last three quarters as revenue growth has slowed and the net expansion rate has dropped fairly dramatically. The company management has been promising that this is a short-term issue for some time and to expect a rebound. However, I am somewhat skeptical as competition is fierce in the APM market given the alternative offerings from AppDynamics, Dynatrace and Datadog (DDOG) among others.The future of New Relic really depends on how well its new applications are received by customers as it attempts to transform into a Platform-as-a-Service. I believe that the jury is out and we may not find out the answer for some time yet. I wouldn't expect the ramp in sales reps trained on the new products to be kicking into high gear until late in 2020. In the meantime, I am somewhat discouraged by the drop in free cash flow margin, failure on the Rule of 40 and decreasing sales growth and net expansion rate. The company's cash burn is high for its growth rate. For these reasons, I am giving New Relic a neutral rating."

New product updates will drive renewed interest. Near-term concerns include volatility in the cloud space and growing competition in the APM space. I remain bullish in the near term as New Relic has the capabilities to sustain its growth narrative.New Relic's revenue growth decelerated last quarter. The company reported revenue growth of 27%. Dollar-based net expansion rate decreased from 124% to 112% due to lower upsell. On a more positive note, enterprise revenue percent of ARR increased to 62%, up from 56%. US and ex-US revenue grew 27%.Source: Seeking AlphaGoing forward, management is guiding for a 21% revenue growth next quarter. This isn't compelling enough given that analysts have a 2021 revenue growth guidance of 18%.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Margins came in above expectations due to lower FX headwinds and personnel costs. FCF was negative, highlighting the decline in deferred revenue. This puts a spotlight on the renewal rate, which isn't growing, as customers are hesitant to sign multi-year renewal deals. Management has beefed up its product portfolio to raise its value proposition. There is a unified dashboard called New Relic One, and the company released new products in logs, traces, and metrics. There is also a new AI product to reduce log alert noise. Going forward, management is guiding for more R&D spend.After studying product reviews on third-party sites like Gartner and G2, the common theme that emerged was the huge pricing of New Relic's APM offering. Users were impressed with the capabilities of its offering; however, most mid-sized businesses think the price point is a bit on the high side, forcing them to learn more about the full capabilities of the product to derive more value for their spend. If New Relic optimizes its pricing a little bit more, it can potentially attract more SMEs while driving up product retention rate.New Relic has $772 million in cash and cash equivalents and debt of $485 million. Its debt/equity ratio of 130% isn't the most attractive and I remain neutral on its overall financials given its lack of profitability.Source: IDCIn 2018, New Relic was the second-fastest-growing APM player behind Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) (AppDynamics). It also had the second-largest market share. The APM space is getting increasingly competitive. Dynatrace (DT) is investing heavily to gain market share while Datadog is establishing a strong foothold in the space. New Relic used to outspend Dynatrace on both R&D and SG&A. The opposite is now the case.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)If the trend continues, New Relic might struggle to gain market share as new players enter the APM space. As a result, I'm not confident about New Relic's ability to rapidly expand its market share.New Relic's valuation has cooled off massively, and it's now trading at a discount to most of its frothy peers. The cloud sector remains expensive at 30x P/E (TTM); therefore, investors shouldn't rush to buy this based on its subdued valuation due to the inherent sector volatility risk.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)As it stands, the best way for investors to unlock value is to bet that New Relic will be bought at a premium to the current price. This entails playing the long-term game.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Near term, management will have to beat and raise forward guidance for the volatility inherent in the stock to be subdued.There have been multiple corrections in the cloud space, and a lot of cloud players still trade at lofty valuations to their projected future growth and cash flow. If there is another correction in the cloud space, New Relic could be affected, given its 24M beta of 1.38.A significant portion of New Relic's valuation is a bet that its product pipeline will drive sustainable revenue. Some of these products face strong competition from other SaaS plays. This might impact New Relic's ability to continue to raise pricing and grow market share. If the new product updates don't drive retention rate, optimism won't improve, and valuation multiples won't expand.Source: AuthorI am bullish on New Relic as the recent product update will potentially drive renewed growth momentum. I see the best way to unlock value in the form of the company being acquired at a significant premium to its current price given the level of competition building up in the APM space, which will weaken the pricing power of existing players.Source: AuthorIf you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."
4353142,104952,2020-06-10T15:19:49-04:00,"We see growth opportunities through client-base expansion, driven by the adoption of New Relic Edge and AI in FY 2021 and beyond.New Relic also onboarded four new executives, demonstrating a full commitment to fixing the sales execution issue in Q1 2020.As we see potential growth and margin expansion opportunity in the medium term, we are upgrading our neutral rating to overweight.","In our recent note on New Relic (NEWR) in Q1 2020 last September, we highlighted the potential investment risk considering the management shakeup in the company. We rated the stock neutral at the time as we continued to believe in the business's potential and strong positioning in the attractive APM (Application Performance Monitoring) and observability spaces. New Relic has since continued to perform above our expectations, which increases our conviction in the stock further.In Q4, New Relic beat the guidance as it grew revenue by 21% YoY and announced new executive hires to strengthen its leadership team. The company also introduced two new offerings, which demonstrates its commitment to continue investing in its platform despite the ongoing macro uncertainties that have reduced the visibility for the full year. The stock has only been up ~7.5% from last September when we published our first coverage. As such, the price level provides a good entry point and we are upgrading the stock to overweight.We have a long-term bullish view of New Relic, which we think will continue to be a dominant player in the APM and observability spaces. There are two key catalysts we have identified as of Q4:We expect a client-base expansion growth opportunity through continuous R&D investments in AIOps and Edge technologies. Throughout FY 2020, the company has been tweaking and improving its New Relic AI offering, which reportedly came out of the successful beta phase in Q4. The newly-launched New Relic Edge in Q4 is also a differentiated offering that complements AI. We expect the combination of AI and Edge to drive top-line growth, primarily through strong client base expansion.(Source: company's earnings call slide)By having AI, New Relic now has the right asset to enter the AIOps (AI for IT Operations) category and a more comprehensive offering, which we think is highly appealing to its client base. For context, its enterprise peer Dynatrace (DT) even considers AIOps as the most critical piece of technology across its product stacks. We believe that the AIOps expansion should allow New Relic's dollar-based net expansion rate to recover to where it was around one to two years ago. Conservatively, we expect a long-term target of 120-130%, considering Dynatrace's current 120% net expansion rate and New Relic's 130% in Q4 2019.We further view New Relic Edge as an equally interesting offering, which can boost the expansion rate further. New Relic Edge leverages multi-tenancy technology, which allows more efficient and faster data computation, considering the cloud deployments closer to the clients' location. Overall, it is a similar model to the increasingly trending Edge Computing practice in the IoT (Internet of Things) space.(source: company's earnings call slide)Given the promising potential of the offerings that will drive client expansion, we expect New Relic to maintain its single-digit FCF (free cash flow) margin in the near term, with a potential expansion towards the end of FY 2021 and beyond. Likewise, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue should also decrease to account for the stronger client base expansion.The strengthened executive team to improve overall go-to-market execution. Considering the sales-related issue around the beginning of FY 2020, the decision to onboard new executives to fill in the strategic positions demonstrates the management's commitment to fixing the problem once and for all. In Q4 2020, there are a handful of additions to the executive team:Most of these names have held key positions in larger enterprises and channel partners such as Dell, EMC, Salesforce, Accenture, and VMWare, which we feel will benefit the overall sales cycle and client-base expansion. Furthermore, we believe that these strategic additions are in line with the introduction of AIOps and Edge offering and the renewed objectives in Q3 to focus on onboarding more +$100k ARR clients and increasing renewal yield.On the other hand, we feel that there is a risk in onboarding too many C-level executives at the same time, especially following the disruption seen earlier in the fiscal year that still requires more careful planning. In that sense, throwing new and drastic changes upon these executive appointments can potentially undermine the ongoing recovery. In Q4, we have seen signs that the team still needs to adapt better to remote work format as the sales cycle lengthened. However, the pandemic has also affected the company's SMB and mid-size clients severely, as paid business accounts declined to 16,300 from 17,000 in FY 2019, leaving the company with no visibility for the full year as it will see a potential increase in delayed renewals.New Relic has a strong reputation and brand name in the APM space, and the expansion into AIOps will strengthen its positioning further, which should drive growth and margin expansion, primarily through increased client base expansion and reduced outbound marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue.(Source: stockrow)Despite the slowing revenue growth from +50% to 25% over the last three years, followed by an expected decline to +11% in FY 2021, we have an optimistic view that growth should reaccelerate further in the next fiscal year. Given last year's 25% growth and 4.7% FCF margin, New Relic is about +10 points shy of the rule-of-40. It is also likely that it will still not pass the score of 40 this year. The recent macro uncertainty has also put some pressure on the valuation, which we think is attractive enough at ~6.8x P/S. Given our conviction in the New Relic's differentiated technology asset, we believe that it can trade at 9-10x P/S beyond 2021. Accordingly, we are upgrading our neutral rating to overweight."
4312428,104608,2019-12-13T15:20:22-05:00,"The company reported Q2 revenue and EPS that were ahead of expectations, largely due to strong margin performance.
        Management lowered their full year revenue guidance, which likely signals rather muted billings growth performance.
        Valuation remains a little below comparable peers at ~6x forward revenue, though there are still questions to be answered.","Following a rather disappointing Q1 earnings report, New Relic (NEWR) reported a better Q2 report, even though billings growth was still a weak point. The stock is still down over 25% since their pre-Q1 earnings report and is up under 5% since reporting earnings a month ago. I think investors have lost a little bit of confidence and bullish-ness in the name over the past few months and it could take a little bit of time for this to come back.The quarter itself was not bad as revenue growth of 27% came in ahead of expectations and operating margin surprised to the upside. Billings growth remained relatively flat, though this was up against a strong year ago period which included some multi-million dollar signings. Management lowered their full year revenue guidance even though operating margin guidance was slightly raised.While the stock is up over 20% since their Q1 earnings, most of this rebound was from a few months ago as investors have moved their foot off the gas pedal. The Q2 report was neither extremely positive nor negative, though I believe it pushes investors out another quarter or two before they start to get more bullish on the name.NEWR remains one of the leaders in the APM (application performance management) industry, meaning they essentially develop tools that help measure an application or software performance. Their software functions are in back-end processes, and the technicals are a bit challenging to understand. But, for most investors, NEWR is a name not well-known. Larger institutional funds have been able to capture significant gains by holding this name over the past few years.With valuation ~6.1x FY20 revenue and ~5.1x FY21 revenue, the name is a little cheaper than other software peers growing revenue at 20%+. However, with the company’s billings growth in question, I think investors should remain on the sidelines a bit longer before the company starts to post some positive trends.Revenue during the quarter grew 27% to $145.8 million and was nicely above expectations for ~$143 million. However, revenue growth decelerated by 3pts compared to last quarter’s growth of 30%. Revenue growth had historically been closer to 30% and even though this quarter was slightly lower, the general trends continues forward.Source: Company PresentationGross margin continues to remain very strong at 84% during the quarter, which is at the higher end of the company’s 80-84% long-term target. Gross margin over the past few years has settled in near the 84-85% range and I believe the company will continue to post similar results, which are near the high-end of software companies in the market.Over time, as NEWR continues to scale and gain operating leverage, we should start to see operating margin expand as the company demonstrates increased profitability. For now, the company remains focused on revenue growth, gaining scale, and increasing their market share. Operating margin during Q2 was ~8% which seemed to be well above consensus expectations. Ultimately, the company reported EPS of $0.24, ahead of expectations for $0.15.Source: Company PresentationDollar-based net expansion rate improved to 112% compared to 109% last quarter, though is still down from 124% in the year ago period. Part of this can be explained by the company’s lower billings compared to the year ago period, as contracts have become a little shorter in nature.NEWR also reported 62% of annual recurring revenue coming from enterprise accounts, the highest level seen in the company's history and similar to last quarter. By generating higher recurring revenue from enterprises, investors can have more confidence in this revenue stream given the stickiness. Also, paid business accounts >$100k were 906 during the quarter, representing growth of 15%, down from 18% growth last quarter.Even though metrics and growth rates were largely similar to last quarter, billings growth remained a little under pressure. Billings of $124 million were well below expectations for $130+ million. Billings were essentially flat compared to the year ago period, though management did note there were some large multi-million deals in the year ago period, making growth rates a little challenging to compare. Management noted billings were a little soft due to weaker than expected sales attainment and shorter contracts.Source: Company PresentationFor Q3, management is expecting revenue of $148-150 million, which was pretty close to consensus expectations. Non-GAAP operating income guidance of $3-4 million represents ~2.3% operating margin at the midpoint, leading to EPS of $0.12-0.13. Billings for the quarter are expected to increase sequentially in the low single digit basis, which implies another quarter of soft billings growth and was below consensus expectations.Full-year revenue guidance was lowered to $588-593 million from $600-607 million, which represents growth of ~23% compared to previous guidance of ~26% growth. Non-GAAP operating income was slight narrowed to $21-25 million, though now represents ~3.9% margin.After last quarters big billings growth miss, the company’s stock has remained under a lot of pressure. Even though the stock remains down over 25% since the start of their fiscal year, the stock is up ~20% from their post-Q1 low point and up just under 5% since reporting Q2 earnings.Valuation will continue to remain under pressure for this name until either one of two things happen. First, NEWR could surprise investors to the upside by reporting accelerating billings growth. Or second, investors will need to wait another few quarters until the company starts to lap some of the bad quarterly billings performances.The company has a current market cap of ~$4.0 billion, and with cash/investments of ~$800 million and ~$400 million of debt, the company has a current enterprise value of ~$3.6 billion. With full year revenue guidance being lowered to $588-593 million, this implies a FY20 revenue multiple of ~6.1x.While the current guidance implies revenue growth of ~23% for the year, investors seem to be uncertain whether or not guidance will go up or down next. After reducing revenue guidance during the Q2 call, I think 23% is a good growth rate to assume for the rest of the year. Typically when a company has to lower their revenue guidance, they make sure they do it enough where they are able to still beat the lowered expectations.Assuming FY20 revenue comes in at the midpoint and grows another 20% in FY21, we could see FY21 revenue of ~710 million, which would give us a FY21 revenue multiple of ~5.1x. While this revenue multiple appears a little cheap compared to other software companies growing revenue 20%+, I think this name still has a few questions around their longer-term growth profile.The stock remains a little under $70 and has only been up less than 5% since reporting earnings a month ago, signaling investors are not overly excited about the name heading into 2020. An optimistic investor could argue that valuation has pulled back enough that once we pass the bad billings growth, we could see a brighter future.For now, I think the current ~6x forward revenue is about right, though if the company were to turn things around in the next quarter or two, we could see the multiple slowly creep back up to the 7-8x range.Risks to NEWR include the company reporting another weaker than expected quarter, which could send the shares down another 20-30% and cause investors to lose confidence in the longer-term model."
4294429,104608,2019-10-01T15:11:25-04:00,"New Relic reported a weaker than expected quarter with billings growth missing consensus by ~6%.Management provided soft Q2 guidance but reiterated full-year revenue guidance, signaling continued strength in the business.Valuation has reached an attractive point at ~5.5x forward revenue; investors should start to reconsider the name at these levels.","After reporting much weaker than expected billings during the quarter, New Relic (NEWR) remains down over 20% from the pre-earnings level and investors should start to reconsider valuation on this name. My initial read was the stock would rebound over the following weeks but that does not seem the case. In fact, the stock was down over 30% at one point but has slowly recovered since.Revenue during the quarter grew 30%, which was in line with expectations, though billings growth of 24% was well below expectations for ~30% growth. This sent the stock down over 20% the day following earnings. Management provided Q2 guidance that was a little bit lower than consensus, though left the full-year revenue and operating income guidance metrics the same.Data by YChartsWith the stock down over 20% since earnings and valuation reaching what appears to be a low point, now could be a good time to pick up some shares on sale. I believe Q2 guidance is achievable as management noted the softer Q1 was partially due to changes in their sales force and a new platform. With both of these issues largely resolved by the end of the quarter, the company could see a surprise beat during Q2, which could spark a nice rally in the stock.NEWR remains one of the leaders in the APM (application performance management) industry, meaning they essentially develop tools that help measure an application or software performance. Their software functions are in back-end processes, and the technicals are a bit challenging to understand. But, for most investors, NEWR is a name not well-known. Larger institutional funds have been able to capture significant gains by holding this name over the past few years.Historically, NEWR was consistent at providing beatable guidance and achieving these metrics. However, Q1 was a slightly different story. Revenue grew 30% to $141 million, which was only ~$1 million ahead of expectations. Revenue growth has hovered around the 30% level for the past several quarters, which should be viewed as a positive considering the company is reaching scale and the law of large numbers eventually kicks in.Source: Company PresentationInternational and US revenue both grew ~30%, demonstrating the company's ability to diversify their geographic revenue streams and growth potential. In addition to the strong revenue growth, the company reported 85% gross margins, which remains near the high-end of software companies in the market. Operating margin continues to be healthy at 5% during the quarter.Over time, as NEWR continues to scale and gain operating leverage, we should start to see operating margin expand as the company demonstrates increased profitability. For now, the company remains focused on revenue growth, gaining scale, and increasing their market share.Source: Company PresentationDollar-based net expansion rate of 109% dropped quite significantly from 131% last quarter and a pretty consistent trend of 120%+. Q1 typically has the lowest dollar-based net expansion rate due to seasonality factors.NEWR also reported 62% of annual recurring revenue coming from enterprise accounts, the highest level seen in the company's history. The higher recurring revenue from enterprise is a strong trend given these customers tend to be stickier and represent a larger dollar spend. In addition, paid business accounts >$100k were 881 during the quarter, representing growth of 18%, down from 22% growth last quarter.While these metrics were generally positive, billings were not. Billings growth of 24% to $125 million was well below consensus expectations for 30%+ growth and was also down from ~28% growth last quarter. Management noted changes within their sales organizational structure and moving to a new user interface platform hurt billings, though suggested these were only short-term issues and should be resolved in the coming quarter.Source: Company PresentationFor Q2, management is expecting revenue of $143-145 million, which was a little bit below consensus expectations of ~$146 million at the time. Non-GAAP operating income guidance of $5-6 million represents ~3.8% operating margin at the midpoint, leading to EPS of $0.14-0.16. Billings for the quarter are expected to decrease sequentially in the low to mid single digit basis, which likely means another quarter of decelerating billings growth.Despite the lower than expected Q2 guidance, full-year revenue guidance of $600-607 million was left unchanged, representing growth of 26% for the year. Non-GAAP operating income guidance of $20-25 million was also left unchanged (despite a beat during Q1) and represents a 3.7% margin at the midpoint. Despite Q1 revenue barely beating and Q2 below expectations, the unchanged revenue guidance possibly means the company is confident in the remainder of the year.Compared to where valuation used to be, NEWR looks tempting for long-term investors who believe Q1 was just a hiccup in the grand scheme of things. Valuation has pulled back quite a bit over the past few weeks and despite the stock being up over 10% in the past month, the stock remains down over 20% since reporting earnings.Data by YChartsThe company has a current market cap of ~$3.7 billion, and with cash/investments of ~$800 million and ~$400 million of debt, the company has a current enterprise value of ~$3.3 billion. Despite Q1 revenue coming in a little lighter than what some investors had expected, management reiterated their full-year revenue guidance of $600-607 million. Using management's revenue guidance, this represents a FY19 revenue multiple of ~5.5x.The current guidance represents revenue growth of 26% and assuming there is slight deceleration in FY20, we could see revenue grow ~23% to ~$740 million, which would represent a FY20 revenue multiple of only ~4.5x. Despite revenue growth remaining healthy near 25% over the next two years, the stock trades at a somewhat inexpensive multiple compared to other software names with similar growth metrics.With the stock still ~$65, investors should be tempted to add or build to their position considering valuation has contracted significantly over the past few weeks. Optimistic investors could argue the name should trade closer to 8-9x forward revenue, though I believe the more appropriate forward multiple is closer to 6-7x.I think with the stock under $65, this represents a good buying opportunity for longer-term investors who believe that billings growth will return to a more normalized growth rate in the coming quarters. Risks to NEWR include the company reporting another weaker than expected quarter, which could send the shares down another 20-30% and cause investors to lose confidence in the longer-term model."
4303225,103480,2019-11-06T12:45:50-05:00,"Shares of New Relic plunged a fresh 7% after reporting Q2 results, despite beating expectations on both the top and bottom line.New Relic's net expansion rate, the key driver behind the stock's destruction last quarter, recovered three points to 112%.The company also modestly raised its guidance for the full year, indicating that last quarter may have been the bottom for the company's pessimistic expectations.The stock looks incredibly attractive at ~5.6x forward revenues.","The article was also shared with PRO+ Tech subscribers - find out more about PRO+ here.Once a stock is in the penalty box, it's difficult to get it out. New Relic (NEWR), the infrastructure software company behind several widely used performance monitoring solutions, falls squarely into this category. After reporting weaker renewal rates last quarter owing both to international weakness and a shift in the company's sales org to a regionally-based reporting structure, shares of New Relic lost half of their market value. After several feeble attempts to recover in the subsequent months, New Relic fell again another ~7% after reporting second-quarter results - despite strong results.Data by YChartsLet's cut to the chase: I believe New Relic is one of the best value opportunities currently out there in the software sector. No investor wants to hear about growing pains, especially in the company's sales org - but ultimately, these are short-term issues that distract from the fact that New Relic is the best-of-breed vendor that virtually invented the category of infrastructure monitoring.The business metrics that investors were worried about last quarter (namely, dollar-based net retention rates) saw a mild improvement in this quarter, and New Relic also raised its full-year revenue outlook to $588-$593 million, higher than consensus at $589.3 million and slightly higher than last quarter's slashed forecast of $596-$593 million.Figure 1. New Relic guidance updateSource: New Relic Q2 earnings deckIn spite of this, the company still trades at bargain-basement valuations. At present share prices around $62 (45% below year-to-date highs of $109), New Relic trades at a market cap of $3.63 billion. After netting out $777.5 million of cash and $416.3 million of convertible debt on New Relic's balance sheet, we arrive at an enterprise value of $3.29 billion. That represents a modest valuation multiple of 5.6x EV/FY20 revenues, based on the midpoint of New Relic's latest revenue guidance. Recall that in the past, New Relic traded at valuation multiples in the low teens - even though growth has slowed down to <30% y/y versus growth in the high 30s last year, I don't see that as warranting a ~50% valuation cut.There's also no doubt that New Relic is still playing in a hot sector. One of New Relic's only competitors, the New York-based startup Datadog (DDOG), recently went public and is trading at a >20x forward revenue valuation.In time, sentiment will improve on New Relic as it notches a few more quarters of solid results to wash away the memory of 1Q20. In my view, the stock is worth at least 8x EV/FY20 revenues (still at a discount to historical averages, owing to the near-term sales uncertainty), implying a price target of $87 and 40% upside from current levels. Stay long here.If there's one thing we can say about New Relic, it's that investors and Wall Street just aren't expecting much from the company anymore - setting it up perfectly for nice beats. Here's a look at the company's latest second-quarter results:Figure 2. New Relic 2Q20 resultsSource: New Relic Q2 earnings releaseRevenues grew 27% y/y to $145.8 million, which decelerated three points relative to last quarter's 30% y/y growth rate, but was altogether expected thanks to last quarter's sales warnings. New Relic still came in two points ahead of expectations at $143.4 million, or +25% y/y.Underneath the hood, we also saw a lot of positive trends in the key business metrics that scared investors off last quarter. In particular, we note that the company's dollar-based net retention rate jumped back up to 112% this quarter, three points stronger than last quarter's nadir of 109%. We note as well that New Relic's average annualized revenue per business account continued to march to new all-time highs at >$34,500 this quarter, indicating that New Relic continues to see success in upselling its customer base (albeit at a lower upsell rate than in prior years).Figure 3. New Relic key metricsSource: New Relic Q2 earnings deckFrom last quarter's earnings commentary, we learned that a lot of the company's sales issues were due to a lack of sales hiring (a common theme across the software sector - many fast-growing SaaS companies, like Pluralsight (PS), have failed to keep up sales hiring at an appropriate pace to support revenue growth). New Relic has taken steps to remedy that this quarter, but CFO Mark Sachleben noted that most of these hires (150 net new heads in the quarter) were back-end loaded. It will take time for new sales hires to ramp up and become full quota-carrying reps, but eventually once New Relic can seed its key territories with tenured salespeople, we should see a recovery in revenue growth rates.Here's some additional qualitative commentary from CEO Lew Cirne's prepared remarks on the Q2 earnings call, detailing the company's updated priorities and execution plan (key points highlighted):In short - New Relic has taken steps to correct the slowdown in performance over the past two quarters, and the worst may be behind us as the company beefs up its sales org and clarifies its go-to-market structure.And despite the sales turmoil, we note as well that New Relic maintained strong profitability results. Pro forma gross margins remained high at 84%, at the high end of the company's long-term target range of 80-84%. Pro forma operating margins also held flat at 8%, higher than full-year results in all prior years:Figure 4. New Relic margins vs. targetsSource: New Relic Q2 earnings deckThe company's pro forma EPS of $0.24 also showed massive upside to Wall Street's consensus of $0.15.Buy New Relic while market sentiment is still weak. Though it's true that the company's top-line performance has considerably weakened from last year, we can bank on a near to medium-term recovery as the company strengthens its sales force. From a product perspective, New Relic still remains king of the hill - in August, a Gartner survey named it the top-ranked solution for Application Performance Monitoring - so there's little concern for the company's long-term demand and growth trajectory. At just 5.6x forward revenues, the risk-reward profile is heavily tilted in favor of bulls - stay long and wait for the rebound."
4293824,104952,2019-09-26T19:02:38-04:00,"New Relic announced a downgrade of its Q2 revenue guidance in its Q1 earnings call, though its full-year revenue guidance of $600 million to $607 million remains unchanged.Over a month, post-Q1 earnings call, New Relic revealed a management shakeup. The company revised its FY 2020 revenue guidance to be in between $586 million and $593 million.Trading at 30% lower than its pre-Q1 price/share due to its recent headwinds, we believe that New Relic is fairly priced.We maintain our neutral position pending the progress of Relic One's adoption and resolution of the recent issues by the management over the next two quarters.","New Relic (NEWR) shares dropped by 30% to its 1-year low around $64 per share, following its Q1 earnings call, despite beating its guidance, much due to what the CEO claimed to be internal sales execution and hiring issues. Q1 saw the company beat its non-GAAP EPS by $0.11 and its revenue guidance by $1.27 million. The Q1 revenue was $141 million, which represents a 30% YoY growth. The only downside outlook here was the Q2 revenue guidance of $143-145 million, which was below the consensus of $146 million.Unfortunately, just recently, it appears that the internal issues the CEO blamed for the weaker Q2 guidance turned out to be much more severe than what we anticipated. Just a little over a month after the Q1 earnings call, its Technology Chief and Chief Revenue Officer (CRO) have resigned, which forced the company to cut its FY 2020 revenue forecast further. As a result, we are staying neutral on the stock at least until new appointments are made to replace the leaving CRO and Technology Chief.Earlier last month, during the Q1 earnings call, the CEO, Lew Cirne, broke the news that the company could not achieve its internal sales target despite beating its guidance:(Source: Seeking Alpha)In the last two years, we have always known the management to underpromise and overdeliver on its revenue guidance. On that note, we brushed aside the latest minor adjustment on the Q2 guidance. Besides, the FY 2020 revenue guidance remains unchanged.However, taking into account the CEO’s relatively blunt statement and the management’s reputation on underpromising and overdelivering, in hindsight, we probably should have guessed that there was a greater issue. Unsurprisingly, the news broke out about a month later that New Relic needed to cut its FY 2020 revenue guidance following the resignation of its two key chief executives, one of them being the one heavily involved in sales execution.The underperformance issue in Q1 seems to be a delayed management shakeup. The company also revised its FY 2020 revenue guidance to be in between $586 million and $593 million, instead of the previous $600-607 million. After the news came out on September 16, New Relic shares dropped to a new 6-month low of $51 per share, before trading back up to the same level post-Q1 earnings call a few days later. Though the previous shares drop post-Q1 earnings call might seem like a little overreaction from the crowd, we now have an impression that much of the recent headwinds are already priced in by the crowd.In APM (Application Performance Management) space, New Relic competes head-to-head with the recently IPOed Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG), Cisco AppDynamics (CSCO), and privately held Dynatrace (NYSE:DT). Though New Relic is mostly in the business of APM, its recent M&A activity and initiative to launch a programmable monitoring platform, Relic One, indicate that it is ready to enter the broader data analytics market. Some of the sub-segments of the broader market New Relic enters are AIOps (AI Operations) and Log Management, where it competes directly with Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK).(Source: G2crowd)Interestingly, data analytics is the space where we tend to see a good number of pure-play competitors. As a result, it is relatively straightforward to value New Relic. Furthermore, we also believe that data analytics is the space where companies need to push for innovation to differentiate. With companies playing around with a lot of advanced technologies such as AI, big data, and orchestration, we like the fact that investors are getting exposure to these technologies through the stocks. The only question we have for New Relic at this point is whether its recently-launched Relic One product can be competitive enough as a niche offering in the increasingly saturated APM market. From a high-level standpoint, two of the Relic One's main value propositions, which are ""programmability"" and ""extensibility"", are nothing new. For context, Datadog also offers similar functionalities where it allows developers to build a custom dashboard for extensive data visualization and to get access to over 350 integrations to third-party data sources across systems, apps, and services. In the space, there is a new competitor by the name of Datadog, whose recent IPO has drawn a reasonable level of enthusiasm from the market lately. Datadog went public at $27 per share and soon reached $40 per share before trading at ~$38 per share currently. In terms of growth, Datadog is faster than New Relic. Datadog grew its revenue almost twice as much from $100.8 million in FY 2017 to $198.1 million in FY 2018. The revenue also further grew from $85.4 million in the first half of FY 2018 to $153.3 million in the first half of FY 2019. Datadog also has a 146% net retention in the first half of FY 2019, which is higher than New Relic’s Q4 2019 and Q1 2020 net retention rates of 131% and 109%, respectively. Using its FY 2018 revenue and recent price per share, we estimate Datadog’s P/S to be around 4.57, which is lower than New Relic’s 6.73 P/S despite having a faster YoY growth rate. We think that New Relic’s relatively much stronger FCF and gross margin positions than Datadog justify its premium valuation. Compared to Splunk that has an 8.49 TTM P/S and relatively similar gross margin yet higher FCF margin, for instance, New Relic trades lower at 6.73 P/S. Due to the recent issues involving management shakeup and increasingly heated competition, we feel that the stock is fairly priced today. New Relic shares have dropped by almost 30% since its Q1 earnings call. Given the management’s tendency to underpromise and overdeliver on its revenue guidance, there is also a high chance for New Relic to meet the expectations and trade upwards after Q2. However, we plan to maintain our neutral position until after two conditions are met: 1) new appointments are made to replace the outgoing executives. 2) the new product, New Relic One, acquires significant traction resulting in at least 5-10 PPS increase in currently-weakened Net Dollar Retention over the next two quarters."
4275167,21815,2019-07-16T09:19:27-04:00,"The increasing strategic importance of digitalization is a powerful tailwind for the company.Its SaaS business model enjoys huge gross margins and gives it plenty of opportunities for up-selling.There are some negatives, though, there has been, and will be, significant dilution and we see limited room for valuation multiple expansion.","We were impressed with APM (application performance management) company New Relic (NEWR) when we wrote about them over a year ago.But as impressed as we were (and still are) with the business model (which we described in some detail in the linked article), we did argue that the shares needed to cool off as they seemed fully valued, if not overpriced at the time. Well, since that article appeared in June 2018, the shares have given back 15%+ or so:They also dipped quite a bit below that in-between, enough for us to advise to jump in when we wrote another article in October last year, but that only worked to some extent, the shares are up just under 6% from the time of publishing that last article, which is a bit disappointing.The growth opportunities and the ways the company is addressing these we identified in our previous articles are still there and their combined effect can be summed up with a slide from the earnings deck:They introduced their new platform New Relic One which is aimed at:Software is increasingly dominating operations and its complexity is rising:Many customers have point solutions in monitoring the performance of their applications, but this then grows with the underlying complexity and misses the dependencies (Q4CC):What New Relic One provides is a unified view which captured the interconnections and dependencies and is curated with clients being guided at what metrics they have to watch (Q4CC):It looks like that integrated view catching dependencies is where the company's competitive advantage is resting on. Given the win and retention rates, they have a strong competitive position versus the legacy APM centric vendors.But there is a new class of competition emerging that (like New Relic) focuses on modern environment (cloud, containers, kubernetes, etc.), describing these on the Q4CC:And that's why, in the words of management, the New Relic One platform is a game changer because it runs at a pan enterprise level catching all these interdependencies.New Relic One will also consolidate the often large numbers of New Relic accounts that big customers have, which could be as high as 200+ (Q4CC):New Relic One also simplifies the number of tools so big customers do not have to switch so often between tools (Q4CC):New Relic One will be free for existing accounts and offered as a complementary view as to not uproot their existing products and assist them with the learning process.Nevertheless, there are some indications that New Relic hasn't cornered the market. For what it's worth, FinancesOnline compares New Relic with Dynatrace (NYSE:DT) and seems to come out slightly in favor of the latter, although this is likely to apply to the legacy APM solutions. Indeed, it chimes with Gartner's famous quadrant:One of the nice features of SaaS platform business models is the endless opportunities it provides to add bells and whistles and open up new revenue streams and opportunities for up-selling.This they have been doing, of course, adding new products like infrastructure, insights and Lambda.Additional functionality can be either:Three new products are scheduled for fiscal 2020 (which started already in April):SignifAI was acquired and this AI solution is aiming to significantly reduce the number of alerts customers get (up to 50K a day!). It's going to be part of New Relic One, but it's not ready yet.The SignifAI acquisition fits nicely in the unified perspective of New Relic One, from The New Stack:The company also integrates with a host of other solutions and open source technologies. There are several metrics that account for the land and expand strategy:From the earnings deck:The company also has a longer-term target operating model:Data by YChartsMargins have been trending up for a while. Operational margins are taking a bit of a hit because of the increased investment in R&D and S&A. Apart from the cost, it will also take some time getting these new people up to speed. They hired more than 500 people during the year and this year that will be somewhat less (so in percentage terms, the decline is likely to be significant).The company is significantly increasing its cash flow:Data by YChartsWhether the seemingly accelerated improvement will continue doesn't seem quite likely, at least not this year, as:Guidance for free cash flow this year is $55M-$65M which would consolidate recent gains but not add to them.Free cash flow comes almost entirely from stock-based compensation and it's not surprising there has been significant dilution:Data by YChartsThe company has $405.9M in long-term debt (0.5% senior convertible notes) and $744.7M in cash and equivalents.Data by YChartsOne should keep in mind that in addition to the 58.4M shares outstanding, there are 18M+ shares in additional dilution from incentive pay, a 30%+ dilution, from the 10-K:The senior notes will also convert but these are already included in the EV/S multiple, of course.Analysts expect an (non-GAAP) EPS of $0.60, rising to $1.08 next year, but it's still to early to value the company on an earnings basis.The company is still in the expansion phase, investing heavily in R&D, S&M and acquisitions, and so it should be, since it is already generating positive free cash flow and is faced with large market opportunities.The company has a history of earnings and revenue beats, and there is little reason to assume this will change anytime soon.The company hasn't yet reached the scale where it generates so much cash that it can start buying back shares and countering the (substantial) dilutive effects of incentive pay.Two metrics stand out, the terrific gross margins (85% in Q4) and the net dollar expansion rate of 131% which testify to the inherent profitability of the model. There is a lot of inherent operational leverage, but this is still mostly invested in growth.We see just a little room for valuation multiple expansion. While the company certainly isn't valued at the top end of the SaaS pyramid, 10x sales isn't exactly cheap either. They do have competition and debt, and there is still 30% dilution coming.That doesn't mean there isn't any upside in the shares, we think there is, market circumstances providing. Growth might slow down a bit, but will be very brisk for some time to come and the investments in R&D and S&M are tapering off this year so leverage is likely to improve at some point."
4283243,103480,2019-08-08T12:18:02-04:00,"Shares of New Relic crashed more than 30% after reporting Q1 results, despite beating Wall Street's top and bottom line expectations.
        The company's Q2 guidance came in below consensus, and calls for growth to decelerate five points to 25% y/y.
        Like many other SaaS companies over the past two quarters, New Relic cited sales execution and hiring issues as the primary drivers behind the lower forecast.
        Net expansion rate also fell to 109%, nine points weaker than 118% in the year-ago period.
        Despite the near-term weaknesses, New Relic remains at a multi-year low and is highly buyable at a valuation of ~5x forward revenues.","In a stunning reversal of fortunes, application monitoring company New Relic (NEWR) has crashed to new lows after it became the latest enterprise software company to report on ""sales execution issues"" - which is the worst thing for software investors to hear about. Despite performing ahead of expectations in the first quarter, New Relic noted some softness in sales momentum that impacted billings as well as a more developed competitive landscape. Once an investor favorite that ranked among the most expensive stocks in the software sector, New Relic has now essentially given up all of its gains for the year and is down 30% YTD:Of course, I'm of the opinion that any time there's blood in the streets, patient and opportunistic investors should be sniffing around (I deployed the same tactic last week in buying Zendesk (ZEN), where a small whiff of weakness in Europe caused a ~20% plunge in shares). It's important for us to assess two things: first, how bad is the last news from the company, and does the valuation drop overcompensate for the weakness?Let's address New Relic's valuation drop first. At present share prices around ~$57, New Relic has a market cap of $3.33 billion. After we net out the company's $768.9 million of balance sheet cash against $411.1 million of convertible debt, we arrive at an enterprise value of $3.08 billion. Here's how that stacks up against New Relic's latest guidance:Figure 1. New Relic FY20 guidance updateSource: New Relic earnings deckNote that New Relic's revenue range of $143-$144 million (+24-26% y/y) falls below consensus estimates of $146.0 million (+27% y/y), while also indicating four to six points of sequential deceleration relative to this quarter's 30% y/y growth rate. That indicates slightly steeper deceleration as well relative to this quarter, where the company showed four points of deceleration relative to 34% y/y growth in Q4. New Relic's full-year estimates disappointed as well - with the full-year forecast clocking in at $600-$607 million, bracketing consensus estimates of $606.2 million but lower at the midpoint. Regardless, at the midpoint of New Relic's latest FY20 guidance range, the stock currently trades at a mere 4.9x EV/FY20 revenues. Hands down, this is the cheapest entry point for New Relic to date. Take, for example, earlier this year when New Relic traded at an all-time high near $110 - at that time, New Relic was trading at slightly over 10x forward revenues. In my view, the slight guidance miss and the near-term sales warnings don't warrant the valuation slicing in half. New Relic is at the cheapest level it's been at in years, and I'm a strong buyer at these levels. It's worth noting that the dreaded condition of ""sales execution issues"" is not a permanent affliction. For example, SailPoint (SAIL) last quarter noted that it expected to face a sharp drop in billings due to insufficient sales hiring and inadequate coverage of large enterprise clients as the company shifted to focus on mid-market sales. In the same day that New Relic reported earnings, however, SailPoint's growth rates came in higher than its prior guidance and the company noted that it was rebuilding momentum in its sales staff.For companies with strong, category-leading products like New Relic, it's just a matter of time before the company hits its stride again.Let's now assess New Relic's latest results and its commentary around what's going on with its sales team. Here's a look at the company's Q1 financials:Source: New Relic 2Q19 earnings releaseIn and of itself, New Relic's first-quarter results aren't the problem. Revenues grew 30% y/y to $141.0 million, besting Wall Street's expectations of $139.7 million (+29% y/y) by a one-point margin. As previously mentioned, this quarter's growth rates represented four points of sequential deceleration.The problems lay underneath the hood. Beginning this quarter, we saw the weakest-ever performance in net expansion rates, which is a key measure of how SaaS companies are retaining and upselling into their current installed bases. Because upsells also cost less sales dollars than new business, expansion business is also critical to improving margins.Figure 3. New Relic business trendsSource: New Relic earnings deckAs shown in the chart above, the company's 109% net expansion rate sank nine points y/y, and remained lower than any other quarter in this nine-quarter window. On the bright side, however, the company's average ARR per paid business account rose to an all-time high of >$33,000, reflecting a stronger product mix.New Relic's sales issues developed over the course of the first quarter. Here's the commentary that CFO Mark Sachleben offered (emphasis added for key points) on the Q2 earnings call:In essence, New Relic shifted for the first time to a region-based sales team structure, which combined with U.S./EMEA weakness and insufficient sales hiring led to some deal slippage. Note that the Europe-based weakness isn't exclusive to New Relic; many companies, including Zendesk, have also reported weakness in the region - so we shouldn't disproportionately punish companies like New Relic for wider IT spending trends that are impacting the whole technology sector. Unfortunately, CEO Lew Cirne also drove the dagger deeper when he noted that the competitive landscape has become more challenging in response to an analyst question on the earnings call:It's worth noting, however, that New Relic remains the undisputed best-in-breed vendor in the monitoring space, with its primary competitors being mid-sized startups like Datadog. Earlier in March, New Relic's Leader status was re-confirmed for the seventh consecutive year by Gartner in its annual Magic Quadrant rankings, which carry plenty of weight with IT buyers. New Relic's premium positioning should allow it to muscle past competitive pressures, especially among large-cap enterprises. It's also worth noting that New Relic also remains a free cash flow positive company, which is a rare status among high-growth software companies. New Relic's generous cash balances plus its positive FCF gives it plenty of financial flexibility to invest in growth as it navigates through a challenging sales period. Over the trailing twelve months, New Relic generated a respectable 9% FCF margin. And despite this quarter's sales issues, both operating and free cash flow remained positive, albeit down from the prior year:Figure 4. New Relic FCFSource: New Relic earnings deckIn one swift drop, New Relic has moved from the top tier of enterprise software valuations to the bargain bin. In my view, the drop is a steep overreaction to macro-based weakness that basically every software company is experiencing in varying degrees, plus a company-specific sales hiring and re-organization issue that management has committed to solving over the next few quarters. Stay patient here and buy the dip."

Tread carefully with this speculative investment.,"New Relic, Inc. (NEWR) is another SaaS company that has been body-slammed by the markets. The stock was sporting a price of $115 a little more than a year ago. Today, it is hovering at around $64 after forming a base at approximately $55. This appears to be a good time to establish a speculative long position, anticipating a rebound to close the gap with a target price of $85 level.Source: Yahoo FinanceThe stock price is undervalued relative to its peers and the company fulfills the Rule of 40%. Therefore, I’m giving New Relic a bullish rating but I'm holding my nose as I publish this article.The recent executive shuffle and lowered guidance for FY2020 make me think that there may be a second shoe to drop sometime in the not too distant future. The company has had some ""sales execution issues"", yes those three dreaded words that investors do not want to hear. Therefore, I plan on reviewing this stock again prior to the next quarterly earnings call. My target price for New Relic is $85.Before getting into my concerns about New Relic I would first like to highlight some of the positive aspects of this company. First of all, New Relic has been recognized by Gartner Peer Insights in 2019 with the highest rating among the leaders in the Application Performance Monitoring category.Source: New RelicNew Relic management is making a lot of noise regarding this accomplishment. But before you get too excited, please understand that the 2019 Gartner Magic Quadrant has both Dynatrace and Cisco (CSCO) ahead of New Relic in both vision and ability to execute.Source: DynatraceAccording to the voice of the customer, New Relic is the best. According to the Gartner magic quadrant, two other companies are better. Take your choice.Another positive factor that I like is New Relic's non-GAAP gross profit margin of 89.5%. This is huge compared to most SaaS companies.Source: Portfolio123It took two years for New Relic to develop the “next evolution of the New Relic Platform.” It was released to the public back in May.Source: New RelicThe New Relic One is intended to address the three pillars of the company product strategy as stated on the Q1 2020 earnings call:My gut feeling is that New Relic One was released prematurely, probably due to competitive pressures and/or product development slippage. It is also possible that the new platform missed the mark on customer expectations and now the CEO is spinning a story to make New Relic look good. This is speculation on my part of course but read the following text below before coming to your own conclusions.Why do I believe that the product was released prematurely? There are three pillars that New Relic One is supposed to address: extensibility, intelligence and programmability.With regards to extensibility and intelligence, the CEO states:With regards to programmability, the CEO states:The first release of New Relic One is out there but it is really a restructuring of the previous product with a new UI. It doesn't appear to address what customers are asking for and this is one reason why sales growth is suffering and guidance is being reduced.The fact that the CTO is no longer with the company speaks volumes about the inability to deliver. Either there was significant schedule slippage and management decided to deliver half a product implementation, or the company missed the mark on customer needs and the CTO wouldn’t buy-in on a quick re-spin. In any case, the CTO was at the company from its inception and the engineering department was built around him. His exodus means that something serious is going on.For these reasons, this speculative investment needs to be kept on a short leash. I will be particularly wary as the next earnings call approaches. I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing EV/forward gross profit (GP) multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/forward GP multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward GP versus estimated YoY sales growth for the 93 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.Source: Portfolio123The GP in the vertical direction is calculated using the ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database multiplied by the TTM gross margin. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate,"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, New Relic is sitting well below the trend line, suggesting that its forward GP multiple is lower than its peers, given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that New Relic is undervalued relative to the average stock in my digital transformation universe.High-growth companies generally sacrifice profits for growth, and traditional value factors such as P/E ratio are not meaningful. Therefore, I focus on other metrics such as the ""Rule of 40%,"" free cash flow margin, and cash burn to evaluate software companies.The Rule of 40% is a metric used by software companies to help them achieve a balance between growth and profitability. The Rule of 40% is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate plus profit adds up to 40% or more, then the company has balanced growth and profit and is financially healthy.There are several different ways of calculating the Rule of 40%:Growth - The standard growth metric is to use the Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) growth rate. For my Rule of 40% calculation, I use percentage sales growth TTM. There are three reasons for this: (1) ARR is not always available, (2) most SaaS companies grow not only organically but also by acquisition, and (3) many companies are in the middle of a transformation to SaaS and have a significant amount of product sales.Profit - I have seen many variants for the profit metric. Some analysts use EBITDA margin, others use operational cash flow margin or free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin, as I believe that is the most meaningful factor from an investor's perspective.TTM revenue growth is 33.6%, up from 93% in 2015.Source: Portfolio123New Relic's free cash flow margin TTM is 8.7% for the most recent 12-month period and has been steadily rising since 2015 when it was -30%.Source: Portfolio123New Relic's YoY revenue growth was 33.6%, while free cash flow margin for the trailing 12 months was 8.7%. Therefore:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 33.6% + 8.7% = 42.3%The Rule of 40% calculation comes out higher than 40%. Therefore, I conclude that the company is financially healthy. Keep in mind that the company has guided for lower growth for FY2020. Therefore New Relic may fail on this metric in the future.New Relic has been having difficulty hiring sales staff. Even if the company does manage to hire the requisite number of salespeople, they need to be trained and will take time to come up to speed on meeting quotas. This could take the better part of a year.It isn't clear what New Relic is using to compete for enterprise business. In my opinion, the New Relic One platform isn't ready for prime time but the carrot is being dangled. This means that potential customers have to make a decision on a new but immature product. This results in longer sales cycle times and customers do a look-see at what the competition has.The market has been bearish with regards to SaaS stocks recently and with New Relic specifically. The attack on the share price may not be finished yet. Even a slight miss on guidance or drop in billings can result in a drastic share price revaluation.There are many digital transformation stocks with extreme valuations, and it is possible that we could have further SaaS market revaluation in the future. In this case, I would expect to see New Relic's stock price fall along with the rest of the market.The trade dispute between President Trump and China is ongoing and has the potential to cause market turbulence or even drive the United States into a recession. A decrease in economic activity will have a negative impact on New Relic’s operations. Brexit is a wildcard and may affect business in the UK, Europe or even globally.New Relic is one of many SaaS companies that have been caught up in rotation out of high-growth stocks. In New Relic's case, guidance has been reduced and executives have left the building. New Relic lost more than 40% of its stock price in the last year and a half, making for an interesting contrarian play. Company fundamentals are good, including positive and rising free cash flow and fulfillment of the Rule of 40%. The stock price is quite undervalued relative to its peers. I am giving New Relic a speculative bullish rating with a price target of $85.This speculative investment will require a great deal of attention especially as the next quarterly earnings call approaches. I believe that the flagship product may not be ready for prime time and there is the potential for another shoe to drop."
4249094,104608,2019-03-15T11:57:02-04:00,"New Relic reported another beat and raise quarter, with revenue, billings, and EPS all coming in above consensus estimates.Management raised FY19 revenue guidance higher than the Q3 revenue beat, implying continued momentum and confidence in the underlying business.Although valuation remains at a premium level compared to peers, New Relic is one of the few names posting 35%+ revenue growth, 85%+ margins, and expanding FCF margins.","New Relic (NYSE:NEWR) remains one of the leaders in the APM (application performance management) industry, essentially developing tools that measure an application or software. Their software functions are in back-end processes, and the technicals are a bit challenging to understand. But, for most investors, NEWR is a name not well-known. Larger institutional funds have been able to capture significant gains by holding this name over the past few years.Q3 results were another strong quarter for the company, with revenue, billings, and EPS all beating consensus expectations. Revenue and billings both grew 35% during the quarter, and management once again raised their FY19 outlook. However, the stock traded down ~5% after earnings and has been range-bound ever since. I believe investors' expectations for the company remain high, and as valuation has recovered over the past few months, it has become challenging to build a position and develop a very bullish case.Data by YChartsAfter reporting very strong Q1 results in early August, the stock was largely muted. Then came the late 2018 market correction in which NEWR saw their stock decline by ~30%. However, the company continues to remain in favor of investors, as noted by their strong 2019 performance so far, with the stock up over 30%.NEWR has done a great job over the years at managing expectations, that is they have consistently beat and raised, quarter after quarter. Though NEWR has seen revenues decelerate somewhat meaningfully over the past few quarters, this should come as no surprise, given how fast revenues were growing (previously 50%+ for many quarters). Naturally, revenue growth would decelerate over time, and though it was 35% this past quarter, I would not be shocked to see revenue continue to decelerate into the low-20s over the course of the next year or so.Source: Company PresentationThe 35% revenue growth this past quarter is impressive and remains comparable to other high-growth software names. In addition to the 35% revenue growth in Q3, NEWR saw another impressive 85% gross margins and is starting to turn bigger profits, with operating margin reaching 6% and FCF margin now at 9% (on an LTM basis).Source: Company PresentationDollar-based net expansion rate of 122% remains very healthy, although was the lowest for Q3 in the past few years. Despite the slight downtick in dollar-based net expansion rate, I believe the 122% is strong and is likely to continue for quite some time.NEWR also posted 56% of recurring revenue now comes from enterprise accounts, which was flat compared to the prior quarter. Investors have been so used to this figure expanding each quarter that the flat percentage seemed to be somewhat of a disappointment. However, with revenue growth of 35%, this could imply that certain areas of commercial clients are still showing signs of strong demand.Also, during the quarter, billings grew 35% to $140 million, which came in above consensus estimates of ~$130 million. With the company continuing to report strong gross margins of 85%+, they have been able to post stronger operating margins. For the quarter, NEWR reported operating margins of 6%, which was better than consensus expectations for 4%. The better-than-expected operating margins led to EPS of $0.19, which beat consensus estimate for $0.12.Source: Company PresentationManagement also provided guidance for Q4 and raised expectations for the full year. For Q4, management expects revenue of $126.5-128.5 million with non-GAAP operating income of $0.5-1.5 million, which represents ~0.5% operating margin at the midpoint. This ultimately leads to EPS of $0.04-0.06, which I believe there is upside to as a result of either better-than-expected revenue or higher margins.Despite the ~$4 million revenue beat in Q3, management raised full-year revenue guidance by ~$7 million to $473.6-475.6 million. The full-year guidance now also expects EPS of $0.58-0.60, up from their previous $0.42-0.48 expectation.Source: Company PresentationOver the long term, NEWR continues to expect gross margins in the low-80s along with expanding operating margins. As NEWR grows and scales, they will be able to spend less on S&M which will ultimately drive higher cash flow margins. For now, cash flow is very lumpy, and management is looking to smooth out their cash flows and earnings over the next few years, which will drive increased value to the company. However, there is a clear upward trend in margins over the past few years as the company remains on the right path towards positive FCF.NEWR has looked very interesting for long-term investors, especially during the late 2018 correction when we saw the multiple contract by 3-4 turns. Coming off another strong quarterly report, the stock's multiple appears to have fully priced in the high expectations for the remained of the fiscal year and heading into FY20. As the company continues to penetrate the enterprise market and revenue growth remains 30%+, we should start to see increased profitability and FCF.Data by YChartsThe above chart shows a variety of leading software players and their relative forward revenue valuation. As you can tell, valuations had contracted 2-3 turns for a majority of the names. However, over the past few months, valuations have started to expand and approach pre-correction highs. NEWR is no different here, currently trading at 12x forward revenue.One of the great things about NEWR is their long-term cash flow generating potential. As NEWR scales and continues to grow revenues over 30% and likely above 20% for the next few years, they will be able to deliver greater cash flow potential, which appeals to investors. A lot of the other software names are still focusing on ramping revenue growth through increased internal investments in R&D and S&M. NEWR's leading 85% gross margins and potential for sustainable cash flows put them in a great opportunity to remain at a leading valuation premium for the next few years.Valuation does remain elevated compared to the overall market and their peer group; however, there are not too many companies out there which continually post 35% revenue growth, 85% gross margins, and expanding free cash flow margins. Over the long term, NEWR will naturally decelerate to a more normalized 20-25% revenue growth, 80-84% gross margins, and sustainable cash flows.I believe NEWR deserves to be trading at a premium revenue multiple for the next few years, and investors should look to buy on any weakness. A risk to the name is increased competition, such as Cisco's (CSCO) AppDynamics, or other competitors in the market. If NEWR saw their revenue decelerate rapidly or see margins compress, this would also put the stock under pressure."
4221140,103480,2018-11-11T20:06:50-05:00,"Shares of New Relic jumped 12% after reporting a strong Q2.In addition to beating Wall Street's estimates on both the top and bottom lines, New Relic managed to accelerate revenue growth by 60bps.New Relic expects the number of applicable workloads for its product to expand by 4x within the next three years, further cementing the company's growth trajectory.New Relic's balance between sustained ~30% growth as well as growing free cash flows makes it a terrific SaaS stock to invest in.","SaaS software stocks are roaring back to life this earnings season. Despite early tremors from the hangover effects of the October pullback and a couple of bad numbers from some of the Internet giants, most technical, backend software companies have produced terrific results this quarter. Among these is New Relic (NEWR), the infrastructure monitoring platform that measures the performance and health of IT systems.New Relic has earned a strong reputation for consistent performance, always edging above its own guidance and crushing Wall Street analysts. This quarter - New Relic's second fiscal quarter of the year - was no different, with the company showing a modest acceleration in revenues as it continues to inch toward a ~$500 million revenue run rate. Among infrastructure software companies, this makes New Relic one of the largest.It's important to note that New Relic's growth isn't slowing down despite its growing scale. In an investor deck published this quarter, New Relic noted that it estimated the number of applicable workloads to quadruple by 2021. Having now extended its products into both infrastructure and application monitoring (which gives New Relic users flexibility into the health of both their frontend and backend technologies), New Relic has greatly broadened its use cases and widened its addressable market, supporting the case for sustained growth in the mid-30s. Figure 1. New Relic applicable workloadsSource: New Relic investor relationsAlong the way, New Relic isn't just growing at all costs either, as many companies in the SaaS space are prone to do. Each quarter, the company makes major strides toward improving its operating margins and boosting its free cash flows. This is one of the major reasons that New Relic has consistently traded at a premium to peers. NEWR data by YChartsStill, it's worth noting that the month of October has modestly slashed New Relic's valuation to below 10x revenues, even after the company's post-Q2 rally. New Relic is trading about two and a half turns cheaper than where it was after last quarter, when New Relic also beat expectations and raised its guidance. With another strong quarter under its belt and with a marginally lower valuation than before, I believe now is a good time to wade into New Relic. Note also that shares are still about 15% lower than the all-time highs that New Relic reached in July.One of the aspects that I like most about infrastructure software stocks is that they are far more predictable than application software companies. Backend systems, after all, are far more difficult to rip out. Over its lifetime, New Relic has exhibited tremendous consistency, with its annualized net expansion rate hitting 124% this quarter (one point higher than the year-ago quarter):Figure 2. New Relic business trendsSource: New Relic investor relationsThis means that, not only is New Relic's installed base sticking around, but they are also upgrading to subscriptions worth 24% more, on average. The company's average ARR per account has also been consistently growing each quarter, hitting >$26,500 as of the end of Q2. Large accounts, meanwhile, are also growing. In short - New Relic continues to extract increasing value from its customer base, while continuing to win new clients and filling more of its growing addressable market. It's also managing to convert its robust top line into a nascent stream of free cash flows.There are few software companies with the caliber of high-quality execution that New Relic provides. Though I've been cautious on the stock's perennially high valuation before, it's clear that New Relic is on a path to becoming a profitable, billion-plus revenue company that is a staple of the enterprise IT stack. Here's a look at New Relic's second-quarter results:Figure 3. New Relic 3Q18 resultsSource: New Relic investor relationsRevenues grew 35.7% y/y to $114.9 million, actually accelerating 60bps over last quarter's revenue growth of 35.1%. For a company of New Relic's scale, we'd expect deceleration to be the norm - not the other way around. Analysts weren't expecting the bump in revenue growth this quarter - the consensus target was $112.2 million, or +31% y/y, marking a solid four-point beat this quarter. A major driver of growth is New Relic's extension into infrastructure monitoring, building beyond its traditional strength of application monitoring. Lew Cirne, New Relic's CEO, reported that more than 40% of New Relic's new bookings came from non-APM products, highlighting the strong traction of its newest offerings in the market. Cirne additionally believes that most of New Relic's market opportunities are greenfield - as in, customers that are not currently using any monitoring solution at all. As taken from his prepared remarks on the Q3 earnings call:When additionally considering the fact that New Relic has relatively few competitors (these being AppDynamics, recently acquired by Cisco (CSCO), as well as startup Datadog), this makes for a compelling growth narrative.Margins also performed tremendously well this quarter. Gross margins hit 83.9% this quarter on a GAAP basis, up 240bps from an already-high 81.5% in the year-ago quarter. A gross margin profile in the mid-80s puts New Relic at the upper end of software margin profiles, and indicates very favorable unit economics that can allow New Relic to scale into a cash flowing machine once it hits a larger scale and trims down its operating expenses. New Relic's CFO mentioned that gross margins might drop by about one point in the back half of this year due to capacity investments in new data centers (both domestically and abroad), but these near-term headwinds shouldn't sway New Relic's profit growth too much.This quarter, New Relic also achieved impressive efficiency gains on sales and marketing - which, like most software companies, is New Relic's largest category of expenses. Sales and marketing costs of $61.1 million represented 53.2% of revenues this quarter, down seven points from 60.5% in the year-ago quarter. This allowed New Relic to drastically trim down its operating losses to just -$5.5 million, or an operating margin of -4.8% - essentially breakeven, and representing more than twelve points of operating margin gain versus -17.1% in the year-ago quarter.Unsurprisingly, New Relic's pro forma EPS of $0.20 crushed analyst estimates of $0.12, while free cash flows also hit nearly breakeven this quarter, much better than cash burn of -$8/8 million in 2Q17:Figure 4. New Relic FCFSource: New Relic investor relationsIn addition to a strong Q3, New Relic also offered a favorable outlook calling for 31-32% y/y growth in FY19, whereas Wall Street's consensus was about a point lower than the low end of this range:Figure 5. New Relic FY19 guidanceSource: New Relic investor relationsEven if we assume New Relic's growth decelerates to about 25% y/y in FY20 (unlikely given the fact that the company has barely seen any deceleration over the past several quarters), we'd still arrive at at just shy of a $600 million revenue estimate for the following fiscal year - which, against New Relic's current ~$4.9 billion enterprise value ($5.3 billion in market cap, less a $0.4 billion net cash balance) still represents a reasonable ~8x revenue multiple. In my view, New Relic's consistent execution will continue to sustain its premium valuation among SaaS stocks, especially as the company expands its universe of addressable workloads.There is risk, of course, in New Relic's growth trajectory. As the CEO himself mentioned, many of New Relic's growth opportunities lie in workloads not currently using a monitoring solution. The burden is on New Relic to prove that monitoring is necessary. Within the tech sector, enterprise software is far more recession-proof than the typical company due to its mission-critical role in running the guts of many businesses. It's tough to rip out installed software even in recessionary times - but also tough to convince IT buyers to buy new software in a category they may not consider essential. In tough times, New Relic's application and infrastructure monitoring services may be viewed as a luxury. And, though New Relic is about 20% cheaper than it was in mid-summer, the stock is still up more than 70% over the past year and still carries a premium valuation relative to many of its SaaS peers. There are plenty of counterbalancing fundamental strengths, however, to excuse New Relic's premium valuation. If you believe in a short-term recovery in tech stocks and the broader market, and if you're not in New Relic yet, consider buying now on any short-term dips."
4215238,104608,2018-10-28T13:31:13-04:00,New Relic remains the leader in the application performance management space and is deserving of a premium valuation.Q1 revenue grew 35% with industry leading 85% gross margins coupled with strong free cash flow margin of 38%.Recent pullback and contraction in valuation provides long-term growth investors with a great opportunity to buy shares at a valuation not seen in over a year.,"New Relic (NEWR) is the clear leader in the APM (application performance management) industry, essentially developing tools that measure an application or software. Their software functions in the back-end and the technicals are a bit challenging to understand. But for most investors, NEWR is a name not well-known. Larger institutional funds have been able to capture significant gains by holding this name over the past few years.After reporting very strong Q1 results in early August, the stock was largely muted. However, the market turbulence in recent weeks has pulled the stock back nearly 25% from recent highs. With ~35% revenue growth in the quarter and 85% gross margins, this company should be on every investor's radar.NEWR data by YChartsFor a while, it seemed like NEWR was running out of steam and short-term potential. This was when the stock was trading around $115. Now that the stock is down to $83, it seems like a great buying opportunity for investors who are willing to hold on to the name for the long term. With the stock trading at this low of a level, NEWR has a nearly 40% upside just to get back to the point it was trading at a few months ago. Fundamentals remain intact as NEWR remains in full force. The market correction has caused a lot of mispricings and investors should be eager to back up the truck on high quality names that will remain winners over the long term.NEWR has done a great job over the years at managing expectations, that is they have consistently beat and raised, quarter after quarter. Though NEWR has seen revenues decelerate somewhat meaningfully over the past few quarters, this should come as no surprise given how fast revenues were growing (previously 50%+ for many quarters). Naturally, revenue growth would decelerate over time, and though it was 35% this past quarter, I would not be shocked to see revenue continue to decelerate into the low-20s over the course of the next year or so.The 35% revenue growth this past quarter is impressive and remains comparable to other high growth software names. In addition to the 35% revenue growth in Q1, NEWR saw another impressive 85% gross margins and is starting to turn bigger profits, with operating margin reaching 8% and FCF margin now at 11% (on a LTM basis).Source: Company PresentationDollar-based net expansion rate of 118% improved from 112% in the year-ago quarter, and I expect this figure to continue to remain well above 100% for the foreseeable future as NEWR remains focused on their enterprise customers. Management noted that ~50% of their customer accounts paid less than $2,500/year in ARR and nearly ~75% paid less than $5,000. This compares to their average enterprise customer who spends ~$100,000 a year. NEWR's focus on further penetrating into the enterprise market and expanding their products will enable them to not only achieve higher revenues, but have a more recurring, easier to predict revenue stream. This bodes very well for long-term investors who are happy to put their money into a company with a large, smooth, and predictable revenue stream.For Q1, enterprise ARR represented ~55% of total ARR, and as the enterprise segment continues to expand, so will the ease of predictable revenues.Q1 revenue grew 35% y/y and came in at $108.2 million, with non-GAAP operating income at $8.7 million, exceeding the company's guidance. Non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.15, which beat consensus estimates of $0.11.Source: Company PresentationNEWR also raised guidance for Q2 and FY19. They expect Q2 revenue of $110.5-112.5 and EPS of $0.11-0.12. In addition, they now expect FY19 revenue of $457.5-462.5 million and EPS of $0.39-0.46, which is raised from prior EPS expectations of $0.29-0.37, despite management's comment of investing more into the business in the second half of the year, leading to lower profitability in Q3/Q4.Source: Company PresentationThe above chart is one of my favorite charts to put in articles. We are clearly able to see the progression over the past two years and the company's improvements on many fronts. One of the more impressive lines is the annualized revenue per average paid business account. As NEWR continues to expand into the enterprise segment and begins seeing higher dollar accounts, we will see the average account annualized revenue expand.Source: Company PresentationOver the long term, NEWR continues to expect gross margins in the low-80s along with expanding operating margins. As NEWR grows and scales, they will be able to spend less on S&M which will ultimately drive higher cash flow margins. Yes, FCF margin was 38% for Q1, but this was abnormally high, as you can see in the chart above. For now, cash flow is very lumpy and management is looking to smooth out their cash flows and earnings over the next few years, which will drive increased value to the company.NEWR has looked very interesting for long-term investors, especially since the stock has self-corrected over the past few weeks. Coming off a strong Q1 report, the stock was largely unchanged as investors believed NEWR was fully valued at the time. Given there is no change in the business fundamentals and the correction was largely due to tech stock re-rating downwards, NEWR is a great long-term play for growth investors.NEWR EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsThe above chart shows a variety of leading software players and their relative forward revenue valuation. As you can tell, valuations have largely contracted to the 9-10x forward revenue range. NEWR falls right into the middle of the group, trading at ~9.5x forward revenue.One of the great things about NEWR is their long-term cash flow generating potential. As NEWR scales and continues to grow revenues over 30% and likely above 20% for the next few years, they will be able to deliver greater cash flow potential, which appeals to investors. A lot of the other software names are still focusing on ramping revenue growth through increased internal investments in R&D and S&M. NEWR's leading 85% gross margins and potential for sustainable cash flows put them in a great opportunity to remain at a leading valuation premium for the next few years.Valuation does remain elevated compared to the overall market; however, there are not too many companies out there who just posted 35% revenue growth, 85% gross margins, and 38% free cash flow margins. Over the long term, NEWR will naturally decelerate to a more normalized 20-25% revenue growth, 80-84% gross margins and sustainable cash flows.I believe NEWR deserves to be trading at 9-10x revenue multiple for the next few years and investors should look to buy on any weakness, especially during a market correction which we are experiencing. A risk to the name is increased competition, such as Cisco's (CSCO) AppDynamics, or other competitors in the market. If NEWR saw their revenue decelerate rapidly or see margins compress, this would also put the stock under pressure.Over the long term, NEWR is a clear winner and should be held in a portfolio for long-term investors. Right now, their 9.5x forward revenue multiple seems about right, but with revenue growing 35% and strong potential for free cash flow margins, investors should look to add NEWR to their portfolio."
4241245,104683,2019-02-14T18:09:30-05:00,"The massive transformation of the digital space is leading to the entire business commerce model being disrupted.Companies that are best of breed component providers, the cloud providers, the service and monitoring providers are coming together to fulfill these complex services needed to support this disruption.New Relic sits in a sweet spot to monitor and identify which components are working, and alert businesses of failures to be fixed in quick time.NEWR TAM or workloads as they call it will increase four-fold by 2021.","As we look around what's happening today, there is a massive transformation of the digital space and the entire business commerce is being disrupted. In the old days, we had monolithic software providers, wiring the internet 2.0 with a complete stack, for instance, an Oracle (ORCL) or Microsoft (MSFT) or IBM (IBM). Today, the play has changed to best of breed component providers, the cloud providers, the service monitoring providers, and the software app providers creating complex services and leading to better digital experiences and efficiencies. This has led to companies having multiple stacks of complex systems that provides for superior customer experience management (CEM). When there is a breakdown of these systems, identifying and quickly restoring the service back is dependent on these monitoring tools, which identify issues from servers to software suites and to the infrastructure layer. I am sure there would be multiple winners eventually, but I will definitely pick up one player who is in the reckoning and place my bets on New Relic (NEWR). New Relic focuses on application monitoring and management space.Let us look at the recent earnings report and read a few quotes that provide great insights:NEWR just expanded into their first $10 million ARR account and has been expanding their TAM and expect the workload to increase four-fold in the next 3 years. Many analysts also think similarly like this JPMorgan Analyst Sterling Auty, who calls the company well-positioned to take advantage of the digital transformation shift across multiple industries. They are increasing the workloads in two ways - by expanding the new product offerings and by increasing the existing customer ARR. NEWR has already made a few smart acquisitions, the latest being an AI company, that rounds out their offerings to intelligently assess and send a single alert so the customer can execute an actionable response to a customer experience incident.A quote on their latest acquisition of SignifAI from their CEO that can increase their workloads and give them new landings is below:The latest earnings report shows how the strategy is prospering as 40% of their new ARR is from their newer products, while the average customer ARR has also increased by 35%. Let us see the latest financial snapshot and analyze the underlying story.As one can see above, the revenue growth has been steady at ~35%, but what has impressed me the most is their ability to land and expand, as can be seen from the average revenue per customer, and this shows both stickiness and great execution. They are steadily increasing their presence in the larger accounts and it has grown by 30% on an average for accounts over 100K (ARR), and they are moving up the value chain with each passing year. This should help start kicking up the leverage for operating income to grow over the next few years.I have compared NEWR to more mature SAAS companies such as VEEVA (VEEV) who have marketing costs at about 30-35% of revenue and I expect NEWR to be there by 202. As the operating income jumps to about 25%, the growth may level down to 20-25%. At a PS multiple of 12- 15, this should make a double if not more by 2021. NEWR is already working towards cash flow and profitability and has already started to show non-GAAP profitability.Atlassian (TEAM), another SAAS company that was incorporated 7 years before NEWR had 57,000 clients at the end of 2016 and 138,000 by the end of 2018 thanks to some smart acquisitions. Let us assume that NEWR may have 30% of this kind of growth because some of these same companies may not need complex monitoring systems. Looking at the progress TEAM has made in the last 3 years shows what NEWR could do on its op income numbers once it reaches 30K clients. I picked up TEAM because they are also a pick and shovel company like NEWR. One might need to reframe the business problem to see the rationale behind the analogy, but companies who rely on IT would need these kinds of products and services, and a quote at the end of this article reconfirms my analogy.I agree the valuations seem high for these SAAS companies, but we need to focus on a few key areas and look at measures that are fundamentally different than the traditional metrics to make an investment decision. I have used these questions when evaluating a company like NEWR:I will end my article with this quote from Lew Cirne the CEO in a recent call:That sums up why I have invested in NEWR."
4212288,21815,2018-10-17T22:03:27-04:00,"New Relic is the leader in an industry that is still in the very early innings with lots of growth ahead of it.Coming up with new applications broadens its TAM and offers increasing opportunities for up-selling.Unlike many other cloud platforms, financials are already very sound with substantial cash generation and non-GAAP profitability.","New Relic (NEWR) is the leader in so-called APM or application performance management, tools that measure the performance of applications, software, network traffic and the like. It claims to have a number of important advantages:The company received the highest score for APM suites from Gartner's 2018 Peer Insights Customers' Choice for APM Suites.From the company's Q1 earnings deck:The user-friendliness is pretty important due to a shift in the market towards DevOps teams and the pushing down of responsibility (Q1CC):There is plenty of growth and operational performance has improved strongly the last two years:NEWR Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsIt's also good to see that the inevitable slowdown of the pace of growth has been arrested:NEWR Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YChartsHere is what is driving the growth: For a more in-depth discussion of the growth drivers, we refer to our earlier article from June 18 this year. Here a few additional notes:But the TAM is still bigger due to the expansion in non-APM applications like:This gives plenty of opportunities for 'land and expand.' Infrastructure is doing really well after just a year and a half in the market, according to management, as it's filling a need to combine application and infrastructure monitoring on a single pane of glass.All this is reflected in its dollar-based net expansion rate of 118%, up from 112% a year ago. The company is focusing strongly on enterprise customers (Q1CC):The company often enters into one department, but happy customers lead to other departments - getting an interest and before they know they have conversations at more senior levels.Not only can a foothold into a corporate customer spread along the organization, there are also more opportunities for up-selling other applications. In Q1, enterprise ARR (annual recurring revenue) grew to 55% of total ARR as a result.The company also keeps on innovating, launching support for Kubernetes which enables customers to adopt containers technology. Customers can now see their Kubernetes data right alongside the application and infrastructure data.The company has also launched distributed tracing in the quarter, from the Q2CC:Q1 revenue grew 35.1 y/y and came in at $108.2M with non-GAAP operating income at $8.7M, exceeding the company's guidance. Non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.15, 4 cents better than analyst expectations.The company has raised Q2 and FY2019 guidance:The full-year increase in non-GAAP EPS is quite considerable - it's up from the previous guidance of $0.29-0.37, although some of that is a result of interest income of its greatly expanded cash balance (and a rise in interest rates). And before shareholders start to rejoice (Q1CC):There are a series of impressive operating metrics:Perhaps most notably is the dollar-based net expansion rate of 118%, up from 112% a year ago (note the strong cyclical pattern). Margins have been trending upwards for quite a while:Gross margin at 85% is the best in the business, according to management:Management argues it focused on efficiency right from the start and that is now paying off. Margins will fall back a bit to 83% with the European expansion and capacity additions in the US. Leverage has already kicked in quite considerably:NEWR Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsCash flow has been positive on an annual basis for quite some time and is accelerating, although there is a seasonal pattern with Q2 and Q3 usually negative and Q1 strongly positive as money flows in from Q4 deals.The upcoming two quarters (Q2 and Q3) will also be negative as the company will also spend some on CapEx but the rising trend is intact and encouraging. For the year they expect cash from operations between $70M and $80M and free cash flow between $30M and $40M.Nevertheless, the company embarked on selling notes in May due in 2033 for a cash injection of $487.4M and it sat on a cash mountain of $721M at the end of Q1.NEWR EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsThe shares are of course rather expensive on a sales multiple, although we have seen worse in the SaaS platform space. Analysts expect an EPS of 45 cents in fiscal 2019, rising to 78 cents in 2020. The shares have sold off with the market:New Relic's shares are expensive, but so is basically any other cloud-based platform generating recurring revenues and multiple ('Swiss army knife') opportunities to cross-sell.And while revenue growth isn't the fastest, it isn't exactly slow either and the company has some distinguishing features:So we think the premium valuation is justified on the basis of its financial performance and growth opportunities, although it's always debatable how high the multiple should be.Swings in sentiment can drive multiples higher (as it did, until last month) or lower, and we think the shares are attractive on these downswings."

In fact, they often confound analysts, with the result being a lost investment opportunity. In place of traditional value factors, I generally focus on other measures, such as revenue growth, the software company ""Rule of 40"", and my favorite: company performance relative to analyst estimates.New Relic had a great year with trailing-twelve-month (TTM) revenue growth of 35%.

This is a good predictor of what to expect in future quarterly results. With that said, New Relic has a great record of beating analysts' estimates. The company has exceeded estimates for the last five quarters for both sales and EPS estimates.(Source: Portfolio123.com)Analysts are challenged when it comes to valuing software companies. While these companies tend to generate high revenue growth rates, they also tend to be unprofitable due to large investments in research & development and sales and marketing. Discounting future cash flows requires many assumptions that are typically unreliable and difficult to support.One industry metric that is often used for early- to mid-stage software companies is the ""Rule of 40."" It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help software companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40; some analysts use EBITDA, and others use the free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin, as the figure is useful in a later part of my analysis.Some analysts interpret the Rule of 40 as follows: If a company's growth rate plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more, then a high-growth SaaS company can burn cash in order to drive growth.New Relic is burning cash. SG&A expenses are 90.5% of revenues, higher than what would be expected from a more mature software company that would typically have a figure around 50-60%.(Source: Portfolio123.com)Note that SG&A includes sales and marketing, general & administrative and R&D.On the other hand, New Relic's SG&A expense has been steadily declining and is more reasonable than some other stocks that I have analyzed recently, such as Okta (OKTA), which has more than 100% SG&A as a percentage of revenues.According to the Rule of 40, the cash burn is OK so long as revenue growth plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more.Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 35% + 14% = 49%In the case of New Relic, the cash burn appears to be ""acceptable.""Revenue growth plus FCF margin is sometimes referred to as the ""Efficiency Score."" It has been determined that Efficiency Score has a greater than 70 percent correlation to a public SaaS company's revenue multiple, which is the valuation divided by revenue.In order to demonstrate this, I have plotted the EV/Sales multiple versus the Efficiency Score in MS Excel for 48 software stocks from my Digital Transformation stock list. A linear trend line is plotted through the scatter plot that represents the best-fit valuation multiple for a given Efficiency Score.(Source: Portfolio123.com/MS Excel)As can be seen from the above graph, the New Relic valuation (EV/Sales) is below the best-fit line through the data points.The rest of this analysis is somewhat controversial. For me at least, it seems logical to assume higher valuation for higher-growth companies, and I use the best-fit line to gauge a company's valuation relative to the rest of the stocks in the custom universe. This is a relative valuation, not absolute as one would attempt to get using a DCF calculation.Based on the above chart, I conclude that New Relic stock price is undervalued relative to the rest of the digital transformation stocks in my custom universe. Therefore, I assign a Buy rating for this stock.An investment in New Relic comes with several risks. For starters, the stock market bull market is long in the tooth, and we could enter a bear market in the not-too-distant future based on a slowing economy or a resurgence in trade tensions between USA and China.In addition, SaaS stocks are on a tear, and many of them are reaching all-time highs. Some analysts believe that we are in for a second ""dot-com"" crash due to lofty valuation levels and little in the way of profits.Also, there is the possibility that the new initiatives by New Relic may not be endorsed by customers.Finally, the market for APM is very competitive and although New Relic is considered a leader, there are other players such as Dynatrace and AppDynamics that also have very good products.(Source: Gartner)New Relic offers a platform allows customers to collect, store, and analyze vast quantities of data flowing through and about their software. The company has YoY revenue growth of 35% and is likely to achieve significant growth for several years as a result of new features in the pipeline. The company scores quite well on the Rule of 40. I believe it is fairly valued relative to other software stocks. What's not to like?This investment comes with significant risks, however. All digital transformation-enabling stocks have lofty values. At some point in time, these companies may come down to earth. There is also intense competition. But I believe that New Relic, with its more reasonable valuation, is a buying opportunity and investors should not miss out. Therefore, I assign a Buy rating to New Relic.Keep an eye out for my soon-to-be-launched Digital Transformation marketplace service!"

The tech company is actually highly profitable with a revenue base still below $500 million like the companies of the past. Investors have to pay up for the stock, but a company that generates money every day it opens for business reduces the ultimate risk in long-term ownership.Image Source: New Relic websiteThe applications performance monitoring or APM market is only going to grow. Companies moving to the cloud need advanced tools to monitor the performance of their applications in a dynamic world.Epic Games uses New Relic for running Fortnite with millions of users competing in games where up to 100 players battle to be the last person standing. The battle royale format requires real-time performance monitoring. Gamers aren't going to continue to playing Fortnite and spending billions on in-app purchases, if the game isn't performing as designed. Performance issues could quickly send players to another battle royale game causing Epic Games millions, if not billions, in revenues by not proactively monitoring the app.The stock unfortunately caught onto this impressive market opportunity. New Relic already trades with the Cloud Kings at market multiples. The forward P/S multiple is now up at nearly 12x similar to the group of cloud kings that includes ServiceNow (NOW), Splunk (SPLK) and Workday (WDAY).New Relic was a $50 stock last year and only generates about 30%-plus revenue growth so the stock doubling in under a year is a disconnect with reality.In the last quarter, New Relic delivered revenues of $108 million and income from operations of $8.7 million. As well, the company generated positive cash flows.These days finding a profitable tech company generating profits doesn't occur until revenues reach into the billions. For New Relic, the company targets a profit margin of nearly 5% with net income reaching $20 million this fiscal year. Very impressive numbers these days.The analyst community projects meaningful growth in profits due to the 30% topline gains forecasted in the next couple of years. The key note is that an already impressively profitable company, considering the revenue size of only $460 million, is expected to triple profits by FY21 that starts in about two years.One has to really decide if paying up to $100 for the stock that will earn $1.29 per share in three years is ideal. With New Relic growing EPS at a fast clip, the stock will definitely catch up to the current value in time. The question is the time period required for the stock to remain at near $100 before it becomes a good deal at this price.Maybe one can get behind owning the stock at $96 next fiscal year as the forward P/E multiple dips down to 75x. The number is still extremely expensive for a company that doesn't start FY20 until next April. The key investor takeaway is that New Relic is an impressive cloud stock. The stock is too rich despite the early ability to generate solid profits and cash flows. The ideal outcome for those not owning the stock is to wait for a dip or for time to pass before buying New Relic.Disclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

4189103,98236,2018-07-23T08:21:00-04:00,"New Relic is considered as one of the leading competitors in the space known as Application Performance Monitoring (APM).This space appears to finally be coming into its own with recent commentary from industry analysts suggesting deployment can quadruple in the next 4 years.New Relic, based on an expanding product portfolio, achieved one of the highest dollar based net retention rates at 41% for the quarter in its history as a public company.Its booking growth rate, at 43%, was almost 20% above prior expectations in its most recently reported quarter.While the shares do not appear inexpensive, most valuation work has been predicated on what appear to be overly conservative estimates that the company has forecast.","New Relic is a hyper-growth name that is dominating one of the key components of what is called the digital transformation space. Digital transformations are becoming increasingly crucial as part of the competitive strategy for many large companies. Some vendors such as Liberty Mutual describe themselves as software vendors that happen to sell insurance. In that environment, testing an application to determine how it is performing and whether it's providing users with a decent experience has become far more important. In turn, this has lead even the largest businesses, with large IT staffs to look to 3rd party software as their testing engine. New Relic (NYSE:NEWR), with the broadest range of software testing offerings, is benefiting substantially from that trend and is thus likely to enjoy hyper-growth for some years into the future at rates well above those considered by the current First Call consensus.Some readers may be unfamiliar with the concept of APM. It is best to think of it as the analysis of the performance of a user network, and the applications that use the network. Historically, APM did not offer users enough views of the overall digital experience that their network could deliver to make it terribly worthwhile to go through the trouble to install the software. Networks have loads of inter-relationships in terms of the hardware they use, the communication protocols they run, their level of virtualization and so forth. APM software can get to be very complicated very quickly. And to really measure network performance, network infrastructure has to be measured and metrics need to be analyzed. Early APM designs didn't incorporate this kind of elaboration and they wound up not delivering the value add expected by buyers.For those readers familiar with the New York Metro area, I will provide a real-life example. Let's say on a Friday evening the GWB jams up, and there is a wreck on the Henry Hudson Pkwy. southbound. In that scenario, I-95 in CT, along with the Merritt Pkwy. will soon become overwhelmed. It might be necessary for drivers to evaluate a route that doesn't require the use of I-95 (the Cross Bronx) if they want to reach Manhattan. I am sure that some more technical souls will scream at that analogy as it leaves out so many important connections. APM is far more complex than such a simple analogy might imply. But the technology that New Relic and its most important competitor AppDynamics sells is designed to locate, evaluate and suggest mitigation strategies so that users have networks that provide users with a reasonable experience while functioning efficiently.I have often wondered why New Relic (NEWR) was named as it is. There is nothing much of a relic about the company which was founded just 10 years ago. Its core functionality, Application Performance Monitoring (APM) has been around for some time now, but New Relic's set of solutions is part of a 2nd generation or 3rd generation of the technology. For those interested in the details of its product capabilities, I have linked to its most recent investor presentation which, amongst its other components, does present a high level review of the company's product capabilities. It turns out that the company name is an anagram of the name of founder, Lew Cirne. I suppose that is as good a reason to name for the name as anything else.As it happens, Mr. Cirne has had a relatively lengthy and distinguished career in the enterprise software world, with stints at Benchmark Technologies as “Resident Entrepreneur” and at a firm called Wily Technologies, one of the pioneers in the APM space. Mr. Cirne was one of the founders of Wily and wound up selling it to CA (CA) for a healthy sum that profited the VC’s; at this point, New Relic looks to be much more of a category leader than Wily has proven to be in the care of CA.Many readers and clients ask me these days if I still feel positive about making investments in the enterprise software space, especially in the wake of the strong rally, overall, and the share price melt-up from 2 Thursday’s ago in particular. Valuations are so extended, so it is said, and it is hard to dispute that, at least in taking a backward look. In looking at a company such as New Relic, it is important to note that while traditional valuation metrics certainly look stretched, the reality is that reasonable growth expectations are also rising. In fact, the increase in ARR this past quarter was at a record in percentage terms, and that is certainly the most objective way of measuring the progress of a company’s selling motion. Overall, the 141% net dollar expansion rate for ARR, is one of the highest such percentages to be seen at scale in the enterprise software space, and rivals or out-duels the dollar based net expansion rate of many other hyper-growth vendors. At the end of the day, the reason that shares in the IT software space have been so strong lately, and relatively, is pretty simple. The companies within the space, for the most part, particularly when they are not legacy vendors, are seeing accelerating growth and accelerating profitability that is likely to persist for years.Should readers buy New Relic shares at this point? At the least, I think establishing a starter position is a prudent strategy. As I will try to detail in the balance of the article, despite the recent share price performance, which has been little short of scorching, New Relic’s growth prospects, when looked at beyond the confines of articulated company guidance, seem exceptional. The fact is that the quarter reported in early May saw many non-headline revenue metrics that suggested accelerating growth, significantly beyond the 34% headline number reported by the company. I would suggest that the current consensus expectation for longer-term growth of 25% shown in the company's investor presentation and embodied currently in the First Call consensus, substantially understates the opportunity of this company, and a different expectation of revenue CAGR will produce higher valuations, even when compared to the levels seen most recently.New Relic is not a company whose light has been hidden under a bushel basket. At this point, 16 analysts post estimates of this company’s operational performance on First Call, and there are 13 ratings that are currently published. As it typical nowadays, the difference in opinion isn’t whether this is a high-growth company with a strong and defensible franchise, but how much that outlook is worth. On this site, a recent article published about the company from contributor Shareholders Unite is titled “New Relic Needs to Cool Off.” The author, while positive regarding the outlook for this company, wonders if investors can rationally accord this business at a valuation based on 7X its revenues for its fiscal 2022 year which doesn’t even start for another 3 years. New Relic’s current EV/S, based on its latest revenue guidance, and an outstanding share count of 60 million, is around 12.5X when considered on a 12 month forward basis.The issue for me is simply that I do not imagine that current investors, or analysts who recommend the name, put much stock in the company’s “goal” of achieving a $1 billion run-rate in revenues by fiscal 2022. And I don’t think many investors or analysts really think they are paying 12.5X EV/S for a business whose growth is just 25%. The math of that goal presented at analyst day suggests that the company will grow at a 25% for the next 3 years. I think it is reasonable to believe that the CAGR over that span is likely to be something more like 30%-35% and possibly more, and indeed if the Gartner forecast of APM adoption is valid, then that growth rate range will prove to be conservative.It is certainly true that APM, as a technology, is nothing new, and I will discuss that later in this article. But for as long as it has been around, most users have not chosen to deploy it. Garter’s latest MQ report which was published in April of this year, says that 5% of application workflows were monitored by APM last year and that 20% will be monitored by APM in 2021. No, that doesn’t mean that the size of the space in terms of revenue will grow by 4X. But what it might realistically suggest is that the company’s revenues, which are forecast to be about $460 million this year, will certainly more than double that total by fiscal 2022. The company ducked a chance to increase its CAGR forecast during its Analyst Day last month, although it did substantially boost its target margins for both earnings and cash flow at that time, but I doubt that this omission ought to be taken seriously.Last quarter, in particular, revenue growth accelerated. Some of the acceleration in bookings and revenue growth that were reported were said to be a function of onetime events, such as early payments or advance renewals. As it happens, one analyst noted that these one- time events had actually taken place in the year-earlier quarter as well. The CFO then said during the conference call dialog, that his forecast was based on setting the company up for success.Essentially, I think it is reasonable to believe that management thinks its current forecast was quite conservative and should have been exceeded in the quarter that will be reported next month. All of the particular growth metrics for this company that this company articulates were showing exceptionally strong performance last quarter. In particular, the 141% dollar based net expansion rate reported by the company, up from 133% in the year earlier period, as well as the significant rise in both the number and size of paid business accounts, would seem to have set the stage for particular strong performance, that likely exceeded guidance in the quarter to be reported in early August.In the last quarter, the company was able to increase the number of its larger customers, defined as those with more than $100k of ARR, by 12% sequentially. The company does not report ARR at this point, but it seems fair to conclude that it is rising quite a bit more rapidly than the growth in reported revenues. The company’s largest users, with ARR contracts of greater than $1 million increased by 78% year on year. And the company got more than 40% of its ARR increment from its newer products in Q2. Further, the company saw billings of $153 million in the quarter, a beat of almost 20% compared to prior estimates and up by 43% year on year, as mentioned earlier. All of these metrics suggest that forecasting growth rate compression simply doesn’t make sense, and it is reasonable to believe that the quarter to be reported in August will exceed the company’s forecast significantly. Under the circumstances, therefore, the seemingly extended valuation of New Relic, looks far more reasonable than might be the case if investors simply took the company’s articulated growth forecast on its face.The measurement of and optimization of the performance digital applications that are customer facing, is basically the reason Gartner is suggesting such dramatic growth in the deployment of APM. As more applications “go digital,” the odds are that the growth of APM will continue to accelerate. The value of APM for users has risen substantially as the applications, whose performance is being measured, are those through which an increasing cohort of customers generate their revenues. Woe to the competitive position of a company which faces its customers with a slow web site that doesn’t keep up with the traffic.In the past, the APM market has seen far less adoption than might have been anticipated. My own experience in the space relates to a vendor called Keynote Systems. It was both a frustrating stock and an under-achieving vendor. Ultimately, it was bought by a private equity firm which specializes in the IT space called Thoma Brava. Not my happiest of investments.Since that time, Thoma Brava chose to put together Keynote, with another of its portfolio holdings called Dynatrace. Dynatrace itself had a checkered history having been bought by Compuware and put together with a competitor called Gomez. Dynatrace has struggled in the market place with inconsistent messaging, some integration issues and a complex legacy UI. Because of the merger with Keynote, Dynatrace is thought to be the largest vendor in the space, and it is growing, just not very rapidly.When considering New Relic, and its valuation, it is important to note that essentially all of its competitors except for AppDynamics should be considered as legacy vendors, attempting to morph into companies with modern capabilities. All of the other vendors with the exception of Dynatrace and AppDynamics are considered significantly down market in the Gartner survey. Cisco (CSCO) was able to pay about 13X revenues for AppDynamics, based on some expectations for forward revenues. As it happens, AppDynamics was losing money and burning cash at a healthy clip although cash burn was doubtless not a huge concern for Cisco. But it does suggest that the valuation for New Relic is far more reasonable than might be thought to be the case.Instead of focusing on a revenue goal whose validity and construction ought to be challenged, it might be interesting to see some of the company’s customers who showed up to be briefed on this company’s DevOps paradigm. There one will find Wix (NASDAQ:WIX), Riot Games, Cambia Health and Ancestry.Com. Why are these users coming to visit NEWR as part of a strategy to use some of the NEWR offering as part of their DevOps paradigm? Simply put, having applications whose performance is optimized is really vital to their competitive success. I really do not spend my leisure or any other part of my day playing League of Legends-apparently the franchise offering of Riot Games, but if 3 million players are on-line simultaneously, as is said to be the case, then insuring that the software powering the game produces an acceptable user experience is of vital importance to both the user community and to Riot Games. Trying to forecast some kind of reasonable CAGR for New Relic is, no doubt, a fraught exercise; forecasting that it will be substantially greater than the current published consensus of 25% published on First Call for fiscal 2020 is not a great challenge.I have tried to provide an overview of APM earlier in the article. Basically, APM is a set of tools that measures the performance of all of a user’s applications in all of its environments. I have linked here to a presentation that details what users do with the APM app from New Relic. Briefly, APM allows users to know what’s happening to the performance of their network when it runs mixed workloads of many different applications. The service also finds dependencies, as they are called, and allows users to fix performance issues rapidly.Over time, New Relic has expanded its offering to include visibility and measurement into a variety of ancillary capabilities. The company offers analytics, it offers what it calls synthetics, which simulate the behavior of users, it has a service focused on mobile applications and it offers a view of both infrastructure performance, such as servers and other hardware components of a network, as well as the different mix of workloads that may be running on the infrastructure. New Relic’s Infrastructure product tells users if they need more capacity, and what kind of capacity to restore network performance to acceptable levels. It appears based on the comments of the CEO that these newer offering have become significant contributors to growth, and in particular to the high net dollar retention rate the company achieved last quarter.It might seem that these kinds of capabilities should have been adopted by users long ago, but the fact is that they have not been a priority for users until recently. Apparently, users did not seem to believe that it was important to measure the performance of their applications as part of an exercise to optimize their networks. Some leading participants in the space including KeyNote (now part of Dynatrace) and Riverbed simply ran into a wall in terms of their growth. Most recently, AppDynamics, which was growing its revenues at more than 80%/year, was acquired by Cisco just prior to its IPO.Again, I keep coming back to the Gartner forecast that calls for penetration of APM to rise from 5% last year to 20% by 2021. It is all about the need to monitor increasingly digitalized business processes. Web apps have essentially become the store fronts of large enterprises and as such their performance is a tremendous competitive issue. When looking at the potential growth of this company, look no further than that.To a certain extent, New Relic is considered to be the most “modern” solution set in its space. It is only available in a SaaS version, and obviously its tools have always been optimized for the cloud. New Relic is said to be a specialist in DevOps, which is a software delivery methodology that combines developers and operations into a single unit. Again, not all DevOps paradigms include something like a performance measurement tool. But part of the growth story for this company is a function of the rising adoption of the DevOps paradigm and with it, the need to optimize the performance of new applications as well as the need to provide virtualized capabilities. This company's technology is integrated with AWS, the Pivotal Cloud Factory, OpenStack and VMware, amongst othersHere is a competitive evaluation that was performed between New Relic and App Dynamics. I have also linked to the most recent Gartner Magic Quadrant earlier in this article that addresses the APM space. From a functional stand-point, I think it is fair to say that New Relic is apparently the leader in the space for cloud deployments. According to Gartner, its products are not considered cheap, but its pricing is in line with competitive offerings, and particularly those from AppDynamics which apparently has had some functional shortcomings, now being remediated.The major issues Gartner calls out as cautions regarding New Relic relate to its US-centric delivery model, and its focus on cloud environments. The other side of those cautions is that customers looking for a cloud solution will wind up with the most advanced technology using New Relic, and the company is starting to develop a substantial international footprint.New Relic has reached non-GAAP profitability, probably somewhat earlier than had been anticipated by many investors and analysts. Last quarter, the company reported non-GAAP EPS of $0.09 compared to its prior forecast of $0.05. Most of the path to profitability relates to the constrained operating expenses the company has engineered. Last quarter, GAAP operating expense rose by 17% year on year while revenues rose by 34%. That resulted in a swing of more than 900 basis points in operating margins. Most impressive, at least to me, was the relationship between bookings and sales and marketing expense. Bookings rose by 43% in the quarter, to $153 million, while sales and marketing expense rose by 21%. It should be noted that bookings last quarter were seasonally influenced due to annual renewals which are concentrated in the company’s fiscal Q4, but nonetheless, the relationship between bookings and sales and marketing presents a significant milestone on the company’s road to GAAP profitability.At this point, the company uses a modest amount of stock-based comp. Last quarter, stock based comp was 11% of revenues and increased by 32%, year on year, slightly below the rate of revenue increase. The company is cash flow positive at this point, and cash from operations doubled year on year in fiscal 2018. In Q4, the increase in operating cash flow was somewhat constrained because of the increase in accounts receivable, a concomitant of a strong bookings quarter. On the other hand, the growth in deferred revenues sharply accelerated by no less than 67% year on year, again, a concomitant of a very strong bookings quarter.At this point, New Relic has forecast that its operating cash flow for the year will reach $70-$80 million. To a certain extent, the cadence of operating cash flow growth will be dependent on both the company’s improving profitability but also on the cadence of the company’s bookings that in turn will be reflected in the growth of its deferred revenue balance. As I commented earlier in this article, the non-headline metrics in terms of sales productivity were so strong last quarter, that it is easy to foresee the company handily exceeding its forecast for operating cash flow.The company has a consistent track record of beating its own forecast for earnings since it went public. The beats have not been insubstantial and in the last year have ranged between 31% and 162%. The current guidance provided by the company for earnings was noticeably above the prior First Call consensus. In the wake of the company’s guidance, estimates of earnings were increased by more than 50% for this coming year. I don’t think expense discipline is a problem for this company given the significant leverage it has been showing in terms of improving its gross margins and operating cost ratios.During the last conference call, management spoke about increasing its research and development spend which had only increased by 23% last quarter and by 22% for the year as a whole. The CEO suggested that the very strong up-take of the newly released products including Infrastructure and Insight on which I commented earlier in this article have driven growth at rates above prior expectations. Apparently about half of the dollar based net expansion came from new products, and as mentioned, last quarter about 40% of the increase in ARR came from new products. So, it clearly makes sense for the company to step up its research and development spend given its ability to upsell its customer base and to acquire new customers with an increased product footprint.So far as that goes, I think some investors/observers would prefer to see the company spend more on sales and marketing in order to increase the company’s sales capacity. It would seem likely that the company ought to be increasing its sales and marketing spend significantly faster than the low 20% range that prevailed last year, if that would result in a continuation of the substantial customer acquisition numbers and the kind of upsell seen most recently.Almost certainly, investors are buying New Relic shares for hyper-growth and not because it has a high free cash flow yield-which it doesn't, or because it is reporting strong non-GAAP earnings-which it won't for some time yet. Any company that can achieve 141% net dollar expansion rate is certainly poised to achieve hyper-growth, even if some of the upside in that metric was said to be one time in nature.New Relic is one of the companies that has taken advantage of the free money on offer to hyper-growth IT vendors this spring. The company wound up selling about $488 million of convertible notes with a coupon rate of 0.50%. The conversion rate was $110.81/share which was a premium of 27.9% at the time of the offering. Of course, at this point, the shares have just crossed over the offering price. Overall, the offering had the potential to add 7.5% to the outstanding shares. Presumably, other than the amount of the proceeds that is being used to enter into the capped call transactions in order to limit dilution, the company will wind up using the balance of the proceeds to make strategic acquisitions in order to enhance its growth rate. In the two months since the transaction was consummated, New Relic has not made any acquisitions.This company has an experienced management team, and one of the more profitable things that enterprise software companies can do is to find tuck-in acquisitions to extend their product footprint. The contribution margin of such acquisitions can be extremely high, and revenue synergies, which are hard to forecast, often exceed expectations. While I don't know if the company has a specific target in mind, I am glad to see that they have the necessary firepower in terms of cash to take advantage opportunistically of the potential to grow horizontally and vertically. At the least, I would imagine, that the extra shares the company will issue, will not be dilutive as they will be used to insure more rapid revenue growth.At its current size and valuation, it is not inconceivable that New Relic might be a candidate for consolidation, although given the company’s operating performance, the required premium is going to result in a valuation that many acquirers might find excessive. I would not acquire these shares based on an expectation that the company will be acquired in the near-term.New Relic announced a partnership with IBM as a component of its expansion plan in Europe. The partnership at this point is essentially one that uses IBM’s cloud infrastructure to host New Relic’s APM and ancillary offering. New Relic has not really been focused on international expansion thus far. The choice of IBM for European cloud infrastructure will provide New Relic and its users a choice of where application data is stored, something that is mandated these days because of privacy requirements.As is often the case with agreements of these types, IBM will be able to resell New Relic, despite the fact that it has offered a competitive service until this time. IBM has had its own solution in the space, but New Relic scores better in most user evaluations, and I imagine that over time, IBM will de-emphasize its own offering. I do not imagine this is a precursor to an acquisition. Overall, I believe European expansion is part of New Relic’s enterprise strategy which should result in the company’s ability to close increasingly larger deals with multi-national vendors and to enhance the company's CAGR for the next several years.No one could possibly pretend that investing in any name whose valuation rests on hyper-growth into the intermediate future is without risk. I have, in several past articles, acknowledged that the valuations for IT equities have moved into a new realm that requires new assumptions to justify. The thesis that enterprise software is experiencing a very strong rising tide is one that is challenged in the minds of investors from time to time. And New Relic shares are as much at risk when investors mentally challenge hyper-growth, as are the shares of other hyper-growth names. In the last market swoon in late June, NEWR shares fell 12% without any particular catalyst other than a pullback in the market for tech names.I think any company trying to manage through hyper-growth inevitably confronts execution risks. This company has to hire at prodigious rates in a very competitive market for talent. In particular, it has to hire developers and implementation personnel, and talented individuals in those spaces are in short supply. The CEO wants to ramp research and development, and so he should, as I have observed elsewhere in this article. But how to attract the proper staffing and to provide them with infrastructure is a non-trivial undertaking.I do not think competition will turn out to be a huge problem. Neither Cisco nor Thoma Brava are enterprises that are likely to be overly aggressive in competing with NEWR. And it is always possible that users don't behave in the way Gartner has forecasted in terms of expanding their deployment of APM. In my view, however, the likelihood is that Gartner, has, if anything erred on the side of conservatism.Overall, readers and investors need a strong stomach to deal with the seemingly random ups and down of tech stocks, and owning New Relic will be no different.I have never made a secret of my belief that most price targets are creatures of the devil. They imply a degree of certainty that simply doesn't exist. For many years I produced price targets predicated on using DCF analysis. The problem with that analysis for a vehicle such as New Relic is there is no reasonable concordance of opinion regarding the company's longer-term growth rate, to say nothing of its profitability. I believe that New Relic will most likely grow in the low to mid 30% range for the next several years for the reasons I depicted earlier in this article. If that happens, then rather than reach $1 billion in revenues in fiscal 2022, the company should achieve revenues in the range of $1.15 billion in fiscal 2022, with an exit run rate of above $1.2 billion, or 20% above the projection the company has made. I mentioned earlier in this report that one writer on this site felt that paying 7X revenues expected in fiscal 2022 is a bit of a stretch. What I believe investors are paying now is an EV/S of about 5.3X, based on my expectation for revenues in fiscal 2022, and that changes the valuation calculus substantially.The company has a non-GAAP operating margin target for FY 2022 of 8%-10% and a long-term operating margin target of 20%-25%. The issue for valuation analysis is will the company be sustaining growth of 30% or more in fiscal 2022, or what is an appropriate rate to use. Using the New Relic margin forecast would produce EPS of around $1.50/share in 2022. But as I have been at pains to demonstrate, this company, with a dollar based net retention rate of 140%, has the potential to generate very substantial margins non-GAAP operating margins; upselling users is one of the more profitable undertakings for an enterprise software vendor. The company's cash flow for fiscal 2022, not currently forecast by the company, will almost surely exceed its reported non-GAAP earnings handily because of the company's continuing pivot to a higher ASP, with multi-year deals sold to the enterprise.My one year price target for these shares based on a revenue outlook of $650 million for fiscal year 2020 is between $125-$130/share, although continued strength in bookings might cause me to make an upward adjustment.Investors are always looking for catalysts. I expect for New Relic, most catalysts will come in connection with quarterly performance, and to a lesser extent from revised guidance. I think that to a greater or lesser extent, investors have yet to put together the bookings number, the strong ARR increase and the Gartner forecast mentioned elsewhere in thinking about New Relic's prospects.Should investors make a commitment in New Relic shares at this point? I am well aware that the company made a new high in trading earlier this week. That is not inconsistent with the trading pattern for many hyper-growth equities which swooned briefly in late June, before recovering to new highs. And I am aware as well that the shares are up by over 90% year to date. I would love to find an entry point that doesn’t seem extended-but that hasn't proved to be a particularly easy task.In writing articles for Seeking Alpha, I seek to recommend investments that readers can focus on for a multi-year span. My belief is that an investment in New Relic shares is one that will reward investors for many years into the future. I have no particular insight into the specifics of the quarter the company is set to report next month. And even if I did have such insight, hyper-growth stocks frequently beat to their own drummer when it comes to how they react to quarterly earnings.Don't buy these shares because they will or won't exceed current consensus expectations. That is simply not knowable, and if it were, how the stock might trade remains a mystery. Buy the shares because despite the valuation as discussed earlier, this company has an outstanding competitive position in a space whose growth is just now taking off and will continue to do so in the future."
4207491,102273,2018-09-20T22:44:02-04:00,New Relic has the right approach to capture the hearts and minds of developers.The company's focus on hybrid cloud is a competitive advantage against public cloud vendors.Further diversification of product revenue is key to revenue growth and profitability.New Relic needs to continue linking application and infrastructure KPI to business goals to show the value of its products.Sales and marketing expenses a major drag on profitability.,"In its analyst day presentation held in June of 2018, New Relic (NEWR) talked about how by 2021, 50% of the global GDP would be digitized. Smartphone, Internet of Things (IoT), analytics, and the arrival of 5G are some of the drivers of this digitization trend. New Relic has a very large total addressable market, but it needs a much larger scale and scope to consistently deliver on profitability. Monitoring and performance management supplement a broader set of infrastructure and application development solutions, so New Relic can increase its scale and scope by being part of a public or hybrid cloud company.Exhibit: Monitoring is Central to Business Success in a Digitized World(Source: New Relic Investor Presentation)As companies write new applications to automate and digitize business processes and workflow, these applications are becoming mission-critical to the revenue growth and profitability of their businesses.In the past, companies did not think about monitoring and management until they got closer to a production deployment. Just imagine, you are building a power plant and you do not think about safety systems, alerts, control systems, and monitoring dashboards until close to the go-live date. It would be disastrous! Likewise, it would be disastrous to think about application monitoring just before going into production. So, companies and developers are beginning to understand the importance of instrumenting your application for monitoring and management from the time they write the first lines of code. This is one of the markets that New Relic is going after.There’s a certain level of stickiness associated with developers using any software product from a very early stage. There’s also a lot of investment that goes into selecting and using a monitoring tool and once the developers in a company get comfortable using a product, they do not switch easily. Just look at the staying power of programming languages such as Java or data query languages such as SQL.But a product stickiness cuts both ways. In companies that have already adopted a performance management or monitoring product, they are not going to switch out their product for a new monitoring product. So, New Relic focuses on winning the hearts and minds of middle managers running IT, Operations, and developers who might have a new initiative underway. So, making inroads into new accounts takes a lot of time and effort. And, even when the company wins a deal that deal is very small. So, it takes a lot of effort and time for New Relic to convince a company to standardize on its product.Exhibit: New Relic's Land & Expand Strategy(Source: New Relic Investor Presentation)As digital applications become central to a company’s operations, it needs a comprehensive understanding of the applications and their use by its customers. In other words, a company needs monitoring and alerting from its data center (or, Cloud provider) running the application to the mobile phone or desktop used by its customers to access its application.New Relic has been busy building a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet its customer needs. Companies need a way to get a complete view of their application environment. They need to identify the root causes of issues and fix those issues quickly. The New Relic Application Performance Management (New Relic APM) and Monitoring product meets this critical need for companies, their developers, and their operations team. New Relic APM was the first product offered by the company.Since end-users frequently access various applications on their smartphones, New Relic offers a solution called New Relic Mobile to provide visibility into the performance and health of mobile applications running on Apple’s (AAPL) iOS devices and Google’s (GOOGL) (GOOG) Android operating system.The New Relic Browser product offers visibility into the application performance when end-users access the application from a desktop or a mobile browser.New Relic Infrastructure provides a comprehensive view of the health of the application environment by monitoring the infrastructure on which the application is running. It provides full visibility into the server host by gathering health metrics such as CPU, memory, etc.Many companies need these capabilities for their applications running on-premise in their own data centers and for applications in a public cloud. Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) and VMware (NYSE:VMW) have shown that many companies prefer a hybrid, multi-cloud approach to their application deployments. At the very least, the transition of applications to the various public cloud is happening very slowly. Companies also prefer having more than one option for their application deployment on the public cloud. Even though maintaining multiple public clouds is not easy, this gives them flexibility in assessing, negotiating prices, and helps prevent lock-in.Each of the large cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AMZN), Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure (MSFT) have their own monitoring platforms. New Relic’s biggest competitive advantage may be that it caters to companies that have a multi-cloud and hybrid deployment approach. None of the cloud providers can match its multi-cloud, hybrid cloud expertise.In 2008, New Relic offered its only product - Application Performance Management (APM) product. Since then it has expanded its product offering and it now includes New Relic Mobile, New Relic Browser, New Relic Synthetics, and New Relic Infrastructure.Exhibit: New Relic Has Broadened Its Product Offerings and Reach(Source: New Relic Investor Presentation)This expanded product set helps New Relic to position its value across the end-to-end application stack, from the end-user to the infrastructure layer. This has allowed the company to expand the deal size from $40K to $60K (see exhibit below) and increase the number of products in each deal to 2.6 on average.Exhibit: More Relevant Products Lead to Larger Deal sizes(Source: New Relic Investor Presentation)Applications exist to achieve business goals. So, it’s important for monitoring products to link to business metrics and assess where the business stands with respect to the performance and cost of the applications. But, this is difficult to do. Companies in this space try to achieve that and closely monitor various application modules such as billing service or inventory service, etc. But there’s more to be done in this space. The closer the monitoring products get to connecting the application to revenue and cost numbers of a business, more the value that management can derive from deploying such products. This would make them more willing to see the value in deploying monitoring products.Winning the hearts and minds of large enterprises is a very expensive and time-consuming proposition. So, it’s no wonder that New Relic spends a lot of money on sales and marketing activities to attract new customers. The land-and-expand strategy also yields smaller deals upfront and the company must be persistent and patient in expanding its footprint in each account.Exhibit: Sales & Marketing Expense as a Percentage of Total Revenue(Source: New Relic SEC Filings, Author Calculations)To be fair to New Relic, even long-established companies such as Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) still have very large sales and marketing expenses. In the fiscal year 2018, Salesforce had $10.4 billion in revenues and sales and marketing expenses of $4.8 billion. That’s about 46% of total revenue. Fast-growing new companies such as Nutanix have very large sales and marketing expenses. Companies prioritize revenue growth and product stickiness over cost management and profitability in the hopes of gaining enough scale soon. In the fiscal year 2017, Nutanix had $766 million in revenue and $500 million (65% of revenue) in sales and marketing expenses. In comparison, Microsoft’s sales and marketing expenses were 16% of total revenue in the fiscal year 2018. Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) spent about 30% of its revenue on sales and marketing in fiscal 2017.It’s safe to assume that New Relic will have to continue spending a major portion of its revenue to sales and marketing to gain mindshare and market share and that will have negative consequences for its profitability. But, if the company can increase its average deal size further and sell more products, that could help scale the sales teams and reduce costs.Companies such as Microsoft (MSFT), IBM (IBM), Google, and Amazon Web Services offer application and infrastructure performance monitoring as part of their broader product suite. Those companies have a broad array of products that they sell, and they could position application and performance management as supplementary to their existing products. Microsoft, Google, and Amazon can make the case that they understand their products better than anybody else and so can create monitoring products that are closely tied to their offerings. So, they can make the case that a customer gets the most by monitoring the applications by using their native monitoring products.If monitoring products are supplementary to a broader application product suite, New Relic may be best served by being acquired by a larger player in the software business. It could be someone who needs a stronger presence in monitoring. Cisco (CSCO) acquired AppDynamics for this exact reason that it needed to extend its monitoring capabilities beyond the network and into the application infrastructure.New Relic has created a name for itself and grown fast. The market is still growing and vast opportunities still remain. But at these current prices, the valuation looks very stretched. The products do have stickiness and may have a long run of growth still left in the marketplace. It may also be an attractive acquisition target for another company looking to deepen its expertise in the monitoring space."
4188363,104556,2018-07-19T11:17:49-04:00,"New Relic is a fast-growing player in the APM space.The company is expanding outside of only APM though, into other analytics and monitoring sub-markets.New Relic has a great CEO and quality financials that make it a good name to get to know.","New Relic (NYSE:NEWR), a provider of application performance monitoring (NASDAQ:APM) software, is a name to watch because of its expanding addressable market, fantastic CEO, and quality financials.Estimates peg the APM market to reach $5 billion by 2019. Isn’t it kind of funny that New Relic has a market cap of $6.3 billion then? It’s not often you see a company’s market cap outpace the addressable market, so there must be something more. And there is. On the last earnings call, CEO Lew Cirne commented:Source: Analyst Day PresentationFurthermore, New Relic is also focused on the non-APM part of their business. The company offers six products, APM being one of them. Two notable products are Infrastructure and Insights, which both contributed more than 10% of new net annual recurring revenue.The bread and butter of New Relic is providing monitoring insights for any piece of your business. Whether that means conversion rates or server downtime, the company’s software allows you to have a deep knowledge of how your business is functioning. As you can see, it is not just monitoring applications. Another comment made by Cirne reveals the company’s mindset towards its expanding market,Source: Analyst Day PresentationWhat’s more is that the company sees its non-APM business becoming equal to APM around 2023. While this is still a long way off, it certainly opens up the addressable market. This is likely the reason why New Relic’s market cap has outpaced what its TAM is pegged at.Source: Analyst Day PresentationNot only is the addressable market getting more attention, so is Lew Cirne, the company’s CEO, or at least he should be… I only found out who he was the other day, but after doing a decent amount of research, I like him a lot.I enjoy doing research on CEOs, especially founder CEOs, because there is evidence that founder-led companies outperform the market. And it makes sense intuitively. Entrepreneurs go through innumerable struggles to succeed and he/she will have an immense sense of ownership over the company, not to mention equity ownership.Lew Cirne, sweet Lew on Twitter, has already built and sold a company before, a sign that he is veteran. The 47 year-old is a self-proclaimed data nerd, who is also known as the “Coding CEO” since he blocks off all Thursdays and Fridays to code.He also named the company New Relic because it is an anagram for his name, showing that he doesn’t take himself too seriously. But he means business. He holds 22 patents himself and he owns over $1 billion in stock, or 18% of the company. About 15% of his holdings he gifted to charity. All in all, I came away extremely impressed.He seems like he has the right mix of humility, passion, and execution to take New Relic to the next level. While a competitor sold out, he is looking to build this company for the long run.The company’s value proposition is showing up in the financials as well.Source: Q4 Investor PresentationIn the latest quarter, revenues grew 34% to $98 million. However, the dollar-based expansion rate accelerated to 141% from 125%. Seemingly, this is erroneous, revenue lower than the expansion rate, until you read how New Relic calculates it. The expansion rate is just for ARR (annualized recurring revenue) and not revenue by itself.And you can see from the table below how fast Enterprise Paid accounts are growing. These are businesses with over 1,000 employees and now they make up 54% of ARR. This acceleration from 42% to 46% and now to 54% reveals that New Relic is dealing with bigger clients. The highest ever expansion rate is evidence of that fact as well.Source: Q4 Investor PresentationFurthermore, the company boasts best-in-class gross margins. On a non-GAAP basis they are 85%. Operating leverage has also been trending in the right direction. For the full year, non-GAAP operating margins slimmed from -10% to almost break-even.Suffice it to say, the company’s SaaS capabilities are resulting in a strong margin profile and solid revenue growth. The fact that the expansion rate was higher than revenue could also point to revenue accelerating in future quarters as the ARR shows up on the income statement.Lastly, to bolster the balance sheet, the company recently raised almost $450 million from a convertible note offering, a method used by many of the top small-to-mid cap tech players in the past year.As noted earlier, New Relic’s market cap is $6.3 billion. Backing out $700 million in cash, the enterprise value is $5.6 billion. At the midpoint of forward guidance, the company estimates $455 million in sales. This means a forward EV/sales ratio of 12.3x. Certainly high, but not mind-bending. Calculated billings, a metric many analysts keep a diligent eye on, is expected to eclipse $525 million in 2019 so that makes the valuation a little more tolerable.Source: Q4 Investor PresentationThe company does come with some risks though. First, it is not a top dog in the APM space. DynaTrace apparently has the highest market share and certainly the most ratings on tech review sites. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) both play in the space, not to mention Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) that acquired AppDynamics for $3.7 billion at the beginning of last year. So the market is fragmented but I believe there is still room for a quickly-growing pure play like New Relic.Venturing too far outside of monitoring tools might get the company in some trouble though since Lew Cirne’s specialty is APM. In the end, that could cramp the addressable market and put a limit on how big the company could get. But one sign to look for is how much of the ARR is coming from non-APM tools. This will give investors a signal for how these are doing in the grand scheme of the business.New Relic has been on fire in the past year, but that is likely due to an expanding addressable market, an awesome CEO, and quality financials. Add this one to your watch-list because it looks like it is not done growing.Author’s Note: Please scroll up and hit the big, orange ""Follow"" button so you can get these articles before they hit the paywall.

4187840,20521,2018-07-17T15:32:33-04:00,"The enterprise focus has paid off for New Relic.When New Relic went public around three years ago, annualized recurring revenue from enterprise was just 25% of revenue.During the recent fourth quarter, it accounted for 54% of the revenue.","Software application management tools vendor New Relic (NYSE:NEWR) recently announced a strong fourth quarter. Apart from beating analyst estimates, the Billion-Dollar Unicorn reported the second straight quarter of non-GAAP profit.New Relic's fourth quarter revenues grew 34% to $98.4 million, ahead of the market's forecast of $96.2 million. GAAP loss from operations was $(7.5) million or $(0.13) per share, compared to $(15.1) million or $(0.28) per share a year ago. Non-GAAP income was $4.8 million or $0.09 per share compared to analyst estimates of $0.05 per share.Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $247.9 million at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $233 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018.Paid Business Accounts as of March 31, 2018 were more than 17,000. $100K+ Paid Business Accounts increased to 703 from 517 a year ago.For fiscal 2018, New Relic reported revenues of $355.1 million, up 35%. GAAP loss from operations was $(46.8) million for fiscal 2018, compared with $(61.3) million for fiscal 2017.For the first quarter, New Relic expects revenue between $104.5 million and $106.5 million, representing y-o-y growth of between 30% and 32%. Non-GAAP income from operations is expected between $5.5 million or $0.10 per share, and $6.5 million or $0.12 per share. The Street was looking for revenues of $103 million and EPS of $0.05.New Relic forecast full year fiscal 2019 revenue between $452 and $458 million, representing y-o-y growth of between 27% and 29%. Non GAAP income is expected between $15 million or $0.29 per share and $20 million or $0.37 per share. The Street was looking for revenues of $457.5 million and EPS of $0.36.Over the past few years, New Relic has increased its focus on the enterprise segment. To cater to the segment, New Relic has announced new product capabilities, customer enablement, and best practice guidance for organizations leveraging Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN). New Relic's platform integrates real-time metrics from all the components of the application with application and customer experience data to help organizations understand how the configuration and deployment of AWS services impacts the rest of their technology stack.This enterprise focus has paid off. When New Relic went public around three years ago, annualized recurring revenue from enterprise was just 25% of revenue. During the recent fourth quarter, it accounted for 54% of the revenue.New Relic went public in December 2014 and raised $115 million by selling 5 million shares at a price of $23 each. Prior to the listing, it raised $214.5 million in venture funding from investors including Fidelity Investments, Wellington Management, T. Rowe Price, Passport Capital, BlackRock, Dragoneer Investment Group, Benchmark, Passport Ventures, Tenaya Capital, Trinity Ventures, DAG Ventures, Allen & Company, and Four Rivers Group. Its valuation had grown steadily from $750 million in 2013 to $1 billion as of April 2014.New Relic is one of the very few Billion-Dollar Unicorns in the APM market to have gone public. Early last year, before it could go public, Billion-Dollar Unicorn and rival AppDynamics was acquired by Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) for $3.7 billion.Other than Cisco's AppDynamics, New Relic's competitors include performance monitoring providers such as Dynatrace, Datadog, and Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), large enterprise software and service companies such as BMC Software and CA (NASDAQ:CA), diversified technology companies such as IBM (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), and companies offering analytics products competing with its New Relic Insights product, including Amazon Web Services and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).Its stock is trading at $109.25 with a market cap of $6.1 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $111.59 last month. Over the last year, it has been steadily climbing from the 52-week low of $42.68."
4196244,103480,2018-08-08T03:20:44-04:00,"New Relic posted yet another quarterly beat, with results that soared over Wall Street's expectations.Upsells within the current install base were a major highlight in the quarter, rising to 118% from 113% in the year-ago quarter.Driven partially by this strength, New Relic saw one point of revenue growth acceleration from Q4.Free cash flow also multiplied from the year-ago quarter.However, New Relic's valuation at ~12x forward revenues is hard to swallow.","Another quarter, another big beat for New Relic (NEWR). For a company that's relatively unknown to mainstream investors (its software primarily deals with backend, highly technical services), New Relic has enjoyed quite a robust rally in the past year with little interruption. The fact that investors continue to hold out hope that New Relic might be bought out is another major factor supporting the stock's perennially high valuation - recall that last year, Cisco (CSCO) surprised everyone by buying New Relic competitor AppDynamics the day before its IPO launched, at a significantly higher valuation.For value-conscious investors like myself, however, I continually doubt that New Relic still has upside left. And while that view has cost me the double-digit gains that New Relic has enjoyed over the past few quarters, looking now at New Relic's valuation, I still wouldn't want to be long this stock.One need only look to other high-flying names to understand why. New Relic has now enjoyed several consecutive ""beat-and-raise"" quarters, to the extent that investors might have gotten lulled into a false sense of security on this stock. To date, the company has been excellent at managing expectations and executing well and above that targets - but what if that consistent cadence comes to a halt, like Facebook (FB) did this quarter when it guided to two heavy quarters of deceleration in Q3 and Q4? Reading into Facebook's year-to-date results, one would never be able to guess that the company was going to slow down growth in the back half of this year.There's no certainty, of course, that this will happen to New Relic. But what does seem to be true, however, is that it's the highest-valued stocks that have the most to lose when this happens. Zillow (Z), for example, just got pummeled yesterday to the tune of -15% after its Q3 guidance disappointed Wall Street. Richly valued stocks are the most susceptible to huge correctional swings when even the slightest whiff of bad news comes to the forefront - and I don't want to be holding the hot potato when that happens.At present, New Relic is growing at only ~35% y/y. That's a fantastic growth for a normal company, but it's not completely out of the norm for the SaaS space. Among mid-cap software stocks, 30-40% or greater growth is more of an average. Yet compared to other companies that are growing at roughly the same rate as New Relic, the company trades at quite a sizable premium:NEWR EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsYou can see that in the past, New Relic had traded more in-line with these SaaS peers on a forward revenues valuation basis. But ever since the beginning of 2018, New Relic stock has rocketed ahead while peers - though still advancing their valuation multiples - had more of a modest rise.Don't get me wrong, there's no doubt that New Relic runs a fantastic business. The fact that it can multiply its FCF by a factor of 2 or 3 every quarter, including this one, is a sign that the business is scaling well. Thematically, the company's monitoring tools - which now cover application monitoring as well as infrastructure monitoring, allowing for an end-to-end view of the health of a company's entire IT stack - are only growing in importance. However, a great business does not always make for a great stock - especially if its valuation is out of line.While New Relic's narrative and fundamentals are just too strong for me to be fully bearish on the stock, I would consider New Relic a hold at best. I wouldn't consider touching this stock anywhere above 10x EV/FY19 revenues - implying a price target of $88 and 14% downside from current levels. Note that this is higher than my previous price target of $71 on the stock, or 8.5x forward revenues. New Relic's results are too strong for anyone to realistically believe it can fall back as far as the $70s - but as I mentioned, the risk and possible catalysts to the downside is much more prevalent than that to the upside.Here's a glance at New Relic's Q1 results (the company's fiscal year ends in March, so this is the first quarter of fiscal 2019):Figure 1. New Relic Q1 resultsSource: New Relic investor relationsTotal revenues grew 35% y/y to $108.2 million, surpassing analyst expectations of $106.1 million (+32% y/y) by three points. This also represents one point of sequential acceleration from Q4 (which had seen revenue growth of 34% y/y).One of the impressive things about New Relic is that it has been able to hold a mid-30s growth rate for many quarters. New Relic so far has shown very little signs of deceleration, which is the major concern that is plaguing stocks like Facebook, Netflix (NFLX), Zillow, and more recently in the SaaS space, Instructure (INST). We do want to note, however, that deceleration often comes with no warning.Another one of the key metrics to point out is the fact that New Relic has been able to expand its dollar-based net expansion rate to 118% in the current quarter, five points higher than 113% in the year-ago period. As established software companies like New Relic often drive a large portion of revenue growth from its ability to upsell into the install base, the increased level of renewal and upsell activity is a huge plus to the quarter.Renewals and expansion, in fact, are now part of the company's official playbook. Total paid business accounts in the quarter remained relatively flat since the prior quarter. Mark Sachleben, New Relic's CFO, noted the following on the earnings call regarding the company's ""land-and-expand"" strategy:A focus on renewals instead of chasing new business often has good impact on margins, as it costs much less in sales investments to keep or expand an existing customer than it is to land a new one. We can see that in New Relic's results: sales and marketing costs declined to 53.1% of revenues, down 850bps from 61.6% in 1Q18.This sales leverage has allowed New Relic to achieve a tremendous minimization of its GAAP operating losses, which shrunk to just -$3.6 million from -$16.4 million in the year-ago quarter. New Relic's net income of -$5.6 million is also within a stone's throw away from hitting breakeven, while its already-positive pro forma EPS of $0.15 showed 36% upside to analyst consensus of $0.11.And as always, New Relic's FCF of $41.5 million (quadrupling from the year-ago period) was another salient highlight of the quarter, representing a solid 38% FCF margin:Figure 2. New Relic FCFSource: New Relic investor relationsNote that the back half of New Relic's fiscal year, however, tends to lean more negative in terms of FCF. In FY18, New Relic generated just $9.4 million of FCF (its FCF in 1Q18 was already greater than that). We'll see if New Relic can reverse that trend this year and produce substantially stronger FCF results, but in any case, the company's FCF is still too nascent to lend credible support to its ~$5.6 billion market cap.The argument against New Relic is purely a valuation-based one. Taking a negative opinion on a popular stock that has hit targets across all metrics is an extremely contrarian and unpopular viewpoint, but it's truly difficult to see further upside in a stock that is already trading at several multiples of revenue above its closest peers. The hope of a high-priced buyout always hangs in the air, of course - Mulesoft, a fellow backend-focused software infrastructure company, got acquired by Salesforce (CRM) for over 15x forward revenues - but we can't rely on acquisition hopes to support the entirety of this stock's bullish case. Stay on the sidelines for this name unless a better entry point avails itself."
4208844,104586,2018-09-28T08:30:14-04:00,"New Relic is a paradox of a company.It is a SAAS player, but more expensive than many of the listed SAAS companies.New Relic is one of the leaders in the application performance management market.Still, the company focuses on growing revenue per customer, as opposed to the industry trend of sacrificing margins for growth.The irony culminates in a strong business model and potentially outsized returns.","New Relic (NEWR) is one of the more expensive SAAS plays, devoid of the typical characteristics of cloud companies! The contradictions keep on building, right from the name to the business strategy. Despite the stock and valuations having run up quite a bit, there may be scope for more upside.NEWR data by YChartsWhile the expectation of further stock returns defies conventional logic, strength in the underlying business can lead to sustained shareholder returns.On reading the name New Relic, the first thought that crosses the mind is what kind of a name is ‘New Relic’. Why use an oxymoron for a company name – how can a relic be new – unless it is the anagram of the founder’s name. Mr. Lew Crine (re-arranged as New Relic), the founder of NEWR, has over 20 patents to his name and sold his last company to CA, Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) in 2006. No wonder NEWR has been consistently featured as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for application performance management (APM) over the past six years.Source: GartnerAPM provides analytics around the time taken to execute codes and complete transactions. Gartner's definition of APM includes digital experience monitoring, application server performance (and diagnostics) and automated discovery of performance and event patterns.The growing performance requirements of IT systems have necessitated adoption of APM tools. Gartner expects:Source: GartnerData collected through APM methods tie in to the broader machine data assessment of an organization. In fact, in 2017, NEWR had tied up with Splunk (SPLK):Source: Splunk Press ReleaseIn March 2018, NEWR tied up with IBM (NYSE:IBM) to expand in Europe and also resell NEWR’s products.However, going forward, the APM market is likely to see some pricing weakness.Industry estimates (Technavio, Marketsandmarkets, Research and Markets) suggest that the APM market was worth ~$4 billion in 2017 and expected to grow at a CAGR of over 10% until 2023. Gartner’s estimate of the quadrupling of the percentage of applications monitored (20% in 2021 from 5% in 2017) implies a volume growth of over 40% (without accounting for growth in the number of applications). The cumulative impact of these assumptions could be price declining at a compounded rate of over 20% over the next three years.Thus, NEWR’s emphasis on growing its non-APM business to help alleviate pricing pressures looks well thought out. NEWR's non-APM business includes automated software testing, real-time analytics and associated services.The company has a three-pronged approach towards growing business:This ‘land and expand’ approach across business-critical aspects has resulted in NEWR’s recognition as a 2018 Gartner Peer Insights Customers’ Choice for APM suites. A notable aspect of Gartner’s research is customers citing NEWR as relatively unyielding on the pricing side.Point 2 above warrants additional attention. Across SAAS companies of all sizes, managements are happy to sacrifice pricing for volume growth. Here is a company that is flowing against the tide! This intense financial discipline has held the gross margins in good stead.Source: 1Q19 Results PresentationThe management claim of the company having the best gross margins in the SAAS market has stood true over time.NEWR Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsIn the context of the overall pricing, the gross margins also paint a rosy picture.Despite pricing and volume growth slowing, the gross margins have improved. It is only now that NEWR plans to enter Europe does the management expect gross margin to cool off around the 83% levels. This control over gross margin lends further credence to the management’s ability to execute.During NEWR’s 1Q19 results, the management reiterated its 3-year goal of reaching a billion dollars in revenue run rate and 10%+ operating margin by F2022.Source: 1Q19 Results PresentationWhile the focus on gross margin and pruning opex are likely to help achieve the margin goal, even with the upside from the non-APM business, revenue target of a billion may be a stretch.Source: NEWR Financial ModelAnother factor is going to be the volume indifference (almost).Source: 1Q19 Earnings Call Source: NEWR Financial ModelOn for the challenges in valuing software (especially SAAS) companies is the dollops of SBC, which upsets GAAP profitability. A grouse regarding SBC has been that while SBCS is a deferred expense, it which jacks up the cash flows.Here again, NEWR presents a contradiction – SBC as a % of revenue has been declining at a rapid clip and was around 11% for the full year F2018.The combination of incremental market adoption, strong execution, margin discipline and a clear path to GAAP profitability make NEWR one of the few SAAS candidates worth considering for a DCF.Source: NEWR Financial Model. Note: A dynamic visualization of the NEWR Financial Model is available here Source: NEWR Financial ModelOn a P/S basis, NEWR looks expensive (even for a cloud company). However, NEWR is devoid of most of the characteristics of a typical SAAS company (particularly the pride that many cloud vendors have about their inability to achieve GAAP level profits).Source: NEWR Financial Model The founder’s successful track record should further help the company come out with flying colors. NEWR’s partnerships (SPLK, IBM) should allow for additional avenues of growth. The only challenge to buy would be getting boxed as an expensive SAAS company. If one is willing to look under the hood, NEWR is a beautiful contradiction with significant upside.Notes:"

It's alive, well, and performing at its best in years.Many skeptics have called out those investing in the cloud and software technology business. But just as software for computers was the game-changer in the late 1990s, today cloud computing is revolutionizing the way we all do business and operate in our daily lives. And there is more change yet to come.New Relic is a particularly interesting business in this sector because it produces software to help companies ensure that everything from their hardware to their cloud technology is working as it should. And, as of late, it has been developing products within the artificial intelligence business, which is sure to make Wall Street open its eyes. Investors should certainly keep their eyes on this one.In this research note, we explore the possibilities presented by New Relic.Like many cloud computing companies, New Relic has yet to turn a positive profit. However, its financial trajectory is positive and moving steadily in the right direction.Revenue is growing significantly without costs becoming out of control. Over the last two years, revenue has boomed. It increased by 45% from 2016 to 2017, moving from $181 million to $263 million. And revenue increases continued into this year. Revenue jumped to $355mm, a 35% increase from 2017 to 2018. If New Relic can sustain this revenue at 25-30% moving forward, it should be in a strong position both within its market and financially.Costs have increased, but have remained steady, allowing revenue to outpace cost growth somewhat. The most significant area of expense for New Relic is selling, general, and administrative expenses - much spent on marketing to new and existing clients. Further, gross margins are on a hot streak, surpassing 80% last quarter.Besides revenue increasing, both gross profit and net income have increased significantly of late. Over the last year, gross profit increased 37% ($213 million to $292 million) and net income increased by 26% (-$61 million to -$47 million). Net income remains in the red, but has continued its upward trajectory over the last several years. If New Relic can run up its revenue and keep costs sustainable, it should turn a profit within the next several years. As we wrote above, it is not at all unusual for tech companies of New Relic's ilk to not produce a profit.New Relic has also produced a positive earnings surprise in each of the last four quarters (7%, 11%, 54%, 33%). Most significantly, EPS increased every single one of those quarters, growing from -$.27 to -$.10. While net income remains negative, that could soon be erased by increased revenue over the relative short term.Overall, for a tech company of its size and scope, New Relic is performing quite strongly, especially of late.New Relic is also a leader in the application performance management, or APM, space. It is known for its innovation and leadership, so much so that Gartner rating service has put the company consistently at the top of its APM ratings each of the last few years. Perhaps most excitingly is that New Relic is seen as the premiere leader for APM in the cloud, innovating beyond its competitors.Further, growth within its customer base has been significant. At the end of the year, New Relic reported 17,000 paying customers, a 36% jump from the previous year. And, not only is it growing with new customers, but returning customers are coming back for more, including many very large transactions.As with many technology companies, particularly those in the midcap category, New Relic faces the risk of increased competition and cannibalization by larger, wealthier competitors like Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The cloud computing and APM businesses are growing increasingly hot.Further, we see profitability as a potential issue for New Relic moving forward. It currently does not run a profit nor has it ever in its history. However, profitability is looking increasingly likely. The trick for New Relic will be to continue significant revenue growth while keeping costs bridled. Prices will be an issue in this, and we hope New Relic will not drastically change its pricing structure in the event it faces significant outside competition. That, certainly, would alter our view on the company.Finally, as with every technology and consumer-based product, New Relic is somewhat at the whims of the general market, and could suffer greatly in the unlikely event of a massive tech stock selloff.New Relic is a company of the future, providing solid, useful, and vital products and services to its clients. Its improving financial position makes it a potentially appealing - though far from riskless - play.We see an upward trajectory in growth that has no significant reason to slow down and continued positive innovation by the company. Currently, there is a huge market for what New Relic offers. Why stop now?"

Well, maybe that's not always true as sometimes little piggies get their own Facebook pages. I'll leave you to search for yourself on that one - but yes - Micro Pigs are really a thing.New Relic (NEWR) has been on big run. I wrote my original buy thesis here - New Relic, A Relatively Unknown Gem back at $43 a share. Since then, it's been a turbulent-free ride up. Chart courtesy of Big charts.After basing in the high 50s, New Relic broke out to the upside on strong Q3 results. In this article, I wanted to examine a longer-term time line and see if being a little piggish here still makes sense.New Relic is defining a new category of enterprise software it calls digital intelligence. It is designed to help companies see their businesses more clearly. Your customers' online experience IS your brand. If customers are having a difficult time with your apps and website, it can impact negatively on your brand.The New Relic Digital Intelligence Platform enables organizations to collect, store, and analyze massive amounts of data in real time so they can better understand their application and infrastructure performance. This helps improve their digital customer experience and enhance their brand. In the new world, where nearly every business has an online touch point, it is of vital importance to companies to manage their digital risk and performance. It's a data-driven world, and the faster you can maximize your performance, metrics, sales programs, and user interaction, the better off the digital experience. New Relic helps companies do just that.For Q3 2018, New Relic delivered $92 million in sales, which was up 35% year over year. In its Q1 call, it had highlighted that it was on track for Non-GAAP profitability by the end of 2018. It achieved this milestone in Q3, ahead of schedule.Cash flow has been the real star for New Relic. It is always nice to see a growing company, with large margins (Gross margin hit 84% in Q3), with a positive cash flow. The following data is from its Q3 10-Q SEC report.Cash is strong. And in little piggy land, happiness is a positive operating cash flow. Cash flow is the tender blanket to wrap your little… ok, I'll stop. Ahem, moving on.The company had a collection of many positive slides in its call. I will just share a few of the important ones here.In addition to the normal things - revenues and margins - there are a couple of interesting items on this slide.Let's take another look at that third bullet point. It is helping companies embrace the Amazon Web Services cloud. Let's warp into the conference call and see what management had to say.And later- Lew CirneSo, Amazon's list of cloud customers is prime marketing for New Relic. I think this was a big part in its stock jump post earnings.Here, of course, are its large paid business accounts growing to 629.There is no doubt that New Relic has a great business and has been on a great run. But there is always the possibility of over-paying for a business. At some point, we must take a rational view of earnings, cash, and risk. Are we overstaying our welcome? Are our gains heading for the slaughter?Well, let's do a thought experiment and gaze into the future.From the most interesting slide in the presentation:It's rare that you see a company give guidance going out four years. Being that it has continued to exceed its own projections quarter after quarter, I feel it's reasonable to work with these management provided numbers. Lew Cirne is not only clever, but New Relic is an anagram of his name.Let's make some of our own assumptionsNew Relic has already forecast FY 2018 revenue at $351-353 million. Let's extrapolate that out.So, going out to 2022, we have a Non-GAAP EPS of $1.82. This excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, litigation, and acquisition expenses.The company could easily still be growing earnings above its revenue rate at that point. What type of multiple would we apply? With gross margins this high, strong cash, a leading market position, a 45 to 55 multiple would not be too extreme. That would give us a share price of between $81 and $100.All I've done is use the midpoint of the company's numbers and applied a multiple. It's not Elon Musk's rocket science, but it's a pretty plausible forward look at the share price. With the current share price near $70, a move over four years to $100 is certainly not all that exciting.However, I think this might be a bit too conservative for the following reason.There was a great question from Keith Bachman, Bank of Montreal -I was wondering the same thing myself…Ahh - it looks like a bit of a sandbag. I would expect its margins to be higher, as Bachman suggests.But let's look out another four years and see what would happen if it hits its ""long-term"" goals on margins and growth.Again a few assumptionsA 25-30 multiple on EPS of $11.13 would be between $278 and $333. So, over eight years, using $70 a share as a starting point and $300 a share as an ending point, that would be a stock appreciation at an annual rate of about 20%. That's a piggish return and a great investment.New Relic is one of the fastest growing companies in its relatively new market niche. To me, it is clearly the lead player. It is exceptionally well run, and it has a relatively small market cap of only $3.8 billion.I find it very unlikely that this company will stay independent over the next eight years. A $5-6 billion bid would probably take it out right away.I don't like to invest on takeover speculation. It's nice to be able to simply wait it out, monitor the story from quarter to quarter, and revisit our assumptions. But I can imagine many companies would love to be able to add New Relic's products to their core offerings. Even at $6 billion, they would not be overpaying. New Relic would fit well into many companies' portfolios.As for me, I took a smidge of NEWR off the table. In the end, I guess I just like my bacon a little too much. But I'll keep the bulk of the position on from here.As always, good luck, and just this one time, let's be little piggies on NEWR. I'll be updating my trades on my blog from time to time. If you would like updates, just click on the follow button. Good luck, it's a tough market out there."
4174460,22148,2018-05-15T20:34:38-04:00,Cramer might include New Relic into a Cloud King acronym that would spike the stock.The applications performance software company generates consistent revenue growth in the 30% range.The company recently generated profits and free cash flows that have pushed the stock towards more of a market P/S multiple.,"New Relic (NEWR) turned up last year as a strong cloud play prior to a double in that time period. Now Jim Cramer is pushing the stock as part of his ""Cloud Kings"" cohort to replace the somewhat played out FANG group. The hype could push the stock higher.Source: New Relic website The group was introduced on Mad Money back on March 12 and included Adobe Systems (ADBE), Salesforce.com (CRM), ServiceNow (NOW), Red Hat (RHT), VMware (VMW), Splunk (SPLK) and Workday (WDAY). Nobody doubts the cloud revolution now, but these stocks have all rallied very strong over the last three years.More recently, his focus on the cloud sector throws New Relic into the mix. The application performance company has long been a favorite of Cramer, so the inclusion seems to suggest that he has removed Red Hat from the group in favor of New Relic.Data by YChartsOver the last 3 years, New Relic has the second-largest stock gain of the Cloud Kings group. The stock is also notable as the smallest in the group by far. Splunk is the second-smallest in the group at a market value of $16 billion while New Relic sits at a meager $5 billion.For this reason, investors need to be careful that Cramer doesn't push the stock to premium valuations before one buys.The application monitoring space has years of growth ahead as application performance only increases in necessity. A company can't afford to have slow response time for an application whether a retailer that might lose a sale or a streaming service that might lose a viewer.New Relic recently reported FQ4 results that included a typical large beat and guide up. The company guided to FY19 revenue of $455 million, up from analyst estimates at just below $450 million.As a SaaS provider, New Relic generates consistent recurring revenue with growth rates currently above 30%. My original article from last June was discussing FY18 revenues of $344 million, so the investment thesis is always bolstered by higher revenues as time passes. An expensive stock can turn cheap as revenues and eventually cash flows grow as time passes.The quarter had some strong key operating metrics. The annualized dollar-based net expansion rate hit a record at 141%, reversing the dip in the expansion rate to 133% last FQ4. In addition, recurring revenues are moving further into enterprise accounts that offer much higher account values. Over the last two years, the revenue per business account is up roughly 50% to $23,000.Source: New Relic FQ4'18 presentation All of these business trends support a theme of consistent growth as the company goes through the land and expands process making for easier account conversions. The funnel for revenue growth remains strong.The biggest issue with the stock and the inclusion in the Cloud Kings cohort is that the valuation is no longer cheap. Due to the strong recurring revenue streams, the cloud stocks can easily trade at forward P/S multiples of 10x.NEWR PS Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsUnfortunately, New Relic and Splunk offered a big discount last year as both stocks dipped back towards 6x multiples. Being included in such a group might prevent investors from getting another discount on this stock.New Relic is just now turning profitable, so the stock isn't likely to get the discount of the past. The cloud company generated $35 million in operating cash flows in FY18 and has a business model that supports a quick ramp-up of cash flows over the next decade until operating margins go from breakeven levels currently to 20% in the future.The key investor takeaway is that New Relic now trades more at market multiples and the inclusion in the Cloud Kings group by Cramer isn't likely to help. The stock likely heads higher with strong growth, but one needs to be careful to not load up an eventual acronym from Cramer that includes New Relic in the list."

Is New Relic going to become an active acquirer to consolidate market share?,"According to Gartner, the global application performance monitoring market is estimated to grow to $5.6 billion by 2020. Billion-Dollar Unicorn New Relic (NYSE:NEWR) recently announced its third quarter results. The market is extremely pleased with the company's performance.For the quarter, New Relic's revenues grew 35% to $91.83 million, ahead of the analysts' estimates of $89.4 million. During the quarter, New Relic's GAAP loss narrowed from $13.9 million a year ago to $8 million. Non-GAAP income from operations came in at $2.7 million, compared with a loss of $4.9 million reported a year ago. Adjusted non-GAAP net income earnings of $0.05 per share were better than the loss of $0.09 per share reported a year ago, and the loss of $0.08 per share expected by the analysts for the quarter.For the current quarter, New Relic forecast revenues of $95-96.5 million with non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.04-0.05. It expects to end the year with revenues of $351.6-353.1 million and non-GAAP loss per basic share of between $0.04-0.06. The Street was looking for revenues of $96.3 million for the quarter with an EPS of $0.05 per share.New Relic continues to help its customers with cloud adoption through added integrations. It has announced new integrations for New Relic Infrastructure for services for Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Azure (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Google Cloud Platform (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). These new integrations are focused on simplifying the monitoring of infrastructure resources and application performance for its customers. Customers will have the ability to filter data by service type and region from the cloud service providers so that they can focus their attention on critical services when necessary and optimize cloud spend. Post the integrations, New Relic's product now has more than 40 integrations to cloud services and infrastructure components.Over the past year, New Relic has increased focus on the enterprise segment. To cater to the segment, New Relic has announced new product capabilities, customer enablement, and best practice guidance for organizations leveraging Amazon Web Services. New Relic's platform integrates real-time metrics from all the components of the application with application and customer experience data to help organizations understand how the configuration and deployment of AWS services impacts the rest of their technology stack.It also expanded its digital intelligence platform with the release of Applied Intelligence (NRAI), a set of services that monitors data to uncover and resolve problems faster for the customers. The service will help engineering and operations teams identify abnormalities across billions of datasets, predict problems, and provide prescriptive recommendations.The APM market is led by Dynatrace, which accounts for nearly 15% of the market share. IBM (NYSE:IBM) is a runner up with 8% share. New Relic has made a mark for itself by being the third-largest player in the industry with a 6% market share. This also means there's a tremendous amount of fragmentation in the market. The bigger names in the industry include CA Technologies (NASDAQ:CA), IBM, HP (NYSE:HPQ), AppDynamics (APPD), Compuware and Microsoft. But there are many other lesser known names as well such as ManageEngine, Nastel Technologies, to name a few. Are we to expect consolidation? Is New Relic going to become an active acquirer to consolidate market share?Its stock is trading at $72.84 with a market cap of $4.01 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $76.54 earlier this month. Over the last year, it has been steadily climbing from the lows of $34.61."
4171611,103480,2018-05-09T02:39:29-04:00,"New Relic finished out FY18 with Q4 results that blasted past Wall Street's expectations.Shares are up 5% on the earnings news, including a rally in after-hours trading.The stock has done extremely well both in the year-to-date and over the past twelve months, nearly doubling in that timeframe.Share look expensive at 9x forward revenues, despite an above-expected guidance range and good results.","There's simply no stopping New Relic (NEWR), the infrastructure software company that's best known for its suite of application performance monitoring (NASDAQ:APM) tools. Once a relatively unknown company, the small world of APM got a lift last year when Cisco (CSCO) announced its multibillion-dollar purchase of AppDynamics right before it went public. Since then, a string of good results as well as speculation that New Relic might also receive interest from buyers have propelled the stock into becoming one of the best-performing names in the entire technology sector. Year to date, as shown in the chart below, New Relic has shot up by 35%, including a 5% lift from this quarter's earnings; over the past twelve months, the stock has nearly doubled.NEWR data by YChartsThere's no doubt that all the news coming out of New Relic is extremely positive. The company's push into IT infrastructure monitoring (a space that's closely associated with New York startup Datadog) presents a huge opportunity for growth and complements its existing set of application monitoring products well. The company has had an extremely stable growth curve, consistently posting growth in the mid-30s each quarter, and is gradually becoming a cash flow story. FY18, the fiscal year that just closed this quarter, was the company's first full year of free cash flow profitability, distinguishing it deeply from other high-growth software companies.The question for investors now is: can New Relic continue to climb higher and is its rally sustainable? Last quarter I had pegged a price target of $71, representing 8.5x forward revenues (already an extremely rich valuation for a company growing in the ~30% range), which New Relic has completely blasted past over the past month. Now trading just under 9x forward revenues, New Relic has become one of the most expensive stocks in the software sector, in a wobbly market that from time to time punishes growth stocks with sharp selloffs.New Relic is a fantastic company, but I find it difficult to see much upside with such an expensive valuation already on the table. The company will likely continue to perform well, but its valuation acts as a fairly rigid ceiling on further rally momentum. It's true that there are a select few software stocks that have managed to trade at double-digit multiples or higher for sustained periods of time, like Workday (WDAY) or Adobe (ADBE), but New Relic's chances of making it into that rarefied group are uncertain. Investors in small and mid-cap companies like these, after all, are much more fickle than those in well-established companies with large cult followings.At best, I think the stock is currently a hold given the risk-reward profile that its current valuation entails. 8.5x forward revenues is more than a fair valuation for the stock, representing a price target of $75.This is not to say, however, that New Relic didn't deserve the boost that came after its earnings release. Earnings were particularly strong and a great way to finish off FY18. Guidance, too, points to a robust continued growth trajectory into FY19. The driving thesis of this article, however, is that New Relic is already starting off with such a high valuation that a post-earnings bump, no matter how strong the underlying results, knocks the valuation off course even more. Here's a look at the company's fourth-quarter and full-year results:Figure 1. New Relic Q4 earningsSource: New Relic investor relationsRevenues grew 34% y/y to $98.4 million, showing barely any deceleration from the 35% y/y growth that New Relic achieved in Q3. This is also an acceleration over the 33% y/y growth that New Relic saw in Q2. Overall, Q4 revenue results articulate well the narrative that New Relic has found a formula for a smooth, controlled growth curve as it grows into a larger scale. Unlike some technology companies that decelerate rapidly as they scale (Appian (APPN) is an example that comes to mind, with its recent earnings showing growth that was 15 points lower, from 50% to 35% growth), New Relic has managed to maintain a growth rate in the mid-30s for quite some time.Even New Relic's guidance for the coming year corroborates that narrative. For Q1, the company is expecting growth of between 30-32% y/y (if we account for the fact that New Relic usually beats the top end of its guidance by a few points, we can essentially judge that the company won't show any deceleration in Q1 either). For the full year, the company is guiding to $452-$458 million in revenues, above consensus expectations and implying 27 to 29% y/y growth. The company is also guiding to profitability on a pro forma basis - all forming a fantastic outlook that helped to boost the shares post-release.This quarter, analysts had only expected $96.3 million (+31% y/y), making this quarter's top-line results a decent three-point beat to Wall Street consensus. This isn't the largest beat in the software sector thus far (in another corner of the software realm, Twilio (TWLO) reported earnings on the same day as New Relic and showed a 15-point beat to Wall Street's expectations), but again, New Relic's ability to consistently beat expectations every quarter, rather than seeing spikes and valleys in growth, is extremely valuable to investors.Key business metrics also trended robustly. Most noticeably, the company expanded its dollar-based net expansion rate in the quarter to 141%, up from 133% in 4Q17. This metric has gotten much more attention this year after Cloudera (CLDR), another infrastructure software play specializing in Hadoop database technologies, sounded an alarm that a decline in net expansion rates would hamper its growth. For most software companies like Cloudera, it's actually expansion bookings from existing customers that generate the majority of revenue growth in any given quarter, not new business. The fact that New Relic can boost its already-high expansion rate (which now implies that companies buy 40% more in subscription value in the subsequent years after installation) is a bullish sign for growth in FY19. Along the same lines, the company counted 703 clients with annual contract values in excess of $100k, and enterprise clients now make up 54% of New Relic's ARR, up from 46% this year. The key sound bite here: New Relic's ""land and expand"" model is working wonders, as the company is growing alongside larger deployments by its enterprise clients.Profitability also continues to shine at New Relic. Pro forma gross margins in the quarter saw a 2-point but to 85%, up from an already-high 83% in 4Q17. This, along with significant leverage achieved on the operating cost side, greatly boosted New Relic's bottom line margins (most notably sales and marketing, which is New Relic's largest expense, grew just 21% y/y to support 34% y/y growth. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenues declined 6 points to 56% this quarter, down from 62% in 1Q17). Despite a higher revenue base on a loss-making company, New Relic managed to slim down its losses to -$6.6 million (GAAP), or a -7% net margin, versus -$15.0 million (-20%) in the year-ago quarter. With this pace of profitability improvements, it wouldn't be unreasonable for New Relic to see full GAAP profitability next year.And just like last quarter, New Relic's cash flow continues to shine. While FCF of $9.4 million is hardly enough as a valuation support for the company's ~$4.1 billion enterprise value, the fact that New Relic has been able to turn FCF losses into sizable gains this year is another strong indicator of the company's potential:Figure 2. New Relic FCFSource: New Relic investor relationsWall Street has kept a much stricter watch on profitability in the tech sector this year, specifically this quarter. Alphabet (GOOG) was one of the first companies to report earnings in Q1, and despite strong results, an explosion of expenses sent shares reeling down, a rare move for the perennially popular stock. Over the past year, New Relic has proven itself to have the exact kind of business model that's in vogue right now: steady growth that is still high but doesn't fluctuate too much from quarter to quarter, as well as continuous improvements in operating margins and free cash flow.There is certainly enough bullish material in this narrative to support New Relic's rapid stock price appreciation over the past year. A ~9x forward revenue multiple, however, will make many investors jittery about buying a stock at the top. Based on valuation alone, I'd call New Relic a hold."
4144012,103480,2018-02-07T10:30:53-05:00,"New Relic posted fantastic revenue growth in Q3, with growth of 35% y/y accelerating over Q2's growth rate of 33%.The outperformance also spread to the bottom line, where New Relic's GAAP losses shrank and operating/free cash flows expanded greatly.While not technically a cheap stock at 7x forward revenues, New Relic's momentum over the past few months has been undeniable.With attention on the APM space hot since AppDynamics' huge last-minute acquisition, New Relic is likely to see elevated valuations for a long period of time and outperform the broader market.","New Relic (NASDAQ: NEWR), the backend infrastructure software company that analyzes the health and performance of a company's IT infrastructure and frontend applications, has succeeded in hitting another home run with its Q3 earnings release. Well into the February earnings season, New Relic's strong quarter (featuring accelerating revenue growth and a huge beat to EPS as well as cash flow expansion) breaks up a rather mixed quarter for the technology sector as a whole, with even perennial stalwarts like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) falling prey to missed expectations.Nevertheless, for all those who believed that New Relic's spectacular run has come to an end, its strong Q3 results and upbeat guidance for Q4 will undoubtedly cause many Wall Street analysts to hit the reset button on their forward-looking models - making New Relic's valuation cheaper on a forward basis. For some perspective, this is a stock that has risen 60% in the past 12 months and has largely avoided the bloodshed that beset the wider market in the first week of February - a strong vote of confidence and an indicator of positive investor sentiment amidst a gloomy market.NEWR data by YChartsA quick look at the company's valuation before we dive into what makes New Relic's Q3 results a continuation of its extremely bullish history. At the company's current stock price just under $60 per share, it carries a $3.26 billion market cap; netting out its $241 million of balance sheet cash, the company has an enterprise value of $3.02 billion.Extrapolating forward a ~30% growth rate into the next twelve months (with accelerating revenues this quarter, there's plenty of room for upside in this figure), we estimate that New Relic will generate $429 million of revenues in the next twelve months. This puts the company's current valuation at 7.0x EV/FTM revenues.A fair multiple - not low, not high. A quick reminder that there are plenty of software stocks that are currently trading at substantially higher multiples, even after the early February crush:ADBE EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsGiven New Relic's accelerating growth and booming cash flow margins (reversing from losses last year), New Relic shares similar financial characteristics to Atlassian (NASDAQ: TEAM), which investors placed an extremely high double-digit multiple on (see green line above). While it would be challenging for New Relic to chase a five-turn expansion in its valuation multiple, there's certainly plenty of room for New Relic to trade up to the 8.5x EV/FTM revenues range, implying a price target of $71, or 18% upside from current levels.There's also a lot to be said for the fact that New Relic is regarded highly as the leader of its space, and it doesn't have a large-cap giant the likes of Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL) or Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) breathing down its neck and pressuring its pricing and margins - like the current dynamics in, say, the BI/Analytics space, where the cheap availability of Microsoft's Power BI tool is causing higher-priced rivals to rethink their pricing schema. Apart from a few private startups (as well as, of course, Cisco's (NASDAQ: CSCO) newly acquired AppDynamics), New Relic pretty much has a greenfield opportunity to expand far beyond its current scale.Let's start our review of New Relic's quarter by looking at some of the business metrics that investors might miss if looking purely at the financial statements. Luckily, New Relic has the key data nicely summarized on one page of its Q3 earnings deck:Figure 1. New Relic Q3 metricsSource: New Relic investor relationsA couple key standouts here. First, notice that the company's dollar-based net expansion rate hit 125% in the quarter, consistent with the high marks it's seen over the past eight quarters. Dollar-based net expansion is a measure of how much an existing client spends in Year 2 for every $1 they spend in year 1 - in other words, New Relic's existing clients spent, on average, 25% more in 3Q18 than they did in 3Q17. This indicates that the company has been hugely successful in upwelling its many modules to clients (its infrastructure monitoring tool, competing against the startup Datadog, is a relatively newer addition to its portfolio, and nicely complementing the company's core APM capabilities). This also indicates that upsells are more than enough to cover the churn in the quarter.Another note to add: six-figure accounts grew to 629 in the quarter, a sequential increase of 43 clients with ARR greater than $100,000. Put another way, these 629 clients generate annual billings of at least $62.9 million on their own - given that many of these accounts can be $400,000 or $500,000 accounts as well, that annual figure is likely much higher. Note also that these high-dollar clients are a small portion of New Relic's total 16,600 customer base.Finally, note that New Relic's average revenue per paid business account has been consistently increasing on a sequential basis each quarter, and this Q3 was no exception, with the large account adds contributing to a rise in average ARR to $22,500.The metrics above tell a nice story, but so do the actual dollar results. See the company's earnings summary below:Figure 2. New Relic Q3 earnings summarySource: New Relic earnings press releaseRevenues grew 35% y/y to $91.8 million, a marked beat over analyst consensus of $89.3 million (+31% y/y). As previously mentioned, this represents an acceleration over the 33% y/y growth New Relic saw in Q2, and at the company's current scale (at a ~$365 million run rate), acceleration truly is a rare feat, and one that analysts clearly weren't expecting the company to pull off. New Relic itself had only guided to a Q3 revenue range of $88.3-$89.8 million, achieving $2 million over the top of its range. At its current average ARR of $22,500 (translating to average quarterly revenue of $5,600), this roughly means 357 ""average"" customer adds over forecast- although, more than likely, it was a smaller amount of large >$100K deals that pushed New Relic over the top.New Relic's top line is all about growth, growth, growth, but as stated in the premise of the article, that wealth has also spread down into its bottom line. The company was able to achieve signification operating leverage over all components of its opex, and its GAAP operating loss shrunk to -$8.0 million (a -9% margin) despite a larger revenue base, and a huge improvement over a -20% operating margin in the prior year Q3.The same story can be seen in New Relic's GAAP net income figures, with net loss of -$7.7 million shrinking over -$13.9 million in the prior year. With 30%-plus growth on the top line, it's an accomplishment for a company like New Relic not to be sacrificing points of margin for its growth. The company has a clear path to profitability in the next 12-18 months if this trend continues.New Relic's pro forma EPS of $0.05 also represented positive earnings after adding back stock comp and other non-cash items, and was a huge beat over analyst consensus of -$0.08.New Relic's cash flow results, however, might tell an even better story than its bottom line:Figure 3. New Relic Q3 cash flow resultsNote how the company was able to turn a -$4.0 million free cash flow loss in 3Q16 into positive FCF of $2.7 million this quarter. While this still represents a small 3% FCF margin, New Relic's huge top-line growth accompanied by 11-point closures in the operating margin gap will have a dynamic effect on New Relic's FCF potential as it continues to grow.Like other mature SaaS companies with steep valuations - Atlassian and Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE), New Relic's cash flow results is starting to balance its growth story and provide a basis for valuation beyond pure revenues.There's virtually nothing that's not to like about New Relic, except perhaps its 7x forward revenue multiple. Note, though, that even 7x is a digestible multiple that many software companies have maintained for years. In addition to the uber-richly valued companies presented in this article, other more reasonably valued SaaS companies like Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) have long defended a valuation territory north of 7x. And New Relic has the superior growth profile.With a huge market for full-stack monitoring tools (by full-stack, I mean that New Relic's new and complete set of SaaS offerings cover both frontend application monitoring (NASDAQ:APM) as well as backend infrastructure monitoring). Gartner recently predicted that enterprise software spending will grow by a staggering 9.5% y/y in 2018, an acceleration over 2017 - so strong category-leading companies like New Relic will undoubtedly get a huge secular boost from increased investments in IT, especially as new tax laws encourage both capex and software upgrades.Stay long on this name - in the past twelve months, it's barely seen even the slightest correction as it continues to gain bucketfuls of healthy returns, even as the broader markets slump around it. A company with fantastic fundamental supports like New Relic deserves every penny of its valuation."
4086426,103329,2017-07-08T05:20:42-04:00,New Relic is a relatively small ($2.4B) market cap company in a fast growing segment.The company is on a solid track to profitability by the end of FY18 (non-GAAP).NEWR is relatively unknown and not a battleground stock.It is worth a speculative buy at current prices.,"I don't normally like to invest in stocks that are not profitable. But in New Relic's (NYSE:NEWR) case, I can make the rare exception. There are 10 types of people in the world, those that understand binary, and those that don't. A humorous(less) attempt at a joke, but seems to apply in this case trying to understand exactly what New Relic's products actually do. You either get it or you don't. I didn't, so I had to dig into it and find out exactly what they do. This is one of the lesser followed and written about stocks on Seeking Alpha, so I'll take a little time and try to explain its business model. From its own description:Did that clear it up? Let's try this version.Not exclusively, its software is made for the ""backroom"" guys (and gals) who are monitoring and designing a business's applications. For example, they can show a real-time change in customer retention rates based off a price change. Or, where the mobile app they are designing is requesting too much data from the host. They can show the actual customer experience in real time as the team manages and designs their digital platform and data. They allow you to run custom queries to analyze users by location, device, browser, and other metrics vital to an app's success. This allows big data that can be seen up the management chain by showing, in a user-friendly format, page views, response times, and sessions of specific users to give support and operations teams insight into the customer experience. Its products aid in benchmarking, test tracking, segmentation, analysis, and refinement of data and apps.It's a big data world, and the faster you can maximize your performance metrics, sales programs, and user interaction, well, that's big money. New Relic helps companies do just that.New Relic went public in 2014. After some ups and downs, it has now moved to fresh new highs.NEWR data by YChartsHere are some key company highlights and metrics. This info was provided from the company's Q4 conference call:The company has best-in-class margins.One interesting key metric that the company reports is the number of customers it has with an annual revenue of at least $100,000. This is a nice base of recurring revenue.From its latest Q4, the company has updated its own projections on revenue for FY '18. Sales are now projected to grow from $263 million to $344 million for the year. The company believes it has a multi-billion-dollar market opportunity.As I mentioned in the opening, I don't like to buy stocks without earnings and almost never stocks with losses into the great unknown. New Relic, however, recently gave guidance that on a non-GAAP basis, it will be profitable by the end of FY 2018. That is impressive for such an early and fast-growing enterprise. This is due to its scalability of growth and its large gross margins.The company is also capturing larger customers as measured by its metric of tracking higher average revenue accounts over time.SummaryThese types of stocks are always difficult to judge. What appeals to me is their rapid growth rate, the attractive market they are in, and the fact they are relatively unknown. This is not a battleground stock with hundreds of articles reporting on it. It has a lot of time to get more attention and considerably appreciate in price. As a testament to the validity of its model, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) purchased one of its competitors, AppDynamics, for $3.7 billion just before it went public in Jan. 2017.With a relatively low market cap of $2.4 billion, if NEWR can hit or exceed its core estimated numbers, the stock could go much higher. Turning profitable by the end of FY 2018 gives a clear road map to an investor that New Relic is on the right track. Still a risky stock, but a risk that is well worth taking. As always, do your own research and let me know what you think below.I have included its GAAP to non-GAAP financial adjustments below for the purists out there."
4182332,21815,2018-06-18T11:46:45-04:00,"The shares trade at nearly 7 times their 2022 revenue target.But there are plenty of things going for the company, revenue growth, incredible up-sells, operational leverage, positive cash flows and non-GAAP profitability.How much are investors willing to discount the bright future?","New Relic's (NEWR) shares were relatively range bound for a couple of years after its IPO, but in the beginning of last year, they suddenly took off:What's more, the rise seems to have significantly accelerated in the last couple of months. The company is obviously doing something right of late.NEWR Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsWhile revenue growth seems to be near linear, there was a market deterioration in the operating metrics until bottoming out mid-2016, and it looks like leverage has kicked in quite comprehensively.We'll look at that later on, first let's consider the company's business modelNew Relic is yet another SaaS business platform, with all the advantages that such a Swiss army knife business model usually provides. We have a little generic model that helps as a point of reference:Not all of these items are relevant, where they are we'll provide some comment.The company's killer app is APM (application performance management). The term is actually rather elastic and might mean slightly different things in different contexts, but in general, these are tools that measure the performance of applications, software, network traffic and the like.The APM market is supposed to grow at a CAGR of 16.4% between 2018 and 2022, although curiously the Cision report where this information comes from doesn't even mention New Relic as a key vendor.Gartner argues that only 5% of application workflows are monitored by APM and New Relic's management expects that to quadruple by 2021, and as a result (Q4CC):And there are numerous drivers for this to happen (from Investor Day presentation):Management likes to see its offerings in a wider context as assisting its clients in a digital transformation that consists of three broad fields (from Investor Day presentation):And their cloud based single pane of glass is monitoring quite a lot at once:We're not even going to try to assess the company's capabilities against the competition, we leave that to specialists, but the summary of reports we have seen (like the above mentioned Cision and Crossroads today) mention a host of competitors. There is a Gartner report mentioning Dynatrace as the market leader in terms of market share.According to management, what they most universally hear from clients who use the products is its ease of use, so we assume that's a competitive strength even if we don't have independent data (let alone comparative data) on that.We suspect that another one of New Relic's main selling points is exactly this cloud enabled integrated approach where they can add lots of stuff that is monitored in real-time in a single pane of glass. Management argues that the company is instrumental in moving the needle in broadening the scope of APM. From (Q4CC):The CC is littered with references to their integrated ('single pane') approach, like (Q4CC):Given that existing customers buy ever more from the company, they are quite successful in doing that. But the company isn't the only one going down this route:Of course, this could just be management blurb, but then again, they are the market leader for a reason, and indeed (from Dynatrace):While New Relic is hardly behind, there is considerable competition that much is certain and it's something to keep in mind when we get to valuation. But despite the competition, the company is rapidly expanding its user base:Management argues (Q4CC):We suppose this is a function of the breadth of services (see point 8 below). The 10-K argues the following with respect to pricing:So, if more users use the product, revenues will go up.Quite frankly, we're not sure what to make of a remark in the Q4CC that the company charges by server and the problems this causes with pricing server-less computing setups (Q4CC):The company is expanding its footprint overseas, with 32% of revenues coming from outside the US in Q4. The 10-K provides a useful table which shows international revenue isn't growing faster than revenue from the US:In principle, the products are service light, but for bigger customers this changes a bit, from the 10-K:The company does have an increasing headcount as a result:There is a considerable degree of customization at work as clients differ in needs:The company even has a university where clients can learn to get the most out of New Relic's applications. However, the company includes the services in its pricing scheme, from the 10-K:The company does have partners, IBM (IBM) is one of them (Q4CC):But IBM isn't their only partner:The company is rapidly evolving and building out new applications like:There is a good overview in the 10-K of their main products. Some of these new products, like Infrastructure, are already able to serve as land products. In an evolutionary representation, from the Investor Day:This works. The company boosted its net expansion rate to a seldom seen 141% in Q4, considerably higher than before and it is likely to fall back to the trendline (see figure below).Their non-APM products are accounting for 28% of its total ARR (average recurring revenue) already.Land and expand indeed:And they're not done yet, not by any means. They're going to accelerate their R&D effort in order to make the platform even more valuable and sticky for their customers in 2019.The CEO himself went on an extensive field trip to talk to customers to see what they like about the applications and where opportunities lie for adding services.Not surprisingly, it's enterprise customers that are mostly driving the net expansion rate and it's rather phenomenal that the company only started to cater to this segment four years ago and it's already 54% of their ARR (in Q4).And of course, the build out of this Swiss army knife makes the whole platform more valuable and sticky, increasing customer retention.The company is also adding capabilities by acquiring other firms:The company does seem to have an ecosystem of third-party apps, from the 10-K:Apart from the risks (this passage comes from the usual business risk section of the filing), it isn't clear if the company earns some kind of cut on the offerings of that community websiteThis keeps on climbing, but there is a logical explanation for that, from the 10-K:For reference, from the earnings deck:The decline in deferred revenue is caused by some pulling forward of extensions and lengthening of contracts in Q4 (which produced $10M tailwind in that quarter).There is a $10M benefit from the changeover to ASC 606 due to the deferral of certain expenses in FY2019.NEWR Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsWell, you see gross margin rising and operational leverage kicking in. Even if the GAAP operational margin is still soundly negative, its non-GAAP counterpart is already positive, improving from -8% in Q4 2017 to 5% in Q4 2018. Non-GAAP gross margin was 85%, although a catch-up in CapEx will bring this down to 83% in FY 2019.NEWR Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsThe picture of a business kicking into leverage is confirmed by the cash flow development. The company is already operational cash flow positive for two years and it's also free cash flow positive. How much of that is share-based compensation?NEWR Stock Based Compensation (TTM) data by YChartsNot surprisingly for a company in the early innings of a growth trajectory, all of the cash flow comes from stock-based compensation and then some.Stock-based compensation is a fairly substantial 11% of revenues (in Q4, although it is gently declining as a percentage of revenue). It is also by far the largest source between GAAP and non-GAAP figures (10-K):This also still leads to substantial dilution, even if the company's cash position ($248M, up from $233M in Q3) frees it from having to resort to debt and/or equity financing.Management expects operational cash flow at $70M-$80M and free cash flow at $30M-$40M in fiscal 2019. The share count is rising fairly substantially, which isn't surprising either, but it nevertheless eats up quite a bit of EPS growth. In Q1, it will, on average, further rise to 59.3M, although that's on a fully diluted base.Despite positive cash flows, the company has just recently embarked on placing $435M, 0.5% convertible senior notes (with an additional $65M in green shoe) due in 2023 with a conversion rate of 9.0244 shares for each $1,000 of notes, adding roughly 4.5M shares to the count.As you expect, the shares are priced, well, see for yourself:NEWR EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsAnalysts expect a positive (non-GAAP) EPS of $0.36 in 2019, rising to $0.69 in 2020, but these multiples, while astronomical, are not terribly relevant at the moment. Assuming 35% revenue growth in 2019 would take the forward EV/S down to 14, still in fairly thin air territory.To put things in a longer-term perspective, the company's ambition is to get to $1B in revenue by FY 2022, and even then it would have an EV/S of nearly 7 based on today's share price (and that's assuming no further dilution). Here is their 2022 target operating model (from the earnings deck):It is actually somewhat curious with the net expansion rate at a whopping 141% and the company expanding its customer base with the pace it does that revenues are 'only' growing at 34% (in Q4). We suppose this is due to issues like revenue recognition, with the changeover to ASC 606 per Q1 an additional complicating factor.There is no doubt that the company is firing on all cylinders at the moment, but shareholders are assuming this will continue quite far into the future.That isn't an unreasonable expectation, given the opportunities offered by the familiar SaaS platform business model and the company's proven ability to innovate and up-sell and land new customers.This is also increasing the value of the platform (the whole is greater than the sum of its parts) and increases stickiness.The APM market is also still in the early innings, so growth opportunities abound, and operational leverage has already started to kick in with the company even already in positive free cash flow territory.We have analyzed quite a few of these SaaS cloud business platforms and these all share similar characteristics. What many of these companies also share is a relentless rise in their share price, New Relic is certainly one of them.There almost doesn't seem any upper limit as valuation concerns are often brushed aside with reference to future growth, necessary investment in scaling and developing new functionality, the kicking in of operational leverage and the wonderful stickiness of the business model.These are all valid arguments, but we would nevertheless wait for a more reasonable entry point, although we realize that might not materialize."

Think Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) dominating the OS market in the 80s and 90s, Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) with database software, Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) in networking, and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) the first to dominate in the cloud with customer relationship management.New Relic's software analytics platform is a Software-as-a-Service offering and allows customers to gain insight into the health of their software and more clarity around digital investment throughout the enterprise. New Relic's software runs billions of data points across millions of applications in real time allowing developers to diagnose issues in seconds. The beauty of New Relic's business model is the stickiness of the product and the ability to upsell. New Relic's net expansion rates are an industry leading 125%-130%, meaning customers buy 25%-30% more software on top of what they already have. This is called ""negative churn"" and acts as a powerful lever for SaaS companies. Essentially, if New Relic ceased all growth investments, they would still grow at 25%-30% per year. For instance, a customer may start with the application performance management (NASDAQ:APM) product for their mobile or browsing products and realize they need more data on their back-end cloud infrastructure, leading to an easy upsell for New Relic. Put simply, as New Relic's customers grow, New Relic grows. The average spend across New Relic's customer base is $19,500, up from $9,000 since the IPO 2.5 years ago. Rarely can investors find stocks with business models as attractive as New Relic's. The best comparable to New Relic and its business model is Salesforce, a SaaS company in the CRM space that has arguably been the most dominant software company in the last 10 years. Like Salesforce did so masterfully in the CRM space, New Relic is ""grabbing land"" as fast as possible and carving out a defensible competitive moat in the APM space by dispersing its software on the public cloud.New Relic's five main product offerings and recent highlights from the recent earnings call are summarized below.APM - Assess the performance, health, and functionality of applications.Infrastructure - Complete dynamic infrastructure and server monitoring.""We were encouraged by the performance of New Relic Infrastructure in its first full quarter in the market. This awesome new product was included in 4 of our top 10 deals and represented just shy of 10% of new business in the quarter. We're going to continue to invest aggressively in this offering throughout fiscal '18, both in terms of product and go-to-market. We expect New Relic Infrastructure to meaningfully add to our addressable market over the coming years as it solves a real problem for our customers, who need to monitor their dynamic infrastructure as well as their applications.""-Q42017 conference callBrowser - Visibility into the complete web page lifecycle for modern browser-side applications.Mobile - Application monitoring tool to help teams build high-performance, stable mobile applications.Insights - With real-time analytics from New Relic Insights, you can better understand the end-to-end business impact of your software performance.""….. first million dollar ARR customer for New Relic Insights alone and several sizable wins for New Relic Infrastructure.""-CEO Lew Cirne on the Q42017 conference callLew Cirne's stewardship as founder and CEO of New Relic has been nothing short of exemplary. Cirne's mission in life is to build great software for his customers. It is rare to find a CEO that has as much passion about his job as Cirne and is as fanatical about building a great product and providing a phenomenal customer experience as Cirne. Two comparables I can think of is Jeff Bezos at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Benioff at Salesforce. Cirne sold his previous company Wily Technologies to CA (NASDAQ:CA) for $375 million in 2006. Wily also did APM but its software was hosted on traditional data hosting centers. Cirne saw the massive opportunity in the public cloud and founded New Relic in 2008 on the idea that application performance management could be entirely a SaaS offering. New Relic has built a company culture that embraces the ""data nerds,"" building great software and as a result the employees seem to love working for the company. Cirne owns roughly 15% of New Relic and has stated his intentions to keep the company independent which is a great sign for investors because New Relic will be free to build great software and grow its software analytics platform.Some of New Relic's well-known customers include AirBnB, Nike, Disney, Intel, Uber, and Major League Baseball. The company offers a free product for new startups which is a shrewd move considering New Relic gets in on the ""ground floor"" with high flying startups. For example, New Relic has been working with AirBnb for nearly 10 years. AirBnb has grown to a decacorn ($10B private market valuation) and is expected to be one the most anticipated IPO's over the next year or two.New Relic customers include more than 40% of the Fortune 100 and Lew Cirne recently announced they closed a big deal with a Fortune 10 company. New Relic's largest contract win to date came from an upsell to an existing customer resulting in a three-year $24 million total contract value relationship.New Relic now has more than 30 seven-figure annual recurring revenue (ARR) customers, up nearly 100% from last year and more than 500 six figure ARR customers, up from over 350 a year ago. New Relic expects to gain its first eight-figure ARR deal in the next year or two.New Relic's annualized revenue per average paid business account reached approximately $19,500, which was up 24% year-over-year from FY2017 compared to FY2016 and 5% sequentially from Q3 to Q42017. New Relic ended Q4 with 517 paid business accounts paying over 100,000 per year, up over 40% from a year ago. The company's enterprise business, defined as paid business accounts with more than 1,000 employees, ended the year at approximately 46% of annualized recurring revenue, up from around 40% at the end of fiscal year '16 and ended with over 1,700 enterprise paid business accounts.Finally, New Relic has been adding about 30 to 50 customers per quarter that are spending more than $100k. CEO Cirne also mentioned, ""So that category - we now have over 500 six figure customers, over 500 of them. And that's up 40% year-over-year. That's our farm team for the million dollars plus. And $1 million customers, they're the stable of customers that will - some of them will ultimately be $10 million a year customers, and that's my challenge to the field is who's going to bring in the $10 million New Relic customer? And I hope it's this year.""Most $100k customers will turn into $1MM customers and some of the $1MM customers will turn into the $10MM customers. Again, this points to the stickiness of New Relic's business model. The more customers grow, the more insights they will need into their digital operations and the more business they will do with New RelicConsidering there are no other pure-play SaaS companies in the APM space, New Relic has gained a virtual monopoly and Lew Cirne and his team have essentially created a new industry in the tech space. Cirne has mentioned that could be why the market has not fully recognized New Relic's value and why the company has remained off the radar. Moreover, the deferred revenue and characteristics of SaaS companies can be difficult to understand and appreciate for investors. SaaS companies incur virtually all their costs up front and can often take up to one year to fully recoup their costs. New Relic's average cost recovery time is roughly 1.8 years. However, the long-run fundamentals of the SaaS model make incremental investments explosive. Stanislav Ermilov's article does a great job of illustrating the mechanics of the SaaS business model and why investors often under-appreciate the operating leverage that SaaS companies have when they scale. Once SaaS companies hit scale, the operating leverage can push earnings higher and early-stage SaaS companies often are discounted by the market for years because of the complexity of the business model. New Relic is projected to be EBITDA positive in FY2018 which should act as a catalyst for New Relic shares.Guidance and ValuationNew Relic's CFO Mark Sachleben mentioned on the recent earnings call that FY2018 revenue should range between $341.5 million to $346.5 million or growth of 30% to 32% year-over-year. New Relic has set a revenue goal of $1 billion by 2022. My general feel from listening to Cirne is that he is an ""under promise and over-deliver"" kind of guy and it seems likely New Relic will hit $1B in sales sooner than 2022. New Relic would need to grow its revenue at ~30% per year to hit their target of $1 billion in sales by 2022.As mentioned previously, Salesforce is the best public comp for New Relic and trades at roughly 7.5 times enterprise value to sales. If we assume a conservative 7x EV/sales multiple for NEWR, then its five-year price target should be about $134 per share. ($1B in 2022 revenue x 7 = $7B EV / 52.78 shares outstanding). This does not seem like an outrageous estimate considering Cisco paid roughly 17 times revenue for competitor AppDynamics. Putting the same multiple on New Relic's recent sales, implies equity value of ~$85. ($263.5MM in FY2017 revenue x 17 = $4.471B, or ~$85/share) If New Relic can stay on track with its goals and hit $1B in revenue by 2022, then the expected annual return in the share price should be roughly 25%.ConclusionNew Relic should be a core position for SaaS investors because the share price has remained virtually flat since its IPO due to the misunderstood nature of the SaaS business model. It takes New Relic roughly two years to recoup its costs but creates tremendous long-term shareholder value because of the operating leverage. New Relic is trying to ""grab land"" or market share as quickly as possible to dominate the market, which I believe New Relic is doing and will be appropriately valued by the market over the coming years. Negative churn rates coupled with massive spending on growing the business will lead to exponential growth for New Relic. There are currently about nine analysts covering New Relic stock and nearly all have buy, overweight, or outperform ratings. The average price target between the nine analysts is roughly $43.78 and the stock recently broke through this price. This should lead to positive analysts upgrades in the near term because they will likely raise their price targets. If we slap an 8x EV to revenue multiple on management's FY2018 sales guidance of ~$345MM, then the implied equity value should be roughly $52 per share, nearly 20% upside. If we assume New Relic can grow revenues at 25% per year over the next three years, then a conservative three-year price target should be roughly $78 per share, implying expected annual return of ~21%. ($514MM FY2020 revenue x 8 = $4.117B market cap or $78 per share). Given the most conservative expected annual returns of 20% - 25%, coupled with Lew Cirne's brilliance as a CEO, investors should not be disappointed holding New Relic over the long term. New Relic has launched Infrastructure which is a ""greenfield"" opportunity and should add considerably to New Relic's revenue. Again, Infrastructure was included in four of New Relic's top 10 deals and represented just shy of 10% of new business in the quarter. The market has yet to properly value this new product offering as it greatly increases New Relic's addressable market."
4080923,22148,2017-06-12T17:20:37-04:00,New Relic has taken a quick hit in the last couple of trading days as technology stocks come under pressure.The application monitoring tools continue to lead to expanding deals with customers.The stock trades at an amazingly reasonable valuation considering where a prime competitor got a buyout offer.,"As business continues quickly moving to the cloud, New Relic (NYSE:NEWR) provides the software measurement tools needed to make sure that business critical apps are working correctly. The sector was so hot that Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) bought out a prime competitor before that company went public at a hefty premium.The recent dip in New Relic still leaves the stock far above the yearly lows. The question is whether this is a dip buying opportunity before the stock garners a valuation similar to their prime competitor?In the latest quarter, New Relic reported that FQ4 results beat analyst estimates by $0.04 as revenues grew roughly 40%. The guidance for FY18 is for revenue growth of 31% to $344 million.The decelerating growth rates are typically tough for tech stocks, but the valuation in this case is more reasonable than most hot software stocks. In this case, New Relic only trades at about 5x forward revenue estimates with a market cap of $2.2 billion. Other comparable software stocks typically bump up against 10x multiples before the downfall.NEWR PS Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsThe exciting story is that not only is the addressable market expanding as enterprises increasingly move to the cloud, but also the actual tangible news of actual bigger deals. New Relic continues signing bigger and bigger deals as the company moves from the SMB market to enterprise customers while expanding with existing customers.In the latest quarter, the company signed a three-year, $24 million contract along with a record number of six and seven figure deals. The company ended the March quarter with over 500 six-figure deals and 30 seven-figure customers while the below slide highlights the growth over the last four years.For these reasons, Cisco Systems paid $3.7 billion for AppDynamics back in January. The competitor in application monitoring was scheduled for an IPO and had raised its price range prior to the buyout.AppDynamics had revenues of $158 million for the nine-month period ending last October. New Relic had revenues in the $175 million range during that time period with a similar growth rate.If one forecast that AppDynamics was on pace for $300 million in revenues for this fiscal year, Cisco Systems bought the stock for 12x revenues. A similar valuation for New Relic would value the stock in the range of $80.The key investor takeaway is that one shouldn't expect an AppDynamics type deal value, but any good SaaS stock trading at 5x forward revenues is typically a good buy. Use the current dip in the tech sector to build a position in New Relic and a potential tech wreck to build a large position."

The San Francisco-based company, founded in 2008, has grown into a behemoth in backend software tools, relied upon by developers to monitor the health and performance of their applications.There are a lot of reasons to like New Relic, chief among them being that its financial profile - 30%-plus growth balanced by expanding, positive free cash flows - is exactly what the market is rewarding right now. Gone is the super-enthusiasm for high-growth, loss-leading startup companies: investors have been stung by the likes of Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and even core software companies like MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB) and Cloudera (NYSE:CLDR). It's not enough to show investors a massive top-line growth rate; now, a path to profitability and sustained growth through positive cash flow are key themes to watch as we head into 2018.New Relic started gaining prominence this year when AppDynamics, a competitor in the application monitoring space, was acquired for $3.7 billion at the last minute by Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) right before going public, a deal brokered by top Silicon Valley dealmakers at Qatalyst Partners. Cisco, which had been losing share in its core networking IT equipment business for several years, needed to shake up its product portfolio and differentiate its offerings via software. It paid roughly 12x revenues for AppDynamics, which had roughly $200 million in TTM revenues growing at 50% (an estimated $300 million in forward revenues), still today one of the highest transaction multiples for a software company.New Relic, too, might be a suitable acquisition target, as its portfolio of app testing products can make for a nice side offering in a legacy tech giant's product suite. Speculation that AppDynamics' takeout would also put New Relic into play has helped the stock run 75% year to date, as shown in the chart below:NEWR data by YChartsIt's not just takeover speculation that has New Relic trading up, however. The company's strong top-line growth (30%) at a large scale (~$400 million) has put it on the larger side of the software industry, and right now, investors are indicating that they value maturity more than growth at all costs. In its recently reported Q2 earnings (calendar Q3) in early November, the company showed first-half operating cash flows growing to $16.6 million, up from only $3.8 million in the prior year. While this still represents a small margin, the fact that New Relic can invest in growth while at the same time greatly expand its cash flows is a sign of a software company that's reached critical mass.New Relic isn't exactly a cheap stock - at current levels, it's trading at ~7.4x EV/FTM revenues. However, Cisco has set the precedent that this particular software sector is worth a lot - and even if New Relic isn't currently an active acquisition target, the bar has been set. I believe New Relic can continue to run to 9x EV/FTM revenues, implying a price target of $70 and 23% upside from current levels. Given strong fundamental performance for several sequential quarters and no downside catalysts in sight, New Relic should be able to continue its near-vertical stock climb and return ~20-30% fairly quickly in 2018, barring a wider market meltdown.New Relic is one of the pioneers in the application and infrastructure monitoring space, which are a set of software tools dedicated to ensuring the stability and performance of other applications. New Relic has two flagship products: New Relic APM (application performance monitoring), primarily meant for testing desktop applications; and New Relic Mobile, meant for testing mobile applications.The screenshot below, taken from New Relic's website, showcases the New Relic APM user interface for a typical New Relic user, which, in most cases, is an IT administrator or app developer, but also sometimes a product or business-case user:Source: New Relic websiteThe New Relic APM can detect failures in app performance down to individual lines of code, from which a user can then identify and resolve the issues. New Relic APM, beyond downright failures, can also alert users when application response times are slower than intended.Additional New Relic tools can monitor user-end experiences from and run diagnostics on how the app performs on the user's browser. Recently, New Relic has also moved into providing infrastructure monitoring tools (a space best associated with Datadog, a New York-based startup which has raised $148 million from VCs, according to Crunchbase), allowing New Relic to expand its domain across the IT stack from the very top layer (applications) to the underlying layers within datacenter and networking infrastructure, giving customers a single-pane-of-glass view into system performance.Like other SaaS companies, New Relic's software is distributed via the cloud model and offered in recurring subscriptions, allowing for easy downloads and quick out-of-the-box functionality.Also like most SaaS companies, New Relic focuses heavily on direct sales and invests more than half of its revenues into sales and marketing. As of Q2, New Relic counted more than 15,900 paying customers. The company's sales are tilted toward large enterprise customers, with 51% of its annualized recurring revenue (ARR) coming from enterprise clients.The chart below, taken from a New Relic investor deck, shows the company's growth in high-dollar accounts. As of Q2, the company has 586 clients with annual spend of at least $100,000:Source: New Relic investor relationsWhile New Relic might seem like it focuses solely on technology sector clients with heavy app development needs, it actually has a fairly diverse base of clients in different industries. Featured clients include American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE:AEO), Trek Bicycles, REI, Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY), Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOX) (NASDAQ:FOXA), and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE).The company has a dollar-based net expansion rate of 123% as of Q2, meaning it has achieved a net-upsell position with existing clients across its portfolio of six products.In the first half of FY18, New Relic has posted $164.8 million in revenues, an increase of 35% y/y. In the company's Q2 earnings release, revenue growth of 33.5% y/y also beat consensus expectations that called for 30.8% y/y growth. See the company's most recent results below:Figure 1. New Relic top lineSource: New Relic Q2 earnings releaseThe company has also guided to $346.5-349.5 million in FY18, implying revenue growth of 32% y/y at the midpoint of $348 million over FY17's revenue of $263.5 million. Given the company's history of beat-and-raise quarters, however, we can expect New Relic to end up somewhere higher than even the high end of its guidance this year.New Relic's gross margin is also another important selling point for the company. Its gross margin of 81% represents pure profits per incremental dollar of revenue, as New Relic only incurs minimal hosting costs to add another client. As shown in the slide below, taken from an investor deck, New Relic has among the highest gross margins in the software industry:Figure 2. New Relic gross marginIt's true that New Relic is still operating at a loss (generating $31.3 million in GAAP operating losses on $164.8 million in revenue in 1H18, or a -19% operating margin). The company is still pouring cash into building out its sales arm to drive 30%-plus growth.As seen in the chart below, New Relic is spending 56% of its revenue on sales and marketing, 17% on R&D, and 14% on general overhead as of Q2. This is a far cry away from its FY22 margin target and its long-term operating model target, but the company is making progress toward profitability, taking into account the margin trends since 2015:Figure 3. New Relic operating margins vs. target-state modelDue to the company's excellent gross margins, it has the capacity to scale toward immense profitability in the long term, five to seven years down the road. And once a company like New Relic has reached a ~$350 million run rate, that long term is more of an eventuality than a pipe dream, as it is for most startups.Imagine, for example, that New Relic was generating a 20% net margin on its ~$300 million of current-day revenues, or $60 million. This would imply a P/E of approximately 50x on its current market cap of $3 billion. Given that New Relic will achieve this long-term 20%-plus profit margin target on billions in revenue (and not $300 million), you can imagine how lucrative its business model will be in the future if it can continue executing against growth targets.Despite New Relic's GAAP net losses, however, the company has been able to grow its cash flows, as stated at the outset of this article. Investors are beginning to pile more cash into cash flow-positive tech companies that can finance their own growth through operations, instead of needing to tap the capital markets to access liquidity, which cash-guzzling companies like Blue Apron (NYSE:APRN) and MongoDB are likely to do.As shown in the chart below, New Relic has grown OCF to $16.6 million in the first half of FY18, up more than 4x from $3.8 million in the prior-year period.Figure 4. New Relic operating cash flowSubtracting out $14.4 million of capex yields free cash flow of $2.2 million; it had been negative in 1H17. Yes, this is still a small figure, but New Relic is still far from reaching its long-term operating model, yet is able to produce positive cash flows.At New Relic's market cap of $3.16 billion less its cash of $234 million as of Q2 (the company has no debt), it has an enterprise value of $2.92 billion.Taking the midpoint of New Relic's FY18 guidance of $348 million and extrapolating a 28% y/y growth rate into the first half of FY19, we estimate approximately $394 million in FTM revenues for the company. This implies a current EV/FTM revenue multiple of 7.4x.It's no doubt that New Relic is on the expensive side; there are other software companies I like, such as Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) and Cloudera, that are trading at 4.5x and 4.0x, respectively. But those companies struggle with profitability: Twilio was slammed due to declining gross margins to the low 50s in its most recent quarter (versus New Relic holding steady in the 80s), and Cloudera has an operating loss in the -70s (versus New Relic at nearly breakeven). New Relic's favorable margin and cash flow profile merit its relative premium.Nor is New Relic the most expensive software name. 7.4x still sits well below some of the most richly valued software stocks in the industry, and companies like Workday (WDAY) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) are arguably much more saturated into their core addressable markets than New Relic is, and so will see a much lower growth trajectory in the coming years. In addition, New Relic's small enterprise value of ~$3 billion makes it an attractive acquisition target (AppDynamics, which had less revenue, was acquired for $3.7 billion), whereas Workday and Adobe, with enterprise values of $20 billion and $70 billion, respectively, are far less likely acquisition targets.Relative to the software companies shown in the below chart, New Relic still has room to stretch its valuation further:WDAY EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsWith the market's rotation into more profitable software names, New Relic is a good company to get acquainted with, especially as it's a major player in a space that IT leaders have deemed as a hot-button service. Cisco brought the space to headline prominence when it snatched AppDynamics from the altar; though New Relic might not be an immediate acquisition target, its valuation is supported by its fundamentals as well.The growth of software and application development is a trend that's unlikely to slow down, and as applications proliferate, so too will the tools used to test their performance and monitor backend stability. New Relic fills this rare niche in the industry, and with few competitors in the market, it has room to grow."

According to IDC, the APM market was worth $2.6 billion in 2015. The market is led by Dynatrace with 15% share and New Relic (NYSE:NEWR) came in sixth with 6.2% market share. AppDynamics accounted for 5.5% market share. New Relic has traditionally focused on Tier II and Tier III applications for small and medium sized enterprises. But now, it appears to be changing gears.New Relic's FinancialsNew Relic's third quarter revenues grew 43% to $68.1 million, ahead of the market's forecast of $66.35 million. Net loss of $0.09 per share compared with the market's forecast of $0.14 per share.It ended the quarter with nearly 14,915 paid business accounts. The new customers added during the quarter included names like Bupa UK, Cox Enterprises, Freshdesk, Gannett (NYSE:GCI), Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN), and Viacom International.For the current quarter, it forecast revenues of $70.3-$71.3 million, with a net loss of $0.14-$0.16 per share. The market was expecting revenues of $69.3 million and a loss of $0.15 per share.New Relic's Enterprise FocusAPM market leader Dynatrace provides monitoring and root cause analysis to larger enterprise customers and deals with Tier I applications that account for about 20% of the total number of enterprise applications. New Relic, on the other hand, has focused on Tier II and Tier III applications for SMEs. But now, it is expanding its target market to bigger enterprises and is seeing strong traction.As part of this focus, it has announced updates to the New Relic Digital Intelligence Platform. The updated platform allows New Relic to publish company-wide dashboards for enterprise deployments and delivers expanded visibility into the application performance monitoring module. Organizations also will be able to receive alerts for dynamic infrastructure.The platform will assist developers and operations teams in asking iterative questions about application performance. It will allow them to receive intelligent alerts and create dynamic, real-time, company-wide dashboards that will be able to provide a holistic view of any number of business units or subsidiaries.Last quarter, New Relic also announced its artificial intelligence offering called Project Seymour. Seymour is designed to deliver advanced AI and machine learning capabilities to help companies improve customer experience and the performance and availability of their digital initiatives. Seymour will help across processes ranging from discovery to diagnosis and prediction. It will be able to offer a news feed that will be customized based on the user's roles and permissions and will display the trends and issues that they care about most. It will highlight issues and trends and provide users with a diagnosis of the problem and recommend a solution. The platform also will enable collaboration across team members and finally leverage its massive amount of data in the cloud platform to help predict and prevent future issues.Additionally, New Relic announced an improved Infrastructure offering that is geared toward a new monitoring solution to provide deep, real-time visibility into a company's dynamic cloud and hybrid infrastructure. The New Relic Infrastructure enables correlation of performance metrics and configuration changes to the infrastructure by processing, displaying, alerting, and analyzing all the changes and performance data required to manage and optimize cloud and hybrid infrastructures. Through the new offering, IT teams will be able to have a single source for live-state monitoring and change tracking of all their instances, easily examine inventory and any changes made to their instances via a real-time feed, and achieve faster detection and resolution times.Cisco's acquisition has spurred the market. It paid a hefty premium for the acquisition of AppDynamics and that is benefiting New Relic's stock performance. Its stock is trading at $36.96 with a market cap of $1.95 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $40.13 in September last year and has recovered from the 52-week low of $23.45 it had fallen to in March last year."
4063342,72585,2017-04-21T05:00:00-04:00,"Not all SaaS businesses are equal - NEWR possesses top class underlying fundamentals which are not appreciated by the market.Exceptional revenue growth over the next 3 years would be supported by enterprise contract expansion, superior tech and high marketing investment.No value being given to the newly launched infrastructure product, which would impact the bottom line from 2018.Long-term tailwind from supercycle in business digitization and cloud app adoption.","OverviewThe core business for New Relic (NYSE:NEWR) is Application Performance Monitoring (NASDAQ:APM) SaaS, which is a process that ensures that software at the core processes and performs in an expected manner i.e. timing how long it takes to execute different areas in the code and complete transactions. This is achieved by monitoring logs, instrumenting the code or analyzing network/hardware metrics. APM system does real time identification, measurement and evaluation of an application data and allows isolating and rectifying any abnormalities or issues. In the process, NEWR's APM monitors billions of data points in real-time for tens of thousands of active accounts. New Relic is among the fastest growing public software companies experiencing around 72% CAGR over the last five years, which I view as the best testimony to its business model and technologies.It is highly important to understand the underlying product and the business of New Relic, instead of simply looking at the financials.Sources of the opportunity:Not all SaaS companies are equal. The hidden value of NEWR lies in the company's 80%+ gross margin (vs. 66% median for public SaaS), hugely sticky product and exceptional net expansion rates at ~125% (vs. 95% SaaS median). The market is pricing in a declining revenue growth with mean analyst forecast at 28% for 2018FY. This contrasts with 43% YoY growth for Q3 2017 where fundamentals imply similar levels next year due to: 1) enterprise account growth and upselling; 2) new product launches and bundling with existing APM platform; 3) persistently strong marketing efficiency and announced plan to maintain high marketing investment. Those factors would help to sustain sales growth around 40% p.a. for 2018FY.Why is application monitoring a cool business to be in?Around 10 years ago monitoring used to be simple since most companies had a fixed number of applications to monitor. These applications lived for a number of years on a fairly fixed number of servers. But currently, companies are dealing with both multiple mobile and web applications, which could live on-premises or in the cloud. Furthermore, some are delivered in containers as micro-services. These features greatly increase the complexity of applications performance monitoring and this is where New Relic stands out from the rest.New Relic provides developers and operating functions with the visibility across the stack, including the digital customer experience of the applications and dynamic infrastructure via integrated alerts and dashboards. Using that everyone within an organization obtains a shared understanding of how software is deployed and performs in real time. As code changes are deployed, teams can seamlessly see the impact on performance. For example, alerting platform allows teams to quickly know whether a change is delivering the expected results or when their application metrics go beyond required thresholds, so they can immediately roll it back.Digital transformation is impacting businesses across all verticals and including traditional brick-and-mortar industries such as retail, financial services and manufacturing. New Relic offers an opportunity to ride this supercycle of business digitization - the more digital the companies become, the higher the demand for advanced app monitoring services.IDC estimates that enterprises are increasing their investment and worldwide spending on digital transformation technologies will grow at a rate of 16.8% p.a. to more than $2.1 trillion in 2019. Further business digitization support comes from Forrester Research, where the total US e-commerce spending is expected to grow from $334bn in 2015 to $480bn in 2019. According to McKinsey, 80% of U.S. manufacturers acknowledged that digital operations would be a critical driver of their future competitiveness. The importance of APM and infrastructure monitoring is evident from the IDC survey, which estimates the average cost/hour of a critical software application failure at $0.5-1mil, and $100k/hour for an IT infrastructure failure. This, in turn, translates to an average total cost of unplanned software application downtime of $1.25 billion to $2.5 billion per year for Fortune 1000 companies alone.Sustainable competitive advantageBeing the only fully SaaS-based APM, New Relic can help monitor and analyze the company's technology in ways that are simply not possible with traditional on-premise or hosted solutions. According to Gartner's 2016 survey, end users identified New Relic as the quickest to deploy and realize value solution. The solution is offered in a much more cost-effective way vs. competitors since SaaS does not require large initial cash outlay and billed on a subscription basis.Additionally, NEWR's SaaS-only offering creates sizable network effect benefits - as more people connect with New Relic, it creates even more data to increase its product value and optimize client experience. This provides an edge over traditional on-premise app monitoring providers who operate in a silo and unable to process and share the data across users. On the back of its wide data network, NEWR can leverage machine learning and the trillions of data points generated by its product each month. This allows providing a more superior product and user experience, which is evident from its increasing market share below.NEWR has great technology in place which provides a single destination for operations and developers to analyze the entire application. The company can get insight into how the user is managing the application, how the containers are doing, what are the configurations. The current polyglot nature of many application environments presents a major challenge. Recently it became common for organizations to employ multiple web applications written in several different languages (Ruby, PHP, Java, .NET) - something earlier-generation APM solutions canʼt support - not in the same console, using the same core product and technology. Technology to monitor containers offers another technological edge (containers allow delivering an application as a set of discrete micro-services). These containers could live for varying periods of time and their inconsistent and ephemeral nature makes them a major monitoring challenge.Top 3 APM providersMore companies are turning to NEWR as a core component to support their technology growth and AppDynamics and Dynatrace are the only competitive alternatives based on the quality and sophistication of technology.Three leading APM companies control 18% of the market and rapidly growing their shares at the expense of the large incumbents like CA, IBM, HP who lost 8% share just in 2015. New Relic, Dynatrace and AppDynamics have a major product edge vs. the rest with their enterprise offering and more advanced technologies, which deliver a much more comprehensive monitoring. These companies provide analytic dashboards and hence allow to bridge the gap between tech and business executives via the end-to-end visibility and the intelligence for decision making.Source: GartnerBased on Gartner data, New Relic and AppDynamics were aggressive with their growth and eating into the market shares of CA, IBM, HPE and Microsoft (other APM providers in top 7), which experienced falling sales or very modest growth. New relic's market share increased from 2.6% in 2013 to 6% in 2015 which is in contrast to CA's and IBM's market shares dropping from 9.1% to 7.3% and 9% to 8.3%, respectively, during the same period. This is the best illustration of the company's superior technology, which allowed New Relic to jump from 9th largest APM provider in 2014 to number 4 spot in 2016.According to Gartner, the APM market grew 10.6% in 2015 and is projected to grow by ~11% over the next 3 years. But NEWR would be growing much faster by eating into shares of large incumbent firms with weaker technologies.Even if competitors outside of the top 3 leaders manage to catch up on the technology over time, penetration at existing enterprise clients is very hard because SaaS subscription means the clients outsource the management of their critical business apps to the external provider. The switching costs are really high and clients would prefer enterprise-wide monitoring system instead of dealing with separate vendors across functions.Top class managementAmong the main reasons I would be long New Relic is because it is run by a visionary founder/CEO, Lew Cirne, who got a great track record in delivering and marketing innovative products. Cirne had previously built Wily Technology from scratch and essentially created APM category. Wily was eventually sold to CA for $375mil, which clearly illustrates his exceptional operational and product skills.New Relic launched multiple successful products in addition to its core APM business, where non-APM business recently accounted for ~30% of revenues. For example, Insights product reached 10% of NEWR's revenues in the last quarter and used by Fortune 10 CEO on a daily basis - just 2.5 years since the product launch. Cirne possesses an outstanding track record in building new things and was the driving force behind the recent product developments. His product skills are complemented with the management's proven ability to rapidly scale enterprise sales and to deliver highly efficient marketing (on the negative churn below) with the bottom up go-to-market strategy.Misunderstood SaaS model - why the lack of profitability is goodNew Relic currently has an artificially heavy cash burn because of the outstanding growth rates and high marketing costs associated with a SaaS business in the land grab mode. New Relic incurs the majority of its costs to acquire a new customer upfront - sales and marketing, R&D, maintenance, hosting infrastructure. Many of these upfront expenses are not recognized over time in the income statement (as in a case of the traditional software with perpetual license), which results in the misaligned timing of revenue and expenses.For example, NEWR signs most of the large business contracts on a 12 months basis, but revenue is recognized each month at 1/12 of the total contract value. This means the customer pays for the service once a month, but New Relic has to pay its full expenses immediately. As can be seen from the chart, cash flows become even more negative as a SaaS company acquires more customers.SaaS cash flows at different rates of client acquisition:Source: A16Z.comThe faster New Relic acquires its customers, the larger it grows the installed base and the greater is the revenue growth as time progresses. This makes the recent sales & marketing expense at 63% of revenues a highly sensible strategy to pursue, having the longer term view in mind.The majority of investors are accustomed to traditional software companies which make money by selling a perpetual license and then later selling upgrades. In this case, software license is paid upfront and then clients pay a recurring 15-20% annual maintenance fee. As a result timing of revenues and associated expenses are perfectly aligned and don't distort the income statement. In the case of most SaaS firms and New Relic - there is the ""first-to-market"" situation where marketing costs are especially high in order to grab the largest share before the market is sliced (keeping in mind the high stickiness of the business). This distorts the true profitability and potential of the business by hiding it behind the high initial client acquisition costs. As a result, investors, who are used to traditional software stocks, incorrectly value the SaaS stocks due to their lack of profitability.Hidden value of NEWR's SaaS contractsFirstly, let's address the sales efficiency which provides an idea of the incremental revenue returned by sales and marketing investment. Sales efficiency equals newly generated revenue in a financial year divided by the sales and marketing expense in that year.In the case of New Relic, the sales efficiency figure stands around 0.54 which contrasts with ~0.8 average for public SaaS companies. It is a reasonable performance on a comparative basis but may seem not impressive if looked upon in isolation.Sales Efficiency:Source: Author's calculationsLeading net expansion ratesWhere New Relic shines is the Net Expansion rate - it has one of the highest rates among ALL SaaS firms. Net expansion rate compares recurring subscription revenue from customers from one period to the next. The historical net expansion rates were consistently within 115-135% range which are terrific performance numbers and in stark contrast with 103% public SaaS median.High net expansion rate is where the value of new contracts is hidden and why high investment in marketing is highly beneficial. A typical customer pays New Relic 15-35% more than last year, which is an incredibly attractive attribute of business because it means if the company were to cease spending money to acquire new customers, the business would still grow at ~20% CAGR.Historical net expansion rates:Source: New RelicNew Relic delivered superb performance in the contract size growth and increased revenue/average business account from $8k in FY2014 to over $18k in 2017. The recent quarterly results indicated that the average New Relic customer spends 38% more than the average customer spent a year ago. Among the contributing factors was the investment in new products and customers buying more of those.Source: New RelicEnterprise account growth & penetrationSource: New RelicNew Relic pursues a bottom-up strategy, targeting developers and smaller accounts with the aim to convert those into large enterprise-wide accounts via inside sales. As a result, it would be benefiting from a sharply increasing number of enterprise contracts even with falling marketing expense as % of revenue for many years to come as the contracts mature.The traditional enterprise growth path looks as follows. New Relic lands a technical win with $50-100k ARR which involves a limited number of users at the enterprise. Following that it expands its penetration across the company and products to $100-500k ARR, which eventually results in a platform solution, which generates $500-1000k ARR and includes the full set of New Relic products. Following that occurs enterprise-wide standardization of enterprise functions around New Relic's product and translates into $1mil+ ARR.The average selling price per corporate client increased from $30k+ in Q1 2015 to the most recent $65k+. There are over 400 accounts with $100k+ revenues (~3x more than 2 years ago) and over 20 accounts with $1mil+ revenues (~3x more than last year), and client number has increased by 30% in the last year alone. It is important to underline that according to the management, none of these accounts is even close to being fully penetrated.High growth at low costIn a true SaaS business, the revenue recurs for a long time and for particularly strong businesses - indefinitely. New Relic has a hugely defensive business model, where it makes sense to generate only $0.51 of revenue per $1.00 of sales & marketing expense in the same year (as calculated in the sales efficiency).The long-term customer value of New Relic is much higher than that of other SaaS companies and hence deserves premium valuation. Higher value is based on the outstanding net expansion rate of NEWR which was at 125% in the recent quarter vs. 95% SaaS median. Furthermore, its product is highly sticky and gets integrated across client's workflow and daily operations.Hidden contract value is well illustrated with the calculations below, where we derive that $1 invested in marketing generates $16.29 in long-term value for New Relic. The historical cohort growth was at ~30% CAGR and below estimates assume more conservative future growth figures.Lifetime value of $1 invested in Sales & Marketing:Source: Author's estimatesOperating leverage upsideAnother important attribute of New Relic's business is its gross product margin at 82% vs. 66% SaaS peer average, which means it receives much greater benefit from operating leverage vs. other SaaS companies and deserves premium valuation. i.e. high gross margin means that it costs very little to deliver more product and FCFs would be increasing much faster than that for other SaaS companies with similar growth rate.Source: New RelicRevenues for Q3 2017 were at $68.0mil and up 43% YoY, being led by enterprise business, which remains the fastest growing area. As New Relic grows, its fixed costs are shared across wider functions and increase by a smaller proportion than total revenues, which greatly lifts the bottom line. For example, operating leverage is evident from R&D costs as % of revenues falling to 19% in Q2 2017 vs. 24% 2.5 years earlier and General & Admin expenses dropping to 14% in Q2 FY2017 vs. 18% in FY2015.Further benefits are evident from operating margin improvements over time, which is projected to reach negative 11% in Q4 2017 vs. negative 17% in Q1 2017 and negative 20% in Q2 2016.Source: New RelicStrong marketing investmentManagement indicated the long-term sales & marketing expense target ~40% of revenues, where the business is consistently closing the gap to cash flow break-even; expenses as % of revenue are projected to fall further in FY17E to 111%. Over time, fixed cost leverage and improving operating profits would make the underlying business value more evident. Once New Relic would become EBITDA positive, it would become appealing to a wider investor base, which in turn would result in further price appreciation.Business fundamentals were so strong that in the recent quarter management announced the plan to continue high marketing spend on new user acquisition. This delays the cash flow breakeven point but would be a positive development from the long-term value perspective since the company operates in a ""land grab"" market. Furthermore, this is another factor which would allow the company to beat the prevailing falling growth expectations.High marketing spend will result in a lower level of margin expansion from fiscal 2018 than in past two years as well as operating losses in Q1 and Q2 of fiscal 2018. But New Relic reconfirmed its goal to achieve non-GAAP sustainable positive free cash flow by March 2018, which should act as a catalyst for share price once becomes evident in the quarterly financial results.Infrastructure product = massive greenfield business opportunityThe company achieved a $9bn increase in the size of the total addressable market following the launch of New Relic Infrastructure. This fact remained predominantly unnoticed since it did not yet produce a tangible impact on the bottom line and its size and timing remain uncertain for the market. What is outstanding about the Infrastructure product is that it is a massive greenfield opportunity i.e. there are no established competitors.Infrastructure product is designed to provide visibility in configuration changes that affect the company's cloud infrastructure and alert users, so they can detect potential issues and reduce downtime. Hence customers can search across tens of thousands of servers and instantly determine where the faulty pieces of software might be installed, and where all changes are tracked in real-time.Total addressable market:Source: New Relic and IDCInitial user data indicates that New Relic Infrastructure would be a highly successful product, where the upside potential is evident from huge customer demand to participate in the beta program. It was announced just 3 months ago and over 1,500 customers requested access (out of 14700 total). For comparison, Insight product currently accounts for ~10% of revenues in 2.5 years since launch and only around 250 customers participated in its beta.Lew Cirne anticipates that Infrastructure product would become a must-have solution in the modern DevOps, which I would trust given his reputation and the lack of established incumbent competitors.Infrastructure product gave rise to the newly rebranded Digital Intelligence Platform, which can now analyze both software and infrastructure data and allows growing enterprise sales faster via bundling. Hence the platform would become the backbone for the core IT functions of enterprise clients by expanding beyond the APM's support for digital business.It is crucially important to note that NEWR got 14,700 existing business accounts to whom it can cross-sell the new product. At this stage, this upside and revenue growth potential are not appreciated by the investors. Among the reasons is that adoption would take time to scale and management indicated that it expects a material impact from New Relic Infrastructure only in the fiscal year 2018.Given the beta signups for Infrastructure product, its greenfield nature and history of revenue growth with Insights I expect that the product would contribute for ~20% of revenues in 3 years' time, which is equivalent to ~$85mil p.a. or $850mil of shareholder value based on 10x Rev multiple for public SaaS. The very fast rollout can be achieved via product bundling, up-selling the existing contracts and utilizing an established marketing network.Importance of AppDynamics dealOn January 24, 2017, Cisco announced its intent to acquire AppDynamics for $3.7bn, a private application intelligence company and NEWR's closest competitor. AppDynamic was about to go public via an IPO which was priced at $2bn EV or ~10x EV/sales. It should be noted that AppDynamics is a smaller company (sales are around 10% lower vs. NEWR) with lower gross margins (75% vs. 83%) and much more negative EBITDA (-53% vs. -24%).The main reason I see behind Cisco's acquisition of AppDynamics instead of New Relic is its top-down marketing approach and product more geared towards large enterprises. Those are in line with Cisco's current market positioning and would make its integration easier and quicker. NEWR, in turn, got a bottom-up marketing where the product is introduced by smaller teams and then expanded to enterprise-wide contracts. Which means it possesses a large number of low-value contracts and Cisco is not well-positioned to work on growing & nurturing those.The key point for New Relic regarding the Cisco's acquisition is the deal's 17.3x EV/TTM Revenue multiple. This valuation would be used as a starting point for any negotiation on the potential acquisition of NEWR. I believe this fact gained little appreciation by the investors and implies huge immediate upside in case of approach by strategic acquirer.Why existing stock price is a good dealFor SaaS businesses in their current early stages of development, EV/TTM Revenue multiple would be the most suitable valuation metric. There are a number of SaaS stocks which possess similar gross margins and revenues growth rates, and in the long run should gravitate towards a fairly similar operating metrics. This makes EV/ TTM Revenue multiple an appropriate comparable metric. The main benefit is that it removes the impact of elevated marketing expenditure for businesses in the ""land grab"" mode.Based on the M&A multiples and relationship between EV/TTM Revenue and TTM Revenue growth, we can derive the current New Relic value in the range of 8-15x TTM Revenue considering the 43% Y-o-Y growth in Q2 FY2017.Given the 2017E Revenues at $261mil and accounting for $197mil of cash on hand, NEWR currently trades at 7.6x EV/Revenue multiple. This represents the very bottom of the potential price range in the case of the strategic acquisition of NEWR and illustrates its undervaluation.Software M&A multiple and growth rate:Source: tomtunguz.comLet's consider a poor case scenario, where growth rates start diminishing and the stock slips to 6.8x TTM Revenue multiple on the back of this, in line with the current public SaaS median. This would imply 2018E valuation which is only 11% below the current levels.The downside may be higher due to persistently high cash burn and inability to achieve break-even despite the managerial effort - since this may cause the collapse of the multiple to much lower levels. But in this respect, NEWR's risk and downside are very limited because the company consistently delivers 80%+ gross margin and management established its ability to reduce cash burn. Free cash flow margin was at negative 5% for H1 2017 with further improvements to come on the back of operating leverage. As a result, the risk of EV/TTM Revenue multiple collapsing below the 6.8x TTM Revenue and decoupling from SaaS peers is non-tangible and suggests very modest downside for NEWR.High revenue growth persistenceCurrently, the market discounts the recent 43% Y-o-Y growth rate, likely attributing it to the early stage of the business and low starting revenue base.I believe the high growth rates are sustainable over the next 3 years and the stock is not appropriately pricing this. Revenue growth should remain above 30% p.a. over the next 2 years on the back of:1) cloud switching supercycle and increasing number of new business apps;2) much superior tech allows aggressively eating into shares of larger competitors (as evident from the data)3) further Infrastructure & Insight products ramp up and cross-selling to ~15k strong existing APM userbase;4) one of the best SaaS Net Expansion rates, product upselling and increasing enterprise account penetration;5) continued high sales & marketing investments at ~40% of revenues and persistent marketing efficiencyMy projections differ with the analyst consensus of 27% growth for FY2018 and expectations for a further decline in the years after. Based on the below revenue growth projections and assuming conservative EV/Revenue multiple at 8.0x for FY2019 on the back of higher business maturity, we arrive with a $3664mil target value which implies 75% upside to NEWR stock price over the next 24-30 months.Source: author's estimatesI believe the market prices in sharply falling revenue growth for NEWR since it assigned a depressed revenue multiple at 7.6x EV/TTM Rev, despite its recent quarterly revenues showing 43% YoY growth. Public SaaS stocks with revenue growth considerably less than New Relic's (table below) trade at median EV/TTM Rev of 9.9x. This suggests 22%+ discount of NEWR to its peers. Furthermore, most of those stocks in the group have gross margin considerably inferior to that of New Relic. Fundamentals suggest that New Relics's growth will stay on its course and its stock should be priced at least in line with those SaaS peers at 10x EV/EBITDA.High growth and high margin SaaS peers:Source: Bessemer Venture PartnersFurthermore, AppDynamics acquisition illustrated the underlying value of NEWR and what a strategic acquirer may pay for the business in the app monitoring space, which stands at 17.3x EV/TTM Revenue and 134% above the current NEWR's valuation.Catalysts:Recent AppDynamic acquisition already led to immediate 7% jump in NEWR stock. This may promote further re-assessment of New Relic's business over the coming months and hence result in further stock appreciation.Infrastructure product ramp up and its impact on the top line growth in FY2018. Strong sales would make the value of the product evident to the wider market.Improved operating cash flows over the next 6 months as the company achieves non-GAAP FCF break with further catalyst in the form of reaching positive EBITDA over the next 18 months. Stronger cash flow position would make the value of leading net expansion rates and operating leverage more evident to the market.Additionally, cash flow break-even and positive EBITDA would attract the new type of investors and reduce uncertainty regarding business sustainability. In turn, lower discount factor and higher demand for New Relic's stock would support its valuation.ConclusionThe stock trades nearly flat relative to its IPO price from 2 years ago despite its substantially higher revenues, much stronger client base, major product launches and exceptional underlying fundamentals. To create value for its shareholders, New Relic simply needs to remain on its path and prove wrong market expectations for declining growth.Not all SaaS companies are equal and New Relic stands apart from the rest with its very high and sustainable gross margin and net expansion rate. Market failed to appreciate this because of the very high growth and its associated negative cash flow position. Such factors make it hard to understand the business performance under the normalized operating conditions. New Relic's best-in-class products, continued high marketing investment, enterprise contract penetration, Infrastructure product launch combined with product up-selling and cross-selling would support exceptional growth over the next 3 years. In short, poor understanding of the underlying value of New Relic's SaaS contracts and its great growth prospects during ""land grab"" period create a great investment opportunity.This article is part of Seeking Alpha PRO.

4052691,102628,2017-03-07T12:01:48-05:00,"This is a ""Deep Dive"" research report highlighting a key secular trend within the software sector and the underpinnings of our investment theses on Atlassian and New Relic.The ADLM and APM software segments are transforming from ""nice-to-have tools used by IT for IT"" into mission-critical systems used by managers inside and outside of IT - including the C-suite, increasingly.ADLM and APM's rise is an outgrowth of a modern-day gold rush in which software is increasingly becoming *the means* of production, and no longer is just a supplemental tool.ADLM and APM are still considered mundane, niche-bound segments, leading to dramatic undervaluation - particularly for the top players.Atlassian and New Relic, innovation leaders in the ADLM and APM segments (respectively), are two of our highest-conviction stocks as a result of this trend.","Contributing Authors: John Freeman, Fred McClimans, Zach MitchellINVESTMENT CONCLUSIONWe believe Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) and New Relic (NYSE:NEWR), both innovation leaders and share-takers in their respective software market segments of Application Development Lifecycle Management (ADLM - $1.7B in total 2015 segment revenues) and Application Performance Monitoring (APM - $2.7B in total 2015 segment revenues), hold the long-term potential to become much larger companies than many analysts/PMs believe. The size and value of the APM opportunity, as well as the lack of established competitors in the space, also led us to list NEWR as one of our top tech M&A picks for 2017.APM and ADLM have existed for decades in various guises under the broader ""Development Tools"" and ""IT Operations Software"" labels, which are considered relatively mundane, niche-bounded areas of software, tactically purchased only by large enterprises during short-lived, once-an-era upgrade cycles.In our view, this reputation no longer fits; software products within the APM and ADLM segments are transforming from ""nice-to-have tools used by IT for IT"" to ""strategic systems critical to the entire business"", resulting in structurally higher growth for both segments over the next decade.In fact, APM's and ADLM's metamorphosis can be seen parts of a grander theme including any software that operates on, manages, monitors, analyzes, secures, and/or helps build other software. We are calling this more comprehensive theme, ""Software About the Software"" (shorthand = SWreSW), which is not a market segment per se but more of a descriptive overlay across established market definitions.There are two powerful drivers behind the SWreSW theme generally and the accelerating growth of APM and ADLM specifically:There are other existing, emerging and embryonic market segments one could describe, to varying degrees, as SWreSW, and we will be covering many of these in future reports. We are initially focusing on ADLM and APM for two reasons:Not only are TEAM and NEWR pure-play beneficiaries from the accelerating growth of ADLM and APM, they also: 1) possess strong fundamentals and superior management teams; 2) hold the potential to expand into other emerging SWreSW-related segments; and 3) are even attractively valued relative to our EPS growth projections.We believe CA (NASDAQ:CA) and Pega Systems (NASDAQ:PEGA) are also beneficiaries of this theme with well-positioned products in both APM and ADLM, although both face some headwinds from declining legacy products.Lastly, we would like to call attention to Dynatrace, a private IPO candidate in the APM space, as well as AppDynamics (NASDAQ:CSCO), acquired by Cisco in January for $3.7B.THEME EXPLANATIONIn this report, we will try to explain one of our favorite long-term themes that appears to have remained under the radar for many analysts and portfolio managers. Before diving in, we would like to apologize in advance. When talking about software, especially enterprise software, one often is forced to use vague terminology, layered abstractions, physical world analogies and even full-blown allegories that, even at best, only describe a portion of the ""software reality"", before falling apart and potentially leaving the reader with a more confused and flawed view than before.And, so, for lack of a better term, we are calling this theme ""Software About the Software"" (shorthand = SWreSW), which is not a specific market per se; it is more of a descriptive overlay on the classically defined market/category/segment/sub-segment hierarchy.SWreSW refers to any software that primarily operates on, manages, monitors, analyzes, secures, and/or helps build other software. There are a number of existing, emerging, and embryonic market segments one could describe as SWreSW to varying degrees, many of which will be covered in future reports.However, there are two entire segments that, today, fall unequivocally under the ""SWreSW"" label:At present, TEAM and NEWR (primarily) and CA and PEGA (secondarily) represent our investment conclusions from the SWreSW theme, and all of these companies fall squarely within the APM and ADLM segments.What Appears to be Conventional Wisdom?Among the reasons why we like this overall SWreSW theme generally and the accelerating growth of the APM and ADLM specifically, is the perception that they are mundane, niche bounded areas of software with limited long-term growth prospects.APM and ADLM segments are classified under the broader market categories of IT Operations Software and Application Development Tools, respectively, which just do not seem like the sexiest, most innovative areas of enterprise software. Historically, this perception has held true. Most segments within these categories have not grown as fast as enterprise software overall, the growth of which has been driven primarily by applications.In the '80s and '90s, desktop productivity suites, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Supply Chain Management (SCM), and Human Capital Management (HCM) applications drove much of the growth. During the 2000s, applications associated with topline growth took center stage - e.g., Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Business Intelligence (BI), and various types of software facilitating e-commerce and digital marketing campaigns.Beyond perception, there were, until recently, a number of good reasons for the lagging growth of segments within the categories of IT Operations Software and Application Development Tools:How We Think Our View Differs From Conventional WisdomIn our view, all of these reasons for the lagging growth of SWreSW generally and APM and ADLM specifically are fading fast. The perception no longer fits the reality. APM and ADLM software products are transforming right now from ""nice-to-have tools used by IT for IT"" to ""strategic systems critical to the entire business"", resulting in structurally higher growth for both segments over the next decade.Revenue in the $1.7B ADLM segment grew 13 percent in 2015, accelerating from 9 percent growth in 2014 and 5 percent in 2013. Similarly, revenue in the $2.7B APM segment grew 19 percent in 2015, accelerating from 17 percent in 2014 and 13 percent in 2013. We believe that revenue growth for these segments will continue to accelerate over the next three years to 14 percent to 15 percent for ADLM and 21 percent to 23 percent for APM.We believe that this growth does not represent a cyclical ""upgrade spending spike"" typical of this kind of software in the past. Rather, these segments will maintain structurally higher growth rates than they have historically well into the mid-2020s.The Logic Behind Our ViewWe see two powerful drivers behind our growth outlooks for APM and ADLM.The first is a paradigm shift, just now underway, from the Web-based application architecture to the fifth major era of enterprise computing most commonly called the MSA (Micro-Services Architecture).The second, more profound and longer lasting driver is a major shift in the role software plays in the enterprise from being a tool that helps manage the means of production to actually becoming the means of production, substituting for some combination of human labor and dumb machines.The Web-based Application Architecture Migrating To MSAThe migration to MSA is still in the ""visionary"" phase of the Geoffrey Moore's famous ""Crossing the Chasm"" adoption curve, with probably less than 10 percent of enterprises having deployed MSA-based applications at scale. However, several high-profile enterprises have deployed MSA very successfully at massive scale, including Amazon, Netflix, and Uber.We believe MSA will cross the chasm be adopted rapidly as it extends several advantages, including much faster application development and deployment and the potential for almost on-the-fly integration with other MSA-based applications internal and even external to the enterprise (e.g., customers, suppliers, partners).It is also fundamentally a much more scalable architecture, and it can scale up very rapidly, which is critical these days when some new customer-facing app can ""go viral"" and the number of concurrent users can explode from 5k to 5M in a matter of days. To get a better understanding of this architectural migration, a little historical perspective might be helpful.Despite the continuous talk in the industry over the years about increasing software integration and the value of offering enterprises entire suites of software, each stage in the history of enterprise software is about breaking code up into increasingly smaller chunks and establishing standards that enable those chunks to operate together with increasing seamlessness and flexibility.In the mainframe era, applications were singular, monolithic pieces of software centralized in a single location. The client-server architecture split the code in two, with data and some of the application logic being centralized on a server and some executed locally on a PC. In the mid-1990s, software called middleware appeared on the scene to link multiple, heretofore independent client-server applications via various message-passing protocols.During the early-2000s, client-server started to give way to what can be generally referred to as the Web-based architecture, a change that is still taking place among more conservative technology adopters. Simply explained, the Web-based architecture divided up the server side of the client-server architecture into multiple, discrete ""tiers"", each running on a separate server or cluster of severs. It also replaced the client side application with a standard Web browser that could be used to access any application that an enterprise has moved to a Web-based architecture.By standardizing access with the ubiquitous browser, Web-based computing eliminated the need for applications to run natively on a specific client-side operating system. This turned out to be a critical catalyst for the take-off of SaaS and cloud computing from 2005 to 2010 and was a key initial step in making enterprise applications accessible from smartphones and tablets.Even as enterprises were adopting the Web-based model, new standards were developed and added in order to speed up application development time and enable rapid feature release without putting the entire application, or worse, multiple dependent applications, at risk.These standards, falling under the label, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), further divided and partitioned applications into discrete, self-contained chunks that executed a particular set of operations defined as a ""service"". Operating together, these services can replicate the functionality of a more monolithic application but would be much more flexible, dynamic, and resilient.Some enterprises deployed SOA to some degree but, for a number of reasons that are outside the scope of this report, the SOA architecture was not widely adopted. However, SOA did lay the foundation for MSA, which was adopted earliest by enterprises where, as one might guess, software was the means of production.Some argue that MSA represents a finer grained version of SOA or that MSA is simply ""SOA done right"". There is probably truth in both of those statements, but rather than get bogged down in the abstractions and the nested taxonomies required to discuss software architectures, we would simply like to state the following: unlike its technologically justified predecessor SOA, MSA, in our opinion, has clearly demonstrated its business value and that is why we believe it will be adopted rapidly.However, as is the case with every major change in computing, MSA creates a new set of challenges in terms of developing, debugging, updating, deploying, and, overall, managing applications.With MSA, each micro-service can use different technologies inside its own ""instance"", can be written in a different languages each optimized for the workload the micro-service performs, can access multiple databases with differing data structures, are distributed across a larger number of servers that may be on-premises, in a customer's data center, or in a SaaS/PaaS/IaaS provider's data center, and may even move from server to server in order to quickly scale both up or down or recover from hardware failure or a software bug.These are among MSA's advantages, but, obviously, this heterogeneity often requires using multiple legacy tools for development, monitoring, management, security, etc. Of course, generally, those tools often do not, themselves, scale particularly well or play well together.To make matters more complex, as the number of micro-services grows in a production environment, so do the dependencies among them, creating an increasingly complex ""mesh"" of software instances.For starters, this really changes the way software is developed, requiring a much higher degree of automation, documentation, and tracking that is close to impossible for human programmers to handle without help from, well, more software. It also makes performance optimization and troubleshooting not only substantially more difficult in terms of sheer scale but also different in kind, as monitoring agents need to be, more or less, as atomized and distributed as the micro-services they are monitoring.These challenges materialize at every stage of the application lifecycle - from scope/spec definition all the way through maintenance and version management.They are also different in scale and character from those ever encountered during the two previous (still contemporaneous) eras: client-server and Web-based applications. Therefore, not only will MSA adoption crank up overall demand in APM, ADLM, and other SWreSW segments, it will create opportunities for a whole new generation of products and vendors because most legacy products will be useless in solving the emerging challenges of the MSA paradigm.Further, these tools will not be just for large enterprises as has primarily been the case in the past. Even small companies that are increasingly using IT and software as a strategic, competitive advantage (and those that are not doing so will increasingly be put out of business) and are adopting a MSA can no longer view these tools (e.g., application lifecycle management, automated code testing, application performance monitoring, among others) as luxuries.Employing these tools will be table stakes. As an aside, this need for a different approach hampers legacy vendors in the IT Operations and Application Development categories and represents an additional point of conviction regarding our primary investment conclusions, TEAM and NEWR.So, if all that is occurring is a change in architecture, even if it's a major change, we would expect revenue growth in these segments to surge for a few years only to then fade as adoption of the new architecture moves into the late majority and laggards at the backend of the adoption curve. Historically, changes in application architecture have produced spending spikes in the tools used to develop, manage, and secure applications. However, enterprises typically view investment in these areas more tactically, simply the cost of upgrading the infrastructure of the IT department.At present, we are certainly seeing a spending spike in ADLM, APM, and other SWreSW segments. However, we also believe that the growth in demand for ADLM and APM is actually more structural and of much longer duration, with these segments moving from line items in the IT infrastructure and operations budget to being business-critical tools for the entire C-suite, not just the CIO or CTO.That brings us to our second driver, software's changing role.Software's Changing Role Is Changing the Nature of Business ItselfThe second and more powerful SWreSW driver was summed up by Netscape founder and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen in his 2011 WSJ op. ed. where he famously declared, ""Software is eating the world."" His point, with which we very much agree, is that software, fueled ultimately by Moore's Law's biennial one hundred percent transistor surplus, is disrupting, disintermediating, and fundamentally transforming traditional industries one by one.Traditionally, the primary role of enterprise software was to assist humans in managing the means of production. Today, increasingly, software IS the means of production. The difference is not semantic; it is profound and critical to understanding how tech, software specifically, will continue to invade and transform non-tech industries, just as Amazon has done in retail, Apple/iTunes did to the music industry, Priceline and Expedia have done to travel agencies, and Uber is doing to taxis.Pick up any business magazine now and there are multiple articles referring to this trend and they are not targeted at techies. Tech, software in particular, is no longer for techies and programmers; it is for anyone running a business.Over the last fifty years, enterprise software has proven increasingly effective in helping humans manage the means of production, which has primarily consisted of two elements, other humans and dumb machines. Most of the enterprise software market revenue and most of the C-suite attention has gone to the applications, with the well-known categories of ERP, CRM, HCM, SCM, BI, and desktop productivity suites taking the bulk of both the revenue and attention.Still, not long after software began to be used to help run businesses in 1960s, several new types of ""software about the software"" emerged that helped in creating, managing, and securing the software being used to run the business.However, these SWreSW market segments, such as APM and ADLM, were still two steps removed from the means of production. Therefore, they remained confined to niche markets with none of the open-ended upside of the aforementioned applications that they were helping to create, manage, and secure.We believe that the status and role of SWreSW changes substantially as software itself becomes the third element of the means of production, with segments like APM and ADLM moving into a position only one step removed from the means of production. Hence, it stands to reason that they should become just as important as those applications like ERP and CRM that were used to help manage the incumbent elements in the means of production, humans and dumb machines.If that seems a little far-fetched at this point, consider this: SWreSW segments like APM and ADLM will not only be helpful in managing the software element of the means of production in the same fashion as ERP and CRM have in the past with humans and dumb machines, they are absolutely required to do so.Unlike humans and machines, software can operate on a vastly larger scale, at much greater speeds, and, to the degree that it is allowed, autonomously. Any element of the means of production that can affect that much that fast all by itself is going to need an equally powerful entity to prevent disaster, optimize performance, and make sure everything goes as close to plan as possible. That entity cannot be humans alone. Lots of new software will be required, ""software about the software"", to be exact.Our premise is that, if there is an outage in the software that helps humans manage a purely human-plus-machine means of production, the business can still ""go manual"" and continue operations, albeit more slowly and inefficiently.Hypotheticals could include:The reality is that even if one of the most so-called ""mission critical software systems that must never move off of a mainframe"" (quotation marks added for sarcastic emphasis), that is, the ticketing system for airlines, goes down, every airline has procedures for taking, tracking, and billing ticket sales using a pen and paper.In contrast, if Uber's software goes down, its business stops cold.There is no ""man config mode"" for Uber, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), LinkedIn (NASDAQ:MSFT), Priceline (PCLN), AirBnB, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and numerous other companies where software is the primary means of production.It is no surprise to us that these companies and many more that also employ software as the means of production are large consumers of ADLM and APM software, including products from TEAM and NEWR.Amazon, ever-the-trail-blaziest adopter of new technology, actually developed its own APM software for its own use years ago because the company felt that:While companies like these that feature software as their primary means of production represent the ideal market for SWreSW, they do, at this point, still represent a small portion of enterprises. Nevertheless, these companies are laying the foundation and setting the example.The lessons they are learning about how to employ software as a means of production will make their way over the next few years into a set of ""best practices"". They will become the ""trade secrets"" possessed by executives hired away from the innovative new companies by more established companies trying to infuse some software into their means of production. Then, these best practices become the repeatable template sold to these same established companies by management consulting firms brought in by the new executive who needs third party validation to get buy-in from the rest of the C-suite.It will not be long before the lessons learned in the process of injecting software directly into the means of production make up the curriculum of the leading business schools.We believe that chief among these best practices is heavy investment these companies have made in SWreSW, especially in ADLM and APM software.Again, the investment in and daily usage of SWreSW will not be a best practice for the IT department. It will be a best practice for all managers and executives. When a good CEO really wants to check on the health of the business, she goes down to the factory floor or to a sales meeting or to R&D brainstorming session and talks to the employees and listens to them. How do you do that when your employee is software? You need an entity that can speak the same language. You need ""software about the software"".The point is, when humans and machines were the essential elements of the means of production, software was brought in to increase efficiency but was not, strictly speaking, required to maintain operations. In contrast, when software serves as any portion of the means of production, SWreSW, is required to a much greater degree.When software becomes an element in the means of production, enterprises require much more powerful SWreSW products generally and APM and ADLM products specifically. So, we believe that the market for SWreSW will expand substantially in the three critical dimensions:REFERENCED COMPANIESBottom Line: Software is disrupting, disintermediating, and fundamentally transforming industries one by one. Enterprise software in particular is undergoing a dramatic change, as it is increasingly becoming the means of production, rather than serving merely as a supplemental tool that assists humans in managing the means of production. The difference is not semantic. As an example, at companies like Uber, Amazon, Facebook, LinkedIn, Priceline, AirBnB, Netflix, etc., software is the business, and if there is a software outage, the entire business stops cold.APM and ADLM software tools are consequently transforming into mission-critical systems - not the niche-bound, only-the-IT-department-cares afterthoughts that they have been historically and are still largely considered by investors. We believe that revenue growth for these segments will continue to accelerate over the next three years to 14 percent to 15 percent for ADLM and 21 percent to 23 percent for APM, and will remain at structurally higher growth rates well into the mid-2020s.NEWR and TEAM - APM and ADLM innovation leaders, respectively - are two of our highest-conviction stocks as a result of this trend and because of their strong management teams and business models. We look forward to writing about both in more detail as they continue to develop tools that help software eat the world.________Don't miss an alert or update.

This trend, which we've termed ""Software About The Software"" (shorthand: SWreSW), can be read about in more detail here.Cisco's challenge will be to augment the AppDynamics growth engine, rather than subverting it into a Cisco-oriented growth engine (that will come later).This move clearly increases the pressure on Cisco competitors to embrace software and analytics as key value drivers moving forward, as hardware continues to become more of a necessary commodity rather than a value/growth driver.With that in mind, we believe the biggest winner of all may actually be NEWR-the most forward-thinking APM vendor, in our opinion.We've covered NEWR in depth and listed them as one of our top 10 M&A picks for 2017 (see New Relic: Could App Analytics be a Tasty M&A Snack? here).""New Relic nicely bridges this gap between software and business, connecting application management data with more business-oriented intelligence and analytics tools, allowing IT operations to better monitor and manage its software, while providing executives and c-suite executives with business intelligence and performance analytics data.""The APM space has been quietly trending up for the past three years ($2.7b of revenue and 19 percent y/y growth in 2015, up from 17 percent and 13 percent y/y growth in 2014 and 2013 respectively), and we project the growth rate to continue accelerating over the next three years to 21-23%.In addition to the APM upsurge, NEWR also seems poised to capture any AppDynamics-relinquished market momentum as the latter diverts its immediate attention towards its own M&A integration process. Just as important, NEWR now remains as the only public APM pure-play for investors seeking exposure to this emerging market.AppDynamics' $3.7 billion purchase price suggests a P/S multiple of 16x on CY16 sales and 11x on CY17 sales, a healthy premium relative other fast-growing SaaS companies. Even after today's price jump, NEWR looks very attractive from a valuation perspective trading at 6x CY17 sales. Using an 11x multiple on NEWR calendar CY17 sales estimate of $340M would imply a $3.8B market cap, suggesting 90% upside in the current stock price.OUR RECOMMENDATIONSCisco's acquisition-and, especially, the greater-than-100% premium-validates the value proposition we see in the APM space. We believe NEWR is poised to benefit considerably, and we reiterate our position."
4007427,98236,2016-09-20T18:01:00-04:00,"New Relic is a fast-growing company with a cloud offering in the APM space.The company is still a long way from profitability, but it is supposed to reach that goal by the end of its fiscal 2018.The company has many competitive advantages compared to its competitors and it is gaining market share against it rivals very rapidly.The company has developed a dashboard product to extend its footprint beyond APM, a wise move given the revenue limitations of the space.The company's mobile product, which is a very unique offering, was responsible for a large win last quarter and should provide for further differentiation down the road.","What does it mean to be the top in the Application Performance Monitoring Space?I suppose the lead-in might be conceived of as ""click-bait."" Although writing anything at all about APM that might be considered click-bait would be a real challenge far beyond the abilities of my keyboard. I do not think that anyone has ever considered that application performance measurement apps are sexy or exciting anymore than a thermometer or a barometer. Screens full of all kinds of numbers and graphs with different colors explaining capacity utilization or latency. Not exciting.Actually New Relic (NYSE:NEWR) doesn't seem to be quite the leader in the APM space, but given its high growth rate and its status as the only company of some scale to be publicly traded, it has some claim to some kind of market leadership, if the market is defined properly. So, it is certainly possible that investors will get a kick out of investing in the shares as the title of the article suggests. The title for the article - well, it comes from the Cole Porter song ""I Get My Kick Out of You"". It was part of a very well known Porter show of 1934 called ""Anything Goes"" that has loads of show stoppers.Why the name New Relic? I have no idea. Try as I could to see the connection, one is not immediately apparent. A relic is usually considered to be the physical remains of a saint or the personal effects of a saint or other venerated leaders. At least that is what I remember.There is software that might be considered as a relic of an earlier era that could be identified by New Relic. But that is a stretch. Perhaps the thought is that NEWR software will prevent users from running their apps on relics that have down market performance. Or maybe it is just to get users to wonder amongst themselves and become interested in this company's set of solutions.The APM category is as old as the software space. If Neanderthals had computers, they would have had APM. (Of course, one of the distinguishing characteristics between ourselves and Neanderthals was that they lacked imagination or the ability to process symbolic information and hence spent their time on this planet without the benefits of IT. How terribly sad.)The problem with the category is that it has never gotten very large. Gartner's read on the market is that it is around $3 billion/year in terms of total revenues for APM. Adding software that looks at availability and network performance brings the TAM to $8 billion as of 2015.But adding availability and performance software to the mix decreases the CAGR as that category is experiencing just 1% expansion. So the largest companies in the space are not all that large. There are signs though that the CAGR of the APM space itself as well as the CAGR of the Network Performance Monitoring space is accelerating noticeably. In 2015, NPM grew by more than 21% and APM grew by 11%.Historically, the growth in APM was limited by both competition from homegrown systems and because of some ingrained reluctance on the part of larger enterprises to test and monitor the performance of their applications. It has become less feasible to deploy homegrown technology in monitoring web applications, and given the payback there is in getting performance of web based applications right, the long-term ceiling in this field seems to be lifting.For many years, it has been typical that many users have contracted for monitoring on a very short-term basis. That has been particularly the case for SMB vendors who are concerned about the Christmas rush or other users who are most concerned about monitoring performance during a seasonally high period for the usage of a particular application. That can lead both to seasonal differences in revenue comparisons and it does lead to difference in average contract terms which impact reported bookings growth.In the very short term, these kinds of metrics can influence share price performance. That wasn't the case this past quarter. The shares appreciated about 5% in the wake of the earnings report despite significant conference call questions regarding the length of contract terms and deferred revenue. But investors should be aware that there will be a quarter that investors dislike because of sub-headline metrics.Should investors buy the shares of New Relic? Probably not at this point or with this valuation. There is a mismatch between expected growth, lack of profits and EV/S that needs to be rectified. But as I will go on to explain, this is a company whose prospects are excellent and should come to dominate its space and that should lead to sustainable profits and cash flow. The shares are worth putting on a watch list and trying to pick them off. It is how I intend to proceed.What is happening to wake up the APM space?Basically, as more workloads move to the web, the web is responsible for more commerce. The difference in latency of a few tenths of a second has been found to have a noticeable impact on click-through rates and the amount of commerce transacted on a site and during Christmas holiday season, when sites often bog down, knowing what is happening allows site owners, in some cases, to remediate the problem. But equally, as workloads move to third-party infrastructure which has guaranteed standards of performance and availability, it has become more important to ensure that web service vendors are providing the service for which a user has contracted.The largest vendor in the space today is a company called Dynatrace. Dynatrace belonged to Compuware for a number of years during which its performance was typical of that for most Compuware assets - and for those readers unfamiliar with that, it means politely put that it was disappointing, although some of us who had the misfortune to cover the name might use a word starting with ""s"" or two different words starting with ""s"" to describe the performance of that company's set of solutions. Dynatrace became No. 1 in the space by following the typical software industry playbook - it bought its largest competitor Keynote in 2014 and moved to the top of the heap. Keynote itself had been one of the more frustrating of names to follow. It may have earned the distinction of having the lowest valuation of any company that averaged 20% growth because it could never string two successful quarters together. IBM (NYSE:IBM) is No. 2 in the space and has lost market share along with the third largest vendor CA (NASDAQ:CA) whose market share has fallen consistently and who suffered through a miserable 2015 in the space. The sixth company in market share is a firm called AppDynamics which was founded a few years ago. It has a growth trajectory comparable to that of NEWR and is likely to move up a couple of places in market share this year based on current trends.New Relic is in the fourth position overall and has more than doubled its market share in two years. Based on its current performance in terms of revenues and its forecast, the company is likely to be No. 2 in terms of the APM market this year and should outgrow Dynatrace in absolute dollar revenues as well. So while NEWR is relatively small and is estimated to reach only $254 million in total revenues this year, I think it is worthwhile considering the name and determining if it can translate revenue growth to profitability and significant sustained positive cash flow. Don't worry readers, you haven't missed that part of the story. The company has forecast that it will reach both sustained positive free cash flow and non-GAAP breakeven by the end of fiscal year 2018 (ends 3/31/18).The other major question will indeed relate to market share and the company's growth. Forecasted growth this year is 40%, forecasted growth next year is 27%. 27% is still a decent level but it changes the valuation calculus materially. From my perspective and remembering the antecedents of the market leaders none too fondly, I would put my money on NEWR to outperform its rivals in this space very noticeably and I feel that the reversion to the mean that is forecast is less likely than it might otherwise seem. At the moment, and based on a market cap of $1.91 billion and with about $200 million of cash and no debt, the EV/S stands at 6.7X based on the current year forecast of $254 million in revenues and at 5.5X based on revenues forecast in the analyst consensus for 2017. At those levels and lacking either positive cash flow or profitability, there is no significant potential for positive alpha. Indeed, while the shares are near an all-time high at this writing, they are up just 3% YTD. So the question in the eyes of this writer is whether or not those are the correct numbers to use.A deeper dive into New Relic's numbers, strategy and outlookNew Relic is of course a cloud-based company and has always been so. All of the other companies in the space, with the exception of AppDynamics, started with an on-premise model and have migrated and that has given NEWR an advantage in GUI and the ease of use of its products when compared to competitors. It has been typical of most companies in this space to use a land and expand strategy and NEWR is no exception. It has thousands of small customers who use the tool to monitor the performance of their digital ""store-fronts"" either at peak retail season or around the year. It also has a growing stable of enterprise customers who are acquiring the software to ensure that their companies get value from the applications they buy or internally develop. To the extent that investors drill down significantly, most of them like to see growth in the enterprise business which has much longer average contract terms coupled with far larger transaction sizes. Average annualized revenue per customer was only $17,000 a quarter, although that is up 36% year on year and 8% sequentially. Given the new pricing initiatives, the CFO forecast a deceleration in that growth rate.This past quarter, company CEO Lew Cirne announced that the company had closed a seven-figure plus transaction with a brick-and-mortar retailer based to a significant extent on the company's abilities to extend its software to the mobile apps space. President Hilarie Koplow-McAdams said on the call that ""New Relic Mobile registered its strongest new business quarter yet"" and that it was the single greatest contributing factor to the seven figure win in the past quarter.The company has evolved a new packaging and pricing offering to enhance its opportunities to capture land customers. CFO Mark Sachleben said the company's conservative forecast for the current quarter was to an extent based on a strategy that will result in more but smaller customer acquisitions that hopefully will exhibit growth trends equal to or greater than has heretofore been the case. The dollar based net expansion rate in the quarter was 118% which was actually down as anticipated from the prior quarter. If the new customers who the company plans to capture with the new pricing and packaging follow that pattern, then it will have positive results for the company.The company believes, overall, that it will see a significant increase in average deal size and that in turn will lead to greater seasonality with the typical software phenomena of seeing a very large Q4. Guidance for this year doesn't seem to be tracking that way to any significant extent.Given the history of the APM space, the company has prudently begun to develop what might be described as a real-time dashboard of surrounding metrics and telemetry to help users have a complete view of their business. This is a very nascent undertaking but it offers the company the ability to escape from the ceilings that have plagued other APM vendors. I think that a key to the ability of this company to retain its revenue growth at levels well above the consensus forecast is going to be the Insight product that encapsulates the dashboard functionality. Can Insight become a 10% contributor to the company's revenue? There is not enough evidence and the company hasn't provided enough in the way of signposts to develop a real trend analysis for the product.There are many metrics that some observers look at in trying to analyze the performance of a company with thousands of users, most of whom spend very little. Many of the statistics at this point are noise in that there is is simply not enough history with which to develop a statistically significant trend. But for whatever reason the commentary on this call was very focused on second and third level statistics which do not have much to do with forecasting the trend of revenues for this business.If I were forecasting the company's revenue prospects based on the size of the market, based on the competition and the company's current momentum in competitive engagements and the traction of its new products, I would be inclined to think that it will be able to significantly exceed 26% growth. Its strategy should work, in my view.And profitability?Yeah, how about profitability? The company has achieved non-GAAP gross margins of 80% and that is about what a reasonable goal is going to be for that metric in the longer term. There have been some signs that GAAP expense measures are showing lower growth rates with a concomitant improvement in operating margins. Research and development was 27% of revenues last quarter and that is up from 23% in the year earlier period. On the other hand, sales and marketing spend was almost 66% of revenues last quarter, down rather significantly from a 75% ratio in the prior year. General and administrative expense was 17% last quarter, significantly down 21% the prior year. Overall, the operating loss ratio was 31% on a GAAP basis, a decent improvement of more than 900 bps from the prior year's ratio of 39.4%. Stock-based compensation at 12.5% of revenues is less than that of some peers. Stock-based comp was 12.1% of revenues in the same quarter the prior year. The non-GAAP operating loss margin for the quarter was 17%, or 1,400 bps better than the GAAP operating loss margin. CFFO was marginally profitable this past quarter and has been oscillating between positive and negative. The CFO forecast that it would be negative in the quarter that ends the end of September. The company's capex at $32-$34 million is expected to be significant this year for a company of this scale as it builds out data center capacity to support its growth. With a current balance of $196 million of cash and equivalents, this company has no liquidity issues.During the course of the conference call, the CFO said he was proud of 40% growth with a 1,000 bps improvement in profitability. Overall, management forecast is essentially that the GAAP margin for the year will be around a negative 26% for the year. (The company doesn't forecast GAAP margins, but I have just interpolated from its forecast of non-GAAP using the current levels of stock-based comp.) Since the operating loss margin was 31% this past quarter, the ramp to reach 26% for the full year is pretty steep. That implies quite a bit of cost seasonality as the revenue seasonality required to reach the forecast of $253 million is not all that significant. And it implies very substantial cost discipline of a kind not yet seen at this company to reach its target of non-GAAP breakeven operating income by the end of fiscal year 2018.On a non-GAAP basis, the operating loss margin was 17% this past quarter and is forecast to be at 13% for the full year. Getting from 17% to the 10%-11% range which is required to average 13% loss for the full year will be no mean feat, I suspect, and yet it has to happen in order to achieve guidance.While I think the company has an excellent opportunity to grow at significantly above the 26% forecast of the consensus next year, I think getting to non-GAAP breakeven status even by the end of the period is going to be a stretch. While I have no reason to believe that the company will not be able to achieve the cost targets necessary to achieve breakeven by the time period it has forecast, and I am sure that New Relic budgeting apps have conveyed the obvious points to management, the swing from the current non-GAAP operating loss margin of 17% this past quarter to break even seven quarters into the future would be a significant accomplishment.What's this worth?I think composing a recommendation on the shares of this company is a close call. And that is what it is all about. The shares are simply too expensive for me to recommend at current levels absent better visibility than I have with regard to revenue growth significantly above the current forecast. I think investors are going to need to see at least a couple of quarters that show a faster path to profitability or better than forecast revenue growth before there might be the opportunity for the shares to have material positive alpha potential. Investors have many ways of evaluating the timing of their investments. I would certainly be looking to buy these shares if there is a significant market pullback. And I would also look to buy these shares if investors are not pleased with some sub-headline metric as described above.To put it mildly, the APM space has been a fraught adventure for investors. I believe that New Relic strange name and all is likely to be the first opportunity investors will have to make money investing in the space. But not at $37.58/share. I am intrigued, but not quite ready to pull the trigger."
3793106,54942,2016-01-07T09:46:55-05:00,New Relic aims to disrupt the application performance monitoring market with its highly scalable SaaS platform.The company is shifting towards the enterprise space which is boosting ARPU at a tremendous rate and which is likely to continue over the next several years.The premium valuation is already reflecting the strong growth prospects and we think investors may be able to pick up shares at a much lower price.,"New Relic (NYSE:NEWR) is a possible disrupter in the systems management otherwise known as the application performance monitoring space. The SaaS vendor's core business is the using of software analytics for IT operations management and business analytics. The company as it stands is unprofitable and will likely stay that way through 2018. But the highly scalable SaaS business model and the large market opportunity in the space should allow the firm to ramp up revenue growth and eventually profitability over the next five years.The need for software analytics - the gathering of metrics in real-time from live production software and transforming it into actionable data - answers businesses questions of how their e-commerce portal is performing and what can be done to strengthen the channel. We think the company prospects are extremely bright but that the current valuation reflects that opportunity.Large Market Opportunity To DisruptThe APM market was estimated to be approximately $2.4 billion in size in 2013, but their solutions are spread across a few major IT markets that expands the total market opportunity to greater than $10 billion. But we think the company is likely to add additional modules and develop solutions that will allow it to compete in the combined IT operations management and business intelligence spaces which would increase their TAM to $30-$40 billion in 2016. We think they continue to expand their offerings into adjacent areas such as infrastructure monitoring, which they have already started with their acquisition of Opsmatic, as well as security and additional applications for business users.The application performance management market is growing at a fast-clip despite its small size at $2.4 billion. Third-party research states that the software segment grew by 13% in 2013, over four-times the rate of the broader IT operations management market. We think they can capture approximately 5% to 7% of the market by 2017, up from the current 2%, or revenue ~$250 million. As the APM market continues to grow, the two emerging vendors, New Relic and AppDynamics, will gobble up a large portion of share from the legacy players.Large Runway For Revenue, Especially Within EnterpriseAs the company ramps, they are continuing to move up market and increase the number of large accounts under their purview. Revenue has grown at a 97% CAGR over the four years and is expected to grow between 35% and 45% over the next three years. More importantly, the company is adding customers at an increasing average revenue rate. As paid business accounts has risen from ~6,600 in fiscal Q1 2014 to ~12,800 in fiscal Q2 2016, the average annual subscription revenue has increased by a like amount from ~$7,600 to ~$13,500. This is being driven by a shift towards the enterprise which is key to driving ARPU higher.Their hybrid approach with 100 commission-based sales reps focused mainly on the inbound telesales channel - with a handful outbound selling to enterprise customers of 1,000 employees or more. This hybrid approach brings in the SMB client but also helps drive into the much more profitable larger enterprise segment which we think will help push ARPU higher over the next several years.We think the ARPU is likely to be the largest upside driver over the next several years with their revenue forecast only needing ~7% ARPU growth to be achieved. This compares with the 20+% ARPU growth that they have realized over the last two years. As they grow, they should be able to garner the attention of more enterprise customers and drive deeper penetration into the segment, driving ARPU higher and outperforming their revenue benchmark.The freemium subscription model with a 100% SaaS-based business model allows them to give out free trials of 14 - or 30-days. They then give the option of either staying on a limited free-trial basis or upgrading to a paid Pro or Enterprise subscription with most being annual contract commitments. We would note however, that their customer base is currently ~80% to 85% annual commitments so this is not the typical SaaS subscription business with multi-year locked contracts. The shift to the enterprise is helping to de-risk the firm as they are moving to multi-year invoicing, which will increase deferred revenue and the revenue visibility over time.(Source: Investor Presentation)The business model should help them continue to achieve increased operating leverage. While COGS as a percentage of revenue is likely to increase 100 bps over the next two years, the other expense pieces are likely to drop substantially, especially sales and marketing from the current 76% of revenue rate. Gross margins were 80+% in the most recent year which is down from the ~85% rate a few years. The decline has been driven by the build-out of new services including Insights and additional customer support. However, we think that the company being already above typical SaaS-firm levels means they can actually approach on-premise software gross margin levels once they scale.First Analyst Day Provides Visibility Into New ProductsThe growing portfolio of products that the company is offering is enabling it to expand with existing customers and win new accounts, especially within enterprise as we noted. This is evident by the 1.6 products that the average New Relic customer purchases along with the dollar-based net expansion rate of over 120% over the prior several years.The FutureStack announcements didn't have any notable core product releases, but they did include some key changes. One of them is the update to Visual Data Explorer, a tool that gives business professionals a point and click interface whereby they can create their own dashboards similar to the offering by AppDynamics. This obviates the need to write new queries in New Relic Query Language and moves to a user-friendly, non-IT based interface system.Enterprise and Pro customers can now access eight days of event data storage on the dashboard as part of their subscriptions, versus the previous one day available. We think this change is aimed at driving increased usage and sales of Insights by showing potential customers the value of storing data for longer periods of time. This is an incremental fee revenue generator for the company for which they think there is a strong value proposition for clients.They also gave insight into what they see for their recent Opsmatic acquisition, which we think is opening them up into moving into the infrastructure monitoring space. The cloud-service company for DevOps monitoring was in the start-up stage when they acquired it, but we think can be integrated and leveraged onto the New Relic platform with relative ease. This will give New Relic the ability to give customers real-time visibility into every component of their apps - from the infrastructure all the way down to the user experience.ValuationThe shares are currently trading at a premium valuation with what we think is a fully-valued price at the moment. At 11.2x EV/Revenue and profitability several years out, we would not be surprised to see the shares pull back below $30 in the near-term, lock-step with what other SaaS IPOs have done recently. The current growth rate is indeed quite phenomenal and likely to continue through 2020. Even by 2020, revenue growth is likely to be in excess of 20% with profitability ramping extraordinarily fast on their operating leverage.We detailed a 10-year DCF model to show the assumptions for future growth. We believe this is a fairly fruitless effort as the ability to forecast more than two or three years out, especially in a fast moving and highly-disruptive industry such as software development, is highly speculative.Looking at relative valuation, on an EV/Revenue basis, the shares are trading at a premium compared to the broader group of SaaS and high-growth companies. The premium is not small either at 60+%. The closest comps in the space are Splunk and ServiceNow, although they are not growing as fast, they are high-growth firms in the space. They are trading at 10.5x and 12.4x EV/Revenue, respectively. Our estimate based on this modeling would be to use a much lower multiple to account for the risks and the lack of profitability. We've seen in the past year many IPO SaaS businesses trade much lower based on the lack of profitability despite very high growth rates.We actually think that eventually the multiple is likely to be lower than the 8.0x used for 2017e revenue. While the shares are not extremely overvalued and thus do not warrant a short position, we think they are fully valued for the strong growth prospects that the market and management has forecast. But we think given recent IPO trends in which multiples fall off fairly significantly once the cache wears thin, there could be a strong buying opportunity in the shares down the road.ConclusionWe would be patient in the purchase of these shares as we think the lofty valuation is likely to see an industry-wide re-rating lower similar to other IPOs in the space in recent years. New Relic has very strong growth prospects but we think that is currently reflected in today's valuation. In addition, the shares are controlled with two private equity firms owning large share blocks and the founder owning over 50% of the outstanding equity. This makes a buyout highly unlikely. We think if investors are patient with the share price that they can pick them up with a two-handle on them over the next six to twelve months."
3230876,48411,2015-06-02T15:21:38-04:00,"NEWR continues to be my dark horse pick for 2015 in the SMB/enterprise solution space.NEWR's product portfolio is comprehensive, differentiated, and a highly visible value-add.NEWR is growing at very attractive rates and it's showing cross selling growth as a contributor.As NEWR continues to fill out its product portfolio capacity look for its key metrics to accelerate in growth.Continue to own this overlooked name - big things are ahead.","I continue to beg my SMB/enterprise solution readers to take a deep look into New Relic (NYSE:NEWR). This company is an absolute rock star that's fulfilling a need that has zero rock stars. In fact, I would argue that when you get really deep into the NEWR story that nobody else is doing what it does. That type of differentiation and that type of value-add are a dangerous and highly lucrative mix that you want to own.NEWR is the rare still misunderstood SAAS player that the market continues to overlook. I just don't think it can continue to overlook it for long. Consider getting at the very least a starter position on the board. NEWR has been my pick for the SMB/enterprise space to be the dark horse performer of the year since its IPO. Shares are down 8.4% since initiation of coverage.NEWR had a blowout quarter that wrapped up a blowout fiscal full year 2015. For those unfamiliar with the NEWR story, NEWR is a ""software-as-a-service provider of software analytics products which allow users to monitor software performance with .NET, Java, JavaScript, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby applications deployed in a cloud or in a data center (SOURCE: NEWR SEC filings)"". It offers 5 products as of fiscal year end which are:I believe NEWR to have a complete and holistic product ecosystem but apparently management is looking to expand on the SKU count in fiscal full year 2016. Exciting, exciting times are ahead if that's the case as NEWR just recently released its Insights and Synthetics products and added the follow on Data Apps SKU as well. Data Aps is an attachment product for Insights which allows Insights to be deployed on mobile devices - a huge shot fired that introduces NEWR to the mobile game and allows for a full revenue capture when available.NEW CEO Lew Cirne elaborated on NEWR's intentions to continue growing platform capacity:These additional SKU's showed immediately traction with both new and existing customers and were largely responsible for the financial outperformance and guidance outperformance given at FQ4/15.Revenue was up a whopping 75% Y/Y for the full year and 68% for the quarter Y/Y. Keep in mind this was taking place during an upmarket move from an SMB focus to an enterprise focus AND while NEWR was developing new SKU's.That's impressive to say the least but the good news didn't stop there:Best of all NEWR exited the fiscal full year with $210 million in C&CE, down only ~$4 million sequentially. While NEWR's cash burn has fluctuated in a wide range T36NM its cash flow statement shows no burn rates that exceed ~$30 million on a full year basis inclusive of CAPEX and operational burn. I believe this figure provides excellent visibility into NEWR's future burn rates and by way of that examples that NEWR is not at risk of near term dilution risk or risk of taking on debt. Even if NEWR were to get aggressive with acquisitions, which I don't anticipate it will as it creates all of its own growth and technology via effective R&D spend, it still would have ample liquidity and operational flexibility. I see nothing but balance sheet strength at this point.At year-end NEWR counted more than quarter of the Fortune 100 as customers even though it has only had enterprise reps in the field for four quarters. During FQ4 alone NEWR was able to add customers such as Aramark, the Center of Medicaid and Medicare, GE Capital, National Geographic Society, Panasonic, REI, Telus, Atlassian, Docker, GrubHub, Kochava, TangoMe and TrustPilot. I think NEWR is just beginning to scratch its potential from an enterprise standpoint but that it should also be able to continue selling into a massive SMB market. Again, this is a combination you want to own.My recommendation is to buy NEWR. Buy it and DCA into a whole position if you must but get something on the board. I expect big things from NEWR in time.Good luck everybody."
3675966,96286,2015-11-11T11:03:40-05:00,"New Relic’s quarterly report for Q2 beat revenue and growth expectations, but their stock price still suffered.We will analyze why investors are worried New Relic was not able to obtain enough new enterprise customers.Hope remains as New Relic integrates with Amazon Web Services, paving the way for enterprise customers in the cloud.","New Relic's (NYSE:NEWR) revenue and growth were positive for the second quarter, beating investors expectations. Being in the tech industry, I know they have a solid product that programmers love. It seemed like a great investment, except for one thing, their stock price took a tumultuous hit and fell 13% over the past few days.Founded in 2008, New Relic is a software analytics company that helps customers monitor their software to make business decisions in the cloud. Their technology is delivered through a SaaS-based model. Since going public in 2014, they have shifted their focus from acquiring small tech companies to enterprise companies. The issue with last quarter was that they were not able to obtain enough new enterprise companies.New Relic's quarterly report came out November 5th. They beat revenue expectations, but their stock price still suffered. Their price is not likely to recover until they can prove enterprise companies are willing to use SaaS-based software analytics.Current GrowthIn their second quarter the number of paid business accounts went from 10,590 to 12,840 year over year (YoY), representing 21% growth. A majority of their paid accounts are small businesses, which is a strong indicator of traction in the market. They expanded relationships with enterprise clients Airbnb, GameStop, Petco and Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM).Revenue beat expectations and went from $25,361,000 to $42,928,000 YoY, representing a 69% increase. So the real question is, with such substantial growth in revenue and market share, why did New Relic have a 8% loss in share value?To answer this question we are going to look at the total addressable market of tech and enterprise companies and see how much revenue can come from each.MarketNew Relic's customer base is comprised of tech and enterprise companies.The number of tech companies in the US is around 100,000. In 2008 there were 103,585 companies with 100-plus employees in the US. A majority of them have some sort of IT. In total, 1795 of those companies were enterprise and had 5,000+ employees.Small Business vs. EnterpriseFor small businesses the current price of using one of New Relic's services is $149.00/Month. Therefore a small business represents a $447.00 quarterly revenue potential. If New Relic maintains a 21% growth rate, which will decline at some point, new revenue related to small businesses would be $3,658,308.78. In the future, New Relic may figure out a better way to monetize their smaller customers through cross selling and a new pricing model.On the enterprise side, we will assume one enterprise company is paying just under 10% of New Relic's revenue, but could pay more then that in the future. This would equal $4,292,800.00. Ultimately the acquisition of a enterprise customer is vastly more important than gaining many small tech companies.It's uncertain what each enterprise company will pay to use New Relic, but if a company is not heavily invested in tech, they will pay substantially less. There also is the possibility of future competition that could undercut New Relic's price model for enterprise companies. Both scenarios will result in less potential revenue.Another way to look at this is comparing revenue potential to total market share. When using this form of analysis, It becomes clear that gaining one enterprise company is equivalent to around 5,000 small businesses.Despite substantial gains with small and medium sized companies, the lack of new clients on the enterprise level was a major influencer in the decrease of stock price.RisksThere are several factors affecting whether New Relic can acquire new enterprise customers.Enterprise companies have been slow to switch over to the cloud and SaaS-based software. Many may be unwilling altogether for a variety of reasons including prior investments in hardware and legacy systems, security and long-term cost of using a SAAS product.The timeline of many enterprise companies to start using software analytics may be several years, giving ample time for competitors to establish themselves. New competitors can come in and solely focus on the enterprise, offering services that New Relic does not have yet.There is always the possibility of a tech giant, such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), coming into the space and grabbing market share due to their connections with enterprise companies and significant resources.Future GrowthNew Relic just started a beta program for their product in Amazon Web Services (AWS). This presents a great opportunity to reach an untapped market.AWS is the largest cloud hosting service and boasts revenue of 1.67B last quarter and is on track to becoming a 6.00B business. AWS already has a large number of enterprise companies and New Relic has the potential to tap into this revenue stream.Clearly New Relic's true value is in their ability to obtain enterprise companies. The big question still remains, will enterprise companies switch over to the cloud and SaaS products? Given the growth rate of AWS and other cloud products I predict it will happen sooner rather than later. Thus, while New Relic's stock price has taken a seemingly surprising hit amidst a time of overall growth, if the firm can capitalize on enterprise integration with AWS, investors can expect New Relic to return to a profitable long-term hold."
3211446,20521,2015-05-26T11:27:09-04:00,,"Earlier this month, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced the release of Application Insights, a solution to help organizations monitor and track their application performance. The move marks Microsoft’s entry into the application performance monitoring (APM) market. Among its competitors, Microsoft will also have to count Billion Dollar Unicorn club member New Relic (NYSE:NEWR).New Relic’s Offerings San Francisco-based New Relic was founded by entrepreneur Lew Cirne in 2008. Prior to founding New Relic, Lew had set up and sold Wily Technology to CA Inc. Wily Technology provided capabilities of enterprise class application performance management (APM) and brought them to the Java platform. After selling off Wily, Lew focused his attention on the SaaS segment and soon founded New Relic.Today, New Relic offers a cloud-based suite of products to help organizations collect, store, and analyze software data in real-time. Their application monitoring platform enables a more efficient technology department that is able to find, fix, and forecast performance problems in applications. Their products include an APM suite that provides code level visibility for production apps; a mobile offering to monitor network and app performance for mobile devices; Insights which is an analytic engine where data is collected, stored, and presented in a meaningful way; and a server management service. Developers can also use their products for browser monitoring capabilities and access free plugins from over 90 partners to test on their apps.Given the increasing adoption of mobile devices, New Relic has increased their focus in the segment. During the recent quarter, they had announced plans to expand the Insight offering to include mobile devices. The upgraded Insights will provide companies with the ability to unlock app performance, user engagement data from their mobile apps, and seek real-time answers to questions about their mobile business. The platform will also allow organizations to analyze custom events to support individual business needs.In 2014, they acquired Barcelona-based data analytics platform Ducksboard. Ducksboard is another SaaS company that helps customers visualize and monitor data in real time from multiple data sources in a single dashboard. Ducksboard had built integrations with over 65 applications including Google Analytics, Twitter, MailChimp, Stripe, WordPress, salesforce.com, and Zendesk.The expansion into mobile and advanced analytics will help New Relic make a bigger push into the larger enterprise segment. Traditionally, the company has focused on the SMB segment. Of late though, they are reaching out to larger organizations through their offerings. New Relic will begin to face tougher competition in the industry because of the recent entry of Microsoft.Last month, Microsoft released Application Insights that works with Microsoft .NET, Windows-based applications, Android, iOS, Linux, and enterprise Java applications. It also  supports ASP.NET, C++, PHP, Ruby, JavaScript, and Python among others. The service is currently available as a public preview, and the commercial release is expected soon. Microsoft is planning to sell the service for a fee, based on the amount of telemetry data collected.New Relic’s Financials New Relic operates on a freemium model. Their basic product is available for free and comes with 24-hour data retention capabilities along with providing access to online support. Premium options are available at prices starting from $149 per month per host and offer features such as unlimited data retention capability, transaction traces, and cross-application traces.For the recently reported quarter, revenues grew 68% over the year to $33.4 million, ahead of the Street’s forecast of $30 million. Loss of $0.22 per share was also better than the market’s projected loss of $0.25 per share.New Relic ended their fiscal year with revenues growing 75% to $110.4 million and a non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.85.For the current quarter, New Relic forecast revenues of $34.5 million-$35.5 million with a net loss of $0.23-$0.26 per share. They expect to end the year with revenues of $155 million-$159 million and a net loss of $0.95-$1.03 per share. The Street was looking for revenues of $32.5 million for the quarter with a loss of $0.24 per share. Analysts had modelled the year at revenues of $147 million and a loss of a dollar per share.Their stock is trading at $32.71 with a market capitalization of $1.5 billion. In December 2014, New Relic had raised $115 million by selling 5 million shares at a price of $23 each. Prior to the listing, they had raised $214.5 million in venture fund from investors including Fidelity Investments, Wellington Management, T. Rowe Price, Passport Capital, BlackRock, Dragoneer Investment Group, Benchmark, Passport Ventures, Tenaya Capital, Trinity Ventures, DAG Ventures, Allen & Company, and Four Rivers Group. Their valuation has grown steadily from $750 million in 2013 to $1 billion as of April 2014."
3241346,48411,2015-06-07T18:32:50-04:00,"NEWR CEO Lew Cirne gave a great presentation at the JP Morgan Global Technology, Media and Telecom Conference.Cirne was again excellent with his color and his candid answers to questions regarding Competition, Differentiation, And Growth Creep.Continue to be long NEWR.","New Relic (NYSE:NEWR), one of my favorite SAAS SMB/enterprise solution names, gave a post earnings conference presentation that was candid but insightful (no pun intended). NEWR CEO Lew Cirne gave some excellent commentary around a few items that I think investors considering a NEWR position but aren't quite feeling familiar enough with the company can appreciate.Before getting into that, just to reiterate, NEWR is a software monitoring and analytics platform provider that offers a suite of products that can be subscribed to as stand-alone or as a comprehensive solution:(SOURCE: New Relic: Growing Enterprise Traction And Product Portfolio Expansion)The following are my key takeaways from the New Relic Inc at JP Morgan Global Technology, Media and Telecom Conference presentation (via Sentieo.com).New Relic & New Software …So this was an interesting statement from Cirne in that he's saying here that NEWR has been able to grow at the rates it has been without running into anything ""sticky"" so far - that it's been sticking strictly to the low hanging fruit. I have to wonder how much business NEWR has allowed to move past it and at what rate that would have moved the topline. I'm not mad, I'm actually impressed.I think this bodes really, really well all things considered and I think it is a smart move in that, as Cirne alludes, we're in a massive evolutionary cycle for software in which the new software being created is absolutely huge in volume. Why climb up the tree for fruit? Just pick up the stuff on the ground. Cirne is a smart CEO who literally, not figuratively, invented software analytics. If he thinks this is the way to go, I'll back him.NEWR Can Assist …Guys that follow me know that for the SMB/enterprise space I demand some form of differentiation. NEWR defines differentiation from a product portfolio and capacity standpoint but the fact that it also is uniquely suited to support languages uniformly is huge. Again, I think this is something that comes directly down from Cirne who still codes to this day. He participates in product development when he can which is a great contributor to the overall culture at NEWR. The big takeaway here is that NEWR isn't like everybody else in an already uber-limited competition space. That matters.Competition …A nice segue from our above point into the competitive environment is led by Cirne's next commentary. NEWR doesn't want to be on-premise for the headache reasons alluded to above but also because that would distract from its pure-play SAAS focus. This SAAS focus is in itself a differentiator in that NEWR is building a brand associated with SAAS and only SAAS - a market it knows it can service well and unique via its product portfolio. This particular commentary just really ties together what we've been breaking out to this point and I thought it was an important point in the conference. In particularly I like the, ""We've got virtually no competition in the below-the-enterprise level,"" note. I thought that was great to hear being long the stock.Growth ""Creep"" …Call it cohort organic growth or penetration expansion, call it whatever you want. I call it growth ""creep"", which is to say that without additional dollars NEWR slowly sees its prior wins become larger. Because there are no additional customer acquisition costs this also makes these customers more profitable. You can imagine with that does for NEWR's overall economics and for longer duration model leverage. Both are helped out greatly because of this.This is also the reason why I think NEWR should keep growth as the primary objective for some time into the future. I think that NEWR should focus entirely on the land grab in front of it and then on profitability, not the other way around. Because NEWR has evidenced growth creep in the past it should be able to achieve greater and greater relative leverage as its cohort years grow older and older and as its existing cohort years grow in size to new cohort years (which of course have fresh customer acquisition costs attached to them).This, to me, was a huge takeaway from the conference because this isn't something that is readily available in the public filings. Awesome give from Cirne.NEWR The Dark Horse ...Guys, I know this name hasn't paid out just yet whereas plenty of my other SMB/enterprise picks have but as is the case with Zendesk I really, really like this to be a top performer in the long run. Do some serious research into NEW because I think if you spend the time you'll like what you see.Continue to be long NEWR.Good luck everybody."

The increasing demand is driven by the growing need of enterprises to gain better business visibility and monitor applications to deliver customer satisfaction and improve operational efficiency. An earlier Markets and Markets research had estimated the industry to grow 13% annually through the year 2019. Despite the strong market growth, New Relic (NYSE:NEWR) is not restricting its presence to the APM market and is, instead, diversifying to other software services.New Relic's FinancialsNew Relic's fourth quarter revenues grew 57% to $52.5 million, ahead of the market's forecast of $50.7 million.

The market was expecting revenues of $54.3 million and a loss of $0.22 per share. New Relic forecast the year's revenue at $248 million-$253 million and a net loss of $0.61-$0.69 per share. The Street was looking for revenues of $243 million and a $0.65 loss per share.New Relic's Expanding OfferingsOf late, New Relic is diversifying out of the APM market into other software offerings. It is developing a multi-product software analytics platform for which it is seeing strong demand. Recent quarterly metrics suggest that 30% of its new monthly recurring revenue added during quarter came from non-APM products. Two years ago, that number was under 5%.As part of this effort, during the quarter it introduced new features across the New Relic Software Analytics Cloud that will offer the enterprise's IT operations teams increased visibility along with the ability to diagnose and resolve performance problems quickly. The offering already is being leveraged as part of its expanded partnership with Major League Baseball. The two will now be able to integrate New Relic's app monitoring and data analytics capabilities to improve MLB's digital properties. It will leverage software analytics to help MLB drive successful digital transformations and strategies. Together, the two companies will jointly produce a weekly MLB Now segment called ""Digging into the Data"" which will highlight new insights about individual player performance and will be available for on-demand viewing via MLB.com. They will also co-host collaborative technology-focused events, for which details are yet to be disclosed.The company also is increasing its focus on the government sector and has initiated proceedings for the certification process for compliance with the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). Once completed, New Relic will get authorization by federal agencies to allow them to confidently use cloud products such as the New Relic Software Analytics Cloud.Its stock is trading at $29.4 with a market cap of $1.47 billion.

Enter software provider New Relic (NYSE:NEWR).New Relic (Mkt Cap: $1.71b, TTM revenue of $222m - expected to announce quarterly results 07 FEB 2017) nicely bridges this gap between software and business, connecting application management data with more business-oriented intelligence and analytics tools, allowing IT operations to better monitor and manage its software, while providing executives and c-suite executives with business intelligence and performance analytics data.Yes, the Application Performance Management (NASDAQ:APM) space is crowded with competitors old, new and nascent. However, we believe New Relic represents the most forward thinking and strategically well-positioned of these competitors. Interestingly, AppDynamics, a rival software provider in the APM and app analytics space, recently announced its intent to IPO in early 2017 - both firms are going after a slice of the combined IT operations and business intelligence/analytics market that Gartner pegs at around $40b for CY2016. That's the size market we get excited about.Who are the likely candidates? New Relic has no shortage of M&A options that we feel bring solid value to the table.

3014236,48411,2015-03-19T13:57:34-04:00,NEWR recently announced its Insights solution has gone mobile.This should be huge for margin expansion and retention.I also believe longer term this could lead to a new revenue segment or a consulting and optimization spin-off.Continue to be long NEWR.,"New Relic's (NYSE:NEWR) New Relic Insights calendar Q2 launch to provide mobile data and analytics should mean guidance increases are coming maybe as soon as the end of calendar Q2 but almost certainly by calendar Q3 reporting. With NEWR's Insights product scheduled for calendar Q2 mobile launch this would mean we should get a huge uptick to revenue guidance for FFY2016 (NEWR's next quarter reporting will conclude its FFY15). With my previously stated NEWR bull thesis intact Insights furthers my bullish sentiment and my thoughts that NEWR is a must own enterprise solution during 2015.Remember, NEWR already had similar capability within its product portfolio at the time of its IPO and listed mobile capabilities within its product suite in its S-1 filing:However, the build-out and expansion of Insights' capabilities into the mobile arena brings a new level of sophistication to the company's ability to service this huge and lucrative need. I believe this makes NEWR a much more attractive mobile analytics provider to its larger customers within its enterprise segment. NEWR doesn't provide a breakout of products by segment and really doesn't provide any granularity as to product penetration on a product or segment level but my guess is that having two products of varying sophistication (and price point) will allow for a more tailored solution providing to SMB's and enterprises. While NEWR's customer base by number is heavily weighted to SMB its largest spenders are clearly enterprises and it does have over 1100 enterprise accounts, including ~10% of the Global 2000 (SOURCE: New Relic Inc at Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference). Insights being launched into mobile should have immediate-term and long-term uplift effects to the financials.First, Insights should allow for deeper penetration and further saturation of the enterprise book that has already been accounted for from a cost standpoint. Put more simply, additional sales to existing customers are essentially cost free with NEWR's solutions being delivered via the cloud rather than needing to be implemented on-site. This of course means these add on sales come at extremely high margins which are good for driving the entire income statement.Second, NEWR's ability to show additional value to enterprise customers, who at some point will likely be more of a net contributor to the financials than the SMB book even at a much smaller total customer count, also should do well to increase an already stellar record of retention. Both are bullish NEWR share price. The combination should lead to NEWR reporting a lift to dollar base net expansion rate and spend per account, two highly visible and easy to track metrics that guide NEWR's company health:Finally, I believe the collection of this massive amount of data from mobile devices could lead eventually to a NEWR consulting segment being established in which NEWR assists with app development and optimization. Of course the data being used would have to be blind data but the fact is if NEWR can capture a meaningful portion of the mobile application data coming from its software and refine this into sellable packages used for optimization this new and much larger data set (including basic items like geographical location, device specific data, application performance based on memory usage, etc.) should be monetizable. I know that NEWR's CEO and founder Lew Cirne has wanted to stay away being a ""hands on"" company but an optimization segment would makes sense considering NEWR's clients actually implement its products' code directly into its end points (applications, web pages - literally their software allows NEWR's code to be ""over the top"" of it). Regardless of if this forward looking prediction comes true the Insights expansion is bullish.I continue to recommend a long position in NEWR on all durations."
2823986,48411,2015-01-16T13:16:47-05:00,"NEWR's attractive IPO has become a little rich, wait for lower pricing.NEWR's land and expand strategy shift from SMB to enterprise forces a buy at current valuation metrics to take on substantial risk.NEWR's well-funded, fast growing, and has an attractive product but wait for evidence it can compete in the enterprise space or for lower pricing.","New Relic, Inc. (NYSE:NEWR) recently came to the public markets in mid-December and is off to a hot start, up 42.6% after pricing its IPO $2 (~10%) higher than the targeted midpoint listed in its S-1.What's driving this frothy IPO buying after a cooling off period by the general IPO markets? NEWR is participating in a very lucrative niche of the business analytics space and has been growing quickly over the last two and half years, as listed in its S-1 filing. It provides an optional benefit to SMB's and to a small capacity of enterprises that can really increase efficiency and effectiveness of broader models.NEWR is developing its own brand of Software Analytics to better help businesses answer those performance specific questions, questions that with current data infrastructure can often take days to get a response to and at the cost of tying up other valuable resources. ""How long do items stay in a user's cart prior to purchase?"", ""what are the demographics for people who have searched for product ""X""?"", ""which users have had a bad experience?""NEWR's platform, which is cloud-based and run on a SAAS model, greatly speeds up this process and cuts down on the wasted resources normally expended to derive these analytics - increasing overall business efficiencies and production. In business, analytics means money. Money means value-add.NEWR's platform collects, stores, and analyzes this data derived from existing infrastructure software for customers and then presents this data in real-time, on demand, via easy to read, easy to access dashboards.I sat through an hour demonstration on the platform in which functionality, ease of use, and endpoint monetization was exampled. The platform's value-add is readily apparent and is something that, depending on price point, I would recommend to my consulting clients almost uniformly across the board. Data are so important to remaining competitive in today's business environments and having real-time analytics of this data, without having input responsibilities, is huge.Apparently, NEWR's customers agree with me. NEWR has experienced substantial key metric growth across the 30 months detailed in its SEC filing and it's been able to show this growth while not having a direct enterprise sales and support operation in place to focus on larger accounts.To this point NEWR has been focused on that sub-enterprise niche of customers that falls beneath the Oracle/SAP/Google business analytics umbrella, to which I applaud them for focusing on. It's never a bad idea to come out in the early years of land and expand with a very niche based vertical focus, which this niche also happens to be underserved, to lock up a large base of customers to provide revenue visibility to the financials. There's also the fact that NEWR's SAAS based delivery provides the value of the smaller and mid-size customer not having to stack maintain or have any substantial overhead costs associated with acquiring analytics. Again, the customer and dollar based growth has been excellent:Besides paid business accounts, NEWR offers free full use of its platform on a trial basis. The dollar-based net expansion rate has shown to grow and grow quickly. Paid business accounts have tripled since 1H/12 and the dollar-based expansion rate has grown on an actual dollar basis as the percentage rate of growth has worked itself through larger and larger base figures. Being a subscription based model, seeing this type of front-end and sustained growth of platform is going to be huge to the financials in the near-term in both managing cash burn into further scale up and in being able to plot out profitability to the public markets. Both will need to be done on NEWR's first call as a public company for the share price to be maintained.Now, before getting to those financials I should note that the big reservations I have about NEWR's longer term viability despite its nice platform, and really this is more a concern about its valuation currently (~$1.51 billion - PSR of 24X, PB of 13, EV/Sales of 22X), lie in the substantial competitive risks that it's going to face going forward. It's one thing to be the nice SAAS option that is eating up a bit of the non-enterprise market share and that is providing a broader feeder introduction to larger platforms at the next level (the enterprise level), it's a whole other story to actually come up and compete with the multi-national juggernauts of the space. I have to wonder with plenty of substantially similar services available in the enterprise space, there really isn't an option readily available for the SMB space that NEWR is currently targeting, and a significantly (although now well-funded) smaller set of resources to what level of effectiveness will NEWR be able to penetrate this next group of prospects with. That's the big reservation I have with NEWR's current valuation and its stated plans to go get some big fish in the mid-term.I like the SMB targeting going on currently, I like the international expansion - forwarded greatly with NEWR's recent acquisition of Spanish-based Ducksboard (2011 SAAS startup in the data visualization space, expert at creating visual data sets and dashboards, integrations with over 65 applications, optimized operations for larger screens, etc.), and I like that NEWR now has the funds to do more of the same. I just wonder how much risk I'm willing to take on at a 24X PSR going into a new land and expand.NEWR's current strategy, however, is well suited for the company and has been wildly effective:For fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014, its revenue was $11.7 million, $29.7 million, and $63.2 million - representing Y/Y growth of 154% and 113%. That is outstanding growth of a new solution into a space that is traditionally not a big user of non-revenue generating services (generally, analytics don't directly generate revenue although clearly they do on the back end). For the six months ended September 30, 2013 and 2014 revenue was $26.1 million and $48.0 million - representing Y/Y growth of 83%. Clearly, momentum is still strong and I would think that ~90% FFY15 growth is not out of the question now with larger funding.Despite this outstanding revenue growth, as with most young subscription model based companies, NEWR has posted substantial and growing losses. Inception to date NEWR has an accumulated deficit of ~$100 million and that should grow substantially over the next few years as scale-up's are executed across the company. While losses aren't something I would be concerned with if long this stock, it is something that the company has to plot out (as mentioned above) on conference calls and eventually have a plan for driving operating leverage through each checkpoint of each scale up. This should work to created binary earnings periods for the company, as is often the case with checkpoint stories, as NEWR's operations and share price outlook are going to be entirely tethered to the growth rate of revenue. This is one of the big reasons I have an issue out of the gate with the change in strategy to enterprise sales based, regardless of how large a shift. I think NEWR should do more of the same for at least the next four quarters, get some value out of its funding from the IPO, and then ask the markets for faith. Not the other way around although at the valuation metrics listed earlier the market is certainly giving NEWR plenty of faith.Outside of the growth strategy complications, the other financials at the company look stellar. NEWR has a solid balance sheet - well, as far as I can tell from what was given in the abbreviated financials in the S-1:Again, with the funding raised at the IPO the company has plenty of cash to speed operations and I fully expect it to get aggressive with an acquisition or two in the near term. This should work to increase the company's competitive ability and strategic positioning especially if NEWR focuses on the less competitive international and emerging markets, which may be the strategy with the Ducksboard buyout. Obviously that brought the company expanded abilities but I just don't see how that purchase could be done without the intention of wanting to sell much deeper into the Spanish and greater Euro markets. NEWR already has a good base of international exposure to revenues and in my opinion that was a shot fired saying that it's looking to do more business in that capacity. I like it.NEWR also has a clean capitalization which has allowed it to not have unnecessary legacy funding pressure to the income statement. This also should free up flexibility for when the company does need to do its next round of funding, although that won't be for some time down the road (assuming zero acquisitions):While NEWR's model has been cash burn intense since inception and the company does have meaningful off balance sheet contractual obligations the IPO proceeds provide plenty of mid-term visibility of funding. I expect NEWR to burn ~$30 million in cash during FFY15 (ending in March) ex. acquisitions:Where's the trade?I think the trade is to wait. Yes, NEWR does have an attractive platform. But that platform's level of attractiveness, at least on the front-end until the company can prove otherwise, is on a sliding scale based on size and based on resources. I guess more simply put what NEWR provides isn't necessary to operating a business, it simply provides the business with the opportunity to run more efficiently and more effectively. If you're a SMB that has zero margin or a larger enterprise with more immediate and obvious accretive ways to deploy capital you're probably going to pass on business analytics in the immediate term. That doesn't just go for NEWR, that goes for the entire business analytics space.I don't think analytics are at a point yet in the operational dynamic where they are considered an absolutely necessary expense, more an optional driver. That could potentially cause problems for NEWR at the next size level of companies that it's going to target. At the enterprise level, rather than the SMB level, NEWR is going to be competing with the big boys of the business analytic space and those big boys can afford to use analytics as a retention tool rather than a primary revenue driver. I'll give an example.Think about a huge analytics provider like an Oracle or a Google, yes Google is big in this space. Now let's say Google is selling Company A a huge cloud storage facility or some other primary driver of Google's bottom line for this particular client. Now, let's say NEWR gives Company A's CFO and CTO a call and presents its value prop and the C-Suite decides NEWR Software Analytics are better for the company than the broader based business analytics being offered in a bundle from Google. It's at this point that the larger, better funded, not dependent primarily on the business analytics for revenue company can simply bring pricing down to match NEWR or provide the analytics at cost to retain the higher margin (in this scenario) primary service. You see how that works? There aren't many companies in the business analytics SMB space that can afford to throw pricing out the window or that have the product suite that they can position the analytics segment as an ancillary driver of revenues. That changes one level of company size higher and that puts NEWR at a competitive disadvantage to larger incumbent competitors.Rightly or wrongly, the Oracles, SAP's, and Googles of the world are going to have the reputation of being the white glove solution provider for this need in the enterprise space and that presents a hurdle (which could potentially be very expensive) for NEWR to overcome. Again, they can also afford to price down to retain clients.I think in the mid-term NEWR can certainly win some business and for all I know a good amount of enterprise business. Its platform is as good as any I've ""used"" from those other names but we're not talking about a situation where NEWR is coming with incumbent advantages anymore - not like its current domination (as evidenced by the financials presented above) in the SMB space where its actual technology is 1) better than a good portion of competitors, 2) differentiated as the smaller competitors usually have one point solution that the SMB may or may not be looking for or that may or may not be as effective for what the SMB is looking for, and 3) where NEWR is facing an equal playing field from a pricing flexibility standpoint . On the other hand it may just have to pay (meaning margin contraction caused by pricing pressure) for entry to the enterprise space and at the current valuation metrics I just can't own shares. If NEWR's shares trade lower, closer to the IPO, I may begin to actively look for a position but trading way up here I will be in wait mode.I look forward to providing continuing coverage in the future. Good luck to all."
2923656,48411,2015-02-17T15:27:16-05:00,"NEWR answered the questions it had to in order to change the narrative from uncertainty to one of justifying risk of ownership.NEWR showed operating leverage on a GAAP basis, but especially on a non-GAAP basis when only backing out share-based comp.NEWR is a BUY on this post-earnings sell-off.","New Relic (NYSE:NEWR) had a great FQ3 that showed me what I needed to see to get long the stock. If you follow my writings on NEWR, you know that I was uncomfortable buying the stock without any data as to how the company's focused transition from SMB to enterprise selling was going. Clearly, it's going well based on the FQ3 results.Getting right to it, and to bring those new to NEWR up to speed, NEWR CEO, Lew Cirne summarized the NEWR value-prop beautifully on the company's FQ3 CC:He also summarized on why the switch from SMB to enterprise:Now, with those in mind, NEWR's operations showed some really positive steps:First, revenue grew rapidly as it has for NEWR historically. Total revenue grew 69% on the Q and 78% on the 9M with all revenues segments growing at greater than 90% ex. US revenues on the 9M. For the 9M US revenues grew 69%, EMEA grew 101%, APAC grew 96% and Other revenues grew 92%. Growth was never the issue at hand and with FQ4 guided revenues of 52.5% at the mid-point it shouldn't be in the near-term.Growth was driven over the 9M by NEWR's expansion of its sales team, its growing network effect, its ability to close larger deals (NEWR closed a record number of $100,000 plus deals in the quarter) - both from a company size perspective and from an ""agents"" (read: modules) sold perspective, and from the introduction of several new agents gaining further traction. Over the course of the last 12 months, NEWR has grown from two product SKUs to five in its overall product suite including launching both New Relic Browser and New Relic Synthetics in Q3. I expect both of these new agents to drive sales into the balance of 2015 and to show significant net contribution beginning in FQ3/15. It should also be noted that the three newly introduced agents account for ~10% of revenues, so the market opportunity is still very undeveloped.Now, you're probably saying ""Yeah Dallas all of that is great but the losses are growing at such a fast rate."" You're right. NEWR is growing its losses but it's actually seeing operating leverage when looking at the income statement on a GAAP basis as a percentage of revenues:You can see that gross margins held strong on both the Q and the 9M in the low-80% range and further down the statement that operating expenses, loss from operations and net loss all showed excellent movement toward break-even. NEWR cut its net loss as a percentage of revenues almost in half on the 9M.These figures look even better when backing out share-based comp (which would bring us a non-GAAP figure) and that's inclusive of leaving in D&A and other non-cash charges.Share based comp figures have been removed for the readers' convenience in the last graphics and net loss figures have been presented ex. share based comp in red.I'll also provide the share based comp figures separately, in case any readers would like to track these for modeling:So, make note that even in the very early innings of a focused sales shift to a more difficult customer to close and to a market with longer sales cycles that NEWR saw operating leverage. Also, make note that NEWR has three highly immature products that should continue to drive average revenue per customer higher and that should create even higher an already absurd dollar-base net expansion rate. During our third quarter, NEWR saw a dollar-base net expansion rate of 132%. This performance was the strongest in the last six quarters, and reflects success across all three growth vectors previously discussed. For clarity, NEWR details this metric as ""calculates the net growth in our installed base (SOURCE: NEWR 10-Q)"" and believes it to be a key indicator of the success of its land and expand strategy. I would say things are going well.These excellent operations led to what showed as meaningful reductions to net cash used in operations:Inclusive of some period to period shifting of line items in the operations section, to which I've highlighted, NEWR made definitive progress on its initiative to move towards cash flow break-even. Now, while still a great distance away, especially when factoring in CAPEX, the company is showing progress here. This too is a great example of why it's important to do a three statement breakdown of young, growing companies. The share-based comp and other non-cash charges that destroy the income statement often overshadow positive developments on what I think is the most important statement - the statement of cash flows. Again, NEWR isn't writing home about its annual run rate just yet, but it is in fact making forward progress.Still, it should be mentioned that NEWR's cash burn currently and in the near-term isn't a concern because of the large amount of cash sitting on the balance sheet. In fact, NEWR plans to be aggressive with further acquisitions if it can find them:NEWR ended FQ3 with $205 million in C&CE which gives it plenty of funding visibility inclusive of any sizeable acquisitions it might make. Most recently NEWR acquired Spanish-based Ducksboard (2011 SAAS startup in the data visualization space, expert at creating visual data sets and dashboards, integrations with over 65 applications, optimized operations for larger screens, etc.) to help drive its international revenues which stand currently at ~35% of the totals. I look for at least one more-than-tuck-in acquisition to be announced over the balance of 2015, as I can't imagine NEWR carry on for too long with that much cash not doing anything productive.The story has changed at NEWR from one of uncertainty to one of worth taking on risk. I like NEWR's direction and I'll be getting long shares at market open on 2/17/15."
2923106,61281,2015-02-17T13:19:11-05:00,"New Relic went public two months ago and soared 48% on the first day of trading.In retrospect, New Relic's IPO was relatively successful but yielded below-average return.Investors who were intrigued by the company’s rapid growth should expect a substantial upside in their positions.","Application analytics vendor New Relic (NYSE:NEWR) reported its first quarterly results as a public company last week, beating analysts' consensus for revenue and EPS. The higher-than-expected results sent New Relic's stock to a new all-time high price of $38 per share, representing a 65% increase from its IPO price two months ago. However, common investors who purchased the stock on the first day of trading at $30 or purchased it on the second day of trading experienced a small loss on their investment. In the same period, the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) gained 4.7%, and other big data players such as Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), Tableau (NYSE:DATA) and Varonis (NASDAQ:VRNS) gained double-digit returns. If New Relic presents such a poor return compared to other players in the big data market, why should an investor consider investing in the company?IPO Success In RetrospectNew Relic used an underpricing tactic when it went public to attract demand for the IPO. The company priced its IPO at $23 per share, which is 25% below its Series F preferred convertible stock price of $28.9 (source: New Relic S1). Underpricing is used to attract investors to the offering and theoretically gain a higher return because of the large demand. In New Relic's case, this is partially correct. As shown in Chart 1 below, New Relic's stock price at the end of the first day of trading was 48% above the IPO price, which is below the SaaS/Big Data average of 65%.To put New Relic's IPO in perspective, we need look at Hortonworks (NASDAQ:HDP) IPO, which took place on the same day as New Relic. Hortonworks priced its IPO at $16 per share, well below the $24 price (post-reverse split) of its series D funding round. Hortonworks used the same tactic as New Relic, probably to ease the pain of the bad timing and raise as many funds possible under the negative sentiment in the market. Hortonworks ended the first day of trading at $26, representing a 65% increase from its IPO price, which is substantially higher than that of New Relic. Now, let's see how the underpricing tactics went for both companies. Hortonworks ended its first day of trading at $26, which is 8% above the share price in its last funding round, and New Relic ended at $34, which is 17.6% above its last funding round share price. Obviously, the underpricing tactic was a big success in New Relic's case, and institutional investors can be pleased with the move. However, what about the common investors, who purchased the stock when it was in the $30 price range and have experienced not-so-impressive returns so far?Top Line And Stock Price GrowthFirst of all, the obvious needs to be said: New Relic is a small growth company that is not suitable for many investors. New Relic presents significant growth year-over-year and impressive loss-per-share improvement, but it also holds great risk for investors, as many micro-cap stocks do. Having said that, New Relic reported better than expected Q3 revenues, which were $3M higher than analysts' consensus, and smaller loss-per-share than expected. Moreover, New Relic grows its top line rapidly, as shown in Chart 2 below. New Relic's revenues increased at a 19% quarterly rate, and gross profit increases at an 18% pace. This is an impressive rate and is probably one of the reasons that investors are attracted to the company.In the earnings release, the company provided guidance for the fourth quarter that reflects a $107M revenue for the year, which is a 70% year-over-year increase. The fourth quarter guidance reflects a $38 share price, assuming a 16 P/S ratio, which reflects a 15% upside from the stock's current price. Assuming New Relic continues to grow at the same pace (with a small erosion in growth rates) and under conservative sales assumptions, my estimation for FY'16 is $158M in revenue, +/- 5%, which is a 48% year-over-year increase from FY'15. That impressive top-line growth reflects a stock price of around $50 per share, which is almost 50% higher than the current price. The common investor who purchased the stock at $30 per share at the beginning could benefit from a 50% increase in stock price in the next year.ConclusionNew Relic's IPO was relatively successful and yielded slightly lower returns than the average SaaS/Big Data IPO. However, the company's underpricing tactics was successful, and New Relic was able to raise as many funds as was possible during that difficult period. Top-line growth and expected FY'16 revenue of $158M suggest that investors who purchased the stock at the $30s should benefit from a possible 50% upside."

2689775,73565,2014-11-17T19:35:24-05:00,,"This post is part of a continuing series evaluating the S-1s of publicly traded SaaS companies in order to better understand the core business and build a library of benchmarks that might be useful to founders.New Relic (NYSE:NEWR) is a San Francisco-based, 534-person company providing tools for engineers to understand how well their code is performing. The company operates in the Application Performance Management category, which New Relic calls Software Analytics. Engineers insert code into their applications which sends data to New Relic’s servers. New Relic processes this data and provides interactive reports to identify underperforming code. New Relic charges by the server - the more computers monitored, the greater the subscription fee. Today, the company counts 250,000 users and 10,590 paying customers. An interesting sidenote: the name New Relic is an anagram of the founder’s name, Lew Cirne.In the next seven charts, we’ll explore how New Relic built their business. We will explore revenue growth, average revenue per customer, sales efficiency, payback periods, net income, gross margin and engineering spending. In these plots, I’ve used New Relic’s colors as a consistent legend. New Relic company data is teal, median values are black, and other company values are gray. All the data come from New Relic’s S-1.If I were to use only one chart to summarize why New Relic has built an amazing business it’s the following one which shows the annual revenue growth rates of New Relic customer accounts.Each year, the typical customer pays New Relic 14% more than last year. In industry parlance, this is called negative revenue churn. Negative churn an incredibly attractive attribute of a business because it means if the company were to cease spending money to acquire new customers, the business would still grow at a 14% CAGR.New Relic achieves negative revenue churn because customers instrument increasing numbers of servers over time, which costs more. The longer a customer uses New Relic, the more they become accustomed to developing with all the product’s insights, the more servers and applications they will migrate to New Relic’s analytics system.So despite relatively flat new account acquisition numbers which have remained at about 750 per quarter, New Relic’s revenue will continue to expand because of the negative churn characteristic.As the S-1 indicates, in addition to the smaller accounts that likely form the majority of the company’s customer base today, New Relic is pursuing larger customers. At the time of the S-1, the company recorded an Average Revenue per Customer of about $8k. This will surely increase as the company penetrates engineering teams more deeply and the investments in sales and marketing begin to reward the company with larger contracts. But this account size easily supports building an inside sales team to scale revenue quickly.Another aside: the majority of New Relic customers pay on a monthly basis, unlike most SaaS companies which move to pre-pay annual contracts. Many SaaS companies move to annual pre-pay to be able to finance their own growth more efficiently and to reduce churn. But churn doesn’t seem to be a concern for New Relic. Storing data for their customers provides the business some lock-in.The combination of negative churn, account growth and pursuit of larger accounts has enabled New Relic to grow rapidly. The company reported $63M in trailing twelve months’ of revenue in their 2014 fiscal year which is right at the median. Impressively, New Relic increased revenue 213% y/y.New Relic’s sales efficiency has historically been higher than the median at 1.4, but recently that figure fell to 0.98 as the company tripled its spending on sales and marketing from $10.7M to $28.4M. The S-1 indicates the company is expanding rapidly in EMEA and APAC, in addition to the US, all of which requires marketing spend and building sales teams.Here’s another impressive chart. New Relic’s gross margin has hovered at 83%, an amazing 25% better than the SaaS median. And this gross margin has been constant for at least the past 3 years. Gross margin is revenue minus cost of goods sold. In this case, New Relic’s main costs are storage and customer support/success. The incredible consistency of the gross margin might indicate the company actually manages pricing to this metric.New Relic burns more capital as a percentage of revenue than the median publicly traded SaaS company. Over the last three years, the business has operated at -68% net income-to-revenue ratio, twice as high as the 35% median for comparable companies.This substantially higher relative burn rate is driven by massive investment in sales and marketing. In years 4 and 5 of the company’s life, New Relic has invested twice as much on a percentage basis in sales and marketing (92% of revenue) than the median company (48% of revenue).Meanwhile, New Relic is on par with its peer-set for engineering investment, at about 26% of revenue. This implies New Relic has been hiring sales people at an incredible clip. The business added 224 people in the past 12 months, and presumably the majority of those have joined the go-to-market teams.New Relic has built an amazing company, one with some stunning negative revenue churn characteristics which should set the high-water mark for public SaaS companies."

New Relic develops big-data software analytics that enable companies to have real-time analytics capabilities for their machine-generated data. New Relic currently offers seven products for a variety of applications, from mobile performance and server monitoring to testing through simulated usage. All of New Relic's products use the same infrastructure that allows customers to collect their data efficiently, store it in a secured database, and analyze in real-time using user-configured charts of key performance indicators.Similar to other big-data software vendors, New Relic has many strategic partnerships that should allow the company to make its software more appealing to the end-customer. New Relic partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure, Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Rackspace (NYSE:RAX) in the infrastructure side of the cloud business and with Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) on the development-platform side of the business.As shown in chart 1 below, since the beginning of the year, New Relic has generated $55M in revenues and spent $97M on operational expenses and cost of revenues, which yielded a $29M net loss year-to-date for the company.New Relic, which was founded only in 2008, is still in rapid growth mode, and over the last ten quarters the company increased its revenues a quarterly rate of 17%. Over the same period, the company increased its operational expenses at a quarterly rate of 15% and its cost of revenues 19% quarterly, driving New Relic to a negative bottom line. New Relic presents higher quarterly growth rates than other big data analytics companies such as Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) and Varonis (NASDAQ:VRNS), which had an 11% quarterly revenue growth in the last ten quarters. The driver for the growth rates between the companies is the lack of sharp revenue fluctuations in New Relic compared to the sharp quarter-over-quarter changes in Splunk and Varonis, as shown in the below chart.IPO Price EstimationAs the IPO stock price has not been disclosed yet, investors can get a sense of New Relic's share price from previous deals, funding series and valuation of employee options:The stock options granted in July 2014 are for a term of 6 years with an expected volatility of 51% and a risk-free rate of 2%. Adjusting that stock option to a one-year term with 9% volatility and a risk-free rate of 0.25% will change the stock price's fair value to $20. Assuming that the venture capital funds invested in New Relic will not accept any loss on their investment, it is reasonable to assume that the IPO price will not be below $17.5. Adding an additional 15% return on top of that figure will get the share price to $20 and will probably be the low bar of the price range +/- 5%. The high bar of the range will be $23 +/- 5% (if we add the same 15% to the $20 stock fair value as described above). The price range, therefore, is similar to Varonis's IPO price and slightly lower than Splunk's, which went public with an IPO price of $26.7.Big data analytics is considered a hot and trendy sector that attracts investors due to the growth opportunity it offers. As our lives are becoming increasingly digitalized, companies collect and store all available data and wish to use such data to gain more knowledge about themselves, their clients, and their market, in order to optimize their offerings. With the amount of data so large, IT departments in most companies use different tools to analyze the data gathered and use it effectively. According to IDC, the amount of data is expected to grow from 130 exabytes (1 exabyte= 1 million terabytes) in 2005 to 40,000 exabytes in 2020, incorporating an incredible growth opportunity for companies offering big data analytics software such as New Relic, Splunk, and Varonis. The price range of $20 to $23 reflects a P/S ratio between 11 to 9.5 to New Relic, which is substantially lower than Splunk's P/S of 21 and a bit higher than Varonis' P/S of 5.9. For such a young company, this is an attractive P/S ratio, and if New Relic continues to present its impressive growth rate as expected, then investors could benefit from a nice upside on their investment.ConclusionsNew Relic, a big data analytics company, filed for an IPO this week. The company has smaller fluctuations in revenues quarter-over-quarter than other players in the market, which enables New Relic to have a much higher quarterly revenue growth rate than the other players. As share price was not yet disclosed, my estimate is that it will range between $20 to $23 +/- 5%, which reflects a significant return to venture capital funds that invested in the company and gave employees stock options. The reasonable P/S ratio based on the IPO price estimate makes it an attractive investment."

Given the uncertainties around that process, my bias on the stock is NEUTRAL.Chicago, Illinois-based Precima was founded to create a suite of data analytics and reporting tools for retailers of all sizes.Management is headed by president Brian Ross, who has been with the firm since 2007 and was previously Director of Strategic Innovation at LoyaltyOne.Below is an overview video of the firm's technology approach:Source: PrecimaPrecima’s primary offerings include:Company partners or major customers include:According to a 2019 market research report by ResearchAndMarkets, the market for retail analytics is expected to reach an estimated $9.5 billion by 2025.This represents a forecast CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of more than 18% from 2019 to 2025.The main drivers for this expected growth rising adoption of technologies such as the Internet of Things, WiFi, RFID tags and cloud-based analytics for decision-making purposes.Major vendors that provide competitive services include:Source: SentieoNielsen didn’t disclose the acquisition price or terms and didn’t file a form 8-K, so the deal was likely for a financially non-material amount.Management did not provide a change in financial guidance as a result of the transaction.A review of the firm’s most recent published financial results indicate that as of September 30, 2019 Nielsen had $389 million in cash and equivalents and $12.0 billion in total liabilities, of which long-term debt was $8.2 billion.Free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was $538 million.In the past 12 months, Nielsen’s stock price has fallen 16.7% vs. the U.S. Professional Services industry’s rise of 33.6% and the U.S. S&P 500 Index’ growth of 23.6%, as the NLSN chart indicates below:Source: Seeking AlphaEarnings surprises versus analyst consensus estimates have been positive in eight of the last twelve quarters, as the chart shows below:Source: Seeking AlphaBelow is a table of relevant capitalization and valuation figures for the company:Source: Company FinancialsNLSN acquired Precima to add its capabilities to its Global Connect platform.As Pat Dodd, Chief Commercial Officer for Nielsen Global Connect stated in the deal announcement,So, the deal for Precima provides Nielsen with the retail analytics end for its plan to better connect manufacturing to retail.Also, Precima’s focus on the loyalty and personalization space within retail will help ‘brands plan and measure the impact and success of personalized consumer offerings.’I consider Nielsen’s current M&A approach as somewhat cautious, with management focusing their attention on fixing some previous acquisitions in terms of improving their integration with Global Connect.With the pending spin-off of Global Connect into a separate, publicly-held business, the firm is obviously continuing to acquire capabilities despite the likely significant distraction of the spin-off process.I’m looking forward to learning the details of the Global Connect spin-off transaction.Given the uncertainties of that process, and how much value might be unlocked for NLSN shareholders in the spin-off, my current bias on NLSN is NEUTRAL.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Click here to find out more »I believe that Nielsen (NLSN) has at least 50% upside from current market prices and is being unfairly punished before and during the recent market decline. Investors are getting the opportunity to buy well below recent and significant insider buys. The market is focused on the short term and past missed expectations. The long-run growth trajectory appears reasonably favorable and conservative expectations are baked in. At this valuation, you are not paying for any growth and you are getting a company that has several potential catalysts in the near future. I believe the Media business is worth the market cap of the stock + almost 50% by itself - getting the Connect business which returned to growth in 2019 for free. Nielsen has a 10% conservative FCF yield with revenue and EBITDA which is safer than most companies. This is shown by an average of 70% revenue being committed prior to the beginning of each year and their top 10 customers having an average relationship greater than 30 years.Nielsen is a global leader in measurement and data analytics. It provides clients with a comprehensive understanding of what consumers' watch, listen, read, and buy. The stock has fallen from $60 four years ago, to today under $14. Advertisers have chosen Nielsen as the company they trust when it comes to how they spend their money - it should be and has been difficult to change that. They have reliable, quality, and large customers. Five of the top ten include NBC Universal/Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), The Coca-Cola Company (KO), Nestle S.A. (OTCPK:NSRGY), The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and CBS (VIAC). Nielsen's TV ratings in the US is a high quality business and has been used by the companies above for over 50 years which leads to this being deeply engrained into their various processes. During this time, think of how far the TV ecosystem has come, I remember my grandparents talking about only having three channels, compared to today with our dozens of choices. Nielsen has remained a constant in the businesses.Nielsen has two main business lines. Connect tracks what people buy via retail purchases or online purchases and it has 60% recurring revenue and mid-teens EBITDA margins. From the company website describing Connect, ""We've explored what's important to shoppers for more than 90 years, and businesses continue to rely on our data and insights. With groundbreaking technology, we provide a truly complete picture of the complex and changing marketplace that manufacturers and retailers need to innovate and grow their businesses.""Connect's growth area is primarily in emerging markets which has been hit by poor currency fluctuations and lower margins. EM currency has struggled compared to the strong dollar which has hurt EM sales. Additionally, Nielsen and the importance of consumer behavior is just no as established outside of developed economies. As EM grows, Nielsen should grow as well. In the US Connect had also decelerated due to lower CPG spend for a variety of reasons, for example the shift away from brick and mortar retail.Nielsen believes EM growth can overcome the US softness and deceleration, and Nielsen has the broadest scale when it comes to tracking what consumers buy. Nielsen has no competitor with comparable global scale in emerging economies. It has competitors which offer ancillary services similar to Nielsen, but not an all-in-one product which can benefit from economies of scale. The higher GDP growth rates, and rising middle classes could be a powerful tailwind for Connect. However, the Connect business is less attractive than media due to its more uncertain revenue stream. Connect is likely going to be more disrupted by Covid-19 than the media business, because of a less secure revenue base and a more manual data collection process in certain geographies.Nielsen's best business (Media) has higher margins and a monopoly in TV advertising with growing importance in digital and audio which has continued to progress, albeit not with its previous unopposed strength. The media segment has 80% recurring revenue and higher EBITDA margins at 43%. Viewership/listening data and analytics is a secular growth area unlike CPG spend. Companies have used the incumbent Nielsen for 50+ years and it is part of the language and is deeply entrenched in company operations.They also have relationships with 23/25 top companies in digital area which will be growing in the future. Nielsen has a great chance of becoming the digital currency in addition to the much larger (currently) TV market simply because large advertisers do not like to change what they know. Advertisers will likely want to use Nielsen in this market as well, and big tech will likely provide advertisers with the metrics they are used to seeing in order to not lose market share. For example, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is not going to lose ad dollars to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), because they didn't provide Nielsen ratings. Another key point here is Nielsen is now focused on offering cross-platform data where it should have a nice lead due to its monopoly in TV advertising.See below for reasons of stock declines over the past several years:Created by Author via BloombergNielsen has a new leadership team who has recently portrayed confidence with multiple insider buys. The CEO, David Kenny, on 2/28/20 bought his first shares on the open market with a $1M purchase in the low $18 range. David Kenny Insider Buy The Chairman of the board, James Attwood, a Carlyle veteran and 13 year board member, bought over $4M in the low $16 range on 3/6/20. James Attwood Insider Buy This could be a positive sign for shareholders. The backgrounds of Attwood and Kenny, as well as this being their first open market purchase, I believe is more than just a showy buy. They put real money to work and it should be taken seriously. Additionally, the new Connect CEO joined from Nielsen's board - signaling board/management have confidence in a comeback.I like to analyze insider buys rather than just view them as a signal as a quantitative manager would. I know an asset manager really well where insider buys is a major portion of his idea generation and analysis. His biggest positive indicators are as follows:1. Is it a significant increase in both absolute and relative terms?The answer here is yes with regard to significance, and yes especially to Attwood in terms of increase in percentage ownership.2. Can you judge past buys as an indicator of future performance?We cannot do that here.3. Is this a showy buy, did the person just join the company?No, David Kenny has been there since 2018, while James Attwood has been at the company for over 10 years.4. Did multiple people buy? The groups buying is a positive indicatorThis is a bit mixed - although these are the two people that have overseen the recent strategic review at Nielsen. They may be subject to the most bias, but they are clearly knowledgeable about the future of Nielsen.Source: Company Proxy ReportAn additional catalyst is the business separation: Media and Connect will separate into 2 distinct companies during the second half of the year. This could lead to Media being valued properly as a high quality data and analytics company which I believe to be worth 50% more than the current value of the stock. Additionally, if Connect can return to more consistent growth and raise its profitability it will undoubtedly be worth something. At 6x EV/EBITDA, according to my calculations, it is worth around $1.5B.The separation will allow each business segment to be more focused on and accountable for its specific vertical and will hopefully unlock proper multiples under less leverage. Nielsen's investments could lead to growth in the latter half of 2020, this is certainly a show-me stock under new management and ultimately this will be the main factor of long-term success. Lastly, Nielsen could become the currency in the growing digital advertising market and it is likely the favorite due to its moat within established large advertisers. Covid-19 could push this out a few quarters, but management has been very clear and honest in explaining how they have performed, so investors will have clarity in management's progress or lack there of.It has a lot of leverage (4.2B Debt/Adjusted EBITDA) which has to be reduced and will continue to reduce capital return to shareholders. The coronavirus is likely to cause a recession and delay Nielsen's turnaround. This has likely been the root cause behind Nielsen's latest decline, which I believe to be overdone.The previous management team mislead investors and the new CFO who came in with David Kenny also left only a year into his tenure in Q4 2019. The company is likely under major uncertainty as the split begins and investors behave as such. Their business is rapidly changing and they may be left behind as cord cutting continues, subscription services provide less advertising for premium prices, and retail declines. The rise of big-tech companies and the importance of data and analytics could lead to very capable competitors with more resources than Nielsen which they allude to in their 10k under risk factors. Regulation including GDPR which hurt Nielsen in 2018 will likely continue to become more of an issue worldwide. GDPR of course puts limitations on the usage, tracking, and monetization of user data. Nielsen depends on shared data sources for its business. You have seen FB and Google talk in great detail about this in their earnings calls.Devil's AdvocateCreated by Author via ExcelThe market certainly does not believe management is capable of producing positive results in these areas as they are pricing in a miserable failure. If the split were to fail, I would consider cutting my losses. I do believe Nielsen will be able to continually transition as they have for the last almost 100 years. I do believe their cash flow is reliable as they have very long-term and stable customer relationships as mentioned above. Finally, I believe Nielsen will return to consistent growth in both sides of its business which will lead to a rerating. If Nielsen's management team can perform close to their conservative expectations, the stock will rerate meaningfully.Porter's Five ForcesCreated by Author via ExcelThis is Nielsen's most attractive characteristic as it is trading at by far its lowest metrics ever recorded. It is at historic lows in relative valuation on an earnings and EBITDA basis as well as relative to other peers in its industry. Nielsen trades on an EV to NTM adjusted EBITDA basis of 7x, while since 2011 it typically traded at 10-14x (usually in the upper end of that range). I believe the media business alone - which as a standalone company assuming Connect was priced at 0, would trade 30-70% above the current stock price. The P/E is below 10x, where it usually trades around 17x (from 14-20x).Created by Author via BloombergAs you can see, Nielsen is trading at wide discounts to peers and itself. Below is what I view to be the risk/reward profile in the near term of Nielsen. The risk/reward is extremely attractive, and although Nielsen is highly leveraged, it does have decreased exposure to Covid than most stocks and a reliable revenue floor.I have reduced the revenue growth from 3% to -1% in 2020 with a modest $60M decline in EBITDA, and conservatively estimated the following below, showing large upside. I estimate the separation of the two companies will unlock some value as you can see with the separated versus together multiples below. It will be very informative, once Q1 earnings season begins to get guidance from management on future outlook, guidance, and advertising spend.Created by Author via ExcelGiven the greater than 5 to 1 base case versus bear case ratio - I view Nielsen to be exceptionally attractive at these levels, and have added to my position on the way down. I recommend investors look to pile in at current levels."
4311249,105510,2019-12-08T12:24:28-05:00,Nielsen will be spinning off its Connect business.The spin should unlock significant value for its lucrative media business.Investors get over 50% upside from here.,"I believe the Nielsen (NLSN) thesis is now worth investors’ attention. The stock has been chronically undervalued for a while now, as secular industry headwinds challenge its market-leading position in the audience and retail measurement space (media and CPG). However, management’s recent decision to spin-off the Connect (ex-media) business could spark a revival in the stock price, with significant value to be unlocked at RemainCo (media). This opportunity exists because the market is far too focused on the Q3 dividend cut, and has seemingly ignored the significant underlying value set to be unlocked in the media business - a sticky mass of recurring revenue with 40+% adj. EBITDA margins. I believe Nielsen's standalone media business alone is worth $30, offering investors ~54% upside from the price at the time of writing.In conjunction with Nielsen’s Q3, the company announced the conclusion of its long-running strategic review, deciding to spin out the Connect (ex-media) division. The transaction will see 100% of the shares of the SpinCo distributed to Nielsen shareholders, which will qualify as a tax-free event to Nielsen and its shareholders. SpinCo will raise new debt as part of the process – according to the transcript, the target leverage post-spin will be 2-2.5x, implying an additional ~$1 billion in debt at the upper end. The proceeds from the additional debt raise at SpinCo will be used to de-lever RemainCo.“Now over time, we see different target leverage ratios for each business with a medium-term leverage goal of roughly 3 to 3.5 for Media and approximately 2 to 2.5 for Connect. Again, those are our best views at this time.”Here’s a side by side comparison of Nielsen’s RemainCo and SpinCo business profiles post-spin:Source: Nielsen Earnings/Strategic Review DeckThe stock has not fared well post-Q3, however, largely due to the Board’s decision to cut the dividend (worth over $400mm/year) to shore up the balance sheets ahead of the spin-off and add flexibility to invest in growth. The quarterly dividend reduction is material, moving from $0.35/share to $0.06/share effective December, implying an ~6%pts reduction in the annual dividend yield to 1.2% (from ~7%).While the dividend cut is admittedly a bitter pill to swallow, the added balance sheet flexibility is a net positive, in my view. The reduced commitment allows management to make targeted near-term reinvestments in the Media and Connect business to firm up both businesses’ longer-term competitive positioning as well as unlock additional cost savings.Source: Nielsen Earnings/Strategic Review DeckThe media segment will see additional investments in an effort to preserve its role at the center of the media ecosystem. At the core of its investment strategy will be its “Total Audience” measurement capabilities, which should allow for more comprehensive and consistent digital measurement across platforms and content consumption methods. Its investment plan will also cover “predict and measure” offerings, which leverages Total Audience data and artificial intelligence to create cross-media plans for the ecosystem.Source: Nielsen Earnings/Strategic Review DeckMedia investments will also focus on geographic expansion, largely driven by its digital offerings, which is guided to drive mid-single-digit growth in the Media business through 2023.Source: Nielsen Earnings/Strategic Review DeckThe Connect investment strategy primarily focuses on the deployment of the Nielsen Connect Platform, as well as broadening the coverage to additional areas such as e-commerce and specialty channels. Other initiatives in the works include a Connect real-time analytics offering focused on pricing, promotion, and personalization targeted at driving efficiencies for retailers. Additionally, further investments in automation and technology (in place of legacy systems) could also drive additional cost savings in the medium-term. Connect EBITDA margins are guided to hit high-teens (vs. low-teens currently).Nielsen’s last closing price of $19.47 suggests investors are valuing the media segment at an implied 8x FY19E EBITDA, assuming the Connect business can command a discounted 6x EBITDA multiple.Source: Company Guidance, Market Data as at 5th DecNote that this is significantly below comparable information/data peers, which can command multiples in the ~20x range.Source: Yahoo Finance, SeekingAlpha, Market Data as at 5th DecI believe a business separation could unlock significant value - on a stand-alone basis, RemainCo could be worth up to $30, assuming a 10x EBITDA multiple (conservatively around five turns below peers), and a 3.5x leverage ratio.Source: Author Est, Market Data as of Dec 5th That said, execution risks remain, as the company still has to efficiently separate the business (from a tax/legal standpoint), and define effective governance principles for both entities. Additional one-time expenses/dis-synergies associated with the separation have also yet to be guided, though I have accounted for this by using a heavily discounted EBITDA multiple for RemainCo and ignoring the potential equity value of SpinCo.Nielsen remains the market leader in its industry and offers investors exposure to a steady, recurring stream of revenues, which remains resilient through market cycles. The stock has undergone a period of transition in recent years, primarily in its Connect business, due to weakness in its consumer packaged goods (CPG) client base. However, much of this seems to have been priced into the stock, which trades significantly below its peers; the recent dividend cut has exacerbated the valuation discount, offering investors an opportunity to buy into Nielsen’s unique data assets at a deep discount. The upcoming spin should help unlock significant value; I believe RemainCo could be worth up to $30 post-spin."
4289249,104952,2019-09-02T20:54:01-04:00,"Nielsen's TTM revenue growth is -3.15% while margin is compressing in last 3 years across the board.Having underperformed in most of FY 2018, initiatives to improve cost and revenue have been in place.With over 40,000 employees operating across 100 countries and high dependency on legacy system, it's been hard to move the needle.Going in 2019, Nielsen and most of the competitors in the space are still facing bleak growth outlook, with most forward growth metrics in the low zeroes or negatives.","Nielsen (NYSE:NLSN) has faced a couple of key issues in recent times. It started with its underperforming Buy business segment last year, which we learned in its 2018 Q2 earnings report. At the end of FY 2018, its CEO Mitch Barnes also announced his retirement. Its Watch business, in the meantime, has also been facing challenges, mainly in how it needs to adapt to the changing landscape of how and where measurement is done.We are neutral on Nielsen despite its attractive 6.75% dividend yield and an 8.68% 3-year dividend CAGR. Given Nielsen’s size and the scale of its operations, it would be quite challenging for the company to move the needle in terms of growth and profitability in the short term. On the revenue side, it would involve bringing up revenue growth into the low-to-mid single-digit zone. On the cost side, this would involve modernizing the company’s internal data platform and migration of its core data into the public cloud. Though some of the improvements we discussed have partly been ongoing, the outlook for growth so far in the first half of FY 2019 has been lackluster. Under its new CEO David Kenny, who spent time as a head of IBM Watson AI division, there has been a push towards adopting more technology platform internally to consolidate and to move all the data into the public cloud infrastructure. That being said, this major cost-reduction move will take time to realize, given moving massive amount of data out of Nielsen’s decades-old legacy systems would not be an easy task, as he suggested in the Q2 earnings call:The company has also been in the midst of the wider strategic review since last year due to the potential takeover bids to divest part of its businesses. As stated in its 10-Q:Two weeks before its Q2 2019 earnings call, Nielsen traded 4.3% higher given a rumor of KKR making a takeover bid for the company at $30 per share, making it a 26% premium to then price per share. This rumor was later on reported to be false.(Source: stockrow. Nielsen’s financials and top-line growth)As a company with considerable tech components, Nielsen’s growth has been lackluster. Nielsen ended FY 2018 with $6.52 billion of revenue, a decline from its FY 2017 revenue of $6.57 billion. Net profit margin has also declined over the last 4 years. Excluding its negative net profit margin of -10.9% in FY 2018 where the company recorded a negative net income due to non-recurring non-cash expense, net profit margin trended downside from 9.2% in FY 2015 to 6.5% in FY 2017.In the first half of FY 2019, we notice a similar trend, where Q1 and Q2 revenue have both declined by 2.9% and 1.2% consecutively. According to the company, the lack of innovation and custom analytics have contributed to the major decrease in its Connect segment. On the Media segment, the major culprit has been the challenges in local TV measurement.(Source: Nielsen’s 10-K)Looking at the cost side over the last 3 years, we have also noticed that the company indeed could benefit from an investment into cloud-based data infrastructure to minimize its overall operating cost. On average, the cost of revenue had grown by 7.5% while revenue only grew 3%. SG&A expenses also increased by 5% within the same time frame. Taking all these into account, the move into a more product-driven company, as the CEO mentioned in last Q2 earnings call, could also help the company in achieving better unit economics as it scales.Nielsen will also have to pay attention to its debt level. Given the typical way Nielsen closes deals with its clients, it has been getting the benefit of having a consistent and predictable earnings pattern over the years. This led to greater ability to raise cash through debt issuances and to service such debts. As stated in its 10-Q:However, under the current circumstances where Nielsen needs to consider an alternative contingency plan through acquisition, this debt level could be a turnoff for potential buyers looking to pull off an LBO move.(Source: stockrow. Nielsen’s financial ratio.)Today, Nielsen’s debt has been at the highest level in the last decade. Currently, there is a $9 billion debt sitting in the balance sheet, which is higher than its overall market cap of $7.4 billion. With a Debt/Equity ratio of 3.25, this number was also higher than the post-crisis period in 2009 where it was somewhere at 3.09. Compared to the same time last year, its Debt/Equity ratio has gone up by more than 50% YoY. At the same time, when we look at its ROE, it seems difficult to justify taking that much debt. We saw TTM ROE dropping from around 10% to 14% to potentially lower than 8%, excluding the negative TTM ROE today due to the one-time expenses resulting in negative net income.When we tried to assess Nielsen’s valuation relative to its peers such as comScore (NASDAQ:SCOR) or WPP (NYSE:WPP), which owns Kantar, we found that Nielsen is slightly trading at a premium, even though the growth outlook for these companies tend to be as bleak in general. The forward revenue growth for all of these companies is mostly in the negatives or low zeroes. Among them, Nielsen has the highest future revenue growth outlook of 0.19% YoY. Nielsen is trading at a forward P/E of 23.10, which is almost twice higher than where WPP is at.From our perspective, it would not be quite difficult to see where Nielsen ends up if a takeover were to happen. In our opinion, a company with zero growth should be valued close to its revenue. In Nielsen’s and WPP’s case, we found this to be quite relevant given both are trading at between 1 and 1.17 times its sales. This would mean that all of Nielsen's holdings could potentially be valued at between $7 billion and $8.8 billion based on its current market cap and if a hypothetical 26% premium were applied.Nielsen has been under pressure to unlock greater shareholder value in recent times. It has been underperforming. With almost no future growth opportunity and its size, it has been difficult for Nielsen to move the needle. Several initiatives have been in place to reduce cost and adapt to the changing landscape of the measurement industry, but it would all take some time to realize. At the moment, we believe that a potential takeover could be the only upside for investors looking to dip their feet into the stock. Given the progress of its recent takeover negotiation process, however, we would decide to be neutral on the stock at least until the end of the year. From the existing key shareholders’ perspective, though, a takeover should definitely not be a silver bullet."
4193030,104183,2018-08-01T12:17:47-04:00,"The CEO stepping down and a strategic review of the Buy segment have sent Nielsen's stock down 25%.The dividend's coverage, while above 1x, doesn't have a large enough margin for investors to feel comfortable.Nielsen's leverage just became an amplified concern considering the waning free cash flow profile.","Nielsen (NLSN) recently took a 25% hit following Q2 earnings and the market has now made this name one of the highest yielding stocks in the S&P 500 with a current yield of 6.07%. The drop-off in profitability is alarming, with net income down 45% YOY and considerable margin compression. Investors should not jump in and buy this 6% yield because it's not backed by solid financials, but rather is risky with a highly leveraged balance sheet and a lack of liquidity. While the dividend can remain online in the near term, a significant restructuring is needed - beginning with the Buy segment - before investors should even consider adding this name to their portfolio.Source: Wikimedia CommonsNielsen just reported Q2 results and hit the market with quite the surprise. Broadly, there just wasn't growth and there was margin contraction at all levels. Breaking it down, adjusted EBITDA was down 8.2% YOY and the corresponding margin was down 232bps YOY. That, in turn, led to a decline in FCF of 23.5%. Another concern is the FX impact at the EBITDA level for the company, which is presumably part of the total guide down 230bps for the year. Revenue was aided by FX this quarter to the tune of 90bps and EBITDA also benefitted mildly by 10bps. However, in the projections going forward, we're looking at -200bps in EBITDA margin in the second half. The full-year total will be 30bps, meaning 200bps of that is organic margin compression - not the positive development that shareholders want to see. These are a weak set of results and are, unfortunately, showcasing a structural problem with the business as a whole, rather than a temporary negative development.Source: Investor PresentationOne positive I'm taking away from this report is that management is realistic with the results and not trying to blame it on external factors. CFO Jamere Jackson said, ""Our progress was not reflected in our financial results, which are disappointing and came in below our expectations."" A more inflated management team might have said that the quarter was out of their control rather than admit that there's a catch-up period to be had. Fortunately, there are offsets. For example, the company is ahead of schedule with its cost take-out plan - despite it not yet being visible at the adj. EBITDA level - as they've raised the target by $150 million to $650 million.One of the major pain points of the earnings report was that the CEO Dwight Barns would be retiring. This comes at a difficult time as the company also said it'd be conducting a strategic review of its Buy segment, which is focused on recording consumer habits. There's no specifics currently surrounding this, but it casts an air of weakness for the segment that accounts for 49% of sales and 23% of EBIT. The Watch segment is the more profitable segment, accounting for 76% of EBIT. Watch has solid tailwinds around it, including strength in National TV and digital, with Gracenote putting up double-digit growth rates; however, some of this strength is going to be offset by the impact of GDPR. In the Buy segment, it's no wonder they're looking to offload the division as EM growth is flat and has experienced a difficult 2017 so far. Surprisingly, the developed markets portion of the Buy segment is actually performing worse as multinational clients' spend has declined. As for Barns stepping down, I view it as an initial negative, but a weakness to be bought as no company is just one individual and he can be replaced.Nielsen has historically been a very strong dividend stock in terms of consistency. We've seen a five-year growth rate of 33% and a one-year growth rate of 7.87%. A 6% yield by itself is nearly 3x that of the broader market and quite compelling when the search for yield still rages on among investors. This is all the more true when valuations for the broader equity market remain high and quality dividends are few and far between. However, given the significant drop off in profitability, it's more than appropriate to discuss dividend sustainability, let alone the ability of the company to grow it in the manner it has been.In the last twelve months, the company spent $488 million dividends relative to $1 billion in free cash flow. On those metrics, there is good dividend coverage, even if the FCF profile is deteriorating. It's also possible that the company reverses this past quarter's trend and keeps FCF stable in Q3 or improves. I think that'd give investors a lot more comfort knowing that their dividend had no chance of being cut at the expense of future growth. The problem here is the drastically lowered guidance. For the full-year 2018, FCF guidance was reduced to $550-575 million, which gives them actually very sparse dividend coverage of just 1.12-1.19x. I could run this at an EBIT level, but the company prefers to use multiple adjustments and this is the purest form of evaluating dividend security, in my opinion.To top it all off, Nielsen is highly leveraged. The company is targeting a YE2018 net debt ratio of 4.3x, which means gross is somewhere in the camp of 4.5-4.6x depending on the net change in cash from the current $394 million. There's no real default risk here in the near term at least considering there are no significant maturities until 2020 when the company has $800 million in senior notes due. The problems, rather, begin to build in the 2022/2023 time frame. In 2023, the company has a $4 billion term loan due. In current standing, the company just doesn't have the liquidity to even begin tackling that and makes sense why they need to conduct a strategic review of the Buy segment - they're going to need proceeds to fund a pay down of that term loan.Source: Investor PresentationDiscussing the dividend also brings up the stock's valuation. It's trading at 11.9x forward earnings and 8.7x EV/EBITDA, which is a discount to the broader equity market, to direct peers it's a massive discount to the tune of 56% on a P/E basis and 51% on an EV/EBITDA basis. This valuation is relative to peers Equifax (EFX), CoreLogic (CLGX), FactSet (FDS), and Gartner (IT) and while investors may have slightly different comp sets, these are all similar-sized information services companies. Another thing to note here is that Nielsen has the highest dividend among peers. Gartner and CoreLogic don't even pay a dividend. Equifax's yield is negligible below the broader equity market at just 1.24%.With such a substantial yield differential, there is quite the bid for current income investors to seriously consider this name despite the large drop-off in the equity. It's tough not to like the relative value here, especially as Nielsen trades near the point where it IPO'd seven years ago. However, the lack of safety around the dividend, considering they're now going to pay out a majority of FCF in dividends, makes me inclined to not buy the current dip.Source: StockChartsA substantial de-rating like the one we've just witnessed has to be met with significant caution as it's easy for investors to want to jump in at all-time lows for a mature business. However, I want to express to investors that the narrowing free cash flow profile is highly concerning and coverage is inadequate, in my opinion. The disposal of the Buy segment creates further complications, especially if the financial situation at large for Nielsen deteriorates further. Other than a high-yield relative to comps and a massively discounted valuation, I can't find any real reason to want to jump in and buy here. This could be ""dead money"" until a positive organic development occurs. I highly advise investors to avoid this name and look elsewhere for yield."
4157805,103213,2018-03-20T10:46:44-04:00,"Nielsen has been severely treated by the market.Yet growing segments more than offset declining sources of income.Uncertainty around the market research industry's future scares investors.However, at this price, with a 4% yield, Nielsen is worth a small position in your dividend growth portfolio.","Nielsen (NLSN), the leading market research company, has been experiencing a tough time lately. Top line growth has been held back by a struggling and weakening segment which has scared investors. Market research companies are facing major industry shifts: retail sales are moving online; quantitative data is now widely available; linear video is being replaced by over the top (OTT) video services, and the list goes on.Some of these trends provide opportunities for Nielsen which it has capitalized on, including audience measurement of video and text.As such while its legacy business is declining and undergoing massive transitions, new market opportunities drive growth for the company.While the difficulties the company faces are undeniable, I believe the company has been hit too hard and is now slightly undervalued at $33. I will be looking to purchase at these levels and below and would advise dividend growth investors to do so.4th quarter earnings declined by 47% compared to the 4th quarter of 2016, on revenues which were 6% stronger. Since then, the company's stock price has declined by 22% to 33$ just above its 52-week low. The company increased their dividend by % giving the company a 4.06% dividend yield, thus making it close to introducing it into my screener.The S.A.F.E dividend stock screener is designed to find stocks which have attractive yields, a history of dividend increases, room to grow the dividend, and whose financial condition ensure dividend stability.It screens on 5 criteria:The two first elements are the most important ratios in the screener. They ensure that I'm getting a yield that I am content with, without horrifying payout ratios. The dividend streak shows some commitment from management to return cash to investors. Positive PE means the company generated positive net income in the last year, so I know we are not looking at companies that are losing money. The current ratio is a sanity check to only include companies which can cover their short-term liabilities.This method only gives you a handful of results at any point in time. I like this because I can focus my efforts on a handful of stocks. The obvious shortfall is that some very good dividend growers will be excluded. You can still apply the rest of the framework to any dividend paying stock, this screener gives you a starting point.Nielsen fits the bill in every single respect bar the payout ratio, as the table below suggests.Source: uuptickThe S.A.F.E Dividend Method is a framework developed by my son Sam and myself to uncover undervalued dividend growth stocks.Within our framework, I analyze in detail any stock which makes it into our screener. I monitor the screener weekly for new entrants as well as exits.Nielsen's revenues have grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.2% vs 3% for the S&P 500; Nielsen's earnings grew even faster at a 9% CAGR vs 5.6% for the S&P 500.Source: uuptickNielsen's revenues are split between two segments: Buy and Watch.""Buy"" as the name indicates, refers to market research solutions focused on what consumers buy, particularly consumer packaged goods. ""Watch"", is focused on providing media clients and advertising clients with insights concerning consumers' television, online, radio and mobile activity.The former has been the victim of the retail glut in the U.S., leading the segment downwards during the past few years. This trend is likely to continue in upcoming years. So long as retail companies experience a tough domestic market, their spending will be restricted, and Nielsen will be the indirect victim of this trend, which will likely continue in upcoming years despite growth in over geographies.The latter is booming. Despite predictions that cable cutters would hinder the segment, Nielsen has led the way in the industry providing analytics for social media (Youtube, Facebook) and OTT video (Hulu). The segment is expected to continue growing as brands invest more in performance metrics to compare returns of ads on new media vs old media.Source: uuptickThankfully the growing segment is much more profitable since a larger part of the work provided can be automated which results in higher margins.The decline of ""Buy"" is expected to continue to dampen top line growth for upcoming years. Management forecasts 3% growth this year. Nonetheless we should see margin expansion and return to 8-9% of net income.The next thing I do is look at the company's payout ratio relative to its historical value. I also look at the evolution of the two underlying line items: net income and dividends.Source: uuptickSince initiating a dividend in 2013, the company's payout ratio has quickly increased from 35% to 112%. This is a negative point in my analysis. If you adjust for the one-time tax expense incurred last year, the dividend would be just under 100% of earnings. I prefer to see companies increase their dividends at a slower but more responsible pace. Cash from operations is largely sufficient to pay for the dividend, but nonetheless, Nielsen is now in a situation where any future growth is constrained by the company's earnings growth. The company is expected to remain within this range for 2017.I then look at the company's dividend yield compared to its historical value.Source: uuptickNielsen has yielded between 2% and 2.5% for the better part of their short dividend history. The dividend at 4.06% is the highest it has ever been. This is a positive because I like to buy bargain stocks.The dividend yield increased abruptly when the price tanked in late November 2016 when guidance for 2017 was below expectations. Source: uuptickAs you can see, after the IPO in 2011, Nielsen outperformed the S&P 500 for the better part of the five subsequent years. For the last 1 ½ years, the stock's trajectory has been the opposite of the index.Next I need to assess the safety of the dividend, since the stock has a high payout ratio, I want to make sure that the risk around the dividend can be contained.I will look at the degree of operating leverage (DOL) for our security, and how it evolved over the last business cycle. This allows me to estimate the decline in revenues required to wipe out operating income.Source: uuptickIn the real world, you sometimes get a negative relationship between revenues and operating income, in which case the data isn't workable. You also get a high standard deviation with so few observationsHowever, it is interesting to look at the range of values: here between 40% and 60%. In other words, so long as revenues don't drop by 40%-which is unlikely-, the company will continue to produce positive operating income.I also want to know that the company has shown dedication to increase its dividend over time. Nielsen has been increasing its dividend every year for the last 5 years by different amounts. This is the minimum I need to see some commitment to paying the dividend, but the opportunity cost of cutting the dividend isn't high enough for management to make it a priority in the case of a downturn.Source: uuptickAs you can see the dividends has increased rapidly, more than doubling in 5 years. Going forward the dividend growth will somewhat be constrained by earnings growth, so I project low to mid single digit growth in upcoming years.Next up is figuring out what I want to pay for a stock which pays 1.36$ in dividends per year, which I will assume grows at 4% per year.I run a simple DDM Model three times adjusting the dividend growth rate by +/- 1%. I then divide these values by the price to see what portion of the stock price can be attributed to the dividend stream, and what premium I must pay for exposure to potential stock appreciation.I assume a constant 10% discount rate for every equity I analyze which allows me to compare the stocks within my screener's theoretical value to their stock price.For Nielsen this gives us a value between $20 and $28, or between 60% and 84% of the current share price. This is a little lower than I usually enjoy seeing.I then look at Peter Lynch PE lines over the last 5 years. A Peter Lynch PE line gives you the theoretical price at a point in time if the stock traded at a certain multiple of earnings. I look at the PE line for the average 5 year PE as well as the minimum and maximum PE over the same period. Source: uuptickAs you can see Nielsen is trading below its average PE multiple for the last 5 years. This is extremely encouraging because if we adjust for the one-time tax event, and forecast the increased PE from lower tax and higher margin revenue mix, Nielsen could be trading at one of the lowest valuations since the company went public.Market research is having to redefine itself like many other industries. This risk scares investors who are uncertain of what the future holds. However, Nielsen has proved that they are reacting and anticipating shifts in demand. The market has hit the company hard, and the historically low P-E combined with the historically high dividend yield, makes the company worthy of a small purchase for my dividend growth portfolio.I will be analyzing other stocks which are in my S.A.F.E stock screener during the next few weeks, so if you enjoyed this article please follow me and don't hesitate to ask any questions you might have."
4267481,23757,2019-05-31T05:42:26-04:00,"Nielsen's stock looks cheap, but growth has been virtually non-existent.Its largest segment is under pressure as media shifts from linear to on-demand digital.Management's lack of confidence in digital monetization opportunities warrants investor caution.","Nielsen plc's (NLSN) stock is cheap, but there are serious questions about the company's future growth prospects. Nielsen trades at just a forward P/E of 12.4, but revenue and gross profit have dropped year over year, and net income has basically been stagnant for the past four years. Additionally, analyst consensus earnings growth for the next five years is just 2.4%. So, what are the challenges Nielsen is facing, and are they likely to continue?Nielsen split its business into two segments - Watch and Buy.The largest segment, Watch, accounts for 52% of revenues but 78% of segment non-GAAP income. Unfortunately, this appears to be the segment most vulnerable to disruption.The Watch segment contains three business - Planning, Activation, and Audience Measurement. The Planning and Activation businesses which center around helping clients plan media buying campaigns and selling consumer demographic and behavior insight information are probably relatively safe from disruptions. Although, competition in some areas is increasing. For instance, Adobe (ADBE), which years ago used to be purely a graphics software company, is now listed as a competitor in Nielsen's 10-K.The Watch sub-segment facing the most challenges is the Audience Measurement. Nielsen's audience measurement service used to be (and still is, but now to a lesser degree) invaluable. Television and radio had huge audiences, but companies and advertisers needed reliable data on just who was watching or listening. Today, media consumption is changing. Today's consumers are on Facebook (FB) and Instagram. They are consuming media on demand from Hulu, Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) (note: Netflix has no ads), Spotify (SPOT), and various other over-the-top services. These companies often have most of, if not all, the information advertisers want on how their ad campaigns are performing. So long as the company's data can be trusted, there is a much reduced role for a third-party company like Nielsen.One question on the company's latest conference call really struck to the heart of this matter, and I think anyone invested in Nielsen or thinking about it may be disappointed by management's response. The quote from the call is long, but I think it's important and worth reading in full. An analyst asks a question about Nielsen being monetized less, as media shifts from linear to digital/on-demand. The CEO answers the question with a long-winded response about growth opportunities. The full exchange is below (bold highlights ours):What's concerning is that there was no color given about the monetization differences. We all know digital is a huge growth market. Of course, Nielsen is going to see its digital businesses grow. The real question is can the company earn the same from digital as it earns from traditional linear television. Given that the CEO basically declined to answer that affirmatively and simply highlighted the growth opportunity, we have some serious concerns. It sounds like a de-facto admission that there will be some disruption.The Buy segment is probably the segment least susceptible to disruption, but it still has some challenges. There are three sub-segments - Retail Measurement Services, Analytical Services, and Consumer Panel Services. Analytical Services is just what it sounds like, providing datasets and number-crunching services to companies. The Consumer Panel segment is information gleaned from various consumer panels and surveys Nielsen conducts. Neither of these segments should be experiencing very much in the way of disruptive change. The Retail Measurement Services segment could possibly be experiencing disruption as more sales move online and consolidate around a few major players such as Amazon and Walmart (NYSE:WMT). Like the Watch segment, the more information Amazon and Walmart can provide to sellers, the less demand there is for third-party data from companies like Nielsen. However, the change likely isn't as pronounced as what's happening in the Watch segment, but the potential for disruption seems to be there. Additionally, the consumer packaged goods segment is one of Nielsen's biggest clients. The challenges that segment is undergoing also seem to have trickled down into Nielsen's results as some of those companies have cut back on spending.Overall, Nielsen is a company in transition struggling to adapt to a new media landscape. In fact, the company is currently weighing selling or spinning off some of its business units or even an outright sale of the entire company. The inability of the company to articulate the impact of the shift to digital on-demand media consumption on its financials should be worrisome to investors. While Nielsen will probably still play a role in digital, it may be a reduced one compared to linear TV. Despite the cheap valuation, we don't think Nielsen represents a compelling investment for the long term at this time."

Yesterday, the company's stock price closed up by 2.34% after the company posted higher-than-expected revenues. In the quarter, the company generated revenues of $1.6 billion, beating the analysts forecasts by $10 million. The EPS of $0.44 missed by $0.35. In this article, I will highlight the reasons why I believe the company is a buy at the current price.Source. Investing.comAbout NielsenNielsen is a leading performance management company that provides companies with information about their customers. The information provided by Nielsen is used by companies to target the customers in an effective manner. The company is broadly divided into two segments: Buy and Watch. The Buy segment gives companies information on what and where customers buy, while the Watch segment provides customers with information about what consumers read, watch, and listen to. In the United States, Nielsen's data are synonymous with television viewership, especially after events such as the presidential inauguration. Nielsen is present in more than 100 countries, with more than 40,000 employees.Nielsen has managed to grow organically and through acquisitions. Last year, the company bought VisualDNA, Gracenote, REPUCOM, Informate Mobile, and Pointlogic.Summary of earningsIn the 4Q'16, the Buy segment's revenues decreased 1.3% to $868 million. On a constant currency basis, the revenues were up 0.9%. In the emerging markets, the buy revenues increased by 4%, while in developed markets, they decreased by 1.4%. In the Watch segment, revenues increased by 5.8% to $788 million. In total, the company had a net profit of $159 million, which was down 36% compared to the same quarter in 2015. The decline was associated with the company's increased stake in Nielsen Catalina Solutions. A similar event did not happen in the quarter. In the full year, the company's revenues were up 2.2% to $6.309 billion, with revenues in the Buy segment decreasing to $3.2 billion while revenues in the Watch segment went up by 5.3% to $2.9 billion.ValuationNielsen's stock price is currently $43.14, giving it a market capitalization of $15 billion and an enterprise value of $23.13 billion. The company has a trailing twelve month PE of 26.65 and a forward PE of 14.72. The trailing multiple is a point lower than the industrial average and slightly higher than the S&P 500 multiple of 25.13. Using the discounted cash flow (DCF), method, the company is currently trading at a 29% discount, with the future cash flow value being $60.40 as shown below.Source. Simply Wall StreetFinancial Position and DividendFor dividend investors, the goal is to invest in a company that shows a significant level of dividend growth. It is also desirable for the company to have adequate free cash flow (FCF). Personally, I see it as a red light when a company borrows money to fund dividends and share repurchases. In some instances, such as when it is cheaper for a company to borrow than repatriate funds, this is usually acceptable.In the last report, the company reported cash and cash equivalents of $754 million with net debt of $7.1 billion. The company has a net leverage ratio of 3.70x. Free cash flow increased from $808 million in 2015 to $941 million. As a result of the company's recent Gracenote acquisition and the recent $500 debt offering, the FCF guidance for 2017 was raised to $900 million.Nielsen has a TTM dividend yield of 2.87% and a forward yield of 3.14%. The company has a healthy dividend payout ratio of 47%. The table below shows the historical annual dividend data and growth.Source. Dividends.comThe chart below shows how Nielsen's dividend history compares with the industry, keeping in mind that the company started paying a dividend four years ago.Source. Simply Wall StreetFinal ThoughtsIn 2014, executives from major media companies such as Viacom have complained that Nielsen's systems of audience tracking were outdated as they did not capture mobile customers. It was also reported that the executives were looking for alternative companies to provide the data. However, in the audience tracking industry, Nielsen is the market leader and has invested billions of dollars to improve the services. It has done this internally and through acquisitions. The Gracenote acquisition from Tribune media was intended to help the company accelerate its ""total audience measure,"" which captures viewing from all sources. While there have been a number of competitors in the field such as comScore (NASDAQ: SCOR), GFK and IDC, Nielsen has established itself as a market leader in the industry.In the United States, Donald Trump has proposed policies that will see companies make huge savings. These savings will be from tax savings and regulatory overhaul. He has also announced huge investments in infrastructure. If these policies are implemented, I believe companies will accelerate spending in marketing and other corporate activities. Nielsen will not only benefit from a low tax regime but a high demand for its audience measurement services.As mentioned above, the company is currently trading at a 30% discount and is expected to increase its dividend this year. In addition, the company will continue with its $850 million share repurchase program, which it initiated in 2015. According to its estimates, the FCF is also expected to grow. Therefore, as the company is trading near its 52-week low, I believe this is a great time to buy the company."

Tribune wanted to 'expand our metadata capabilities by extending the business into new areas of music and automotive.'Apparently, it succeeded in some part and in the process made a tidy $390 million gross profit on the disposition of Gracenote, although I doubt that's what Tribune had in mind when it acquired Gracenote.Acquisition Terms and RationaleTribune says that it sold Gracenote in an all-cash deal, and announced it will issue a special dividend of approximately $500 million when the transaction closes, which is expected to occur in 1Q 2017.Another reason for Tribune unloading Gracenote was for increased company focus.Tribune CEO Peter Liguori said of the deal, ""We are pleased to be streamlining our company so that we can focus even more intently on seizing future opportunities for our local television and entertainment business.""For Nielsen, the addition of Gracenote 'extends Nielsen's footprint with major clients by including Gracenote's global content database which spans across platforms including multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs), smart televisions, streaming music services, connected devices, media players and in-car infotainment systems.'CommentaryNielsen wants Gracenote to fill out its 'Nielsen Total Audience' measurement framework, which helps advertisers to better target potential customers and optimize their campaigns in real time.Gracenote's content recognition data will help in that regard by providing more data to Nielsen about customer listening and watching habits.Understanding more aspects of consumer behavior will assist marketers to more tightly focus their messaging and receive a higher ROI as a result.Gracenote will be in situated in Nielsen's 'Watch' business segment and will continue to operate as a business unit out of its current headquarters.Earlier in 2016, Nielsen acquired REPUCOM, a Stamford, Connecticut-based analytics firm that provides research services in sports marketing, sponsorship, and media.Additionally in 2016, Nielsen acquired Informate Mobile for its mobile measurement capabilities, and it acquired Pointlogic, a marketing decision support system providing analytics to marketers to predict the impact of their marketing plans on sales and brand equity before launching the campaign.So, Nielsen is continuing to acquire companies that will build out its Watch and Buy segments, whether through improving media measurement or media planning capabilities for its clients.Expect Nielsen to take some time to digest the Gracenote acquisition and integrate it into its Watch segment offering. Its sales reps will be busy cross-selling the new metadata capabilities to Nielsen's existing clients as well as providing Nielsen an entree into Gracenote's client base.But with the digital media space constantly evolving with new forms of media coming online such as Virtual Reality, expect Nielsen to continue to make opportunistic and technological acquisitions to remain relevant to advertisers.I write about IPOs, follow-ons, secondaries, and M&A.

4025630,101614,2016-11-22T16:36:48-05:00,"This company invented the business of measuring viewer statistics for radio and television.
        It has re-formulated itself over the last 10 years in many ways to keep up with advances in the media, advertising and marketing industries.
        Major market players have recently expressed disappointment in the forward guidance from this company, sending it near the bottom of a two-year trading range.","Rationale for this ArticleThe business-to-business sector of the S&P 500 seems to receive a lower level of coverage on SA compared to most other sectors. I propose to consider the realm of marketing intelligence with a review of Nielsen Holdings NV (NYSE:NLSN).Background - Nielsen HoldingsNielsen is a mid-cap business services company, with about 43,000 employees; a market cap of about $16 billion; and $6.3 billion in 2015 sales. It provides business intelligence relating to buying and viewing habits as well as opinion trends of large population bases. It is based in the U.K., and is a subsidiary of Valcon, a privately held Dutch conglomerate. It has a presence in over 100 countries worldwide, but about half its revenue is from U.S. operations.While Nielsen's history is rooted in its invention of television and radio viewer measurements, it has made a concerted effort in the past 10 years, by acquisition, to bring itself into the digital age. Its operating segments are defined as Buy (54%) and Watch (46%).Nielsen has long standing relationships with many blue chip clients, with an average of over 30 years for its top 10 clients (2015 NLSN 10-K pg. 3). Nielsen believes it provides a set of services under one roof which is not matched by any of its competitors (10-K pg. 11).A one-roof concept is not to be underestimated in the mindset of many corporations, and lends itself to long-term stable revenues. Further, more than 70% of revenue is set in contracts before the start of each year.The Business of Marketing IntelligenceDespite the free spirit that is widely visible in social media, most people don't like their activities to be monitored too closely by the government, the news media, marketers, neighbors, or anyone else. On the other hand, businesses and companies are very concerned that they know their audiences, as well as what their competitors are doing.Audience measurement is a tool for the business of marketing. Despite the deep human relations capability and other skill sets needed by many commercial salespeople, marketing seems to be considered a step up from sales in many companies, and corresponds to the expectation of significant analytic capability.Commercial intelligence by measurement provides input to many fields of marketing. These include: branding and identity; industry analysis; the purchase and generation of advertising, as well as how to best to deploy it; public relations; government lobbying; and so forth. MBA graduate schools around the world have been prime movers for supplying employees to such industry players, small and large.Re-Invention of the CompanyIn the last 10 years or so, Nielsen has embarked upon a formidable array of acquisitions to bring itself into the digital age. It has also exited older businesses, including trade shows and magazines.This initiative has extended its reach to video streaming; social media reaction to television; E-commerce; the sports industry; online advertisement; public opinion polls; loyalty cards; in-store retail; and business consulting.Its methods now include electronic consumer metering; product initiative forecasting; product content presentation; real time advertising analysis; neural analysis; biometrics; and marketing consulting.Regulation and Litigation (10-K pg. 12, 18)In contrast with other examples of regulated sectors (e.g. banking, utilities, aircraft), Nielsen operates in a voluntary self-regulating mode under the auspices of the Media Rating Council. The MRC assigns companies with accreditation for various capabilities. It was formed by Congress in the 1960s, and is concerned today with many issues relating to online advertising, e.g. invalid traffic detection.Nielsen and its competitors also participate in industry efforts to define ethical concerns about personal and sensitive data.Nielsen has been the subject of various complaints and lawsuits in recent years. These have allegedly been due to issues such as corruption relating to television ratings in India and faulty methodology. The recent spat with Disney over ESPN measurements would be a recent example.To set this in context, however, many media channel and content providers have encountered tough regulation in their countries of operations, and some have faced protracted litigation and significant fines.Competition (10-K pg. 12)Many companies look to their own internal resources for marketing data. Amazon with all its capabilities remains in this camp. For a comparison primer between syndicated (i.e. Nielsen and its competitors) versus retail (i.e. direct from point of sale) data, see here.comScore (NASDAQ:SCOR) has had difficulty with maintaining profitability and completing its SEC filings, but remains Nielsen's primary U.S. competitor for digital audience and campaign measurement.Kantar is a subsidiary of WPP (WPPGY), a world marketing and advertising leader. WPP is a Nielsen customer for some services. Kantar has a strategic alliance with comScore.Information Resources or IRI, a privately held company, is Nielsen's primary competitor for retail measurement. It also has a strategic alliance with comScore.Primary competitors for internet data analysis are: Oracle (NYSE:ORCL); Google Analytics (NASDAQ:GOOG); Adobe Analytics (NASDAQ:ADBE); and IBM Digital Analytics (NYSE:IBM).Nielsen maintains data streaming partnerships with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB); TiVo (NASDAQ:TIVO); Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN); and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).Quantcast has been a disruptive player since 2006, with innovative contributions to the online advertising space. However, it appears to me that the Media Rating Council together with other major players are resisting its efforts to bring the industry to a new level.Other names in this space, small and large, include: J.D. Power; Gallup; Westat; NPD Group; Ipsos; GfK; Triton Digital; and TIBCO.The Business of ImageWhile many marketing agencies present case studies for their work, I know of a case which illustrates the value of an image makeover, in honor of one of my colleagues who went on to be successful.Earlier in my career, a young man was hired into our technology consulting company, with its 30 or so employees, from a lowly sales position in a local electronics retail store. He and I worked together intensely on many sales proposals for custom firmware and hardware development.At the time (in the late 1980s), the sky seemed to be the limit for printed circuit board level opportunity, and our company entertained an A to Z mix of customers. Several of us would take turns working out the substance of a bid, and with assistance from the owners my colleague would develop, finalize, and present the proposal. I thought he was remarkably capable at what he did.After some time, he made up his mind to go for his MBA degree, with a marketing specialty, at the University of Chicago. It was quite a distance from our workplace, but he made the trip over 18 to 24 months on a weekly basis, attending classes, doing homework, and still keeping up with his job.In time, he began wearing suits to work and carrying Wall Street Journal with him. He became much more careful in what he said, and opted out of proposal development. He also stopped smoking, lost much weight, and became the best ping pong player among all the employees.His transformation over time was a memorable event not just to me, but to my fellow employees as well. It was about a change in image. Likewise a significant side of the business of marketing is to facilitate an image improvement for a client and its products. As previously stated, audience measurement is a tool for achieving this goal.Balance Sheet Through 2015The 2015 Nielsen 10-K report on pg. 63 reports $41.25/share in total assets at the end of 2015, based on 371 million shares of diluted common (pg. 61). About half of this is goodwill, speaking of Nielsen's acquisitions over the years with the potential for revenue generation. Only about 12.5% of assets are current, but Nielsen is not likely to enter liquidation any time soon.The above assets are comparable with $26.33/share in total contractual obligations in existence at the end of 2015, which is categorized in the following table (10-K pg. 52).Based on straight assets minus liabilities, shareholder equity comes out at $11.95/share (10-K pg. 63). Its repurchase of a significant number of common shares, especially in the last two years, as well as its dividend increases (10-K pg. 64) should be evaluated in the context of its debt burden.Nielsen has taken on a significant amount of long-term debt in order to fund its many acquisitions over the last 10 years or so. It did re-finance a significant part of its debt in 2013 and 2014 (10-K pg. 64).On 10-K pg. 91 it is seen that several tranches of debt thru 2021 are variable rate issues. LIBOR rates have increased significantly since the start of 2016, and may increase further from here; however, Nielsen utilizes interest-rate swaps and cross-currency swaps to reduce this risk (10-K pp. 32-33).The bond rating agencies have taken a dim view of the overall situation for at least the last few years. For senior unsecured debt, Moody's assigns B1 while S&P assigns BB+ (three grades higher, still one notch below investment grade).My general observation is that Nielsen took the steps that it felt were needed to maintain its relevance in the digital age in the presence of significant competition. I think stock re-purchases over the last few years have been a distraction from what could have been a more conservative style of management.Operational Cash Flow (10-K pg. 64) Courtesy: FastGraphs.The above chart indicates cash flow for NLSN over the last five years compared to its stock price (black line). Takeaways from the chart are: the dividend only began to be offered in 2013; it is steadily increasing and is well covered by operating cash flow (the dividend did not drop in 2015 as the chart suggests); and the stock price has entered a buy range.According to 10-K pg. 34 and the Jun-2016 presentation for analysts (slide 10 of 24), the non-U.S. currency exposure is about 40% of all revenues. The U.S. dollar may be near the top of a recent strong move upwards.Analyst and Ownership ProfileAccording to exchange records, out of 357 million NLSN shares presently outstanding, about 93% of these shares are held by 488 financial institutions of various types. I consider this to be a vote of confidence by those who manage large sets of funds.By contrast, witness institutional holdings of Aegon (NYSE:AEG), a Dutch insurance company with significant U.S. operations, at less than 5%.Short interest is at an insignificant two to three days to cover. More purchases than sales of common stock by insiders have occurred over the past three months.Mood of the MarketThis security was bid up steadily during 2013 thru 2016, consistent with an expectation of high returns on acquisitions by this company.Courtesy - ScottradeWhile short interest is minimal at this time, the stock price took a strong hit after the late October earnings call, when forward guidance was perceived as weak. This stock appears to be carving out a bottom at 41-42. I think that forward results or guidance would have to be particularly bad from here before this security drops further.ConclusionMajor players in the stock market tend to overreact to their perceived concerns, which can provide an entry point for an opportunistic investor. I find the long-term strategy of this company to be attractive.I am cautious about the significant long-term debt as well as a management distracted by the repurchasing of stock and raising of the dividend. Despite its scheduled plan for debt paydown over coming years (10-K pg. 52), market players expect strong enough performance to compensate for this negative factor.I have taken a partial position in this security at this time (long in a retirement account). I do not expect to add to this position unless I see a change in stance relative to the above stated concerns."
4007308,88746,2016-09-20T11:18:49-04:00,"In my experience, Nielsen is an excellent company to work for.They have two primary businesses: watch and buy.Watch business was the main driver of revenue and profits this quarter.Guidance for the company is robust for the full year.","BackgroundAccording to Nielsen's (NYSE:NLSN) website, they are operating in 106 different countries. They understand what consumers watch and buy (their two segments) and interpret that data for their customers. They allow managers to make strategic business decisions daily. Nielsen's claim to fame is the ""Nielsen ratings"" for television. Now that the world is rapidly changing, they have a comprehensive platform to measure the audiences with all devices. They have an excellent read on the consumer from a variety of industries.Additionally, I would like for everyone reading to know that I worked at Nielsen in Sydney, Australia. It was part of a study abroad through my university. While I was there, I had an opportunity to learn the culture of Nielsen a bit better. In addition, I was able to travel to their Melbourne and Auckland offices. After visiting all the offices, I believe that Nielsen is a great place to work. The attire is business casual and the employees are warm and welcoming. The structure of the organization is very decentralized. Employees were very dedicated and motivated because they had the freedom to make decisions. They also did a companywide volunteer day which was amazing. Nielsen has a powerful brand image while also giving back to the community that they serve.Quarterly Results OverviewRevenue in their most recent quarter was $1.6 billion, up 4.5% on a constant currency basis. This is their 40th consecutive quarter of constant currency revenue growth. They saw continued strength in their Watch and Buy business, with watch being the standout. There are some nice tailwinds for both businesses as Nielsen is the best at what they do. Their customers rely upon them to deliver excellent results and a steady relationship develops with their clients. A large portion of Nielsen's revenue is recurring revenue, providing a nice, stable business.Adjusted EBITDA was $490 million on a constant currency basis, up 4.7%. Adjusted net income was $.71, up 9.2% with constant currency. These results reflect strength in the underlying business as income and EBITDA increased year over year. I will discuss these strengths later in the article.Nielsen also gave guidance for full-year 2016. They expect revenue to be up 4-6% on a constant currency basis, year over year. EPS is expected to be $2.83-$2.93 and the company is expected to spin off $950 million in free cash flow. Approximately 80% of the free cash flow will be earned in the second half of 2016. All in all, guidance was stellar. Revenue growth is fantastic with EPS continuing to increase as well.Quarterly Results by SegmentNielsen has two main segments: Buy and Watch. To provide some context on the makeup of the business, I will review the fiscal year 2015 results by segment. In 2015, total sales were $6.172 billion. Buy accounted for 54.2% of the revenue whereas ""Watch"" accounted for 45.8% of revenue. Buy has lower margins and made $369 million of operating income. Watch had $880 million in operating income and thus has higher margins.BuyOn the conference call, they tell investors what the ""Buy"" business does. The ""Buy"" business provides manufacturer and retail clients with valuable information. Nielsen has an excellent read on what the consumer buys and major trends. For example, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) uses Nielsen data to enhance their omni-channel strategy. Their newest innovation with their connected system will be used to measure and improve performance. It is one fully connected and integrated platform. How it works is: Nielsen understands what is happening, why it happened, and how clients can improve. I believe this system will drive growth in the future.Revenue in the most recent quarter was $852 million, up 3.3% with constant currency. Developed markets were only up 1% in constant currency to $582 million. Emerging markets were up 8.9% to $270 million with double digit gains in Latin America, China, and Southeast Asia. EBITDA was $166 million, up 6.4% in constant currency. EBITDA margins improved 57 basis points indicating strong operating performance.WatchThe ""Watch"" business focuses on what consumers watch and hear. This covers everything from radio, TV, social media, and more. Their clients seek to measure video, audio, and text. This is what Nielsen calls ""total audience measurement."" They try to help allocate resources efficiently for customers. They answer key questions like return on investment, reach, and sales lift. They deliver granularity at the deepest level and that helps clients manage their resources efficiently. Nielsen is also extending their coverage to deliver better data to customers. They are partnering with Dish (NASDAQ:DISH) and Charter (NASDAQ:CHTR) to use their set top box data. I view this as a long term opportunity to provide better data to customers while also reducing the expenses for panels. It is a trade-off that will benefit the entire ""Watch"" business.Watch revenue was up 5.8% to $744 million with constant currency. Video and text (audience measurement) were up 7.9% year over year to $491 million. Marketing effectiveness was up 15% on constant currency to $84 million. Investments were made to enhance the growth. Digital advertising campaigns were up 53%, which is surely to bode well for the company. Adjusted EBITDA was up 6.4% to $332 million, using constant currency. Watch remains a strong business and will be a continued growth driver for the company. Nielsen stands to benefit as digital will be a major contributor to overall revenue.ValuationAt the time of writing, Nielsen has appreciated 12% year to date and is approximately 6% off of its all-time highs. This has pushed valuations to 17.5x forward twelve month earnings. According to CNBC, 2017 earnings are expected to be $3.17 compared to an estimated $2.87 for 2016 earnings. This would be a 10.5% growth rate, making a PEG of 1.67. This would put the company towards the more expensive range as a PEG of 2 is considered expensive.ChartsNielsen has had a sizeable move this year, so it is prudent to look at the charts. If we look at the chart below, we will find that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. What is particularly interesting is that the stock has only been overbought once in the past two years. Since March, it appears the stock has been range bound between $50 and $55. I believe Nielsen is consolidating its moves and will eventually move higher as the fundamentals catch up with their shares. In the meantime, I believe it is prudent that we wait for lower levels to get a better entry point. Support is located at $50 and $48. I do not think that it will break below the trading range. If you can get shares at $50, that would represent your best entry point.Source: StockChartsConclusionIn my experience, Nielsen is an excellent company to work for. Their culture is a relaxed and productive environment where employees can thrive. This creates a successful enterprise that can grow in the long term. Results in the latest indicate underlying strength in the core business. Both of their businesses are generating organic constant currency revenue growth and total company revenue growth has increased for the past 40 quarters. Watch is stronger than Buy, but both businesses are equally attractive. I am particularly impressed with the 7.9% increase in audience measurement (Watch). I believe results will continue to impress as the media becomes more fragmented. Digital advertising increased at a double digit pace in the most recent quarter. Expect these results to continue as digital garners a greater share of advertising dollars.Valuations are reasonable at current levels. However, if you can purchase shares at $50, I think this would represent a great opportunity to pick up shares on the cheap. Happy investing!"
2655715,75175,2014-11-08T07:15:00-05:00,"Nielsen has made a name for itself by measuring the audience for TV advertisement.Traditional TV ratings comprise up to 40 percent of its current revenue.However, consumers are increasingly abandoning pay-TV for online subscription-based platforms.Services like Netflix and Amazon present an alternative business platform and can supply advertisers with more accurate data.Nielsen is unprepared to challenge these trends, and will face significant revenue declines as pay-TV subscribers continue to dwindle.","Nielsen (NYSE:NLSN) has made a name for itself by being essentially the only way to compare viewership numbers between television shows. If you want to see which show is pulling in the most 18-49 year old males, Nielsen's number are the go-to source. However, as the Millennial generation has come of age, viewing habits are undergoing a significant shift. DVRs, mobile apps, and online streaming services such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Hulu, and Amazon Instant (NASDAQ:AMZN) have changed how people watch television. Until recently Nielsen has been largely unable to account for such digital viewing.That changed during its latest earnings report where it announced a partnership with Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) to provide an new, more inclusive tracking system for some types of digital viewing. The system (formally titled the Nielsen Digital Content Ratings, Powered by Adobe) is designed to track viewership across platforms, enabling Nielsen to see who viewed certain shows not only when they aired, but also online, through web-connected devices, and proprietary apps. The system is powered by Adobe's Primetime online TV-platform, and initial partners include Viacom (VIA.B), ESPN, and Turner Broadcasting.Investors and analysts have been calling for Nielsen to move into the digital-viewing arena for some time now - although that doesn't seem to have affected its valuation. Nielsen's stock has risen from approximately $29 a share in 2011 to around $43 today. The announcement of its new digital services has also generated significant excitement. Fortune profiled the new service in an article entitled ""The ratings system that could change the TV industry forever."" They go on to say that Nielsen's new partnership has cemented it as ""the industry standard for generations to come.""When assessing the long-term potential of this business, however, it's necessary to move past such hyperbolic assertions. As more viewers abandon traditional cable for online streaming, Nielsen faces fundamental challenges to its business model and overall relevance. Increasingly, Nielsen's future lies outside of ad-supported television, which is a worrying fact for investors.In 2013, Nielsen's ""Watch"" segment (its audience measurement offerings for television, radio, and online) brought in 2.3 Billion, and made up just over 40% of its revenue. During its latest quarterly earnings call its CFO broke out the Watch revenue, saying it accounted for $649 million. Although Nielsen doesn't provide inter-segment breakouts for its Watch and Buy (retail analytics) segments, TV audience measurement almost certainly makes up the majority of this category. While the company's digital initiatives may have ""momentum"" it's unlikely they can fully make up for the revenue that will be lost as traditional, ad-supported television continues to decline in popularity.Nielsen's core audience measurement business relies on ad-supported televisionThe value proposition for Nielsen's audience measurement service is its ability to tell advertisers who is watching or listening to certain programs. The company accomplishes this through a network of ""Nielsen families"" that agree to regularly report their viewing, along with personal details such as age and purchasing habits. Nielsen holds these families up as being representative of the broader American consumer, and extrapolates nationwide viewing numbers from these sample households.If that sounds like an antiquated measurement system, that's because it is. The data is self-reported, relies on broad assumptions, and up until now it has not been able to factor in most online or mobile viewing. The reason Nielsen has been so profitable is because there's really been no alternative data for advertisers to look at when determining how many people watched their shows, and more importantly, how many people watched the ads.Nielsen's ratings business relies upon the ad-supported nature of television, and content providers' inability to track their audience's habits. Both of these factors are now changing.Nielsen's latest cable ratings highlight the problems it faces. Over the last year, traditional TV viewership (consisting of live TV and time-shifted viewing) declined by 13 minutes per day; a significant drop. That's bad news in and of itself, because such traditional measurement makes up a significant portion of its revenue.What's worse is where viewers are migrating to. If people were simply switching from watching live or DVR'd shows to watching them on network websites or network mobile apps (which some percentage surely is), then Nielsen's new digital offerings would be particularly well timed. What's happening more often though is that customers are moving away from networks and cable TV in general. Todd Juenger of Bernstein Research makes the convincing case that viewers are directly shifting their time from network TV to subscription-based platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu. In a few months you'll be able to add HBO's forthcoming subscription service to that list as well.These subscription-based business models are currently ad-free (with the exception of Hulu), which cuts out the need for Nielsen entirely. Of course, some analysts have argued that ads are inevitable for these platforms if they want to continue expanding. Even if Netflix does introduce ads into its content however, it is hard to see a need for Nielsen's services. Netflix already has detailed information on its customers, including their age, location, individual-specific show preferences, and real-time data on viewing habits. Plus, this data isn't extrapolated from a small sample set like Nielsen's; it's the entire Netflix audience.Amazon's streaming service presents an even worse problem. Not only is Amazon now producing original content and collecting data on viewing habits, it has actual information on how viewing habits and purchases overlap. The entire platform could be fine-tuned to promote in-show purchasing, if it so wanted. That's a goldmine for potential advertisers, and again, it's based on a complete data set.Given the popularity of such platforms, and HBO's recent decision to offer a similar service, this is likely the future of television. Proprietary platforms (especially subscription-based) allow companies to collect customer data without relying on middlemen. It also allows for a leaner, more efficient production process - new shows can be tailored to audience tastes (as Netflix does) or crowdsourced to ensure their appeal (as Amazon's pilot program does). As this change occurs, Nielsen's TV ratings business will be one of the casualties.Nielsen's Online Content Ratings Are Unlikely To Fill the GapA smaller, but growing part of Nielsen's audience measurement tools is its Online Campaign Ratings (OCR). Whereas its television ratings measure the potential audience for televised ads, OCR measures the effectiveness of digital ad buys. The point is to help brands determine who saw their online ads, and how audiences engaged with them. Similar to Nielsen's television panels, OCR data is gathered using a ""representative panel of Internet users"" who have specific tracking software installed on their browsers.In contrast to Nielsen's TV ratings, OCR presents a more viable long-term opportunity. Because of the distributed nature of online video advertising (aside from YouTube and large platforms like Hulu, ad buying is highly fragmented), reports on audience engagement are helpful for marketing departments looking to verify their analytics or confirm that what they bought reached the intended target. Of course, the same issues that exist in Nielsen's TV ratings are present here. Namely, the data is based on a small sample of both users and sites.The big question though is whether initiatives like OCR can eventually become as large as TV ratings. The answer is likely no. Although video ads command a large price premium over banner ads, the overall prices of internet ads continue to drop - mostly due to the huge volume of ad space available, and the low engagement rate of online audiences. Some publishers (including the Economist) are now moving away from impression-based models to attention-based pricing, which would allow brands to target sites and content where audiences spend more time. If such a model becomes widespread, it would eliminate much of the need for ad buyers to ""check up"" on the engagement of audiences, which is of course OCR's selling point.Single internet-ID services, such as Facebook Login, also pose a threat. Social networks have near-unprecedented access to consumer data, and realize the value of being able to passively track a user across the web. If a single login service ever gains significant traction, it would allow the social network to report detailed engagement metrics to advertisers, tied into user profiles, from across the web. Shopping tendencies, viewing habits, and more could all be analyzed and targeted. While this is a less likely scenario, it's worth considering when evaluating Nielsen's future as an information broker for advertisers and networks.Where Does This Leave Nielsen?Looking forward, it's clear these trends are both long-term in nature and likely irreversible. Consumers have shown little to no qualms about giving over personal information in exchange for convenience, especially regarding their online viewing, listening, and shopping habits. That's great news for subscription-platforms, and bad news Nielsen. Netflix, Amazon Plus, Hulu, and likely the forthcoming HBO platform will all continue to make inroads against traditional television and traditional ad-supported business models.However, that doesn't mean traditional television will be going anywhere fast, or that networks will immediately abandon Nielsen ratings. There are around 100 million pay-TV subscribers, and 2012 was a high point for the overall industry. There's also no true competitor for TV ratings, and American's fondness for cable won't end for at least another decade, if not longer. However, the subscription decline that started in 2013 will continue as younger consumers disconnect or forgo cable in the first-place. As this happens, a significant portion of Nielsen's revenue will disappear.When evaluating Nielsen's long-term value, these threats must be taken into account. Forgoing a reversal in either customer habits or the structure of online advertising, Nielsen's Watch segment has limited prospects for long-term growth, and will face significant declines in revenue over the next decade and beyond."

Of those, early reports say it looks like ABC has incurred most of the faulty data, although Nielsen wouldn't confirm or deny it. If it did, that means the rest has been spread among the other broadcasters and syndicators.Communicating with reporters, Nielsen said only about 1 percent to 2 percent of the ratings numbers will be impacted from the software failure.Even so, Nielsen said there are some cases where the impact on companies could be fairly substantial. source: StockCharts.comTrust CurrencyTthe company is spinning this as a small blip. That is true as far as the overall impact goes. But with regard to trust, it could take a big hit.The problem is the software bug was live as of March 2, 2014, and it wasn't found until October 6, 2014. That's a lot of time to have a problem that you aren't aware of, with about $70 billion in TV advertising revenue at stake.There is no doubt this is where the major blow to Nielsen could be, as in general the industry has been patient and stuck with Nielsen as it developed new methods to measure the various screens content of the networks were being watched.Rentrak has also been breathing down the neck of Nielsen, as it has been making acquisitions that tie into measuring of TV audiences, and has landed CBS as one of its customers. With Nielsen's share price down by about 10 percent so far in 2014, it couldn't have happened at a worse time as the company faces real competition for the first time in a long time.Networks also have been pressuring Nielsen because of the falling number of viewers, and wants to be sure all viewers are being counted in order to get the best leverage it can when negotiating with advertisers.Trust is everything with metrics, and this is definitely a black eye to Nielsen, no matter how it's spun.It's in its best interest to get the numbers revised as soon as possible in order that all parties of interest are satisfied. They definitely are anxious about what happened and need answers in an already difficult, competitive market, as viewers swarm to smaller devices to consume content digitally.Disney's ABC said in a statement, ""Our entire industry relies upon Nielsen for accuracy and veracity, and we hope that they can quickly resolve this issue.""There can be no doubt the question going through everyone's mind is how Nielsen could have missed this for so long. Its explanation, as mentioned above, was that the discrepancies in most cases weren't large to be noticed.Will It Have Any Impact on Company's Performance and Earnings?The unit which would be most directly impacted by the software failure would be its Watch business, which is where TV, Internet and mobile audience metrics are included. That jumped nicely in the latest quarter, climbing to $694 million, an increase of 28 percent over the same reporting period in 2013.Growth in the unit was attributed to audience measurement, which is of course where the software error occurred. Its Watch business accounted for 44 percent of revenues in the second quarter.The remaining 56 percent of revenues came from its Buy business, which increased to $900 million, a gain of 6.6 percent year-over-year. Minus its acquisition of Harris, revenues in the unit were up a more modest 4.4 percent.Information Services unit was the major contributor within the Buy unit, bringing in $676 million in revenue, a gain of 5 percent.The major growth in the overall Buy unit is expected to come in developing markets, which grew by 9.2 percent in the latest quarter. It expects that to improve.Another area of the company that has strengthened is its cash flow, which soared to $210 million, up from $90 million sequentially. Free cash flow rose from $13 million in the last quarter to $116 million in the second quarter.In the short term this shouldn't have any impact on Nielsen's earnings performance, but it does wedge the door open a little for its competitors, as its customers should be more open to look at competing offers based upon a loss of some trust. Nielsen has already had Rentrak poach into its territory, so this will strengthen its position when negotiating for contracts.Where the problem may come in the short term is with its share price, which with even a decent performance hasn't been able to gain any traction in 2014.I have been bullish on Nielsen in the past because it was dominant in its market and didn't have any serious competitors. That is slowly changing, and having a debacle like this doesn't help it when its customers are looking for metric solutions that will increase their top and bottom lines.Law Suits or Reimbursements?Depending on who is most impacted from the glitch and to what depth, there is possibility the company or companies will asked to be reimbursed if it was a significant miss.If that were to happen and Nielsen balked, we could see a lawsuit or two filed to get lost revenue returned to the company. Then there is of course the other side of the coin, where the beneficiary on the positive side may have received more advertising dollars based upon numbers that were higher than the measurements showed.All of this could get complicated if advertisers were to be brought into the fray as well because of the skewed viewership numbers they paid for.It's of course in the best interest of Nielsen to get in front of that if it can, and work things out quietly behind the scenes so the focus doesn't continue to be on its failure to catch the software error for so long.ConclusionAs with all disasters, this could be an opportunity for Nielsen if it does things right. It gives it an opportunity to work more closely with its clients, possibly building a closer relationship with them than before, which could lead to stronger business bonds. There's no guarantee that will happen, but the opportunity is there.There also is the possibility it could miss this moment, and simply do the minimum of going over the data and bringing the accurate metrics to all parties. That's the very minimum it should do, and it can't fail there in any way, or its credibility would be strained.As it is, this isn't likely to be a major game changer in the industry, but it is another chink in Nielsen's armor at a time when serious competitors are fighting to take market share and growth away from a company that had almost a virtual monopoly in the market. Those days are slipping away, and Nielsen can't afford to make many mistakes like this, or the unthinkable just a short time ago that it would not have any serious competitive challengers will change much quicker than it already is.The devastation to me is an intangible, one that can't be measured or pointed to, as trust and credibility aren't able to be identified in and of themselves, but the results of lack in those critical areas will be able to be seen in the numbers it puts forth from quarter to quarter.What investors should look for over the next couple of quarters is if some of its competitors are awarded a contract here or there that they didn't have before. It could be a signal that there was a loss of confidence and the industry is open to alternative counting methodologies from Nielsen's competitors.While I knew Nielsen would eventually get some competition, it is at the door a little quicker than I believed would happen, and that could keep the share price under pressure, even though it had a good but not great second quarter.It looks like it will take to at least the end of October for the new numbers to be reissued."
2499875,47521,2014-09-16T17:12:09-04:00,"Long-awaited release of mobile app metrics from Nielsen could change industry.The most likely main beneficiary of accurate mobile counts in the short term will be CBS.It probably won't change the overall network schedule of shows dramatically, but individual shows could benefit immensely.","I've been closely following the progress of Nielsen (NYSE:NLSN) as it has worked on building out a system which can accurately measure the number of people consuming TV on mobile apps, and it is now ready to go prime-time, with estimates it may increase the number of viewers watching shows in the hundreds of thousands; although that would obviously only relate to the top shows, as it's unlikely a poor performer on broadcast television will change and become a major performer because of mobile views.When referring to measuring mobile apps, I mean all mobile devices with various screen sizes. Basically anything with a screen will now be measured.The reason Nielsen will benefit so much from this is the entertainment industry is very comfortable with the company and decided to wait for it to develop a system to measure mobile devices rather than go primarily with companies that target digital alone. It seems like, for the most part, they wanted a one-stop shop, and that's what they'll now get with Nielsen.In the short term this will help the broadcasters, cable and satellite channels, but there is still a ceiling on how much television is being watched across all devices, and with the new metrics we'll get the most accurate measurements since the mobile industry began attracting so many eyeballs.Since the media companies have been making a lot of noise about metrics not representing the new realities, now we will get very accurate data, and we'll know how much advertisers will be spending across all platforms.Of all the probable benefits companies get out of the new metrics, I think Nielsen will benefit the most because it won't matter whether or not the media viewers are growing, they'll still have to pay for the metrics. source: StockCharts.comAdvertisers and Mobile ViewsThe next thing to consider with the inevitable increased number of viewers is how marketers or advertisers will value and price them. It's no secret that broadcast and cable viewers are considered more valuable than mobile viewers, and even with premium content it's uncertain if advertisers will pay the same type of prices to place their ads against the same content being viewed on smaller devices. In the past they haven't been willing to.However much they're willing to pay, we know it's not going to cost media companies any more to produce, so whatever it is will be more than they're paying now. Eventually I think premium content on mobile devices will attract significant advertising dollars, and the distance between what is paid for broadcast, cable and mobile TV ads will shrink.What will probably help that shrink is the fact that when adding the new metrics the average age of those watching the television shows is going to be lower because the demographic for mobile devices skew lower than in-home television sets, desktop computers or laptops.All of this is new, so we won't have clarity to project how this is going to have an effect on the industry, but we know for sure that it will generate more revenue and earnings; it's just a matter of to what degree it will in the existing lower-priced mobile ad world.Impact on Broadcasting and CableOutside of the obvious boost in ad revenue for TV content, the other impact metrics will have on TV shows is it may be the difference between a show being canceled or not.For example, recently Fox's (NASDAQ:NWSA) 'Utopia' was considered a total disaster with the low measured number of viewers, but when adding those watching Live+3 the numbers soared, giving it a much better performance than was believed. With the high costs of the show it doesn't mean it'll survive, but it does mean it's doing much better.What is unusual about the increase in Live+3 is usually there isn't that much of a boost in reality TV shows, but Utopia got a big bump in the key 18-49 demo, soaring by 56%. This isn't a mobile metric, but it shows the potential that some shows may have outside of normal ratings numbers.There is no doubt there will be some surprises from mobile metrics, but there are many weak shows that won't receive much more value from counting mobile views. It isn't like the overall trend of declining TV viewers isn't a real one, and that the only reason it looks so weak is because of not counting mobile views. That will be true with individual shows, but not with the overall broadcasting and cable networks.When combined with counting broadcast and cable viewers up to seven days past the day it aired, mobile will, in the short term, change the way advertisers consider the numbers; but again, over the longer haul there will be no more excuses from media companies which have been saying the number of people watching their shows is far more than is being counted. Very soon that will no longer be able to be asserted. After this, if management still says viewers aren't being counted, it will be considered disingenuous and a reflection of not accepting the fact the trend is down.Overall this should give broadcasters and cable networks a nice boost, but I believe it will be more from individual shows than across the entire schedule.With the number of viewers dropping, some media companies, like Disney (NYSE:DIS) have been cutting back on their exposure to advertising, with advertising revenue at Disney now accounting for about 20% of revenue. CBS (CBS) on the other hand has been slower to take that step, and with 50% of revenue coming from advertising, stands to gain the most of the major media companies from mobile metrics.CBSCBS doesn't have revenue streams larger competitors like Disney and Time Warner (TWC) have, so I think CEO Les Moonves has maintained the company's exposure to advertising, anticipating the eventual measurement of mobile metrics giving the company a big boost.That time is now hear, and we'll see how accurate Moonves has been when asserting CBS is doing far better than existing ratings metrics were showing.I have no doubt that the numbers will improve, simply because they have to when adding new ways of measuring the number of viewers. So at the next couple of earnings calls, we should see CBS benefit from this; although how much is unclear because advertisers were buying spots based on prior data. What the earnings calls will do is point to how much the actual viewers were being undercounted, showing the probably increase in ad spend in the next upfront. Scatter markets may get some immediate benefit, but not as much as next year.Once the numbers are analyzed, at that time the share price will go up, although it could in anticipation of a much-improved metric. The improved metric is an assumption, but a healthy assumption. Again, it will have the most impact on individual shows. If it takes those shows higher than thought, that will drive revenue expectations higher over the next year, and the share price should respond accordingly.There is little visibility at this time, but once a couple of quarters have been measured, it will be much clearer as to how much it should increase advertising revenue for CBS, as well as its competitors. source: StockCharts.comConclusionI'm glad Nielsen has finally put together a mobile metric service, as the assertions and assumptions will finally be laid aside, and investors will get a very clear picture of exactly what to expect from advertising revenue going forward. It will also give a much clearer picture of the value of media companies with significant advertising exposure, as the lack of accurate metrics have held back investors from committing more to the uncertain numbers.Overall, Nielsen should be the biggest winner here. Among broadcasters and cable networks, CBS should get the most benefit out of this. If the numbers are higher than expected, media companies may even reverse course some and increase exposure to advertising.I don't think that will happen, but until we know the specific number of viewers, we won't know if that is a possibility.With the overall trend still being that people are watching less TV and long-form video, I don't think this is going to be a huge factor of the long term for the industry. I do see it buying them some time and getting more for their content because the number of viewers for a lot of shows will no doubt be a lot higher.The strategy of broadcasters and cable companies still needs to be to lower their exposure to advertising. There's a reason Disney has lowered its exposure to about 20% of overall revenue, and I don't believe the company would have done that if it thought mobile views would restore its advertising fortunes to past levels.In the short term CBS will get the biggest boost from this among broadcasters and cable networks, but it will also participate in the inevitable ongoing decline in long-form viewer trends. What Nielsen has done is provided a longer window to deal with the issue and provide alternative revenue streams and more short-form video."

1885011,57971,2013-12-09T06:17:15-05:00,,"IntroductionNielsen Holdings (NYSE:NLSN) is an information and measurement company providing clients with media and marketing information and analytics about what consumers watch (consumer interaction with television, online and mobile) and what consumers buy on a global and local basis. Most investors probably have heard of them via their TV ratings reports, which are generated by Nielsen.NLSN operates through two reportable business segments:Recent Insider ActivityShares of NLSN have led the S&P 500 in terms of insider selling by far over the past 90 days. (source: FactSet) In fact, NLSN insiders have sold over twice as much stock than #2 on the list, Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX).So far in 2013, insider sales have totaled just under 221 million shares, over 1/2 of the company's outstanding share total - as of their latest quarterly report. To boot, there have been zero shares purchased by insiders this year. Here's a look at the insider trading activity for NLSN for all of the past year: (source: E*Trade)This year, total insider ownership of NLSN is down over 50%. Normally, that would be a pretty clear indication for investors to pass on a stock. However, insider selling is not always a bad sign, and this year, the market has not seemed to mind. In fact, despite the consistent insider selling, shares of NLSN are actually doing quite well this year, up over 40%: (source: Google Finance)Why Do Insiders Sell?The SEC considers ""insiders"" to be company directors, officials, or any individual with a stake of 10% or more in the company. Company insiders buy and sell stock all the time, for many different reasons. This should not be the sole basis for making an investment decision regarding a specific company. Some reasons can be a bad sign, but not all indicate an impending decline. Let's take a look at a select few of the common reasons that insiders sell stock - first some negative ones and then some to ignore.Possible negative reasons for insiders selling company stock include:Other reasons insiders sell:So how does one tell the difference? How can one determine if the selling should incite worry and fear in the investor, or simply be ignored? I like to follow some general rules of thumb and ignore insider selling that falls into one of the following categories:If you look closely at the reporting of insider sales of NLSN this year, you'll notice that many of them do fall into one of these ""ignore"" categories, with the exception of a select few. Many of the sales have been from the same insiders for the exact same number of shares on a monthly or quarterly basis.Should Investors Be Discouraged Going Forward?Yes and No. Despite most insider sales being planned or repeats, it's difficult to ignore the amount of sell transactions occurring over such a long period of time. Sure, some are probably taking profits, as the stock is at its all-time high. But I refuse to believe that's the case with all of them.Some reasons to be bearish on NLSN:However, owners of NLSN have been rewarded this year with over 40% return, not including the yield on the dividend just started this year. NLSN has outperformed the S&P as well as their industry peers, as shown in the chart below including two main competitors ADT Corp. (NYSE:ADT) and FactSet Research Systems (NYSE:FDS): (source: Google Finance)Some reasons to be bullish on NLSN:ConclusionIn his book Investment Intelligence from Insider Trading, Nejat Seyhun, a University of Michigan professor/researcher in the field of insider trading, found that when insiders bought shares of their own companies, those stocks tended to outperform the total market by 8.9% the next year. Conversely, when they sold shares, the stock underperformed the market by 5.4%. Basically what this means is that insider selling should be weighted with less importance than insider buying when considered as an indicator of future stock performance. As one of investing's notable greats, Fidelity's Peter Lynch, put it :Investing in any company should be based on thorough research and evaluation of many things: performance over time, future projections, comparison to industry peers, recent news and earnings reports, analyst recommendations, etc. They should never be based solely on what the company's insiders are doing - whether buying or selling. I see articles written every day simply about the recent insider trades in ABC or XYZ company, but to make an educated investment decision, you must ignore those headlines and really look at the reasons for the activity. I look at those articles, and at any stock like NLSN with heavy insider activity, as an invitation to evaluate a company, not buy or sell it.All that being said - I wouldn't recommend buying NLSN at the current share price. When looking at the amount of recent insider selling in combination with some of my bearish points noted above, I think interested investors would be wise to wait for a dip of 5-10% before starting a position, as well as possibly waiting for the insider sentiment of the company to change - i.e. look for an insider purchase. At these all-time highs, that would be a fantastic sign to go long NLSN. For current shareholders, I recommend taking some profits here and selling a portion of your shares. If anything you can always get back in later on a pullback in the stock.I guess in my eyes that makes NLSN what most analysts would term a ""hold"" recommendation. This doesn't always mean that shareholders won't be rewarded in the long-term for maintaining or even increasing their current positions. Nielsen Holdings' fundamentals look good compared to their competition, they are growing well, and the share price has been hot as of late. In the near future, however, I believe NLSN is due to cool off a bit, and I think some of the insider selling shows that they agree with me.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1786002,47521,2013-10-30T04:53:35-04:00,,"Nielsen Holdings N.V. (NYSE:NLSN) has been strongly branded for years in the entertainment and advertising industries. Marketers, and those that provide content for viewers, look to Nielsen for the most accurate and up-to-date data in order to find the best price for advertisers to place against that content.The company operates in three segments: What Consumers Buy, What Consumers Watch, and Expositions. Expositions puts together business-to-business trade shows and conferences in the U.S. market.Even though in its latest quarter the ""What Consumers Buy"" segment accounted for 63% of revenues, it's not the segment of the company that provides the durable moat for Nielsen, rather it's the ""What Consumers Watch"" segment which is its most defensible segment; the segment that makes the company a household brand around the world.In this article, we'll look at the ""What Consumers Watch"" segment in order to see why Nielsen is such a good long-term holding. source: YahooFoundational MoatWhat differentiates Nielsen from its competitors in the ""What Consumers Watch"" segment is its embedded system which is used to measure the TV audience in the home. That has been and will continue to be a gigantic moat for the company.Even when numerous changes affected the industry as consumers started to watch streaming video on the Internet, and then gravitated to mobile devices, the television industry, while pressing Nielsen to come up with metric answers, didn't seriously consider abandoning Nielsen for a competitor. It could have happened if Nielsen didn't come up with answers to alternative viewing, but it has, and that bodes well for shareholders and investors in the years ahead.Even though the ""What Consumers Watch"" unit only accounted for 37% of revenues in the most recent quarter, it doesn't take away from this segment being the most important, as everything else in the company builds out from it.And now that it announced it will measure digital viewing, it covers just about all the content that is available to consumers. Media companies and advertisers will get the most accurate picture of the audiences watching video content as there has been since the disruptive technologies changed the viewing habits of consumers.Digital MetricsMeasuring digital viewing has been the long-awaited missing piece of the video metric puzzle, and now Nielsen will start measuring viewing on mobile devices, DVRs, and televisions connected to the Internet.This will expand the moat of Nielsen, making it even more difficult to compete against and be dislodged by competitors.The reason for that is the overall entertainment industry has made it known in the past that it would prefer to have a one-stop shop if it can, and with digital metrics soon to be available, Nielsen has now become the company offering that service.How it will work is Nielsen will provide a software developer kit (SDK) to content providers in the middle of November, 2013. The kit will allow Nielsen to determine where videos were viewed from and how many times they were viewed.International GrowthWhat's interesting and important concerning Nielsen is it won't matter too much how the macro-economic situation plays out around the world, especially as it looked at country-by-country.So while slowing growth at a cursory glance may look very challenging and negative for Nielsen, it in fact has so little international penetration in many markets, that the markets are essentially there for the taking and growth even if the overall global or local economies slow down.That suggests continuing growth at a consistent pace for a number of years no matter what happens. Even in a recession, there will be growth if no one is providing the type of and quality of metrics and data Nielsen provides in a particular part of the world.At this time, Nielsen is expanding globally at just under an 8% pace.ConclusionNielsen may be one of the more underrated monopolies in the business world, and year after year it shows it has no competitors that can meaningfully penetrate its core business.That and the fact it is taking its expertise and starting to expand across the world points to a compelling and long-term success story that investors need to seriously consider.The bottom line is no one is going to take Nielsen's video metric business away from it. Since the rest of its business builds off of its ""What Consumers Watch"" segment, this is a powerful position the company can defend and expand over the long haul.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1735392,23478,2013-10-08T20:20:04-04:00,,"By Dee GillHere's a potentially lucrative project for an entrepreneurial techie: figure out a simple way to track the number of people watching ""Breaking Bad"" or ""Insidious"" on their smartphones and iPads. There are just loads of cable companies, content providers and advertisers that would pay big money for the data.Nielsen (NYSE:NLSN) should have had this down by now, having been named the god of program ratings years ago for its ability to quantify the number of television viewers for any given show. Nielsen did announce recently plans to incorporate, eventually, some mobile viewers in its ratings. But it sounds like Nielsen might be missing the bigger opportunity here, and it's a company that could clearly use some growth.NLSN Revenue Quarterly YoY Growth data by YChartsNielsen has ignored streamed viewership mainly because its mission focuses on giving customers information to determine advertising rates. You can stream a television program from Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) or Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) without seeing any ads at all. Its new ratings won't consider viewership from those places either, but they will track viewing on devices by people using Time Warner Cable's (TWC) smartphone app, for example, where viewers get the ads too. To say it's limited is an understatement.Content makers and cable companies would like to know how many people stream their shows, old or otherwise so they can better price advertising and licensing agreements. Advertisers would like to reach these streaming people too, but have no idea of the size of this market or its habits yet. Everyone is still trying to figure out what kind of advertising works best on devices, and some hard numbers on what people watch as they try different things would be most appreciated. So right there, you have massive companies ranging from CBS (CBS), Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) to PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) as potential customers for the new databank.CBS Market Cap data by YChartsContent providers already get data for streaming viewership by show in a piecemeal way. Netflix, for example, can tell CBS how many people streamed each episode of ""Dexter"", as could Google Play or other streaming services. The missing element is collective data that quantifies viewership per program across streaming sources, ideally in a way that Nielsen could easily incorporate in its traditional ratings. As Eric Solomon, Nielsen's senior VP of global audience told Variety Magazine: ""Networks are starving for a number they can publish that really represents their audience not just on TV but across all platforms.""Really, what all these companies want is one big number that shows viewership across all platforms, including those TV watchers that Nielsen so consistently tracks. But a mobile tracking app will do for now. (Just think of the buyout opportunities if Nielsen really wants in after all.) Oh, and there's time. Even Nielsen's limited mobile viewership numbers won't come out until fall of 2014.Meanwhile, Nielsen has slightly outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year. But trading at a PE ratio of more than 20, it's a stock that seems vulnerable to a disruptive competitor.NLSN data by YChartsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1443691,47521,2013-05-17T11:51:07-04:00,,"In response to growing dissatisfaction from major networks ABC (NYSE:DIS), CBS (CBS), Fox (NASDAQ:NWSA) and NBC (NASDAQ:CMCSA), as well as smaller content providers, Nielsen Holdings NV (NYSE:NLSN) has started to track Internet audiences, which use a variety of devices to consume media.When considering the unenviable task, almost immediately challenges are encountered, as Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) use metrics which don't work for television. That means YouTube and Facebook won't be able to be counted by Nielsen at this time. The new streaming initiative from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is another factor in the mix.When two of the most-visited web properties can't be measured, it reveals the daunting challenge faced by Nielsen. Add to that the fact children 12 and under aren't supposed to sign up for Facebook, and it leaves out important data for network and cable television serving that market. It really is a mess. It does make one wonder why the networks didn't think of this when putting deals together for Internet streaming.How Much of the Audience is Not Being Counted?The question of how many viewers are actually being lost by the networks is becoming more and more important, as the latest data show that with the exception of CBS, which has had a slight uptick of 1.5 percent in viewers, in-home TV viewership has been shown to be dropping.NBC and ABC are both down by over 6 percent, while the number of Fox viewers has plummeted by about 20 percent, according to Nielsen data. The data are as of May 5.According to WPP Plc's managing partner of the company's media buying arm GroupM, Lyle Schwartz, accurately measuring online viewers would boost TV rating anywhere from 3 percent to 12 percent.To me, this 3 percent to 12 percent range represents the problem associated with the uncertainty surrounding lack of reliable online viewing numbers. That range is just too wide to understand the extent of the problem. For now, all that is known is that a growing number of people are using alternative screens to consume media.Those numbers will continue to grow, but until Internet viewing can be accurately tracked, the value of the growth will be limited for media companies.Advertisers are still holding back on placing ads against online video content, although it has started to grow significantly. For 2013, EMarketer Inc. says that online ad spend will jump by 41 percent to $4.14 billion. That represents close to 6 percent of the regular TV market.WPP, which is the largest advertising company in the world, said in its annual report that it continues to ""overspend on legacy media."" The report asserted the Internet now accounts for about 30 percent of media consumption on a daily basis for people. Advertisers use about 20 percent of their budgets on digital markets.Expectations are when the problems are solved, those numbers will change dramatically.For the major networks, ad spend is expected to drop by 2 percent in 2013, according to ZenithOptimedia, a research unit of Publicis Groupe SA. On the other hand, aggregate TV advertising, which would include cable, is projected to grow by 2.8 percent to $63.9 billion for the year.Nielsen's ResponseStarting about 18 months ago, Nielsen introduced a new program that measures viewers who are watching shows streamed from the websites of some of the networks.The ratings agency has recently started following the number of people using mobile apps to watch video. It also announced a few days ago it was beginning to measure ads for ABC shows playing on mobile apps and websites.Networks participating in the new program measuring video streamed from the websites of the companies are ABC, CBS, The CW, FOX, NBC and Univision, among others.Several years ago, I used to cover the business side of the entertainment industry. Having not followed it after going on to other things, I was quite surprised to find out the same problems talked about back then on the growing usage of the Internet as a viewing choice, has still yet to be solved.When taken as a whole, it's not an easy task to accomplish, but to me, some of these things like measuring those viewing shows on the websites of networks should have already been in place.That is close to being solved, but it could be a couple of years, or even more, before the problem is totally resolved. Tracking an important outlet like YouTube hasn't even been started.While all this is going on, networks and cable companies don't believe they are being sufficiently rewarded for their efforts in responding to the growing demand for options in consuming the content they offer.The good news is the ""Nielsen Digital Program Ratings"" pilot system has been initiated, and the test will be run from May through June. A number of the larger networks are participating in that. Nielsen must feel pretty confident about the new system, because it has announced it will offer a commercial version later in 2013.That will provide some relief to content providers, but the challenge of the major digital destinations of YouTube, Facebook, and other highly-trafficked destinations remain to be solved. This is why it could be several years before it's all in place.I say that because even if the systems are ready, the way the industry operates is it sells most of its ad space once a year. So if Nielsen successfully implements a new program, it has a lag of at least one season, and advertisers may want to see a couple of seasons of data before having confidence that what they are seeing is reflective of the reality of the viewing numbers.Value of a Digital ViewerOne of the elements that is of extreme importance in the digital viewing narrative is the quality of an online viewer.In the past that was one of the biggest issues; even bigger than measuring the viewers. That's because it was questionable as to whether or not online viewers were worth the effort. Some of that, at the time, was because the market was in its infancy. Much of the problem was the burgeoning piracy issue, which has been slowing down as media provide more viewing options in response to consumer demands.Another problem that is growing concerning the value of a digital viewer is engagement. This is especially true with mobile devices; smartphones in particular. If someone is watching a show on a smartphone, the question arises as to what the social circumstances are that would require a person to view a show on a phone.Divided interests are the issue there, and that hasn't been lost on the industry. The smaller and more portable a screen is, the more the value of the person consuming the media is suspect as to the quality of engagement. I'm only talking within the parameters of actually watching a show on a smartphone.Obviously, other factors like watching a TV show that offers an opportunity to vote for favorites using a mobile device, is highly engaging. Networks have worked on making mobile viewing more engaging by providing options for viewers to check things out while watching the show. Marketers are doing the same with ads.What remains to be seen is once the data is accurately measured, is whether or not viewers using other screens are considered as valuable as those watching on TV sets at home.It could result in a metric of a tiered quality of viewers, with different pricing points for each tier.If that were to happen, I would think it would go from smaller devices to larger devices, with the smaller devices commanding less advertising dollars per viewer.Measuring AdsThe good news in the emerging media consumption markets are the fact that many consumers view advertising across more than one platform. Called 'frequency targeting' in the industry, it means the more times a consumer sees an ad, the probability of the consumer acquiring a product or service increases.In the new digital media world, this will make advertising even more effective; the reason why it's imperative to content providers and marketers to get accurate digital data.From the marketing perspective, it offers enormous potential to company growth for those placing ads against video content, along with an increase in revenue to the many companies producing content. It's a win/win for everyone. That's why Nielsen has been under increasing pressure to figure it all out.Consequently, it's not just about maintaining the status quo, but an opportunity to create wealth.The monopoly Nielsen has with the networks has provided it with a lot of time to respond to the changing media consumption habits of consumers. Yet relatively new competitors like Unicorn Media Inc. are emerging, which in the case of Unicorn, has resulted in networks using it to track the exact number of people watching ads on their web properties. The Weather Channel and ABC are two companies using Unicorn. This should give some added impetus for Nielsen to get more of a sense of urgency in tracking digital viewing habits of consumers.Video Consumption RebalancingThe next thing to consider as to the change in video viewing habits, is whether or not a new market is really being created, or consumers are simply using alternative screens to consume content.As with everything in the existing environment, it's not as simple as it may appear.With network TV - as least in developed nations - it's unlikely that content is being consumed more. Consumers have simply migrated from the TV set in their homes to an alternative screen. It's not much more than that. So this isn't much of a growth area in that regard for traditional media companies, it's more of a maintenance of the metrics of the viewing habits of existing consumers.This could be very different in emerging markets with a growing middle class, where a mobile device may be the primary way they consume media. There we have the question arise again as to the quality of the value of the viewer to an advertiser.Implication for NielsenThis appears to be a terrific opportunity for Nielsen over the next couple of years. It looks like the way this is playing out, it'll work on one aspect of the digital metrics at a time, resulting in periodic announcements of solving a problem and introducing the new service into the marketplace.That suggests we could see the share price of Nielsen continue to move up over the next two or three years. It must be taken into account when this two-to-three-year time period is asserted, that Nielsen will take that long to test, solve, and implement new systems.Nielsen has been performing very well over the last year, and barring some unforeseen event, such as a competitor leapfrogging it by being accepted as an alternative by the media companies, Nielsen should enjoy some solid growth for several years.Six-Month Chart1-Year ChartIt appears the company will maintain its monopoly position, with a solid moat to protect it against competition. The moat is its embedded system measuring metrics of the TV audience in the home. At this time, networks and cable prefer to have Nielsen conquer the problem and keep the business all under one roof. I don't see that changing unless Nielsen were to totally drop the ball.This gives Nielsen time, pricing power, and a very predictable long-term future.The staggered release of new services, along with the accompanying good will for the company because it was able to successfully solve the digital metric issue, makes Nielsen a good growth story.Nielsen has a forward P/E of 14.58 and a return on equity of 5.65 percent. Profit margin for the company is 5.1 percent.Implication for Content ProvidersMedia companies have enjoyed a good year as well, with most of the share prices of the firms moving up nicely over the last year. They are looking for more revenue streams, with subscription services being the latest strategy there.Accurately tracking web audiences is required, so media companies are rewarded for providing alternative viewing options to its customers. Where the real growth in advertising will be for content providers is in the increase in the viewing of the same ad by consumers, which will result in a boost in consumer response in buying products. This could bring higher advertising premiums for the content providers - both with traditional and digital consumers - whose viewing habits expose them to the same ad more often.When all of this is in place, then it goes back to business as usual for the media sector, with the focus being on producing the type of content that will attract the quantity and quality of viewers. That is of course still the bottom line for media, but digital metrics must be solved so as clear as a picture of the health of the industry is provided.Here's a snapshot of the performance of the networks over the last year.CBS CorporationOver the last year, the share price of CBS has been in a range of $29.81 to $50.73. It has a market cap of 30.86 billion. The company is up 68 percent over the last 52 weeks.It has a forward P/E of 14.80 and a return on equity of 17.56 percent. The profit margin of the company is 11.54 percent.News Corp.In the last 52 weeks, News Corp. has traded in a range of $18.32 to $34.04. It has a market cap of $78.20 billion. Over the last 52 weeks, the company is up 72 percent.It has a forward P/E of 17.14 and a return on equity of 19.56 percent. The profit margin of News Corp. is 16.68 percent.Comcast CorporationThe share price of Comcast has operated in a range of $28.09 through $43.74 over the last year. It has a market cap of $114.30 billion. It is up 54.25 percent during that time.Comcast has a forward P/E of 15.67 and a return on equity of 14.21 percent. The profit margin of the media giant is 10.18 percent.The Walt Disney CompanyThe share price of Disney has moved in a range of $42.51 to $67.89 over the last 52 weeks. It has a market cap of $120.57 billion.Disney has a forward P/E of 17.01 and a return on equity of 15.43 percent. The profit margin of the entertainment conglomerate is 13.64 percent.ConclusionThe major networks and cable companies have been in a state of digital disruption for some time. Not only that, but the networks are under increasing pressure from cable channels, which have more specialized programming, with the cable companies themselves being under pressure from the growing demand from consumers for a la carte programming choices.This also puts enormous pressure on cable providers, which continue to resist a la carte programming options. U.S. Senator John McCain just introduced a bill addressing the issue.As for the impact of accurate digital metrics, it is being tackled one issue at a time by Nielsen, and is especially positive for the company, because it will provide more revenue from the new systems put in place, and since it'll take at least a couple of years (and probably more) to get things sorted out, this will provide solid growth for some time.Questions concerning online content providers like YouTube, Hulu, and Amazon.com remain to be answered, as well as how long it'll take to introduce a system that can track them by Nielsen.For the content providers, the value there will be the ability to measure the number of times consumers view an ad across several platforms. This results in higher product and services purchased by consumers, which will translate into better pricing power for the industry.When all is said and done, the inclusion of accurate digital metrics won't change the numbers of viewers of TV shows, it'll simply reflect the way people are consuming media across a variety of screens.The game will still be those that produce the best content, and that won't change at all in the years ahead. After all, people must view content and ads for the benefits of the new metrics to kick in.As I see it, it's the metrics associated with smartphones and notebooks that will be the most important for the industry, with laptops and desktop metrics being less important as we go forward. This is because the more desirable younger demographic uses those devices more than older viewers.Other devices like game consoles don't appear as important, as that's connected to in-home media consumption.The networks and advertisers will benefit from more accurate digital media metrics, but to me the biggest winner by far will be Nielsen.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Shares of Arbitron rose 23.6% in a reaction to the deal, still trading 2.0% below the $48 offer.The DealNielsen announced that it will acquire Arbitron, in a deal valuing the firm at $1.28 billion. Nielsen has signed a definitive agreement to acquire the international media and marketing research firm for $48 per share in cash. The deal represents a 26% premium compared to Monday's closing price.For its full year of 2011, Arbitron generated revenues of $422.3 million. The company net earned $53.3 million for that year.The $1.28 billion deal values operating assets of the firm around $1.25 billion given Arbitron's roughly $37 million in cash and equivalents. The deal values the firm at 3.0 times annual revenues and roughly 23-24 times annual earnings.As a result of the deal, Nielsen expects to increase earnings by $0.13 per share in the first year after closing the deal. The transaction is expected to be accretive by $0.19 per share in the year thereafter. Nielsen expects to achieve cost synergies of $20 million as a result of the deal.Nielsen has already received a financing commitment for the transaction. The deal has been approved by the boards of both companies, and is subject to customary closing conditions, including a regulatory review.ValuationNielsen ended its third quarter with $325 million in cash and equivalents. The company operates with $6.7 billion in short and long term debt, for a net debt position of roughly $6.4 billion.For the first nine months of 2012, Nielsen generated revenues of $4.15 billion. The company reported a net profit of $234 million, or $0.64 per diluted share. The company is on track to generate full year revenues of $5.5 billion, on which the company could earn $300-$320 million.The market currently values Nielsen at roughly $11.2 billion. This values the firm at 2.7 times annual revenues and roughly 36 times annual earnings.Given the sizable net debt position, Nielsen does not pay a dividend at the moment.Some Historical PerspectiveYear to date, shares of Nielsen are trading roughly unchanged, trading with gains of some 4%. Shares started the year around $30 per share, falling to lows of $25 in July. Shares recovered, currently exchanging hands at $31 per share.Between 2008 and 2012, Nielsen has increased annual revenues by some 15% from $4.8 billion in 2008 to an estimated $5.5 billion this year. The company reported large losses in recent years, being owned by private equity firms. The company continues to improve profitability as it repaid some of its debt.Investment ThesisShares of Nielsen went public in January of 2011. At the time, shares of the company were offered at $23 per share, in the $1.75 billion public offering. Dutch-based publisher VNU acquired Nielsen in 1999. That company was acquired in 2006 by a consortium of private equity firms including KKR (KKR), Blackstone Group LP (BX) and the Carlyle Group (CG), among others. They offered shares of Nielsen again five years later.The deal seems rather favorable. The acquisition of Arbitron will boost annual revenues by some 8%, and profits by an even greater percentage.The deal values Arbitron at 3.0 times 2011s annual revenues, which is in line with the company's own valuation of 2.7 times 2012s annual revenues.The transaction values Arbitron at 23-24 times annual earnings which looks favorable to Nielsen's own valuation of 36 times earnings. Nielsen's earnings are depressed as a result of high interest payments given the sizable debt position with which the company operates. These multiples exclude the beneficial impact of estimated annual cost synergies of $20 million.Nielsen made an excellent deal at a fair price. Yet I remain on the sidelines. The company is still dragging along a sizable net debt position which is an inheritance of being owned by the private-equity consortium in recent years.Big data is a big theme in the future as companies learn to use their data to better serve their customers. Marketing and industry research offered by Nielsen will remain important. I remain on the sidelines given the overall high valuation of the firm, the high debt load and lack of dividends.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

269507,20097,2011-05-12T08:06:19-04:00,,"One of the core tenets of the internet, internet media and internet advertising is that everything is measurable. Advertising and targeting users has become a data-driven science, and businesses are more efficient because of it. Wix (A Benchmark company) for example, tweaks the time, text and offers in its email marketing based on detailed conversion analytics gathered every minute, optimizing marketing at an incredible frequency.What I find surprising therefore, is the disparity in data that we accept from internet measurement companies.Fundamentally, there are two ways to measure internet traffic and engagement: sampling and real data (which requires pixel placement). Sampling was the state-of-the-art measurement for TV and radio, because that was truly all that was technically feasible. Nielsen (NYSE:NLSN) built an enormous business out of sampling audiences for TV, retail shopping and anything else that needed to be measured. The question is: Why should we settle for sampling in the internet era when everything can be measured?On the web, Compete.com uses sampling data from ISPs and Alexa uses Alexa toolbar data which is necessarily skewed by who installs the toolbar.This is how Compete describes its data collection methodology:By contrast, Quantcast uses a pixel to accumulate real full data. From Quantcast's methodology:Using Seeking Alpha (A Benchmark company), you can see a clear example of discrepancies in unique users between real measurement (Quantcast for Seeking Alpha) and sampling (Compete.com for Seeking Alpha)Compete.Com estimates that Seeking Alpha has 1.8MM uniques per month:Quantcast puts Seeking Alpha's U.S. user number at 3.9MM uniques per month:Quantcast, using a pixel on Seeking Alpha's site, measures more than double the U.S. users for Seeking Alpha than Compete measures using its sampling data, and also suggests a significantly larger growth curve.But let's dig more. Most of the Alexa data is relative (that is relative to other sites), so it is hard to find apples-to-apples comparisons. But Alexa's estimates on Seeking Alpha's U.S. vs. International traffic vary pretty widely from Quantcast.Alexa estimates that 67% of Seeking Alpha's users are in the U.S.:Quantcast knows that almost 83% of Seeking Alpha's users are in the U.S.:I would love to compare Page Views (PV) and Page Views Per Visit (PPV) between Quantcast and Compete, but I could not bring myself to pay the premium membership for the sampling data at Compete. Contrasting Alexa data and Quantcast data, you can see an almost 100% discrepancy in Page Views Per Visit when looking at the Seeking Alpha data:Alexa estimates that Seeking Alpha's Daily PPV per user is under 3:Quantcast knows that Seeking Alpha's Daily PPV per user is around 8:As I started perusing these sites, I found a few nuggets interesting. First of all, you are not required to publish your Quantcast data publicly, but it does provide a measure of transparency that is reassuring to readers, partners and advertisers. For example, I tried looking up Techcrunch on Quantcast but the Data was hidden by the owner. The Compete.com data for TechCrunch showed a slide in users, but my assumption is that were we to have the real data, we would see a similar reversal to what Seeking Alpha showed. Huffington Post is available on both Compete and Quantcast, with Compete showing almost a 10% drop before the recent rise, and Quantcast showing only up and to the right (I assume the big spike in traffic is Osama Bin Laden driven).I think the conclusions are pretty clear as to the advantages of direct measurement, yet many entrepreneurs who come pitch us quote the Alexa data in particular very frequently.As investors and users begin not tolerating measurement methods that are sample-based or estimated, and as more of media moves to IP based systems such as IP TV and internet radio, those measurement companies using sample and panel based methods could begin losing market share. This has real implications for Nielsen and its decades-long market leadership in sample based measurement. The skill set and methodologies for real time and real data approaches are different both in terms of technology and cost structure than sample-based methods, and offers an opportunity for disruption in the value chain.`"

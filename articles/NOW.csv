4382599,103480,2020-10-29T12:30:00-04:00,"ServiceNow posted a far better-than-expected third quarter, with subscription billings remaining far above what the company had initially guided to.
        Instead of decelerating billings in Q3 as ServiceNow originally guided to, a combination of favorable currency impacts, longer contract durations, and strong sales helped maintain strong growth.
        The company has also dramatically boosted its free cash flows.
        The only factor holding ServiceNow back is an expensive valuation, but top-notch results do justify a premium.","Under the leadership of former SAP (SAP) chief Bill McDermott, ServiceNow (NOW) is marching constantly to new heights. The stock, already up ~65% year-to-date and trading just inches from its all-time highs, has ridden on a wave of strong fundamentals as ServiceNow plows ahead on its target of becoming a $10 billion company (twice its current size) within the next few years. Already one of the largest pure-play enterprise software companies in the market (slightly larger than Workday (WDAY), and really only behind Salesforce.com (CRM)), ServiceNow has already cemented itself as a foundational piece of software that has become critical in enterprise workflows. The company's technology, classified as ""IT Service Management"" (ITSM), helps companies design the process flows that lead to smooth service delivery (applicable not just to IT, but to use cases like customer service as well). Just this month, ServiceNow was recognized for the seventh year in a row as the leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant in the ITSM space (as software investors are aware, this is among the most coveted designations to earn as an enterprise software company).The company also just posted strong third-quarter results that averted a steep deceleration in billings that the company had guided to last quarter. Under its new leadership, ServiceNow has adopted the tried-and-true policy of ""underpromise and overdeliver,"" that has led to a string of beat-and-raise quarters.Last quarter, I cited a neutral opinion on ServiceNow, at the time weighing strong year-to-date results against the company's deceleration warnings plus a stretched valuation. ServiceNow's stretched valuation has not gone away - in fact, trading just a few percentage points away from its all time highs, ServiceNow's valuation multiple has expanded even slightly further over the past few months. At current share prices just shy of $500, ServiceNow boasts a $92.84 billion market cap and a $90.33 billion enterprise value, arrived at after netting off $4.21 billion of cash and $1.71 billion of debt from ServiceNow's most recent balance sheet. This represents a hefty 16.5x EV/FY21 revenue multiple versus Wall Street's FY21 revenue expectations of $5.49 billion (+24% y/y), slightly more expensive than most other ~25-30% growers in the SaaS space.Still - given that ServiceNow has kept up its growth pace and avoided the deceleration it hinted at in Q2, I'm more keen to see the bullish side of the ServiceNow trade:I'm still put off by ServiceNow's rich valuation multiple, but at the same time I can't argue with the company's incredibly consistent performance amid a pandemic that has damaged many other enterprise software companies, plus the company's already rich profitability/cash flow profile. The bottom line here: I think ServiceNow's promising third-quarter sales momentum gives me confidence to dip my toes in this stock, but I wouldn't take a gung-ho approach on this name in case the market turns south and sentiment against richly valued growth stocks sours.Let's discuss in further detail ServiceNow's outperformance in Q3 versus the rather dim expectations it laid out in Q2. The chart below, taken from ServiceNow's most recent earnings deck, does a good job at laying out the drivers that spurred the beat:Figure 1. ServiceNow Q3 topline results vs. guidanceSource: ServiceNow Q3 earnings deckRecall that ServiceNow initially guided to 16% y/y growth in subscription billings for Q3. Like for most SaaS companies, investors most closely watch billings rather than revenue because billings represents a longer-term view of a company's sales traction and deals signed, rather than simply the revenue that is recognized in a single quarter. When ServiceNow initially guided for billings to fall to the mid-teens, the stock took a hit as it represented a steep deceleration from Q2's 25% y/y billings growth rate - which would have been a leading indicator for revenue growth, and of course eventually profit expansion, to slow down as well.This ended up not happening. As seen in the chart above, ServiceNow clocked in at $1.08 billion of subscription billings, $76 million above its guidance - driven slightly by favorable FX movements and slightly as well by elongated contract terms, but mostly by stronger-than-expected sales traction that made up ~70% of the quarter's beat. We note as well that from a total revenue standpoint, ServiceNow's $1.15 billion in revenue (+30% y/y) beat Wall Street's expectations of $1.12 billion (+27% y/y) by a respectable three-point margin. This beat is an indication that the pandemic has done little to hamper demand for ServiceNow's product. Amid the pandemic, companies have had to make sure delivery of services like remote IT or customer care are executed perfectly, so the coronavirus was no excuse to stop investing in operationally-critical platforms like ServiceNow. As can be seen in the chart below, ServiceNow's 25% y/y billings growth rate in Q3 matched the growth rate in Q2, and ServiceNow is additionally expecting subscription billings growth rates to lift one point to 26% y/y growth in Q4. That's certainly a much better story than ServiceNow was serving up at the end of Q2. Figure 2. ServiceNow growth trendsSource: ServiceNow Q3 earnings deckThere are a couple of other bullish trends to pick out. One is on contract durations, which I had already mentioned as being a slight contributor to the Q3 beat. Some context here is useful to note: many other software companies have seen contract durations shrink versus prior-year levels during the coronavirus. This is because, of the deals that sales teams are still managing to close, companies are being more cautious in committing to long-term expenses and have generally tried to rein in spending. This was not true of ServiceNow, at least for current clients. While ServiceNow's new customers signed on for an average of 31.5 months (about two and a half years), versus 34.7 months in the prior-year Q3, renewal customers (those who sign up for the same value) expanded to 21.9 months (up from 21.3 months) and expansion customers (customers who add seats or add products, and one fo the most important sources of growth) saw a tremendous expansion to 28.2 months, up from 25.7 in the year-ago Q3. This is an expression of confidence from ServiceNow's existing clients that the Now Platform is a critical part of their business operations that can't be skimped on, no matter what the current environment. Figure 3. ServiceNow contract trendsSource: ServiceNow Q3 earnings deckServiceNow also saw a sizable increase in the number of customers who have expanded their annual business with ServiceNow to over >$1 million per year. For the first time, ServiceNow's large >$1 million customers crossed the 1k mark, adding 45 net-new large customers in Q3 - more than 33 adds in Q2, and more than 42 in the prior-year Q3.Figure 4. ServiceNow large deal trendsSource: ServiceNow Q3 earnings deckServiceNow's strengths didn't just lie in its strong growth, however. The remote-work environment, cancellation of customer events and the stoppage of traveling sales teams have helped ServiceNow to push down its expense profile. This helped ServiceNow to bring down its sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue to 32% on a pro forma basis (excluding stock comp), down from a more typical rate in the high-30s. This helped ServiceNow push its pro forma operating margin to 26.0%, 400bps above the 22.0% it laid out in guidance and 370bps above Wall Street's consensus. We note that ServiceNow's ""rule of 40 score"", adding together its 26% operating margin to the current quarter's 30% revenue growth, yields a score of 56 - far above most other software companies, and another reason why ServiceNow's premium may be justified. For comparison - in its most recent quarter, Salesforce.com (CRM), which I consider the be the closest at-scale comp to ServiceNow, generated a ~20% pro forma operating margin, while its guidance for Q3 (the first quarter that its growth rate will fully comp the prior-year acquisition of Tableau) clocks in at 16% y/y. So not only is ServiceNow organically growing at a faster pace than Salesforce, but its profitability profile is richer as well.Similarly, ServiceNow has continued to deliver impressive cash flows - year to date, FCF has risen an astounding 41% y/y to $884.3 million, with YTD FCF margins of 27% rising two points from the prior-year period. Figure 5. ServiceNow FCF trendsSource: ServiceNow Q3 earnings deckServiceNow's ability to generate >$1 billion in annual FCF, plus its current ~$2.5 billion net cash balances plus a lofty stock price, give the company plenty of firepower to pursue a ""growth by acquisitions"" strategy which is very typical of SaaS companies that have reached its scale, if it so chose.After seeing the strength of ServiceNow's latest results and its terrific execution amid the pandemic (especially its ability to continue expanding profitability and FCF margins while keeping billings growth rates steady), I'm giving in to the bullish trend on this stock. While an expensive valuation still keeps me wary on ServiceNow's overall upside, I think the stock is worth a nibble, especially on any near-term macro dips that aren't driven by any ServiceNow-specific news."
4380616,105447,2020-10-22T13:45:27-04:00,"This week's Alpha Trader podcast features hosts Aaron Task and Stephen Alpher talking (mostly) tech with Jon Markman, founder and president of Markman Capital Insight.Big picture: Going back about 80 years, whenever the Fed steps in to put the brakes on a bear market, one should expect the averages to go up five times over the following ten years.Markman defines digital transformation as the use of data and software to build new business models. Think of Netflix, whose stock is up about 15,000% over the past 20 years as it moved from mail-order DVDs to offering bits of data in the cloud. This revolution has another 10-20 years left in it, and those companies leading and benefitting will offer vast rewards to their shareholders.","Editors' note: This is a transcript version of the episode of Alpha Trader that we published earlier this week. We hope you enjoy.Aaron Task: Welcome to Alpha Trader. We are two weeks away from the election and in the thick of earnings season and maybe there's going to be a fiscal stimulus package and maybe not. In the meantime, we are joined today by a very special guest. Jon Markman is President and Founder of Markman Capital Insight, which is an independent investment research publisher. He's the publisher and author of the Strategic Advantage newsletter and which is featured on Forbes under the name Fast Forward Investing, which is also the name of one of his several books on investing. Jon, welcome to Alpha Trader.Jon Markman: Hey, it's great to be here. Thanks for inviting me.AT: It is great to have you here. As we really get into the thick of earnings season this week, because you are a stock picker, I want to talk about individual stocks with you, but want to get your big picture. As I mentioned, there's so many macro things that the market seems to be hanging on right now; the election, obviously, COVID and the case numbers creeping up, the fiscal stimulus talk, it seems like on a given day that's what's moving the market. What do you think about from a big picture perspective about the market right here?JM: Sure. Well, in terms of the big picture, what we have to remember is that earlier this year, the COVID crisis thrust the market into a bear market for a short period of time and into a recession. And the bear market ended essentially at March 23 when the Federal Reserve announced that it [would backstop] the bond market and basically, reduced interest rates to zero for an extended period of time. The market turned around there, and a new bull market started, and a new economic cycle started. Generally speaking, for the last, you know, 80 years, when the Fed has intervened to stop a bear market, the market has proceeded to go up by five times in the next 10 years.AT: 5x.Stephen Alpher: Okay.JM: 5x. So that happened in 2009, and it happened in the 1982. It's a very common occurrence. So, I think the big picture is that no matter what happens in the days and weeks ahead, I think we can be have some measure of certainty that the Dow will be up 5x over the next five years. So, talking like 91,000 in 2025.AT: Right, so it's going to be – so you are talking about Dow 90,000 plus. That's an extremely bullish…SA: Yeah, I have to write that down. Hold on.AT: Yeah.JM: And, you know, for the NASDAQ, for those of you who follow NASDAQ, NASDAQ was [6,771], I think at the low. So, we're looking at NASDAQ 33,855. Now, this sounds kind of extreme, but I did this exact thing after the 2009 debacle. And I announced a target for the [S&P 500 or 3,330]. And you know, we got there late last year.AT: Right. So that was 5x from the low of 666.JM: Right. And the – in the he Dow – and then NASDAQ was up a multiple of that. I think it was about 7x instead of 5x.AT: Right. So that's very interesting for a lot of reasons. Because, you know, Stephen and I have – one of the themes of this podcast has been, you know, there has been a lot of analogies or comparisons to the late 1990s. So, it sounds like, you know, if that analogy is holding, then we're in like, 1995 or 1996. Like, we haven't really gotten started yet.JM: I would say more like 2009, like late 2009.AT: Okay.JM: Following the financial – great financial crisis, because I was in a crisis in which the Fed intervene to the extent that – and to an extent, similar to what it did this time, although this time was even more so. I mean, the Feds never committed to the interest rate at a basically zero bound for the next two years ever, in its history never has done it. And so when you combine that with the fiscal stimulus we already had, plus this fiscal stimulus is coming, and I think that investors should stop worrying about the small picture and just – the big picture, and just focus on the individual stocks in sectors that they want to be involved in as this bull market rolls on.AT: So, we will get to those and I just want to be clear, and we try to be apolitical on the show, but it sounds like you're saying it doesn't matter the outcome of the election at this point.JM: I would say it doesn't matter from an investor's perspective. I mean, the market is obviously all in on a Biden victory, and the democrats flipping the senate. Markets been very low – has had a very low volatility, where the VIX is really subdued, there's no expectation of a gigantic calamity happening, you know, in November. So, I think people need to put their fears away and just get on with the work of identifying good companies run by good managers and good niches.SA: And just to clarify, while you're saying that the Dow, the NASDAQ, the S&P are going to be several multiples higher several years from now, it doesn't mean we can't get some pretty sizable or brutal kind of bear moves in between.JM: Yeah, I mean, even in a bull market, you're going to have, we have 15% to 19% declines from, you know, from time-to-time, over some crisis that we're not even aware of, you know, when you look back, and you look at the things, the ways that the market got sidelined, between 2009 and today, you can't even remember the details of most of them, but they seem so important at the time. You know, like, you know, the European financial crisis.AT: Exactly. That's the first thing that came to mind for me, like it was such a big deal, at least, you know, in the financial news, but for the markets, you know, pretty much on the screen.JM: Remember the Greek debt crisis?AT: Absolutely.JM: I mean, every single day on our screens, we were talking about the Greek debt crisis, and suddenly it just went away, as the President says, like, things go away.AT: The pigs, I mean, it was all about the pigs. Right?SA: Right. Sure.JM: Yeah. And, you know, from time-to-time there's going to be these missteps with the market, but generally speaking, when the Fed has flooded the zone with as much money as it has, it has to go somewhere. And generally, it goes into the most speculative areas first, before it seeps down into industry. And when I say the most, you know, Walter Wriston, the former head of CEO Citibank said, money goes where it is most wanted and stays where it is best treated. And as generally the stock market at the beginning of these upturns.SA: I know a lot of the stocks you're picking are about technological disruption and such, but given kind of the flood of money out there, do you have any interest in kind of what have previously been underperforming sectors, like energy, financials?JM: I'm kind of interested in the energy sector. The energy is down 50% since from last year, which is unbelievable, in a lot of ways. And I'm interested in the industrials and the, sorry the financials. But they've been afforded at every turn, every time we think that the value stocks and energy and banking are going to turn around and start to move higher they get slammed by the sellers. So, I would say less interested in energy and banking until I can pull out of their bear market – their sideways move and be much more interested in technology.You know, I think that people, a lot of investors are – they're worried about valuations, they're worried about the election, but they're missing the bigger picture. The digital transformation that I've been talking about in my letters, in my columns, is the biggest most investable trend in our generation. Digital transformation is just getting started. It's going to happen, regardless of valuations, it's going to happen regardless of elections. And any market weakness that you see is an opportunity to buy these companies that you know, lower prices, because they're not going to stay lower for long.AT: So, let's talk a bit more about that digital transformation. And it's, you know, in Fast Forward Investing, your most recent book, I know that was the theme of the book, but what's different or new about it today than back in, again the late 1990s, when we were talking about how the internet was going to change everything, you know, is this – is it the same thing all the Fast Forward 20 years or is it something different from that?JM: No, it is very much the same thing. Digital transformation is the use of data and software to build new business models. That's all it is. The use of data and software to build new business models, and it's possible because cloud computing made data processing relatively portable and inexpensive. And it also made large scale permanent data storage viable. So, here's a great example. Look at the evolution of Netflix. It used to be a mail order DVD business, you know, you just filled out a form, mailed it to Netflix, and they send a physical DVD to you by mail. Remember those?AT: I do.JM: But the digital transformation turned the DVDs into an icon on your Smartphone, and now it's just a – instead of a hard disk, it's just bits of data stored away in the cloud. You tap the image on your phone and magically a movie emerges. There's no DVD, there's no player, there's no paper forms to fill out and mail away. Every step of the process has been transformed by a digital alternative. And that's really – just have to start with Netflix. Netflix is real businesses using predictive analytics to determine you know, produce and digitally to deliver content to you that's based on your interaction with its software.So, think about this, Netflix now has 192 million paying monthly customers. They've created a business worth $234 billion out of thin air, and that thin arrow was actually – that's kind of a cliché, but what's really happened is that they've harnessed the digital revolution to create a business is $234 billion. And the – or in the market its shares are up like 15,000% since they shifted online.AT: They should have been rewarded. And I will note Netflix, you know, one of the highlights of this week's earnings, you do have a position in Netflix on your Markman buy list. So, I'm curious if you have any specific thoughts about the earnings report and maybe more importantly, like, how do you approach earnings as a trader, especially in the name like Netflix, where you know, we're on, you've got some big paper games right now?JM: Yeah, I mean, I think this is a 10 years to 20 years theme, and I think that over the next 10 years, Amazon, for instance, will go from being a trillion dollar company to a $10 trillion company. So kind of like where you end up, where you end up buying a stock like that is kind of immaterial vis-à-vis just going ahead and understanding that this trend is happening and taking advantage of it. You have to realize that there are a lot of more – a lot more companies on this [Chucks] in Netflix there. You've got Peloton Interactive, reimagining the gym, and delivering and you've got companies like Schrodinger is delivering health care using digital tools. You know, I think that getting involved in these companies is more important than figuring out exactly what's the price is, what the right price is.AT: Just from like a portfolio management perspective, and I know you trade options as well, do you buy puts out of the money just in case something bad happens on earnings call? Are you just like these are core holdings and you're not going to play around with them?JM: My attitude is that these are core holdings, and I'm not going to play around with them. So, I do publish options, tune options, newsletters, and also features. So, I'm very attuned to the short-term picture. But in terms of this larger theme that we're talking about digital transformation, this is going to be going on for 20 years. You know, it's sort of like, Aaron, you know, when you and I used to working back in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and we said, there's going to be a mobile computing revolution, right? Remember that?AT: Yeah.JM: This was before YouTube was really popular and before, you know, you're prepared to get everything that you needed online. And how long has it taken for that vision to be fulfilled? It's been about 20 years. So, you know the companies that were the [hot] at the beginning of the digital content revolution are still hot today. And if you can't decide on which one to buy, I think, generally speaking, Visa and MasterCard are the way to go, because they're leveraged to both – to the economy, as well as to the digital revolution.AT: Wait, so why not PayPal, as opposed to use your MasterCard?SA: Or Square?JM: Yeah, I mean, Square and PayPal are both great companies and we have on them in the past, but in terms of like, if you just have to have one name that covers E-tail and the transformation of hard money into credit into software. And the two companies at the forefront of that revolution are MasterCard and Visa. MasterCard and Visa are a duopoly. Basically, there are no other companies that provide ATM and credit card transaction data to the scale that they do. So, those are two companies that are like just because I'm sure they're going to be around in 20 years.AT: A quick follow up there, Jon. What about Bitcoin? You know, do you have a thought on cryptocurrency more broadly, as [kind of] threat to the Visa’s and MasterCard’s of the world?JM: I try to get involved with cryptocurrency at the very beginning and I just couldn't get my head around it. And I still don't completely understand why it's valuable. So, I'll leave that to other people. You know, you can't be an expert in everything Aaron.SA: We try.AT: We try.JM: I'm much more interested in, you know, Peloton Interactive. I think they're a fascinating company. Peloton is known for its best-in-class stationary bikes and treadmills, but the company is really disrupting the physical gym experience with interactive virtual exercise instruction. And, you know, the public has really taken to – you have Peloton sales are up 99 – sales were up 99% in fiscal 2022 to almost $2 billion. And the shares are up about 360% since the beginning of the year. And that's a really interesting company as taking advantage of this sort of virtualization of our experiences.AT: Alright. We're going to come back and talk more about Peloton with Jon Markman. You're listening to Alpha Trader, we'll be right back.Take a deep dive into features to arm yourself with knowledge to expand your strategy with confidence. See what adding features can do for you at cmegroup.com/alpha.We're back with Jon Markman, author of the Strategic Advantage newsletter among many others. You can find it on Forbes and Fast Forward Investing. He also has Markman’s Strategic Options and Power Elite equity research services at Weiss. So Jon, just before the break, you mentioned Peloton and one of your recent commentary pieces you wrote some of our favorite names like Peloton are extremely overbought and likely to stall and as you just alluded to, it's had a phenomenal six plus months here certainly since the lows in March. So, what kind of stall or what are your concerns short-term about Peloton? Is it just a valuation call?JM: It's more of an overbought call. I'm not worried about the valuations, the valuations will take care of themselves. You know, with inflation low in a piece can be pretty high, and so I think that I'm not that worried about valuation per se in a high growth company like Peloton. I'm more worried about you know, some competitors coming in like Nordic Track and others, but Peloton has really built up, it's more than just a bike. Have you ever tried it Aaron, ever tried the vehicle?AT: I have not. I have not had the pleasure yet.JM: It's really quite remarkable. I got one a year ago and the bike itself is exceptional, very high quality, but what's really cool is the video, the he spin instructors are fantastic, very motivational, and they really keep you wanting to come back and do your work on the machine. You can get a you can get a – but I want to think of as – like an hour's gym workout in about half an hour on this bike. And the instructions are very motivational. I think they've just done a fantastic job of creating sort of, for one of a better word, the Netflix of gyms where it's a company that's completely dependent, and built on the digital experience, and disrupts the gym as an experience. But there's other companies I think that are less obvious.You ever checked out the company called The Trade Desk, TTD. It's a platform for real time buying and selling of digital Ad, Ad inventory. So, big clients bid for digital ads across connected TV platforms like Amazon Prime and most websites that are not owned by Facebook and Alphabet. What I mean by that is that most ads on the internet are served by Facebook and Alphabet, but all the ones that aren't those two are served through The Trade Desk. Sales were up 38% last year to [616 million]. And they're pulling back now, but they're still up 130% for the year.AT: Right. And I'm looking at the, your Markman Buy List and Trade Desk, you got into it in late April at around $225. You know, most recently it’s trading over 600, Europe 170% on that name. But if you want to go back to Peloton for the same reason, because you're on paper, at least you know your gains here are well over 500%. So, you know, again, are you doing anything to protect or lock in those gains given you just said, you think it's overbought on a short-term basis?JM: You know, I do think it's overbought. So, I think that people who were in it from the beginning from the IPO, etcetera can pair back their holdings, but I'm not really – I'm not – that's like my thing. I don't really get into people sculpting their portfolios. I just want to help them understand what the best companies are to invest in to take advantage of these themes. Does that makes sense? I'm not their financial manager or consultant. I just want to bring ideas to them that they may not have been aware of. Another company that I like a lot in the space, ServiceNow, symbol NOW. It operates in enterprise workflow platform, have you ever heard it?AT: Yeah.JM: They allow companies to easily monitor different parts of their business in real time and it also permits the integration with a lot of other software that – and legacy software that companies have. It's actually become the operating system in many large companies and some companies – those clients are so enamored with what they're doing, their subscription revenues, renewals average 97%. So, ServiceNow has done a tremendous job of digitizing the work desk in large companies, and I think it's a company that people ought to really be involved with.AT: Because, you know, you've got so many different potential ways people can find your stuff like for someone who's you know, just getting familiar with Jon Markman like what's the best way for them to find your work and follow some of these picks that you're talking about?JM: Sure. People can go visit my website markmancapital.net and sign up for a free two week trial of my Strategic Advantage newsletter, which comes out daily. People can also check out my column at TheStreet called, Markman On Tech.SA: I wanted to talk about another stock you wrote recently about one you own when there’s been a multi-bagger for you, that we've all heard of which is Zoom video, your most recent column say that that's looking a little overbought, they might face some challenges, you remain quite bullish on the name in the future. I'm kind of – I'm struck by the speed at which things move now. We were talking about Netflix earlier, and kind of how that's become a dominant name, you know across the globe really. 20 years as a public company up whatever, 13,000% or 15,000%. It's still just a $250 billion company. It has been a Public Company for a little while. It's already $170 billion company. Is the market so much bigger for Zoom than Netflix that we shouldn't be really paying attention to market caps?JM: Well, I think the Netflix piece of the story that I find fascinating is that every step along the way people would say, Disney is going to crush them.SA: That's right. Yeah.JM: Comcast is going to crush them.SA: Apple is going to crush them.JM: Apple is going to crush them. But you know, when you've got a really good idea, and you're able to prosecute that idea with a lot of focus, like the people at Netflix did, you can be successful. A little bit earlier in the year or last year, I was a little bit skeptical of Zoom, because, you know, there's a lot of competing products out there. Cisco has a great product. Microsoft has a great product called Skype.SA: Google has Google themes.JM: Google has Google Meet. And I'm like, you know, you got all these big sharks out there in the water, how is the Zoom Communications going to survive? But it turns out that they created and they operate this simplest video conferencing business in the enterprise world. You know, it's got a web interface that can have anybody zooming in seconds, including grandma, grandpa, and the kids. And you know, it's become an essential tool in the post-COVID world. It's partly because they were in the right place at the right time, it's probably because of luck. But they've done a great job of capitalizing on their luck. I'm just a little bit worried about Zoom going forward because they're moving into an area as they get bigger, where they're going to be competing with the Cisco's and Microsoft's of the world more directly, and I think that could slow and distract them. But for now, I'm a big Zoom fan.SA: And do you look at management's, obviously Zoom’s in the right place at the right time, right now, Peloton is in the right place at the right time right now. You know, how do we know that they've got, you know, they are [Reed Hastings] that's going to, you know, survive 20 years of challenges?JM: I mean, you don't know right? So, because we don't know, it's risky. And but risk is how you make money. If things were, we were certain about things, there would be no money to be made? Because everyone would have the same opinion, but…AT: Yes. And I remember when people were calling for Reed Hastings head when he did the Qwikster move. I guess that was about 15 years ago, maybe and Netflix was looking dead at that point. It looked like self inflicted wounds at that point. So that's a great point. We don’t know which of these, you know, newer younger manager or management teams are going to turn out to be the next Steve Jobs, Tim Cook at all.JM: Right. You have to keep in mind there has to be risk involved, otherwise it wouldn't pay.AT: Right.SA: Right.JM: You know, another company I think is really interesting in this space is Teladoc Health, you remember them. TDOC?AT: Yes.JM: This is an idea which was always on the calm, right. Everyone was thinking, telephone-based medicine that's the future people. People have been saying that since like the 1990s, the early 2000s, late 2000s. You know, it's like it was just never quite happened and it suddenly boomed. However this crisis in Teladoc Health becomes the largest telehealth platform in the United States. They operated video platform that connects healthcare professionals and doctors, psychologists, etcetera to their patients. And in my opinion, the strength of the Teladoc program is its contractual relationship with health insurers in large companies. Sales were up 32% to 535 million last year, or earlier this year and stocks are up 164% in 2020, but I think this is another one that you can buy on pullbacks, it doesn't really have a natural competitor.AT: Right. So yeah, so it sounds like – a lot of these things, Teladoc Health, Peloton, Zoom certainly you know, have benefited from the COVID panic or pandemic excuse me and panic. Is it your view though that if, you know if tomorrow they announced the vaccine, and we can all get back to “normal life”, how disruptive or not will that be to these companies?JM: Well, there's actually three things happening and talking about vaccines. I call them the – this is a terrible acronym, because I can't do any better than this Aaron. It is FVS. It will be better if I had a vowel, you know, yeah, I need a vowel. But anyway, let’s just say FVS. The S is the said. So, I'm talking about support for the market. The Federal Reserve decision to basically say that they're going to keep a zero interest rate policy for the – through 2023 is a huge boost for the market. Number two, V. The V is vaccines. You know, obviously, the market thinks that there will be a vaccine in the next year. I don't think it's going to happen in the next three months. But you could certainly have a vaccine for the most severely impacted people by the middle of next year. And that's a rate of hope that that investors are leaning on. And the S is stimulus.Stimulus, if it were to happen, if they were to pass a stimulus bill now, it might only be $500 billion, because that's the amount that the Senate wants to pass. Speaker Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin have proposed a $1.8 trillion program, but you know, if the stimulus program does not occur in the next – if they don't make a deal in the next two days, it's going to go to after the election. And I think the investors out to hope that it happens after the election because if the Biden camp – if the democrats win, you're probably looking at stimulus of more like $3.2 trillion. And that's like double what they could get right now.AT: That's real money. That's real money.JM: That’s real money. A trillion here, a trillion there, pretty soon.AT: Pretty soon. Pretty soon it's real money. Yeah, yeah. No, it's incredible like how we all become so numb to these big numbers. But yeah, I mean…JM: A $3 trillion infusion – $3 trillion infusion into the economy would just supercharge this. It would turbo-charge the economy and also the stock market, because excess money always goes to speculative uses. So, I think what the market right now is doing is it believes that these three horsemen, the Fed, Vaccine, and Stimulus are going to support investors, at least the next year or two.SA: And a vaccine doesn't change your bullish view on names like Zoom video?JM: No, I mean, I'm not an expert by any means on medicine, but from what I've read, it seems like the rollout of the vaccines will be very slow.AT: Yes, that is true. So – and you reference this with Teladoc, specifically. So, you know, maybe you'd look to buying a pullback. So, what is your advice for people and there's a lot of them, and you know, myself included, you know, who've been sitting on cash or too much cash relative to where they “should be” based on their age and risk profile, you know, waiting, you know, because they think something bad is going to happen and the market is going to, you know, fall back here, like, what would you recommend someone do with cash at this point?JM: Again, I'm not a financial advisor; I just kind of try to find stocks that I think will help people – will benefit people if the thing that I'm talking about will come true, but I think that, you know, this is not a good time, this is probably not a good time for cash. The Fed is telling us that, you know, by forcing interest rates down to near zero, it's creating the view as the correct view that it's called TINA, you know, you’re familiar with TINA, right?AT: Yes. There is no alternative. Yes.JM: There is no alternative. So, I read a long time ago, an interview with Warren Buffett where he said, and it really stuck with me. He says that, ‘stocks and bonds are always in competition with each other’. If you can get a 6% return from a bond, why bother with stocks? But you know, you can't get 6% anymore, right? It's hard for [indiscernible] to get 1% over passbook savings account. So, cash is trash. Yeah, I'm not just saying that because it's [indiscernible]. I'm saying it's because the Fed is telling us that they want – they're forcing people into stocks. And the Fed’s the most powerful engine of growth in the world that has been, you know, for the last hundred years. People always want to think that the Fed’s not all powerful, but it really is.AT: Yeah, don't fight the Fed is the oldest, you know saying on Wall Street. Well, not theOldest…JM: The oldest saying on Wall Street is don't fight the Fed. And my addendum to that is the Fed is undefeated.AT: Can't be the oldest because the Fed’s only been around for 100 plus years, but sorry, that's splitting hairs. That's [indiscernible].JM: The oldest piece of advice of that nature is there's nothing new under the sun that comes directly from – it comes from the Bible, but it comes to us via reminiscences of a stock operator. It’s on the first page.AT: That’s right.JM: There's nothing new under the sun because everything that we talk about is as much about human emotion as it is about dollars and cents. In my view, PE is an opinion, PE is – [high PE] is to tell you that investors have a high level of confidence in the company, the [low PE] says people have low level of confidence. So, I would – I think right now, people have relatively low level of confidence in the market overall. It should be more exposed.SA: Are there any stocks that you're a fan of that have, to your [chagrin], kind of disappointed you, yet you still remain a fan?JM: Well, actually, let me talk about one just – just for Aaron, because he's kind of worried. He's he says people have cash and are looking to raise the plat. And, you know, for those people who are a little bit on the fence, I would say stick with some of the best run companies that have been through so many cycles and come out on the other side. One of the companies I really like a lot on that regard is Danaher, DHR, are you familiar with them? They're a conglomerate that operates in professional services like diagnostics, environmental, and Applied Sciences, and they've got [30 different] businesses under their banner, but that all share a cohesive management structure and a digital infrastructure. And this provides, you know, economies of scale, and the Danaher business has grown year-after-year, after year-after-year and, you know, 2020 has been especially lucrative, but this is a really well managed company. You know, Aaron, you're a baseball fan, you know how people say sometimes, he's a professional hitter. You know that phrase?AT: Yes, yes.JM: And it sounds like ridiculous. Like, of course, they're all professional hitters, but no, there are some hitters that are just – they just seem to be able to hit the ball when it's necessary, hit the, you know, hit a home run when required.AT: Like go the opposite way when they need to, just to move a [indiscernible] yeah.JM: Advance the runners, etcetera, etcetera. Well, Danaher is that kind of company, to me. It’s extremely well managed, and one of the stocks, I have the easiest time recommending to people.AT: Essentially, it sounds like Danaher a number of years ago people would talk about and they are sort of like, you know a smaller GE when that was a complement.JM: Good point.AT: But it sounds like, you know, you're talking about Danaher the way people used to talk about GE.JM: That’s correct.AT: You know, steady, well run business, well managed, you know, diversified and they know what they're doing.JM: Exactly. And so that's not really a tech company, per se, but I included in my list because it does, it has taken, they've done a tremendous job of taking advantage of the digital revolution. Another stock I like a lot that people doesn't get enough credit is Cadence Design, you ever heard of them, CDNS. They make – it's a company that makes systems that companies use to design semiconductors. And you know, chips are the center of the digital revolution, because they're finding their way into ever smaller, lower powered devices.So, we're making lots more semiconductors than we used to. And Cadence is in the business of making that process more efficient and cheaper for the manufacturers like Nvidia, etcetera. And you know, it's not the fastest growing business in the world, I think it's growing at a highest single digit growth – it has high single digit growth last year and this year, but it's a company that's really not that well understood and not that – not overpriced, and I think people ought to take a look at it, Cadence Design, CDNS. And then one more company I'd like to call the people's attention that may not – people may not be aware of is MongoDB.AT: That one I’m not familiar with, what does MongoDB do?JM: It has – symbol is MDB. It makes a scalable cloud-based database program that competes directly with Oracle. So, Oracle is kind of messed up, has been for years, because it's got this tremendous terrible legacy business, it is trying to grow out of MongoDB, and it's being assaulted by these smaller cloud-based database platforms like MongoDB. So, MongoDB revenues shot up to 420 million in fiscal 2020. Just repeated design wins and new business from companies like Adobe and Google. So, in terms of, you know, the best online or cloud-based database program, company, I think MongoDB is the one MDB.AT: You know, I do want to ask you about a couple other [demes] and obviously, you know, it sounds like we could talk about – you could talk about interval stocks for a long time here. When you were talking before about Peloton it struck me though the way you describe them is the way a lot of people talk about Tesla, which is the other, you know, headline earnings report this week, and I'll put air quotes on earnings because who knows if it's going to be positive or not? Do you have a position in Tesla or a view on that particular stock?JM: I’m a big fan of Tesla. I've never – I haven't owned it for a while because it got just – the price got, in my opinion got [outrageous] and I've always been worried about Tesla because they've had a series of Financial – Chief Financial Officers leave the company which is sort of a bad sign.AT: Right.JM: So, Tesla has exceeded my expectations. I'm not an expert in Tesla, but I do respect what they've done.AT: Fair enough. Okay. And then the other name I wanted to ask you about is one that I would think most of our listeners are familiar with, which is Microsoft, give an interesting perspective on Microsoft, which is that, you know, people are under estimating the importance of office in a work from home world, can you explain that thesis?JM: Yeah, I mean, Microsoft is one of the few – is the only company of its generation, they managed to survive. You know, Cisco has not really survived, Oracle has not really survived. And a lot of its competitors have gone away, but Microsoft has just been blessed with great management after Steve Ballmer left. And they made a really important shift to the cloud. They stopped worrying about whether they were going to sell Windows devices, they started to sell – they want to sell more into the digital space. And it's, you know, management has done a great job year-after-year of directing them into the high margin areas of this industry, and I think the world of Microsoft – I think that it can be up, you know, 5x by the beginning of the next decade.SA: And a name that I haven't seen you talk about in at least any your recent writings, which I've just read is Apple, obviously an important name to a lot of people.JM: Yeah, Apple is a name that I have a lot of problems with. The market hasn't had as much problems as I have. But to me, it's, you know, iPhone is no secret, iPhone sales peaked about three years ago, and have not gone back up. And making a big business out of like, Apple Watch, and the iPad services just seems to me like it's a difficult proposition. And I really, you know, you look at Amazon, what they really have is either a five SQ company, can you imagine another, could there be any other [trillion dollar] company that basically has five things to sell.They can sell, you know, what I mean? And if one of those products, you know, becomes in effective [indiscernible] it's not a good seller, the whole company can be brought down, and I'm just a little worried about them, Apple. I mean, they haven't really improved the – I mean, it's the – they're trying to make, keep the impression that a smartphone has to be expensive. And then a lot of other vendors who showed us that you can make a device, it's like 99% as good as an Apple and sell it for about 60% loss.AT: Yeah, it's interesting that when the 5g phones came out last week, you wrote, you know, the phones are finally here, but investors should skip Apple and focus on Skyworks Solutions and Qorvo, the component supplier that make the new devices speedier, and to me that, you know, you obviously, you're not shy about investing in mega cap stocks, but it's – to me that sort of seemed like the classic Jon Markman. Like, I'm going to look for the first derivative type of play. What, you know, do you have positions in Skyworks and is a Qorvo symbol, QRVO?JM: Yeah, I don't have one at the time, but I'm waiting for them to pull back, give me an opportunity to buy them. But I do think that, you know, these are the sensors, these are the, to make the internet of things work. And we need low cost sensors and we need ways to access them. And that's what these two companies helped Apple devices do. So, you know, I don't think it's really that necessary to do first derivative stocks, but you can go directly to the source.So, if you really want to take advantage of this industry, you can buy the stocks and I recon I did. But if you want to go to first or second derivative, then yeah, buy the chipmakers and make this possible. And Qorvo, Cadence is my number one pick in chip design. I think Nvidia is my number one pick in the development of new businesses for chips. And if I had to pick one, I think I’d wait to buy Nvidia on the next pullback.AT: All right, well, if you're right, we may not get any pullbacks for the next decade, but we really appreciate all your time here today. Our guest has been Jon Markman. You can find his research and more at markmancapital.net. Jon, thanks very much for being with us today.JM: Aaron, thanks for having me.SA: Thank you, Jon."

The company mainly focuses on IT functions of enterprise customers even though, more recently, it expanded into other areas such as HR service delivery, customer service and security operations.Data by YChartsIn Q2-20, subscription revenue came in at $1.016 billion, 30% growth YoY. Total revenue of $1.071 billion grew 28% YoY, $17 million ahead of analysts' estimate. In Q2-20, the company had 40 deals in excess of $1m and 2 deals over $10m. Positive momentum was seen in both customer service and human resources divisions, with ServiceNow now having 964 clients generating more than $1m in annual contract value (ACV). Non-GAAP subscription billings grew 26% YoY.Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) grew 30% YoY reaching $7.0 billion, of which $3.5 billion current RPO due within a year and $3.5 billion non-current RPO.Key catalysts include:Key risks include:ServiceNow has been successful in conducting a typical land and expand strategy. The company started as a provider of SaaS solutions for IT Service Management (ITSM) and its success has come thanks to a flexible platform, a familiar interface and by becoming a single system of record for the IT function within an enterprise.Having established itself as a leader in the ITSM space, with a rapid rise to around 40% of ITSM market share, ServiceNow is expanding into the much larger market of IT Operations Management (ITOM) by incorporating new features into its original platform. Moreover, the company successfully expanded its process automation approach to other areas beyond the IT function such as HR functions and customer service.The company's success has been rapid and, for the most part, organic. ServiceNow boasts an impressive 97% customer retention rate, reached by focusing on the 2,000 largest enterprises in the world (G2K); these companies continue to renew their contracts, with the average annual contract value doubling in the last three years. Moreover, renewal rate has been extremely constant over the past few quarters, reaching 97% in Q4-19, Q1-20 and Q2-20.Interestingly, ServiceNow has no exposure to small businesses, which are generally less sticky than enterprise customers. The company not only maintains an impressive retention rate, but it is able to sell multiple products to one single customer, as 75% of its clients are multi-product buyers.Source: Q2-20 Investor PresentationThe majority of new ACV is still coming from IT Workflows (63%), followed by Customer & Employee Workflows (24%) and Now Platform App Engine & Others (13%).As demonstrated by the positive renewal rate, ServiceNow's business model is extremely sticky, with 95% of GAAP Revenues coming from subscription-based services (compared with 94% for FY19 and 93% for FY18).William McDermott serves as president, CEO and Director of ServiceNow since November 2019. He previously served as a member of the executive board at SAP SE from October 2019 to November 15, 2019. He served as CEO of SAP SE since May 21, 2014 until October 10, 2019. McDermott received its B.S. degree in Business Administration from Dowling College, and he holds an M.B.A. from the Kellogg Graduate School of Management. He also completed the Executive Development Program at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton Graduate School of Management.Gina Mastantuono serves as CFO and joined the company at the end of 2019. She previously held a position as CFO of Ingram Micro Inc. from December 2016 to December 2019. She began her career at Ernst & Young LLP in 1992 where she was a manager in the entrepreneurial services group. She is a CPA and holds a B.S. in Accounting & Business Administration from the State University of New York.Chris Bedi serves as Chief Information Officer since 2015. Prior to joining ServiceNow, he served as CIO of JDSU from August 2011 to March 2015, where he was responsible for IT, Facilities and Indirect Procurement. He started his career at KPMG from June 1996 to April 2002. He holds a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Michigan.Independent directors are generally qualified and come from a variety of high-profile leadership backgrounds. Board member compensation consists of a typical fee of $22,000 to $70,000 annually plus $325,000 in restricted stock unit awards, which is comparable to peers. Executive compensation consists of a base salary, cash bonus and RSU awards. The variable component of cash bonus and RSU is based on new net ACV. Compensation seems appropriate and in line with other software companies and looks skewed towards equity compensation as a way to align management with shareholders.The company is in a safe financial position, with rapidly growing top-line and improving margins. Revenue grew from $1.0 billion in 2015 to $3.5 billion in 2019, with EBITDA turning positive in 2017 ($49.5m) and Operating Income turning positive in 2019 ($42.1m). ServiceNow has been generating positive FCF for the past few years, with LTM FCF of $1.1 billion, or 27.5% total revenue.As of June-20, the company has $2.3 billion in cash & equivalents (includes $1.5 billion in short-term investments), offset by $1.2 billion in interest bearing debt which includes $502m in capitalized operating leases, resulting in a net cash position of $1.1 billion. In terms of capital deployment, the company is not paying dividends (and will likely continue to do so in the foreseeable future) or repurchasing shares on a consistent basis and only makes small acquisitions, as growth has mainly been organic. Since 2012, the company has only spent an aggregate $240m on acquisitions.Analysts are expecting ServiceNow to continue growing its top-line at a healthy rate, reaching $6.9 billion total revenue by FY2022; EBITDA margins are also expected to improve, normalizing around 31%-33% EBITDA margin. In a base-case DCF, top-line growth is expected to stay at or above 20% until FY2025, with total revenue reaching $19.4 billion by FY2029 (representing a 18.0% CAGR between 2020-2029). Revenue growth is driven by two main factors: (1) a high and stable renewal rate and (2) increasingly larger deals.Unlevered FCF is modeled to reach $4.0 billion in FY2029, with UFCF/EBITDA normalizing around 64%-65% (or 20%-21% of total revenue).Enterprise Value is adjusted to factor in (1) value of options outstanding: as of June-20 there are 651k options outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of $92.87, 4.6y maturity, with total estimated value of $181m (34.6% volatility, 2.5% risk-free rate and current price of $453.09 per share). Note that all options outstanding, and not just vested ones, are considered (2) non-operating assets of $777m in long-term investments & financial assets (3) debt value of capitalized operating leases of $502m, 8.9y maturity, 3.5% discount rate (note: the 3.5% rate used by the company to capitalize leases is also used as a proxy for pre-tax cost of debt in the below DCF).Below is the summary of a high-level DCF:Source: S&P Capital IQ, Duff & Phelps for normalized risk-free rate and ERP estimates (source), NYU Stern, proprietary research. 2020-2022 Revenue and EBITDA from CapIQ estimates. Please note: the above DCF only offers a rough fair value estimate. Highlighted in dark grey are author's estimates for top-line growth and EBITDA marginsEven though shares are up more than 70% the past year, the stock appears to be fairly valued on a DCF basis. Assuming an exit EV/Revenue of 6.5x (equivalent to a 20.3x EV/EBITDA exit), fair value comes in at $417.63 a share (7.8% downside to current price of $453.09 as of September 18th, 2020 close).Data by YChartsIn the above model, a current price per share of $453.09 implies a 7.2x exit EV/Revenue in Year 10 (22.5x EV/EBITDA) which, again, seems plausible considering the high multiples at which the company is trading on an LTM basis and not too far off the 6.5x target exit. Moreover, a 7.2x exit is in line with the 7.1x median EV/Revenue of selected public comps:Source: S&P Capital IQHowever, the company is still priced higher than most of its competitors (possibly rightly so given the strong competitive position and higher growth prospects) and any execution misstep could have an amplified impact of the company's shares.As noted above, valuation still looks high compared with peers, even though a DCF model seems to justify the premium given higher growth prospects.ServiceNow has successfully gained market share by displacing legacy vendors with its SaaS offering but, as the company continues to expand in new areas of the enterprise, it is likely to encounter increased competition. For instance, moving into the customer experience segment will mean increased direct competition with salesforce.com (CRM).Even though growth has been for the most part organic (the company only spent an aggregate $240m since its IPO), as the company matures, the likelihood of M&A activity increases. For now, the company has mainly engaged in acquiring feature-driven companies and, as there is no clear and proven M&A track record, investors could be exposed to execution risk if M&A activity increases.Finally, as both CEO and CFO joined the company in the fourth quarter of 2019, they have limited experience with the team but, given their backgrounds, they will likely perform well in the years ahead."
4377457,35181,2020-10-03T10:17:36-04:00,"ServiceNow posted strong Q2 2020 results in spite of the pandemic with 30% YoY subscription revenue growth.Revenue run rate has surpassed $4 billion. The company has a target of $10 billion revenue and being the ""defining enterprise software company of the 21st century"".The company has strong free cash flow margin of 27% and easily meets the Rule of 40.The stock price appears to be overvalued relative to its peers based on sales multiple, but is fairly valued when gross profit multiple is used.The stock price is pushing to an all-time high, signifying that it is time to buy.","(Source: Wikipedia)ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is literally the Energizer Bunny of SaaS, as the strong financial performances never seems to stop. The company's five-year revenue growth rate is 38.4% CAGR and in the most recent quarter (Q2 2020) still grew at a 30+% clip, even with the pandemic wreaking havoc over the economy. In the latest quarter, ServiceNow reached a milestone $1 billion in subscription revenue, not too shabby for an economy in recession.(Source: ServiceNow)The secret sauce behind this Energizer Bunny is the very sticky set of digital workflow products that the company refers to collectively as the Now Platform. The platform is ideally positioned to capture market share as IT departments consolidate their software vendors in an attempt to save costs. The platform covers a broad range of applications as described in the latest quarterly report:ServiceNow also offers IT Operations Management (""ITOM"") which is split out separately in the financial statements. ITOM currently generates ~13% of subscription revenue while the Now Platform generates the remainder of subscription revenues.(Source: ServiceNow)The power of the platform is that customers are drawn in by the ITSM functionality, then they are cross-sold on adjacent applications as time progresses. In addition to the applications mentioned above, ServiceNow has also introduced ITSM Pro which includes machine learning and is designed as an up-sell for the more mature ITSM product.The stock price is where we determine whether Mr. Market likes what he sees in this company. And for sure, Mr. Market loves this stock. It has been steadily increasing since the February-March 2020 bear market and is now set to break out to an all-time high.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. The rule provides a single metric for evaluating both high-growth companies that aren't profitable and mature companies that have lower growth but are profitable. Revenue growth and profitability (expressed as a margin) must add up to at least 40% in order to fulfill the rule. Analysts use various figures for profitability. I use the free cash flow margin.The rationale for the Rule of 40 is as follows. If a company grows by more than 40% annually, then you can tolerate some level of negative free cash flow. But if a company grows by less than 40%, then it should have a positive free cash flow to make up for the less-than-ideal growth. This rule accommodates both young, high-growth companies as well as mature, moderate-growth companies. The 40% threshold is somewhat arbitrary but typically divides the digital transformation stock universe in half, separating the best stocks from the so-so ones.For a further description of the rule and calculation, please refer to a previous article I have written.The two factors required for calculating the Rule of 40 are revenue growth and free cash flow margin. ServiceNow's annual revenue growth for the latest year is 31%. The company's TTM free cash flow margin is a strong 27%.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Paint)Therefore, the Rule of 40 calculation for ServiceNow is as follows:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 31% + 27% = 58%Its score is significantly higher than the necessary 40% needed to fulfill the rule of thumb, suggesting that this company has a healthy balance between growth and profitability.Interestingly enough, when I examine the forward efficiency score, a term that I invented that is essentially the Rule of 40 on a forward-basis using earnings as opposed to free cash flow, ServiceNow makes it into the top 15 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe of consisting 170+ stocks.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)There are numerous techniques for valuing stocks. Some analysts use fundamental ratios such as P/E, P/S, EV/P, or EV/S. I believe that one should not employ a simple ratio, and the reason is simple. Higher-growth stocks are valued more than lower-growth stocks, and rightly so. Growth is a significant parameter in discounted cash flow valuation.Therefore, I employ a technique that uses a scatter plot to determine relative valuation for the stock of interest versus the remaining 170+ stocks in my digital transformation stock universe. The Y-axis represents the enterprise value/forward gross profits estimate, while the X-axis is the estimated forward Y-o-Y sales growth.The plot below illustrates how ServiceNow stacks up against the other stocks on a relative basis based on forward gross profits multiple.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red and represents an average valuation based on next year's sales growth. The higher the anticipated revenue growth, the higher the accepted valuation. In this instance, ServiceNow is positioned somewhat above the best-fit line, suggesting that the company is overvalued on a relative basis relative to its peers.When a stock is perceived to be overvalued, I like to regenerate the scatter plot using the forward gross profit multiple for the Y-Axis instead of the forward sales multiple. I consider the gross profit multiple to be a better metric.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)Using the gross profit multiple shows that the stock price is fairly valued on a relative basis.There are several risks that investors should consider before investing in ServiceNow. First of all, I view the current stock market action to be reminiscent of the dot.com era, immediately prior to the crash starting in 2000. Technology stocks were performing well beyond what many analysts considered to be acceptable valuations. In 2000, the market turned into a disaster, and the same could happen here, although there is much more substance behind the internet companies than those that existed 20 years ago.While I believe that ServiceNow is navigating the current economic environment nicely, a prolonged recession could impact the company's results. The pandemic will eventually go away, but the recession, or some say depression, could linger for a prolonged length of time.While I expect that ServiceNow's revenue will continue to grow, it is starting to butt heads with other large platform providers such as Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM).ServiceNow provides digital workflow solutions to the enterprise market. The suite of applications are very sticky, with customer retention of 97%, one of the highest levels of retention in the industry. Sales are robust with YoY growth of 30% in spite of the pandemic and recession.I believe that the Now platform is ideally positioned for capturing market share during these uncertain times, as IT managers consolidate software vendors. Given that ServiceNow offers a broad variety of applications, I believe that many enterprises will keep and expand on their usage of Now and the AI-based ITSM Pro product.ServiceNow has exhibited both strong revenue growth and also a strong cash flow margin of 27%, allowing this company to easily fulfill the software Rule of 40. The fair stock valuation on a relative basis based on the forward gross profits multiple makes this investment a no-brainer. For these reasons, I am giving ServiceNow a Buy rating."

Even amidst this very tough environment, where companies are facing near-term uncertainty and reducing their IT infrastructure spend, ServiceNow continues firing away on all cylinders.The stock is priced at 17x its 2021 sales, which is not expensive, in the present market, particularly for a company with such high gross profit margins, solidly crossing the Rule of 40 threshold, and consistently growing its revenues at very close to 30% y/y.Source: author's calculations, **company guidanceServiceNow is consistently hitting very close to 30% y/y revenue growth rates.Even now, despite its large size, ServiceNow is showing no signs of slowing down. When the previous CEO John Donahoe stepped away, and CEO Bill McDermott took ServiceNow's reigns, I assumed that McDermott would be no match: but how wrong was I? The graphic above is a clear demonstration that McDermott is doing a terrific job.Furthermore, above we can see very clearly that there was no ''pull-forward'' in revenues being experience during Q2 2020 and Q3 2020, as the guidance is largely expected to continue at approximately 28% into next quarter.Secondly, what I find even more astonishing, is that numerous companies are reporting a slowdown in IT spend. And I would firmly believe that ServiceNow's digital workflows would be seeing some level of slow down in demand too, after all, the companies that had to adapt or die, would have already adapted in Q2/Q3. Meanwhile, the ones that can't migrate towards a digital workflow, would probably be quite slow to migrate right now, in this environment.However, non-GAAP billings for Q4 2020 are pointing towards 25%-26%, once again plainly reinforcing that even as ServiceNow has plenty of reasons to start slowing down, it evidently is not. As we look ahead towards Q4 2020, ServiceNow nicely balances growth and profitability, with its Rule of 40 reaching 50%. Incidentally, when McDermott stepped up to the position and contended that ServiceNow was eyeing up a path towards $10 billion in revenues, I felt that this was just company rhetoric and that this potential was too far into the distance to be relevant. But now, it starts to become very easily visible, as ServiceNow is likely to reach just under $6 billion in revenues in 2021.To repeat, previously I had tremendous trouble coming to terms with ServiceNow's valuation. And I missed a meaningful opportunity here. Nonetheless, looking ahead, I now, no longer consider ServiceNow as exuberantly priced as I had previously charged.Assuming that ServiceNow decelerates its growth rates into 2021, which is a realistic assumption. If we work off the assumption that ServiceNow's revenue growth rates in 2021 are in the ballpark of 25% revenue growth rates, this would put the stock trading for less than 17x its forward revenues.If we take a step back and compare with other companies in this space in general, there are one or two cheaper companies, such as Salesforce (CRM), which trades for less than 9x its forward 2021 revenues, although we should note that Salesforce has rarely traded at a higher multiple than this.On the other hand, we have companies such as Coupa (COUP) and DocuSign (DOCU), which are priced 28x 2021 sales and 21x 2021 sales, respectively, despite pointing towards only slightly faster growth rates. However, here's the issue right now in the whole SaaS space: a lot of these companies are being priced very similarly and are trading very similarly. And in the event that tech was to fall out of favor, as it's doing so right now, I am unsure whether paying these sorts of multiples would be a rewarding set up for investors.Having said that, ServiceNow's subscription business carries one of the highest gross profit margins in the space, at 86% non-GAAP gross profit margins for Q3 2020, and guiding for the same for the full-year. Previously I argued that ServiceNow was exuberantly priced. And while I've not fully done an about-turn and gone long this stock, I have put the spotlight on plenty of reasons why the stock still has ample runway ahead.Further, I demonstrate that investors are not paying an exuberant multiple for ServiceNow's stock and that on balance, there's arguably a positive risk/reward to this name."

Think of Netflix, whose stock is up about 15,000% over the past 20 years as it moved from mail-order DVDs to offering bits of data in the cloud. This revolution has another 10-20 years left in it, and those companies leading and benefitting will offer vast rewards to their shareholders.","This week's Alpha Trader podcast features hosts Aaron Task and Stephen Alpher talking (mostly) tech with Jon Markman, founder and president of Markman Capital Insight.Before getting into individual stock picks, Markman first looks at the big picture: Going back about 80 years, whenever the Fed steps in to put the brakes on a bear market, one should expect the averages to go up five times over the following ten years. The Fed helped end the bear market, says Markman, on March 23 this year. Applying that 5x multiple to what the Dow (DJI) and the Nasdaq (COMP) were that day leads to 91,000 on the Dow and almost 34,000 on the Nasdaq in roughly 10 years.Before considering that extreme, consider that the S&P 500 (SP500) bottomed in 2009 at 666. Markman's target then for that index was 3,330, which was hit late in 2019.This, of course, doesn't mean that there will be any number of scares and sizable corrections along the way. These should be thought of as buying opportunities, particularly for those companies leading and benefitting from the ""digital transformation,"" which Markman defines as the use of data and software to build new business models.A great example of this is Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which, over two decades, went from being a mail-order DVD business to offering bits of data in the cloud. Tap an image on your electronic device of choice and the show begins. The company has 193M customers, a $234B market cap, and a stock that's up something like 15,000% over 20 years - all from harnessing the digital revolution.As you might imagine given the major wave he's talking about, Markman doesn't have a ton of interest in Netflix's earnings this week. Over the next 10-20 years, Netflix and others leading the digital revolution - think Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON), and Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM), to name just three - are all going to be multi-baggers (though Peloton and Zoom might be due for a short-term correction).Now, the above are very well-known (and hot) names. Maybe not as well-known, but with an equally great opportunity, is a player like Schrodinger (NASDAQ:SDGR), a company delivering healthcare using digital tools.For those wishing to invest in the digital revolution but undecided about which horse to ride, Markman suggests Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) as - more than any other companies - perfectly levered to e-commerce and the transformation of money to software.Other digital transformation long ideas discussed in the podcast include The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD), a platform for the buying and selling of digital ad inventory, and enterprise workflow platform operator ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW). Both have eye-popping charts, but massive opportunity over the next decade still awaits.We couldn't let Markman go without comment on two tech megacaps - Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). He's a fan of Microsoft, giving its post-Ballmer management kudos for moving the focus of the company away from selling devices, and instead, selling into the high-margin areas of the digital space. He's not bullish on Apple though, worried about waning iPhone sales, and questioning the ability of the company to replace that revenue with other devices and services.Listen to or subscribe to Alpha Trader on these podcast platforms:"

Coupled with the rest of its risks, we won't be buyers at ServiceNow's current price levels.","The market seems to be lacking any breaks, as general indices keep on rallying higher, led by tech stocks. The enterprise cloud-computing solutions companies were recently boosted higher amid encouraging earnings by Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), which considerably beat earnings and raised its guidance.Another company in the sector whose shares have been on a long-term appreciation trajectory is ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), the leading digital workflow company, whose shares are currently trading at all-time high levels, just under $500.Source: Google FinanceWhile the company's recent quarter revealed great results, its valuation of 23 times sales raises the question of whether shares are fairly priced, and if there is a reasonable future return potential at their current levels.In this article, we will:Leading the workflow revolution, ServiceNow has been delivering impressive results since its IPO in 2012. The company's business model is subscription based, which allows ServiceNow to consistently grow its revenues as it attracts more clients. During Q2-2020, the company reported 26% YoY growth in its customer base of 964 individual clients, achieving a $4B run-rate sales milestone. In fact, since its IPO, ServiceNow has been consistently growing its QoQ revenues, without exception.As with every company that is rapidly growing, deceleration is part of the process, with revenue growth eventually declining over time. While this holds true with ServiceNow as well, sales growth remains impressive, still above the 30% threshold.ServiceNow's service management applications and digital workflow products are seeing great customer appeal, which has helped the company to retain its best-in-class renewal rate of 97%. Additionally, the company's Platform as a Service (PAAS) and Software as a Service (SAAS) operations are greatly scaleable. As a result, as the company expands its customer base, it creates more room for its gross margins to grow, which have been on a long-term expansion trend, in line with the company's underlying growth.Despite the high-quality characteristics of ServiceNow's recurring cash flows, it's hard to ignore the stock's steep valuation of around 23 times its underlying sales. To justify such a high multiple, it has to be that the company's sales are expected to continue their rapid growth, as a potential steep deceleration would quickly crumble the stock's euphoric valuation, which is not sustainable in the long term.Based on management's guidance, FY2020 subscription revenues are still expected to grow just under 30%, which indicates strong traction. However, what may worry investors is the projected billings, whose growth is estimated to be around 24%. Billings are essentially the company's future sales pipeline. Therefore, it's a useful metric that can partially signal future sales growth. Source: Q2 resultsConsidering that a year ago, in Q2-2019, the company projected a 30% billing growth, which ended up being its current sales, such a reduced figure of around 24% could point towards a drastic slowdown in future growth.Going back to the stock's sky-high valuation multiple, let's use the company's guidance and prudent projections to assess whether investors can expect further gains at its current all-time high price levels.The company's five-year high P/S multiple is certainly disanalogous with management's guidance for decelerated billing growth. However, there are some extra aspects to consider.In the company's guidance, subscription gross profit is expected to grow to 86% (currently 83%). Despite strong gross profit margins, ServiceNow's bottom-line results have remained weak, as the company faces considerable selling and advertising costs. The stock is, therefore, trading on its potential long-term profitability. But is it enough to account for the current price?Below, we have illustrated the consensus analyst EPS estimates until 2023, and our prudent projections, up until 2025. We believe that our 2024-2025 EPS estimates are quite reasonable since their growth assumes deceleration compared to the past couple of years, which may hardly be the case since net income margins should easily accelerate as the company scales.Source: Seeking Alpha; AuthorNow, let's estimate the potential investor returns and margin of safety, based on these figures and the company's current price.As the table illustrates, assuming ServiceNow ends up trading at around 50x earnings, which is quite reasonable for a leading, growing tech company, investors could see nearly double-digit annualized returns, if they were to buy at the stock's current price.Source: AuthorSince the company enjoys stunning gross margins, its medium-term profitability could potentially justify its otherwise ""unreasonable"" valuation. At the same time, however, there is a minimal margin of safety. Because of its current price, if shares see a lower future valuation multiple, total returns could be significantly reduced, as displayed above.One the one hand, the company's revenues remain robust, with rapid client growth, and even more impressive client retention. Further, the company is well-diversified geographically, with the U.S. consistently accounting for around 64% of total revenues over the past few years.Source: 10-KHowever, with relatively low barriers to entry in its sector, we expect that the company will face steep competition as its market matures over time. With many competitors already offering similar products, if ServiceNow fails to innovate or keep up with the rest of the market, its market share could significantly decline over time.Further, with stock-based compensation being around 20% of total revenues, the company's shares outstanding have been continuously increasing, diluting existing shareholders. If the company fails to deliver solid profitability and misses on analyst expectations, as shown earlier, the combination of inadequate profits and rising shares will damage shareholder value.While the company's quality cash flows of recurring nature should make it easy for management to scale ServiceNow's bottom line, the rising amount of shares is a considerable risk. This goes back to our point that there is little to no margin of safety, even if the company does achieve our's and analysts' EPS projections. The increasing number of shares may challenge a robust EPS generation.ServiceNow's prolonged eight-year rally has been backed by strong revenue growth, due to the company's subscription-based model of recurring revenues and exceptional customer retention rate. Over the past few years, margins have been significantly expanding, which should eventually translate to meaningful earnings in the future.While the stock could still produce noteworthy returns at its current price, there is little to no margins of safety at the current valuation. Further, with future bookings pointing towards deceleration, we are cautious about the company's medium-term growth.While we don't rule out the possibility of ServiceNow both beating analyst expectations and retaining a sky-high valuation multiple, which would possibly lead to market-beating returns, we believe that the underlying risks are hardly worth taking. We, therefore, won't be investing in the stock at its current price."
4372736,105419,2020-09-05T07:24:19-04:00,"Despite this week's sell-off, shares of ServiceNow are up over 60% year-to-date, and the valuation remains higher than peers.However, ServiceNow is a better business than its peers, and the market is still not appreciating the company's tremendous, long-term value.This article reviews the business, the Now platform, its competitive advantages, the large total addressable market, recent performance, valuation and risks. We conclude with our views on investing.","Despite this week's volatility, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) shares are up more than 65% year-to-date, and it has a price-to-sales ratio significantly higher than peers. To many, these metrics are frightening; however, in our view, ServiceNow is attractive. The company has a unique platform that fits perfectly into the current massive global digital transformation opportunity that is still in its very early innings. More specifically, the total addressable market is huge, the ongoing secular shift has been accelerated by covid, and NOW has the solution and leadership to capitalize for a very long time. In fact, our long-term view, combined with the company’s continuing strong execution, leads us to believe Wall Street is not appreciating how truly valuable this business continues to be.ServiceNow is a cloud-based technology company that provides a subscription-based Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) platform to help organizations digitize and automate workflows across different areas such as information technology, human resources, and customer service, to name a few. The solution improves organizational productivity and cost savings, and ServiceNow continues to “land and expand” many large customer relationships.For those of you who prefer watching a video (instead of reading through this article), here is our brief four-minute video overview of ServiceNow and why we like it:Thanks to the company’s visionary founder and chairman, Fred Luddy, the ServiceNow Platform is in the exact right place at the exact right time to capitalize on the enormous digital transformation opportunity as organizations generate vastly more data today than in years past and need a way to utilize it efficiently and effectively across departments. Although there are many standardized Now software packages, the overall Now platform offers one data/architecture model that improves workflow across the entire organization and also prevents data redundancy. Further, the Now platform offers easy integration with third-party applications through APIs, and a subscription-based payment model that continues to allow the company to land and ultimately expand valuable customer relationships.Source: Earnings call presentationServiceNow is a market leader in the IT service management (“ITSM”) tools market with a market share of over 51% in 2019 as per Gartner, which is substantially higher than any of its nearest peers. The ServiceNow platform is a disruptor in the ITSM space and has continued to take market share from traditional players such as BMC since its IPO in 2012 when it had a market share of just 10%. Competition also comes from new market entrants such as Micro Focus, Freshworks, and IBM (NYSE:IBM); however, please note that ServiceNow's product offerings are far superior and have significantly larger coverage. For example, ServiceNow was named a leader in the Gartner magic quadrant for ITSM tools for the sixth year running in 2019.(Image source: Gartner)Furthermore, ServiceNow will face new competition as it explores newer HR and customer service workflow service verticals. For example, it is bound to face competition from other SaaS companies that operate in those verticals such as Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) in dashboarding and Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) in the customer engagement markets. However, we believe that due to its higher integration capabilities, superior platform infrastructure, and continuous innovation, ServiceNow is well positioned to make its presence felt in newer verticals as well.Also very important, from a competitive standpoint, high switching costs add “stickiness” to ServiceNow’s revenue and cash flows. For example, it becomes very difficult for a customer to shift to another service provider due to the significant direct costs (such as the time and expense associated with new software) as well as indirect costs (such as a loss of productivity while users develop expertise). This phenomenon is also captured by the 97% renewal rate enjoyed by ServiceNow. Furthermore, the following customer cohort chart helps demonstrate NOW’s sticky customers and expanding relationships.(image source: Investor presentation)Also important, this stickiness becomes especially valuable during difficult economic times.With organizations becoming more globalized and competition intensifying, operational efficiency has become a major focus area for companies. The operational frictions within large enterprises with traditional workflow mechanisms have become more evident in the current scenario given business disruptions and social distancing. In order to achieve operational efficiency, digital transformation and day-to-day workflow automation have become the need of the hour, so management can focus on protecting revenue and ensuring business resiliency. As per ServiceNow’s management, the company’s total addressable market stood at $110 billion in 2018 and is expected to reach $165 billion by 2023, growing at a CAGR of 8%.(Image source: investor presentation)Given ServiceNow’s dominant position in IT service management, the company is in a strong place to roll out additional products to its enterprise customers who are increasingly looking to deal with fewer vendors in order to be more efficient. This large total addressable market is another reason NOW’s business is so valuable.Not only has ServiceNow delivered impressive top- and bottom-line growth in recent years through customer acquisition and up-selling, but it is also benefiting from the accelerated digital transformation in our post-pandemic world, plus another quarter of expectation-beating performance. For example, ServiceNow reported subscription revenue of $1.02 billion in Q2 2020, which represents an impressive year-over-year growth rate of 30%. And this strong growth was primarily a function of increased purchases from existing clients as well as onboarding of additional clients. Specifically, in the last 12 months, the company has added 200 new customers with annual contract value of over $1 million, 40 of which were onboarded in Q2 2020 itself including two transactions over $10 million.Data source: Company dataServiceNow has been reporting phenomenal growth in recent years through continuous innovation and product additions, growing at a CAGR of over 36% between 2015 and 2019. And although the annual growth rate has slightly slowed in recent quarters, 28% year-over-year growth is still quite healthy and attractive for a market leader.From a valuation standpoint, ServiceNow recently traded at just over 16 times one-year forward sales estimates.(Image source: YCharts)And contrary to some Wall Street analysts, this metric is attractive relative to the company’s high growth rate, leadership position in the industry and the very large, long-term total addressable market. In our view, ServiceNow is pricey, but worth it.Despite the many attractive qualities of ServiceNow’s business, there are risk factors investors should consider. For example, NOW competes in intensely competitive markets, and even though the company enjoys many competitive advantages (e.g. product, scale, leadership position), the industry could change and new competition is always a threat, especially if NOW fails to keep innovating at its current high rate.Technically speaking, another risk factor is the argument that the shares have gone up so much so quickly that the stock is due for a technical sell-off in the near term. Some investors feel that the increased market volatility for tech stocks this week is an indication of near-term challenges. In our view, timing near-term market move is filled with more pitfalls than value, and a far better approach is simply to buy really good businesses and then hang on for the bumpy but ultimately sharply upward long-term ride.The COVID-19 pandemic also creates risks for the business. As a cloud-based company, and an organization where employees have recently been able to work from home, NOW has been less impacted by the pandemic than other organizations. However, any serious, long-term economic harm caused by the virus could have a significant negative impact on the business.For reference, you can learn more about our ServiceNow views in our First Focus report, included below.ServiceNow has consistently delivered impressive top- and bottom-line growth in recent years through customer additions as well as continuous up-selling among existing customers. And despite the premium valuation, we believe the company’s large addressable market, sticky customer base and superior execution will lead to attractive, long-term shareholder returns. For these reasons, we’ve highlighted NOW as one of three stocks that currently standout as “pricey but worth it” (the other two are Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Square (NYSE:SQ)). Overall, if you are a disciplined, long-term growth investor, ServiceNow continues to be dramatically undervalued by the market. And despite some near-term volatility, we view NOW as pricey, but worth it."
4363786,103480,2020-08-03T09:24:43-04:00,"Shares of ServiceNow floundered ever since the company posted Q2 results.
        Despite beating Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines, ServiceNow's key growth metrics showed a meaningful slowdown from Q1.
        This deceleration shows that ServiceNow is not immune to the impacts of the coronavirus that have played out across the enterprise software sector.
        It's difficult to justify ServiceNow's ~15x forward revenue multiple.","ServiceNow (NOW), despite not being a well-known household name because it develops only enterprise software, has consistently been one of the hottest stocks in the enterprise software sector, and this year has been no different. In rising >50% year-to-date, ServiceNow's stock performance has handily beat the flat trends in the S&P 500, but I do question if that winning streak will continue to last.Observe, for example, the fact that ServiceNow shares have been relatively flat in the back half of July (even as large-cap tech stocks continued to zoom higher). Even after an earnings beat in Q2 and a guidance lift, ServiceNow failed to catch new steam for its rally.Amid record multiples for large-cap software stocks, I continue to prefer defensive positioning in my portfolio. Investors this year have continued to chase the biggest YTD gainers up in a rally driven largely by a ""fear of missing out"". But many Wall Street analysts and fund managers are pointing out the escalating risks of overfull valuations, and especially with ServiceNow's growth decelerating and the fact that ServiceNow's earnings are still too thin to justify an earnings-based valuation (P/E is currently sitting above >80x), I think now is a good time for profit-taking in ServiceNow's stock.I've often described ServiceNow as ""priced for perfection,"" and that's never been more true than now. At current share prices near $440, ServiceNow has a market cap of $83.76 billion, and after netting out $3.12 billion of cash and $696 million of debt on its balance sheet, its enterprise value is $81.33 billion. That, in turn, represents a 14.9x EV/FY21 revenue multiple versus Wall Street's consensus revenue target of $5.47 billion (+24% y/y; per Yahoo Finance). Zendesk (ZEN), Workday (WDAY), and HubSpot (HUBS), meanwhile - all similarly sized mid or large-cap software companies expected to grow in the ~20% y/y range for next year - are hovering around ~10x FY21 revenue multiples. I'm struggling to justify any ""secret sauce"" that makes ServiceNow worth this hefty premium. And especially considering the fact that ServiceNow's flagship customer service software competes with a host of well-known, large and deep-pocketed competitors including Salesforce.com, Atlassian (TEAM), and Zendesk, I'm wary of banking on further upside for this stock.Stay on the sidelines here and wait for prices to come down.Let's now take a look at ServiceNow's latest results in greater detail. The earnings summary is shown below:Figure 1. ServiceNow 2Q20 resultsSource: ServiceNow 2Q20 earnings releaseRevenues grew 28% y/y to $1.07 billion, slightly edging out over Wall Street's consensus of $1.04 billion (+25% y/y). The company's overall revenue growth decelerated five points from last quarter's 33% y/y growth rate, while subscription revenue growth of 30% y/y also decelerated five points from last quarter's 35% y/y growth rate.Even more concerning to me, however, is the expected trajectory for billings deceleration. As seasoned software investors are aware, billings represents the longer-term view of a company's revenue pipeline. And the picture isn't looking so good for ServiceNow: billings this quarter slowed down to just 24% y/y, foreshadowing continued revenue deceleration in future quarters and slowing down dramatically from last quarter's 29% y/y growth rate. Figure 2. ServiceNow Q2 highlightsSource: ServiceNow 2Q20 earnings releaseServiceNow's guidance, meanwhile, has this pace of deceleration sustaining into Q3. The company's guidance update is calling for subscription billings to slow down to the mid-teens (15-17% y/y) for the first time in the company's history - and down eight points from Q2. Figure 3. ServiceNow guidance updateSource: ServiceNow Q2 earnings deckIt's important to note that part of this quarter-over-quarter decay was due to an $18 million billings pull-in from Q3 to Q2. Per CFO Gina Mastantuono's prepared remarks on the Q2 earnings call:But note as well that had these billings occurred normally in Q3, roughly two points of growth would have shifted out of Q2 into Q3 - so while the Q2-to-Q3 sequential story might have looked better, Q1-to-Q2 would have been worse. Either way, cumulative billings growth is trending below ServiceNow's usual ~30% y/y pace.There's two major thoughts that this type of guidance disappointment raises:On the flip side to all this is strong profitability trends. Due largely to the fact that Salesforce's customer-facing teams aren't flying out to see clients or hosting expensive events, ServiceNow has managed to boost its pro forma operating margins by ten points year-over-year to 28%, while FCF margin have improved slightly be a point. Figure 4. ServiceNow margin trendsSource: ServiceNow Q2 earnings deckIn spite of strong profitability though, there's still no room to make a case for giving ServiceNow a premium based on its mid-term earnings potential. Wall Street's pro forma EPS forecast for FY21 is $5.43 (+24% y/y), which would put ServiceNow's P/E ratio at 81x. I don't necessarily want to be holding onto a stock trading this richly when the near-term macroeconomic landscape is so uncertain and the market could slip into a pullback again.ServiceNow remains an impressive enterprise software company, and the fact that SAP's former chief Bill McDermott stepped away from a larger company to serve as CEO of ServiceNow speaks volumes to its quality and has lent momentum to investors' enthusiasm in the stock. However, at this juncture, it's difficult to justify premium valuations for a company that faces both heavy competition and is seeing declines in both revenue and billings growth rates. Keep your capital invested elsewhere."

Yet, I proclaim that its results were stronger than first meet the eye. Even though its valuation appears punchy, there's still more upside potential here.This SaaS now trades for just under 19x its 2020 sales, which I contend given that ServiceNow is likely to continue growing its revenues growth rates 25%-30% for a little while longer, there could be still more potential ahead.I also make the argument that analysts' expectations are lower than ServiceNow's own guidance, implying that the Street is likely to upwards revise their own models. This stock is worth watching. Here's why:ServiceNow is a stock that I've been an outspoken bear about. I have been consistently cautioning investors that the stock was overpriced relative to its growth rate trajectory. Having said that, its Q2 2020 results were good, and although I still believe that its valuation is punchy and that risk-averse investors may do better elsewhere, its full-year guidance shows that ServiceNow's prospects remain strong.

Source: SA Premium ToolsWhat should strike you is the discrepancy between the 30% y/y growth rates on the above compared with analysts' estimates. Accordingly, I believe that even though the share price dipped slightly, analysts will soon revisit their financial models and upwards revise their expectations.During the earnings call, a lot of energy was spent highlighting to investors that although Q3 billings come in light, that this was simply down to some seasonality and that ServiceNow will make up its lost ground in Q4.Specifically, adjusted subscription billings exited Q2 at 26%, and looking at Q3 2020 adjusted subscription billings came down to the midpoint of 17%. However, looking out to full-year 2020, this is once more guided towards 24% to 25%.In fact, not only does this imply that it is indeed just some seasonality, but the bigger picture should have been that in Q1 2020 subscription billings were previously guided to be in the range of 23% to 25% -- before COVID. And now, on the back of its Q2 results, ServiceNow moves the midpoint up slightly to 24% to 25%. Most SaaS stocks are now getting a blanket 20x sales multiple asserted to their stocks, without investors truly questioning their actual realistic potential compared with their underlying valuations.Source: author's calculationsThus, even though the multiple for ServiceNow is punchy and sentiment has been incredibly positive for so long I would not look to exit my position if I had one in ServiceNow on the back of these results.Indeed, looking ahead towards its full-year 2020, we can ascertain that ServiceNow is being valued at just shy of 19x its 2020 sales (data not shown).Consequently, for many investors, that's likely to be enough of a discount to buy ServiceNow's stock. And I can see the validity of that argument, as there are far worse companies in the SaaS world that are not delivering the sort of growth rates that ServiceNow is guiding for, while those stocks are being valued at even higher multiples.ServiceNow reported a 'nothing to see quarter', and the stock ever so slightly dipped after hours. What investors should takeaway from this is the opposite message: no news is great news. It shows that despite COVID ServiceNow is still punching out very strong numbers. That subscription billings remain strong, and that ServiceNow is still growing at a rapid clip despite its huge numbers."
4374313,69905,2020-09-15T03:15:15-04:00,"ServiceNow's billings point towards its growth rates coming down to ~25% increase y/y.ServiceNow is being priced at the ''standard'', 20x foward sales multiple, while its revenue growth rates are guided to slow down.As investors start to become more discerning, particularly after the recent tech sell-off, it's difficult to argue that ServiceNow is strikingly undervalued.","ServiceNow (NOW) is well positioned to grow strongly in the current environment. Yet, ServiceNow is not growing particularly fast, and its guidance is also pointing towards a slowdown to approximately 25% y/y growth rates.Furthermore, ServiceNow's billings don't paint a particularly bullish picture either. Yet, the stock, for now, is still being priced at 20x forward sales, which is too expensive relative to its growth rates. On balance, I reason that investors can find more attractive stocks elsewhere.ServiceNow has an enterprise-grade cloud platform called the Now Platform.ServiceNow has three core platforms, IT, Employee, and Customer, which work together to create an efficient and digital workflow.Source: ServiceNow Investor PresentationThe Now Platform is customizable and helps automate companies' production by bringing together different siloed departments under one common user interface.According to the recent Jefferies conference, Gartner puts IT Service Management (''ITSM'') at a total addressable market of $5 billion, with ServiceNow reaching approximately half. Furthermore, ServiceNow believes that its share within this market is still underrepresented, with still more upselling to be done among its 6,000 customers.In fact, ServiceNow estimates that within ITSM alone, there are 30,000 enterprises, reinforcing that ServiceNow still has plenty of runway ahead.Also, considering the COVID backdrop, investors should expect ServiceNow to have tailwinds, as companies are forced to increase the pace of their digital journeys, offering ServiceNow a fertile environment to plow ahead towards under CEO Bill McDermott's stewardship towards its revenue target of $10 billion. As you may suspect, given the positive underlying dynamics, ServiceNow raises its guidance for the year (more on this below).Accordingly, for many companies that were previously relatively content with their IT and HR product suits and used to working with patchy software, given the work from home mandate are now being practically forced into rethinking and modernizing their IT platforms.Altogether, this helped ServiceNow finish Q2 2020 with 964 customers with ACV (annual contract value) of more than $1 million. Source: Q2 2020 Investor PresentationWhat's more, given that ServiceNow has a renewal rate of 97% which it has maintained steady over the past several quarters, we can continue to expect many of these customers to remain on the platform. However, the main issue facing investors today is not so much about the impressive strides ServiceNow has made in the past, but what lies ahead for the company.Source: author's calculations; **high-end company guidanceAbove I have used the high-end of ServiceNow's guidance, assuming that the company is lowballing its estimates and will beat its own guidance (this is what investors are hoping for).The trend is in revenue growth rate is clear: although ServiceNow should be guiding for strong growth in what is a fertile environment, even if we assume that ServiceNow is to beat its estimates, its growth rates are still slowing down. Put another way, the post COVID environment doesn't appear to be as benefiting the company as much as it is being priced in.Furthermore, arguably more insightful is that ServiceNow's billings are not looking all that promising.In the SaaS world, billings are often noted as being a leading indicator of the company's future revenues. Billings is a leading performance indicator of services that are getting booked but not yet recognized as revenues.For instance, during H1 2020 billings were up 29% y/y. However, for Q3 2020 billings are expected to come in at 17% y/y, and for 2020 given the strong performance during H1 2020, this implies billings should arrive at around 24% y/y in Q4 2020. In other words, investors should not expect revenues to grow faster than billings for a prolonged period of time. Realistically, investors should start to think of ServiceNow as aiming towards growth rates at approximately 25%. Source: SA Premium ToolsConsider what analysts are expecting over the next few quarters, with ServiceNow most likely migrating towards 25% revenue run rates.There are two main aspects that investors have to be cognizant of when it comes to ServiceNow. Firstly, that realist prospects put the company on the path to growing at its revenues at 25%. Secondly, its size and hold on the market means that ServiceNow is unlikely to grow to the sky at a pace anywhere near its growth rates of 2019.Presently, ServiceNow's stock is still being priced at 20x forward sales. And I know that this is spot on in the middle of the range of what SaaS stocks are going for, but unlike other SaaS stocks, ServiceNow is not growing at a rate that supports this multiple.On the other hand, as ServiceNow starts to mature, investors should start to consider its underlying ability to generate cash flows. For its 2020 guidance, ServiceNow aims to bring close to $1.4 billion of free cash flow, putting this maturing company trading for more than 62x forward free cash flow multiple.In the way of comparison, Salesforce (CRM) is still guiding for just over 21% y/y growth rates, while its forward revenue multiple is roughly half that of ServiceNow's stock, at just 11x forward sales.During 2020, any SaaS stock was getting a blanket 20x forward multiple to sales, in a non-discerning way. This was particularly evident in March to July time frame. However, right now, since July, investors are starting to question whether valuations still make sense? Indeed, since the tech sell-off from the last few weeks, many stocks are getting small nudges towards more appropriate valuations.In sum, I consider ServiceNow fully value already towards slightly overvalued relative to its underlying potential."
4352292,105055,2020-06-06T01:04:46-04:00,"At a P/S level of 19.9x, with the current macro landscape in focus, an investment in ServiceNow is outside of my comfort zone at this time.ServiceNow expanding into new verticals could pose a risk to the focus that got the company this far. It's also adding more competitors to the mix.16x 2020 sales would be a reasonable buying point - $362/share.","Today, I want to dive deeper into a company that has, quite honestly, flown under my radar for a long time, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW). This relatively under-followed enterprise technology name is hovering around all-time highs and just had its first profitable year in almost a decade. I believe this name will continue to show signs of growth for some time to come. The question becomes is that growth worth the 19.9x P/S ratio that the company is currently carrying around?Image: ServiceNow logoServiceNow is an enterprise tool that allows companies to build automated digital workflows. Things like Incident Management, Problem Management, Change Management, and Release Management are tasks that one would be able to add some level of automation to within ServiceNow's IT Service Management (ITSM) tool.While ITSM is the largest of ServiceNow's businesses, the company also offers IT Business Management (ITBM) and IT Operations Management (ITOM) solutions. There are also non-IT products that help customer service, human resources, and security.As you can probably tell, ServiceNow does a lot. That ""a lot"" though takes care of repetitive tasks for businesses in a defined and sometimes fully automated manner, thus saving businesses time and money. Saving businesses time and money is why ServiceNow has taken revenues from ~$1B in 2015 to $3.5B in 2019. It's also why the software commands 80%+ margins.Image: Revenues by geography per Q1 Earnings PresentationMore than 80% of Fortune 500 companies are already customers of ServiceNow, and as you can see from the image above, ServiceNow has some geographic diversity.Image: ServiceNow annual revenueIf you're wondering why ServiceNow is currently commanding a 19.9x sales multiple, you need to look no further than the 38.3% CAGR revenue growth over the last five years. Over the last three years, it's 35.5%, and last year the company grew revenues at 32.6%. Sure, growth is slowing, but that's the case at (almost) every company on the planet. These numbers, for a company of ServiceNow's size, are quite impressive. They're also backed up by those 80%+ software margins, which makes for fast escalating gross margins, too.Analysts who provide revenue estimations expect that the growth will continue to fall as ServiceNow runs out of room to run with its ITSM product and begins entering new markets. With five analysts providing such guidance, the average 2020 revenues came out to $4.3B, or 24.3% growth over 2019.24.3% growth, given our current macro landscape, is great, but I'm not sure it lives up to 19.9x P/S. Then again, and a brief detour here, P/S ratios get this high in SaaS due to the margins and the ease of scaling to more customers. We should not, therefore, compare the P/S of a growing SaaS to, say, a growing consumer staple.Looking forward to 2021, analysts foresee growth slowing just a little bit more to 23.3%. As expected, analyst coverage begins to wear off a little after that. I do not wish to put my spin on revenues and value the company this high up, so I'll save that part for the ""Valuation"" section below. For now, just know that revenues are booming, and they're expected to continue doing so.Image: ServiceNow Quarterly Normalized EPSNow to the bottom line where things, at least the last few quarters, have been looking quite healthy. As you can see in the chart above, ServiceNow has returned a profit on a normalized EPS basis for the last three quarters, and those net margins have been creeping up ever so slightly.I expect this profitability will continue, and that we'll see margins continue to expand slightly year over year going forward.Image: Large and Growing TAM per Investor DeckThe simplest reason why this growth will continue is the growth of ServiceNow's total addressable market (TAM). The slide above is from ServiceNow's own investor deck where the company estimates the ""Now Platform"" will cover a market worth $165B by 2023.To start capturing a larger piece of the available $165B pie, ServiceNow will have to run up against some big named competition. This is even more so the case as ServiceNow expands further outside of IT Workflows, and into other vectors (Employee Workflows, Customer Workflows).Names that could be considered competition include Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), SAP (NYSE:SAP), Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), IBM (NYSE:IBM), VMware (NYSE:VMW), and so many more.As ServiceNow enters new verticals, it adds more incumbent competition to the mix. This gives me a sort of wariness. Unlike, say, Salesforce that sells a one-size-fits-all verticals software, ServiceNow is building tools that cater to certain niches. A lack of focus while not an issue now could become one in the future. Any investor should definitely keep an eye on that.Image: Customer expansion by year of initial signupIn the first-quarter earnings call presentation, ServiceNow provided a chart that I think bears further attention here. It shows the growth of customers by the year they signed up. So, for every $100 in contract ServiceNow had in 2010, it now has $1,340 from that same batch of customers. That chart is inclusive of losses, too.Image: Customers over $1M ACV and growth YoYServiceNow is also growing the number of customers that bring in over $1M per year at quite the pace. Last quarter, the company saw 30% year-over-year growth. This number will also slow down over time, but to see it still rapidly growing is a definite pro towards investing.One thing any potential, or current for that matter, investor should be aware of is dilution. I hate the word, and it makes me cringe whenever I think of it happening. Alas, it happens at ServiceNow, and quite frequently. Over the last year, through equity awards, the company has diluted shareholders by 3.2%.3.2% is not significant, but in the firm's latest 10-K, it acknowledged that stock-based compensation will continue to increase. Those increases in share count can come on the order of 5% per year over the next three years (program ends FY22).Given the potential for further dilution, I'm going to stick to valuing this stock on a P/S basis, as it is the metric for which we have the most information.Image: ServiceNow 5yr P/S RatioOver the last five years, the average P/S is 14.1x, with 14.4x being the median. In the last year, thanks to profitability, things have jumped a little, and ServiceNow traded for an average 17.1x or 16.6x median.Image: ServiceNow Guidance Per Q1 PresentationFrom the guidance, ServiceNow sees growth coming in at 27%. Analysts, as we discussed above, see an average of 24.3%. If we meet in the middle at 25% growth, 2020 revenues come out to $4.326B.With further dilution on the horizon, the core market being 80% penetrated, and the hefty competition seen in new spaces, I believe the current 19.9x (TTM sales) ratio to be too high an entry point. Instead, I don't think investors should initiate a position over the one-year median given the potential risks (and other places one could invest to get a sufficient return).Adding a little ""padding"" to deal with dilution, I would be OK with paying 16x sales for a company with these characteristics. Readers should know that I hate chasing (it's a surefire way to get caught up in hysteria); instead, I accept that some ships may have sailed. While I am ""bullish"" on ServiceNow, I would not personally buy the stock above my comfort level of $362 per share (16x 2020 sales).The Hideaway Scores are the bread-and-butter of High-Quality Hideaway. These simple-to-understand letter grades help an investor, at a glance, determine if an investment is worthy of further research, or if there's better potential elsewhere. No matter your investment criteria, there's a score for you (value => Price, quality => Quality, growth => Momentum scores, hybrid approach => Composite).The following are some select quantitative figures (also available for more than 4,500 equities in High-Quality Hideaway):I would never recommend selling this company, but I would not personally buy it at these prices. I think there are too many potential risks, and a haphazard macro landscape to be worried about that prevent me from buying here. As I alluded to above, one can simultaneously be ""bullish"" on the prospects of the firm while also unwilling to pay the entry fee. That's where I currently lie on ServiceNow.For $362 per share, assuming it's not a news related dip, I would consider initiating a small position in my portfolio. I would recommend that readers hold the stock at these prices, and consider adding more if the price dips below $362."

With a target price of $370.19, the upside potential is driven by:1) Long-term growth due to secular trends in digital transformation and migration to cloud computing. Top line is expected to grow at a CAGR of 27% to 30% through 2024. In addition, the Information Technology Services Management (ITSM) market will hit ~10.5bn in 2024 with NOW's share at ~45% compared to 2017’s ~35%.2) Competitive position and customer retention, with 73% ($3.3bn) of 2020 revenue already contracted. Despite the COVID-19 outbreak, NOW is positioned with an expected 97% recurring revenue.3) Expansion in customer relationship and partnerships, with FedRAMP certification and advancement in partner ecosystems with system integrators such as Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and Computer Sciences Corp.4) Healthy revenue growth and profitability despite valuation, with Rule of 40 of 58%. ServiceNow’s accrual ratio indicates strong conversion of profit to free cash flow, which is positive for the company. Underlying earnings potential is better than the current statutory bottom line the company generates. With the positive profit despite losing money last year, NOW is expected to decrease marketing expenses and increase margins.Downsides include operating in a highly competitive market, reliance on network partners and stock price correction due to the security being part of an overvalued sub-industry within the IT sector. However, no other company replicates NOW’s workflow platform and is expected to experience high growth.ServiceNow posted strong Q1FY2020 results, beating guidance and consensus, with positive guidance for a subscription revenue growth of about 29% to 30% for the full year. The CEO stated that $7tn will be invested in making work digital by 2023.Historically, IT spending indicates that an economic downturn will catalyze adoption of NOW’s workflow platform as enterprises look to cut costs through workflow automation.Source: Image created by author with data from FactSetGrowth is expected as companies shift and upgrade on data center infrastructure. Systems software spending will be positively impacted by the high growth in digital transformation, which is expected to strengthen offerings in cloud and security software. In addition, the systems software sub-industry will benefit from increased M&A activities in the IT industry, as many firms have been positioning themselves in offering multiple comprehensive services, such as a ‘one-stop shop.’ Software revenue will experience a CAGR of 7% throughout 2021 with an 18% gain from subscriptions, which reflects a shift to cloud offerings (Source: IDC).ServiceNow’s sustainable growth is driven by digital transformation and migration to cloud computing. The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has dramatically accelerated the revolution as work-from-home resulted in a greater need and demand for cloud computing and virtual integration of corporate ‘workflow.’ NOW is expected to target a total addressable market (TAM) that is estimated to be $110bn, as it provides a differentiated workflow platform. The company is expecting a 27% subscription growth and a revenue growth of 29% to 30% in the next two years. We are forecasting NOW to grow its revenue at a CAGR of about 26% to 30% until 2024.Furthermore, NOW’s position in the Information Technology Services Management (ITSM) market is expected to remain strong against legacy competitors such as the former ITSM market share leader BMC Software (acquired by private equity firm KKR). In 2017, the ITSM market stood at $3.4bn with NOW’s share at ~35%. The firm’s annual growth in the ITSM is forecasted to expand 16% to 19%, as the market hits ~$10.5bn in 2024 with NOW’s share at ~45% (Source: CFRA). ITSM software allows digitizing and automating any specified workflow, in addition to software cognition techniques such as machine & deep learning that fuel workflow digitization and automation. As more data-trained cognition is added to the workflow-based software, more tangible and efficient ROI is expected to be produced versus applications such as Enterprise Resource Management (ERP), Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Human Capital Management (HCM).With the rising relevance in customers’ IT spending and a greater need in guidance handling their IT infrastructure, NOW has been experiencing an increase in revenue from winning new customers. This will reduce Sales & Marketing expense as a percentage of revenue than many of its SaaS peers (will result in a higher bottom-line growth). In addition, the company is implementing the ‘traditional tech strategic plan’ of ‘land and expand’ as it grows by gaining new customers and by upselling additional services to existing clients. Although the pandemic has shortened expectations of FY2020, NOW stood with 97% recurring revenue for Q1FY2020 and is expected to maintain 94% recurring revenue with $3.3bn or 73% of 2020 revenue already contracted. Lastly, the disparate competition allows NOW to gain significant market share as it is the only non-legacy firm that provides ITSM and emerging products – a new class of enterprise software because it essentially positions across all software assets and combines the efficiencies altogether.Source: Image created by author with Company dataThe company is expanding into various industry verticals with industry-specific workflows including finance and telecom, as well as within federal, state and local governments. For instance, the firm received US government Fed RAMP High Impact Provisional Authority to Operate certification in 2019. The certification allows federal agencies to accelerate in contracting with ServiceNow. This makes NOW the third ever SaaS vendor to be given the FedRAMP certification. The receival may be due to NOW’s IT asset management (ITAM) deal with the US Department Veterans Affair, which is also the largest ITAM deal made. In addition, NOW is advancing its partner ecosystem with systems integrators such as Accenture and Computer Sciences Corp. The firm is also collaborating with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in efforts to discharge implementation tasks and extend its sales reach. Historically, IT spending indicates that an economic downturn will catalyze adoption of NOW’s workflow platform as enterprises look to cut costs through workflow automation.Source: Image created by author with Company dataNOW has seen top line grow at a rate of above 30% in 2018 and 2019 with bottom line slowly increasing from the negative. In the past, NOW was proactive in doubling down on marketing expenses to drive revenue growth and generate scalability, which is normal with SaaS companies. With high customer retention and a strong competitive advantage, NOW is expected to see a faster decline in marketing expenses than many of its SaaS peers. Rule of 40, which is an industry metric for software companies, sidesteps the valuation depiction for high-growth companies that do not show profitability and requires both revenue growth and profitability (FCF margin) to be at least 40%. NOW’s growth and profitability are deemed healthy: Rev. Growth (34%) + FCF Margin (24%) = 58%.Source: Image created by author with Company dataSource: Image created by author with data from FactSetMany software stocks within the information technology have showcased high growth in earnings and price. Although the companies above are not direct competitors of ServiceNow, the company showcases solid consistency in valuation.Source: Image created by author with data from FactSetAs a high-growth company, ServiceNow maintains a strong financial position against its peers. The company’s debt-to-equity ratio significantly reduced from 99.2% to 30.9% over the past five years. The company’s debt is covered 194.9% by operating cash flow and coverage of interest payment is not a concern as NOW earns more interest than it pays. Lastly, with Sales & Marketing expenses decreasing, gross margin is also expected to increase to 84% in 2023 (Source: CRFA).ServiceNow competes in an industry that evolves rapidly. If the firm is not able to keep up with the pace of innovation in integrating digital transformation into the workflow solutions, customers may choose other competitors despite the high recurring revenue for NOW. The company must accurately predict the customers’ changing business needs, priorities and adoption practices, including technology infrastructure.An increasing portion of NOW’s revenue is generated by sales through the firm’s network of partners. In addition, the company increasingly relies on the partners to provide professional support, including customer implementations that are not directly provided by NOW. Additionally, the partners may utilize NOW’s platform to develop products and services that could potentially compete with products and services that the firm offers. Lastly, if NOW fails to manage and grow the network of partners, the firm’s ability to sell its products and services may be impacted which could harm operations, results and growth rate.Many software stocks within the information technology are overvalued - trading at a premium. The high-growth stocks which are mainly driven by digital transformation may be subject to a revaluation. In addition, uncertain conditions of the impact of COVID-19 may result in a bear market. This may affect NOW’s stock price subsequently, despite the company’s excellent performance.In conclusion, I recommend a buy for ServiceNow. The company will experience long-term growth due to secular trends in digital transformation and migration to cloud computing, will possess recurring revenue of ~97%, expand in customer relationships and partnerships, maintain a healthy revenue growth and profitability despite valuation, with Rule of 40 of 58%. With the positive profit despite losing money last year, NOW is expected to decrease marketing expenses and increase margins."
4347101,105539,2020-05-13T11:20:39-04:00,"Looking through conversations from resellers and customers, ServiceNow's breadth of offering stands out.I will compare its upcoming offerings in the FP&A space with other.These channel checks show how powerful the ServiceNow platform is, and I recommend a buy.The Adobe partnership also proves a powerful product add-on.","I recently wrote an article on the strength of the management team and a high-level introduction to ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW). I dug deeper into alternative data sources, namely channel checks with resellers and customers. This data helped me pinpoint the current differentiation ServiceNow has versus competition. It gave me further conviction in the name, and I recommend a buy on this stock.Additionally, I will discuss the implications of the Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) partnerships.Source: ServiceNow websiteFirst, we will dive into recent channel checks. ServiceNow has built out some functionality in the FP&A space that overlap with BlackLine (NASDAQ:BL). Here is some color on that competitive dynamic.First, we spoke to a reseller of ServiceNow (undisclosed). This reseller focuses just on selling ServiceNow, so they had a good sense of the product and market.First, they mentioned the personnel hire.From this executive, we learned the addition of Bill McDermott is a big deal. If resellers are talking about it, it changes how they pitch the product slightly and how end customers are thinking about it. The first major change this reseller spoke of is building an internal finance piece to complete the ServiceNow platform.Second, they discussed the power of modularization and the platform that ServiceNow has built. Clients are approaching from different business units (HR, compliance, and security) to ask for a specific ServiceNow module. This leads to upselling on existing accounts - a key part of the thesis for investing in ServiceNow. They mentioned a lot of growth in the HR module.Third, the reseller was positive on future growth potential. He described big pockets, such as the federal opportunity, which have yet to be explored. For the core ITSM space, there are still big opportunities within the Fortune 1000.Fourth, ServiceNow has a reputation in the market for holding firm on pricing in new deals. This gives us a hint to some of the pricing power the company is able to demonstrate in the market and is a good sign for future profitability.Lastly, the reseller said they do not see major threats on the horizon. The company has integrated well across the ecosystem and built a diverse, broad set of capabilities.Source: TegusIn recent weeks, ServiceNow announced a partnership with Adobe. This is significant because it allows ServiceNow customers to save time in document and contract management with Adobe Sign.Source: Press ReleaseIn addition, this helps accelerate the HR part of the ServiceNow platform, which also happens to be one of the fastest growing segments. It allows for easy routing, signing, and document tracking. It is interesting to note that ServiceNow chose Adobe and not DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) for this partnership.From a valuation standpoint, my models show a 21% upside from current levels. The business is trading below peers on a free cash flow basis but is generally in line or more expensive on other metrics like revenue.Source: Internal modelThese comparables show that profitable tech names are rare and usually deserve to trade at a premium.Source: Internal modelMany of our channel checks emphasized the CEO change. As investors, we have to keep an eye on the execution of the new CEO and also turnover, which is common when such a change occurs.Our checks also mentioned that ServiceNow is a premium product and that potential future growth may be limited by the price tag.Another consideration is defection to up and coming players like Snowflake. ServiceNow needs to find ways to keep talent.Further, there is not much room for execution downside here from a valuation standpoint."

Why are its revenues decelerating?ServiceNow's main competitor Atlassian (TEAM) continues to increase its revenues and push the quality of its product:Source: Gartner peer insightsAs you can see above, the percentage of five-star ratings for Atlassian's products are substantially higher at 54% compared with just 40% for ServiceNow's products.In the video below, I have gone through and shown in very easy to understand terms why ServiceNow's free cash flow is not as strong as it first meets the eye.As I demonstrate in the video, investors should be cautious of ServiceNow's free cash flow.Amongst other pertinent concerns noted in the video, such as its capitalization of expenditures, the bulk of ServiceNow's costs are non-cash costs in the form of stock-based compensation.What's more, during the animal spirits of 2020, investors are willing to turn a blind eye to these pesky but very real costs.Indeed, please note the table below:Source: Q2 2020 guidance presented alongside its Q1 2020 Press statementWe can see that the bulk of ServiceNow's costs, its stock-based compensation, gets added back to its non-GAAP operating margin.Without this adding back its underlying costs, its GAAP operating margin reaches just 2% for Q2 2020.Since 2018, ServiceNow's valuation continues to be carried by an expansion to its multiples, rather than its underlying fundamentals picking up speed.Put another way, it is ServiceNow's P/Sales multiple which continues to rapidly expand. Specifically, we can see that for 2018, its P/Sales was 12.8x, while for 2019, it reached 16.8x. Presently, its P/Sales is red hot and just shy of 21x.For a company that is ever so marginally profitable, paying such a huge premium leaves investors with no further upside potential.As I show in the video, ServiceNow's free cash flow is stronger than it looks. Indeed, not only does ServiceNow capitalize increasing portions of its expenditure, but at the same time, its stock-based compensation continues to increase at a rapid clip.Meanwhile, its revenue growth rates continue to decelerate. Finally, truly compounding its troubles for shareholders, its valuation is amongst the most expensive it has been during the past few years.Altogether, investors are being primed for disappointment."
4346767,104952,2020-05-12T15:48:13-04:00,"ServiceNow's strong product-market fit is its key success factor in the enterprise market.
        Its workflow tool proves to be mission-critical outside enterprise ITSM.
        The number of clients with ACV larger than $1 million has doubled over the last 3 years. As of Q1, it has 933 enterprise clients with over $1 million ACV.
        We see growth opportunities in both enterprise HR and CSM going forward. ITSM share of new ACV dropped by 200 bps while HR/CSM grew by 300 bps.
        We also expect ServiceNow to land its 1,000th enterprise client in the next two quarters.","Founded in 2004, ServiceNow (NOW) is an interesting large-cap opportunity that stands out in the enterprise software space. Its digital workflow platform has become a mission-critical tool across many enterprise organizations. As of Q1 2020, 80% of the Fortune 500 are ServiceNow’s customers. In the near-term, we have not seen any signs of a slowdown as sales remain solid despite the COVID-19 situation. In Q1, the business posted a +30% growth with the number of deals with $1 million of ACV or higher increased by 48% YoY.In our view, ServiceNow’s strong product-market fit in the enterprise market is its key strength. The company’s IT Service Management (ITSM) workflow platform was the initial entry point into the enterprise market. Today, it has customizable and enterprise-grade workflow solutions built for IT, customer service (CSM), and HR functions.(source: servicenow.com)Unlike some other enterprise tools like CRM or training platforms, an enterprise workflow platform can expand across relevant divisions and still retain much of its mission-critical nature. As an enterprise is a complex organization, workflow functionality plays an important role in any digital transformation, given its capacity to automate, simplify, and improve digital activities. In a lot of cases, IT workflow automation is even a prerequisite to other enterprise digital transformation needs.(source: Q1 earnings call slide)Given the mission criticality, ServiceNow's enterprise workflow platform has created a ~$3.5 billion a year business. ITSM has been the traditional use case, though HR and CSM have gained meaningful traction. In Q1 2020, HR and CSM use cases grew by 300 bps while ITSM use cases decreased by 200 bps. As a result, we see growing opportunities across HR and CSM in particular. Moreover, ServiceNow has also teamed up with Adobe (ADBE) to provide an integrated and advanced Customer Experience/CSM offering.ServiceNow also has a very defensible business. Its product-market fit enables the enterprise market penetration early in the game to increase the entry barrier, while the mission criticality allows it to expand and increase the switching cost. Many SaaS players aim for the enterprise market post-IPO in the hope of better growth and profitability, given the larger ACV (Annual Contract Value). However, many of them also do not have as mission-critical offerings as ServiceNow. Often, this results in workarounds that create a longer sales cycle that shows up as typical sales execution issues brought up during one of their earnings calls.(source: Q1 earnings call)On the other hand, ServiceNow does not have such problems. Over the last 3 - 4 years, the number of ServiceNow clients with ACV greater than $1 million has more than doubled to 933 in Q1. In the next two quarters, we expect it to land its 1,000th large enterprise client. The company’s annual marketing event that will be held online for the first time in Q2, in particular, will potentially accelerate the progress. Based on the Q1 earnings call, there have been 100,000 registered audiences for the event, which is double the average number of audiences typically seen in the past years.We do not see too many long-term risk factors around the stock, aside from the fact that there are limited upside opportunities outside the enterprise market. In our opinion, there is not as critical demand for a workflow automation platform in the higher-velocity, but lower-tier markets such as the SME or midsize companies. In those segments, we have seen players like Appian (APPN) underperforming for some time. At the moment, ServiceNow’s best growth strategy is to stay in the enterprise market and expand both its verticals or use cases.When valuing large-cap growth opportunities like ServiceNow, we consider factors such as growth, scale, and cash flows profitability. Using the rule of 40, which is essentially a proxy to growth and profitability, ServiceNow’s +30% growth and 26% FCF margin mean it surpasses the rule of 40 benchmark by ~16 points. When we look at it in the context of scale, it is even more impressive. By the end of 2019, the company has a $6.6 billion RPO (Remaining Performance Obligation), which it will realize half as much throughout 2020. Given the ~$3.5 billion of revenue in 2019, the company will already secure ~94% of its 2019 revenue for the year.(CRM vs NOW vs WDAY vs SPLK vs OKTA. source: stockrow)At the same time, the mission-critical nature of the platform and exposure to mostly enterprise clients mean that the COVID-19 will have little impact on the business, as we have learned in Q1. Considering that and the strong fundamentals and moat, the 19x P/S is highly justifiable. In the peer group, ServiceNow has the best balance between growth and profitability while having the highest Rule-of-40 score of 56. From that standpoint, Okta (OKTA) looks expensive with the ~34x P/S. Splunk (SPLK)'s seemingly low ~9.8x P/S is also driven by its negative FCF margin, which means that its +30% growth may not be sustainable just yet. Furthermore, the high level of fragmentation and competition in the CRM and HCM market may also put pressure on both Salesforce (CRM) and Workday (WDAY)'s valuation. Given that Salesforce is a much larger company than its peers, there is also an expectation of slowing growth baked into its valuation.After Salesforce, we also have not found too many cloud software companies with a strong enterprise product-market fit. The two enterprise-focused companies, Workday and Splunk, for instance, are still less profitable and slower-growing than ServiceNow despite being the smaller companies. Considering the ~190 million shares outstanding, expected revenue of $4.4 billion, and also a maintained 19x P/S, we see a path to $440 per share at the end of FY 2020."
4347696,102007,2020-05-14T16:10:29-04:00,"ServiceNow provides cloud-based digital workflow platforms for IT service management, HR, and customer service.The company has best-in-class top-line growth and scale, and its SaaS model provides revenue predictability and visibility.We believe ServiceNow is the best way to capture the accelerated transition to digital workflows but its recent relative outperformance gives us pause; we recommend waiting for better entry points.","ServiceNow (NOW) has been one of the stronger performers among enterprise service players as investors began to appreciate the secular tailwinds for the company. Coming out of COVID-19, we think ServiceNow will become ever more present in the corporate world as corporations shift towards remote working and further digitize infrastructure.While many industries have been decimated by the ongoing pandemic, ServiceNow becomes ever more important to its clients many of whom are have shifted towards working from home for most of their employees. ServiceNow is a leading cloud service provider of enterprise software solutions and it began in the IT segment. Over the years, it has expanded beyond its reliance on IT service management to expand into customer service and HR. ServiceNow essentially allows a company to standardize and streamline its business process to drive performance and efficiency. It started its presence in IT and has been expanding to other areas as the world moves towards digitization of workflows and, amid the pandemic, working from home arrangements. These are all secular tailwinds benefiting cloud service providers such as ServiceNow.(Source: IR Deck) Back in 2013, IT workflows accounted for 95% of ServiceNow's revenue but that number has since come down to only 66% in Q1 2020. The company remains heavily focused on the IT segment but its push into HR and customer workflows have paid off. All three verticals are essential to corporations even under today's crisis. Under the subscription model, it is not difficult to understand why investors have piled into technology stocks due to their revenue visibility and cash flow profile. Importantly, ServiceNow's HR offerings are focused on improving workflows between HR and other departments that do not compete directly with traditional HCM vendors such as Workday (WDAY), SAP (SAP), or Salesforce (CRM). (Source: IR Deck)There will be an acceleration of the adoption of the digital workflow by companies in all industries. With the majority of workers now working from home, it is easy to conceive a world where companies handle most of its IT, HR, and customer service workflows on an integrated cloud platform. That is why we think ServiceNow's total addressable market just expanded significantly as a result of the current pandemic. While it is not easy to quantify the impact, directionally the positive momentum should be meaningful and long-lasting. It is also important to realize that this is not a new trend but rather a bring-forward of a secular theme that has been playing out over the last many years. The pandemic has brought about changes in workplace and business interactions which is favorable to ServiceNow.ServiceNow currently has a market cap of $81 billion and trades at ~15x 2021 revenue which at the high end among its SaaS software peers. The higher multiple is partly due to its superior growth profile which makes sense. For example, Oracle (ORCL) has not been growing for years and is expected to remain flat, which corresponds to the lowest trading multiple in this group. Adobe (ADBE) is one of the most successful examples of a transformation to a SaaS model and is trading at 12x 2021 sales. (Source: Public Filings and Bloomberg)From another perspective, we think ServiceNow has likely been overbought on a short-term basis as the stock is up 30% YTD, a significant divergence from the rest of the group. Part of the recent rally was due to a strong 2020 Q1 earnings and management provided a rosy outlook. During Q1, subscription revenue grew 36% from last year and the Remaining Performance Obligation grew 32% to $6.6 billion with a 97% renewal rate. The company reported strong margins and cash flow as less traveling benefited cost lines. Management conveyed confidence in their guidance supported by the visibility into subscription billings which are 50% driven by backlogs, 25% by renewal, and 25% by new customers. In other words, around 80% of the 2020 revenue is already accounted for by signed contracts. The strength of the SaaS model has never been clearer during the current crisis as investors appreciate the predictability and visibility into future revenue and cash flow. When you add in the mission-critical nature of the product and services, ServiceNow is in a very good spot to ride out the current storm relatively intact.(Source: Bloomberg)We think ServiceNow represents the best-in-class SaaS enterprise software play in the market right now, albeit at an expensive multiple. Investors have bid up ServiceNow's multiple in light of a strong Q1 and confident tone from the management. We think there are lots to like about this stock including its SaaS model, global scale, top-of-class renewal and growth, product innovation, and overall execution track record. However, we are also conscious of the recent rally relative to its peers so we would await better entry points. For existing shareholders, we think the secular shift towards digital workflow will only accelerate due to COVID-19, and ServiceNow is one of the best-positioned to capitalize on that trend.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Under the leadership of its new CEO Bill McDermott, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) continued to report a stellar quarter. The stock even climbed to a 52-week high recently.ServiceNow’s FinancialsServiceNow’s first quarter revenues grew 33% over the year to $1.046 billion, ahead of the market’s expectations of $1.02 billion. Adjusted earnings grew 63% to $1.09 per share and were also significantly ahead of the market’s forecast of $0.95 per share.For the quarter, subscription revenues grew 34% over the year to $995 million, ahead of the Street’s forecast of $978.4 million. Professional services and other revenues grew 6% to $52 million. The company announced that it has closed 37 transactions with more than $1 million in average contract value (ACV).ServiceNow expects to end the second quarter with subscription revenues of $1-$1.01 billion, missing the Street’s forecast of $1.02 billion. ServiceNow reduced its fiscal year subscription revenue expectations to $4.19 billion compared with the earlier forecast of $4.23 billion. While most companies are not publishing an outlook, it is interesting to note that ServiceNow is confident enough to publish it.ServiceNow’s Platform GrowthServiceNow continues to drive adoption of its platform through the launch of several new apps and AI initiatives. To address the pandemic, it has launched four key apps that help organizations with better crisis management and business outcomes. Of the four apps, the Emergency Response Operations app was developed by the Washington State’s Department of Health on the Now platform. It help the department to digitize processes and enable quick allocation of critical Incident Management Team positions.The other three apps include the Emergency Outreach, Emergency Self Report and Emergency Exposure Management workflow apps. These were developed in-house by the ServiceNow team and help organizations manage their workflow designs better in the current situations. Since the time of the launch, these apps have already registered more than 5,000 installations.ServiceNow is also leveraging AI in the development of its Platform services. In March this year, it released Orlando, its most innovative Now Platform release ever. Orlando features Now Intelligence that provides customers with access to AI, analytics, and mobile capabilities across the Now Platform and can support any workflow design experience. For instance, a ServiceNow virtual assistant on Orlando can help employees request and reset passwords based on a few questions asked by the assistant. The system uses natural language processing to understand the request and then acts upon it. ServiceNow believes that Orlando is its biggest product launch in a decade. With its predictive analysis capabilities, the tool will help push ServiceNow deeper into the enterprise segment. Earlier this year, I had talked about how SaaS companies need a PaaS strategy to drive growth to the next level. I think ServiceNow is trying to follow a comprehensive PaaS strategy. It allows developers to build apps on the Now platform that can also be accessed by other organizations through their app store. ServiceNow does not divulge detailed statistics and usage metrics about these apps. But I think ServiceNow focuses on large system integrators, not smaller startups. I would have liked to see them provide similar commitment to the startup ecosystem.ServiceNow is looking to hit $10 billion in annual revenues in the next few years. Its trajectory may have slowed down a bit this year, but the company believes that hitting the milestone is inevitable. Its stock is currently trading at $381.83 with a market cap of $72.8 billion. It hit a 52-week high of $386.57 this week. In October last year, the stock was trading at a 52-week low of $213.99.Original PostEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."
4345914,35181,2020-05-11T04:05:22-04:00,ServiceNow recently posted strong Q1 2020 results with encouraging guidance for 29-30% subscription revenue growth for the full year.The company has strong free cash flow margin and easily meets the Rule of 40.The stock price appears to be slightly overvalued relative to its peers.The breakout to an all-time high signifies that it is time to buy.,"We are witnessing a historic paradigm shift that is forcing businesses to reinvent their processes. This paradigm shift is known as ""digital transformation"", a phenomenon that some people consider to be the fourth leg of the industrial revolution. While this transformation was going to happen anyway, the pandemic has dramatically accelerated the revolution. What would normally take years or decades is occurring in weeks and months.Let's thank god that Led Zeppelin was in its prime in the 1970s. Had they written Stairway to Heaven today, the ""stairway"" would be 5G and ""heaven"" would be the cloud!ServiceNow, Inc. (NOW) is the poster child for digital transformation, and it just turned in an earnings report that can only be described as remarkable given the current market conditions.The earnings call occurred in a week that has been exciting all around with several of the software stocks that I track breaking out to all-time highs. These stocks include Wix.com Ltd. (WIX), Atlassian (TEAM), Twilio Inc. (TWLO), and Okta, Inc. (OKTA), among others. Too many to list, in fact. There are so many digital transformation stocks breaking out that I'm having difficulty deciding which ones to write about! But I definitely have to cover ServiceNow, as it is the poster child for SaaS.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)It is impossible to predict how ServiceNow will perform for the remainder of 2020, but the company management didn't blink when expressing confidence in their ability to achieve what I consider to be strong guidance for next quarter and the fiscal year, given the market conditions.While future performance is uncertain, we do know that the company has a strong balance sheet with $2.2 billion in cash, $6.6 billion in RPO, strong revenue growth, and a strong free cash flow margin. ServiceNow should be in good shape once the pandemic scare subsides and global growth restarts.One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. The metric sidesteps the valuation dilemma for high-growth companies that generally don't show profits. The Rule of 40 allows for both revenue growth and profitability (expressed as a margin) in combination such that they must add up to at least 40%. Analysts use various figures for profitability. I use the free cash flow margin.The rationale for the Rule of 40 is as follows. If a company grows by more than 40% annually, then you can turn a blind eye to negative free cash flow to some extent. On the other hand, if a company grows by less than 40%, then it should have a positive free cash flow to make up for the less-than-ideal growth.This rule accommodates both young, high-growth companies as well as mature, moderate-growth companies. Young companies tend to have high revenue growth but are burning cash. Mature companies have lower revenue growth, but they make up in terms of free cash flow. The 40% threshold is somewhat arbitrary but typically divides the digital transformation stock universe in half, separating the best stocks from the so-so ones.For a further description of the rule and calculation, please refer to a previous article I have written.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Paint)In ServiceNow's case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 32% + 29% = 61%Its score is much higher than the necessary 40% needed to fulfill the rule of thumb, suggesting that this company has a healthy balance between growth and profitability.There are numerous techniques for valuing stocks. Some analysts use fundamental ratios such as P/E, P/S, EV/P, or EV/S. I believe that one should not employ a simple ratio, and the reason is simple. Higher-growth stocks are valued more than lower-growth stocks, and rightly so. Growth is a significant parameter in discounted cash flow valuation.Therefore, I employ a technique that uses a scatter plot to determine relative valuation for the stock of interest versus the remaining 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe. The Y-axis represents the enterprise value/forward gross profit estimate*, while the X-axis is the estimated forward Y-o-Y sales growth.* Please note that I am using ""gross profit estimate"" instead of my usual ""sales estimate"" in the calculation.The plot below illustrates how ServiceNow stacks up against the other stocks on a relative basis.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red and represents an average valuation based on next year's sales growth. The higher the anticipated revenue growth, the higher the valuation. In this instance, ServiceNow is situated moderately above the best-fit line, suggesting that the company is slightly overvalued on a relative basis. I do not view this level of valuation should prevent investors from buying into this momentum stock.While I do not consider ServiceNow to be particularly overvalued on a relative basis, it could be argued that digital transformation stocks as a group are all quite overvalued and are subject to a revaluation at some point in time.The current stock market action reminds me of the dot.com era, immediately prior to the crash starting in 2000. Many work-from-home plays such as Zoom (ZM) and Shopify (SHOP) have exceptionally high valuations. If we see a market crash due to the extreme valuation of some software stocks, then ServiceNow will likely get swept along with the crowd.ServiceNow has recently broken out to an all-time high. When a breakout occurs, it usually signifies more bullishness to come. ServiceNow is a strong company with an annual revenue growth of 32% and a positive free cash flow margin of 29%, allowing it to easily fulfill the Rule of 40.The company management provided guidance in the Q1 2020 earnings call of 29-30% subscription revenue growth for Q2 and for the full year. This guidance is superb considering the current global economic conditions.The stock movement is strong, the company's fundamentals are strong, and, in my opinion, the stock price is just slightly overvalued. I expect that ServiceNow will come out of the current market conditions in a strong position and continue to be the poster child for the digital revolution. The stock price is on the move, and you should never question the market... After all, the market is always right."
4350578,102101,2020-05-28T12:28:07-04:00,ServiceNow enjoys favorable demand-side tailwinds that will uphold its growth narrative.It is moving faster than most competitors as it extends the breadth of its capabilities.ServiceNow has the potential to keep outperforming due to its attractive valuation factors.,"Source: SitsiServiceNow (NOW) has proven the ability to gain market share beyond its core capabilities in the IT workflow space. It is also investing in technologies to add more value to its customers. Besides its growth factor, its margins trend and cash flow growth are also attractive. Its billings guide leaves little room to worry about liquidity. If it outperforms its growth guidance, the current valuation will offer more gains.Market OpportunityServiceNow estimates its total addressable market at ~$110B. It offers cloud-based IT operations management and digital workflow solutions for large enterprises (80% of Fortune 500 companies and 8600+ global enterprise customers) across the globe. It is the highest-ranked player in the ITSM (IT service management) space.There is no doubt ServiceNow has attained the escape velocity in which CFOs and CTOs will have no choice but to switch to its platform and increase usage given ServiceNow's deep penetration amongst large enterprises.PotentialServiceNow is capitalizing on the rapid adoption of digital transformation initiatives across large enterprises. Its large enterprise focus has spared it from the COVID-19 induced carnage, which mostly impacts SMBs, though 20% of its business comprises customers in the sharing economy.Regardless, the ease of deploying its solutions means ServiceNow sees little downside impact implementing new projects. Service fulfillment partners will equally face limited disruption deploying ServiceNow's offerings.Management remains confident in delivering double-digit growth this year. ServiceNow's growth guidance is a combination of a solid ARR (annual recurring revenue) base, expanding ACV (annual contract value) amongst large enterprises, and greenfield wins. Examining some of the numbers from the last earnings call, ServiceNow reported 37 deals greater than $1m (+48%y/y) in the previous quarter. 18 of the top 20 deals include three or more products.These positive demand-side trends and catalysts drive my bullish conviction on ServiceNow's growth factor.ProductsIT Workflow: includes capabilities in incident management, service management, operations management, and change release management. ServiceNow is following the general trend of SaaS companies enhancing the availability, efficiency, and user experience of customers using its solutions. This includes the release of new products like the Now mobile app, and a virtual chatbot.Features like predictive intelligence, omnichannel capture, social tools are creative ways to drive user engagement and retention. ServiceNow is on the right path with its product strategy in this space.Employee Workflow: this extends the use cases of its workflow technology into verticals like Finance and HR. Use cases in HR include knowledge management, document management, and employee onboarding.In finance, ServiceNow provides finance close automation tools to help accounting teams. ServiceNow's solutions are meant to complement and integrate into existing ERP (enterprise resource planning) solutions.Customer Workflow: ServiceNow has also found use cases in the customer service space. Capabilities in collaboration, knowledge management, and performance analytics offer convincing adoption of its offerings.This also extends into capabilities in AIOps, asset management, and improvement management. ServiceNow has more than 50 CSM customers spending greater than $1m.Now platform: ServiceNow also has an app engine and an app store to empower developers. This makes it easy to understand its huge success amongst large enterprises. Providing actionable insights and intelligence at scale using AI (artificial intelligence) and ML (machine learning) is an underexplored market in several IT verticals. ServiceNow has identified this opportunity, and it has invested a lot in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning.FinancialsServiceNow's growth factor is attractive relative to the strength of its nearest competitor in the ITSM (IT service management) space. Having 933 enterprises paying more than $1m in ACV is not an easy feat. When a platform or solution attains such a level of market penetration, the case for continual adoption is even more compelling. Its success means it can build upon its years of experience to solve complex business problems for its clients. That's the power of the network effect at play. Throw in its expanding capabilities into adjacent verticals and its rapid pace of innovation, and we have an unstoppable player that is bound to keep winning in the near term.The implication of these translates to improving margins as average revenue per customer grows. While acquisitions and R&D spend might mask its true earnings potential, with time, ServiceNow's margins will expand to reflect the maximum strength of its platform. ServiceNow has an attractive FCF (free cash flow) margin at 30%+. Going forward, maintaining a 30%+ FCF margin won't be tough as earnings become a bigger contribution to operating cash flow. FCF will also benefit from growing deferred revenue, and the potential release of its valuation allowance.CompetitorsITSM: ServiceNow leads competitors in the IT workflow space by a significant margin. This is its bread and butter. The other player ranking as a leader in the ITSM space is BMC (recently acquired by KKR). Gartner claims NOW's ITSM revenue is more than 3x its closest competitor. An implication of its leadership position is that ServiceNow will be highly recommended by system partners and integrators. The flywheel has no choice but to spin faster as NOW gains more customers.Low-code: a good use for ServiceNow's workflow solution is in the low code space. The low code market evolved due to a dearth of highly skilled software developers.Low code application platforms abstract a lot of programming complexity to help enterprises develop, ship, and deploy apps faster. The leaders in this space include Microsoft (MSFT), Appian (APPN), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), Mendix (acquired by Siemens), and OutSystems. Alongside Oracle (ORCL) and Zoho, ServiceNow is considered a challenger. While Alphabet (GOOGL) wasn't ranked, it recently made a low code acquisition in addition to App Maker. Going forward, winners in the low code space will rely on a combination of product innovation and platform adoption. ServiceNow is highly regarded for its depth of innovation. Adoption should naturally follow as users build creative projects that extend beyond incident management using its platform.CRM CEC: ServiceNow plays in this space alongside leading CRM vendors like Salesforce and Zendesk (ZEN). This space also has ERP vendors like Oracle and SAP (NYSE:SAP). ServiceNow plays in this space because its workflow technology helps in the customer engagement process. Investors will begin to notice a pattern in which a productivity tool finds compelling use cases in adjacent verticals. Such a tool can dominate in other verticals if management is quick to innovate and master a winning sales strategy. This ensures it captures enough market share to keep expanding its average revenue per customer.Asset management: ServiceNow's offerings also have use cases in IT asset management. This helps to monitor usage and IT license contracts to stay compliant with the latest regulations. The efficient deployment of asset management tools can also evolve into use cases that extend into the DevOps and cybersecurity segments. Leaders in this space include Flexera and Snow Software.ServiceNow's strength in this space revolves around its ability to sell into its customer base. The potential to partner with DevOps and security players can help extend the visibility of ServiceNow's offerings. Like Elastic (ESTC) search extends into the APM and SIEM space, NOW's asset management solutions can disrupt the way consumers approach vulnerability management and DevOps.Risk management: the IRM (integrated risk management) space involves the use of IT solutions to automate and aggregate workflow around risk management. Use cases include policy and compliance management, audit management, and business continuity management.ServiceNow is a leader in this space. Other top players in this space include IBM (IBM) and Dell (NYSE:DELL). ServiceNow's strength in this space stems from its global reach and strong partnership network.Across most of the highlighted use cases, the ITSM space is ServiceNow's strongest niche. The low-code space is the most promising as it plays into the dearth of skilled developers across the globe. Management highlighted wins in the customer service management space, indicating its strong grasp of this space. There isn't enough evidence to doubt ServiceNow's ability to keep growing across all segments. Most organizations don't know how effective IT productivity tools are until they master their full capabilities. In most cases, mastery is accelerated when enterprises are aware that competitors are leveraging a tool to outperform. Expanding the capabilities of its offering will drive the value add to NOW's customers. This will translate into better margins and sustainable growth.MacroServiceNow sells into large enterprises, most of which have built enough liquidity to weather short-term market volatility. Also, more enterprises will adopt ServiceNow in troubling times if their purchase strategy is to adopt the best ITSM vendor to match the productivity of their competitors. The major near term concern is the COVID-19 impact to 20% of its customers in the hospitality space.InvestorsThe Street has been bullish on ServiceNow. NOW has recovered most of its COVID-19 induced losses. Management's guidance and conviction during the last conference call were positive. ServiceNow is now trading above analysts' average price target of $363. Analysts have an average revenue growth estimate of 26% in CY'20, and 25% in CY'21. These bullish sentiments and forecasts have lifted its valuation in recent quarters.Valuation (Sandbox)ServiceNow enjoys a combination of solid growth, margins, and cash flow. These attractive valuation factors will continue to drive positive momentum. The Street is valuing ServiceNow for 25%+ revenue growth in the near term. While ServiceNow has the capabilities to deliver, it has to maintain the double-digit y/y growth to keep commanding a double digit sales multiple. There isn't enough negative headwind to prevent it from outperforming in the near term.Besides the impact (COVID-19 induced) to its customers in the sharing economy, ServiceNow's risk factor revolves around the oversubscription to cloud stocks. Most cloud stocks are trading at record-high valuation multiples.ServiceNow has a bright future. It is able to fight for market share outside its primary ITSM/ITOM space. Its strong ARR and renewal rate suggest customers are able to solve their business problems with its offerings. It is well-positioned in the midst of more competition as it expands beyond the IT workflow space. While it is priced for perfection, attractive valuation factors will continue to drive positive momentum. As a result, ServiceNow has strong potentials to keep outperforming in the near term.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."
4342967,41961,2020-05-05T07:04:43-04:00,"ServiceNow is an invaluable, mission-critical partner for IT, HR and Customer Service departments within global enterprises.The business delivered strong quarterly results, and, more importantly, solid guidance.ServiceNow's resilience is unfortunately not a well-kept secret, and its valuation has risen, however, its stability and consistency plays an important role in a portfolio during difficult times.","This earnings season will increasingly see a polarization in results between the 'have's and the 'have nots' and ServiceNow (NOW) is a business that will find itself firmly in the 'haves' category.ServiceNow delivered a very strong quarter where revenues increased to $1.06B, representing a 34% year-on-year growth. What was particularly impressive about this result was that subscription revenues were $995M, meaning almost the entirety of ServiceNow's revenues are locked in with a high level of predictability.Where ServiceNow continues to really shine is in the expansion of existing customer relationships. The business has been very successful in pursuing a land and expand strategy, where existing customers continue to progressively spend more each year. In fact, all of ServiceNow cohorts have expanded the annual contract value that they do with the business, with the oldest cohorts contributing the highest growth on initial annual contract value.ServiceNow 2020, Q1 Investor DeckThis is also reflected in ServiceNow's ability to convert customers into very large accounts over time. ServiceNow currently has over 900 customers that contribute over $1M in annual contract value, a figure which is growing 30% year on year. This speaks to the stickiness of the ServiceNow solution and the value that the business provides its customers.ServiceNow 2020, Q1 Investor DeckServiceNow's role as a partner to IT and other organizations within the enterprise to help improve productivity and coordinate workflow and ticket management is one that is even more paramount in an environment of distributed resourcing and unconventional and alternative ways of working. Dealing with user access and system issues in an environment where the physical machines and equipment needs to be solely remotely accessed and triaged creates additional stressors and challenges for IT departments and new workflow considerations which ServiceNow can help manage.While ServiceNow started predominately in providing IT workflow management, the business very quickly and successfully expanded into other areas where its competency of workflow management could be leveraged. HR Service Management and Customer Delivery were areas where the business saw similar need with respect to assisting HR teams to onboard employees and manage relevant workflow items such as benefit access, 401(k) management, etc. ServiceNow's capabilities also found value in Customer Service case management and resolution.The success of both of these new modules is seen in ServiceNow's results for the quarter. The relative contribution in terms of annual contract value from IT workflows has steadily decreased over time. Further evidence of this continued trend was seen year on year, with IT Service Management contribution declining from 68% to 66% of ACV, with customer and employee workflows which represent the HR and customer service modules increasing from 20% of ACV to 23%.More than 75% of NOW's customers are now multi-product purchasers and 90% of ServiceNow’s biggest deals in the quarter included multiple solutions. This is a trend that bodes very well for ServiceNow, with the business having successfully increased its level of stickiness with its existing customer base which makes it less likely that customers will move to alternate solutions as its engagement is deepened with these enterprises.In an environment where companies have been rushing to downgrade expectations and going cup in hand to governments for financial assistance, ServiceNow provides an element of comfort and security as far as the viability of its business and ongoing operations, something that is invaluable in these troubling times. Nobody appears to have told ServiceNow that there is a pandemic raging.Rather than following the procession of businesses which have meekly withdrawn guidance due to uncertainty, ServiceNow has confidently put forward a forecast of 26-27% revenue growth for Q2, which will encompass a quarter where a majority of the US is in lockdown, companies are scrambling to cut budgets and conserve cash and the rise in unemployment shows no end in sight. In fact, ServiceNow's full year guidance expectation for 2020 is for subscription revenue growth of approximately 27% year on year.ServiceNow 2020, Q1 Investor DeckWhat gives ServiceNow the confidence for such strong guidance when other companies are buttoning up the hatches just trying to survive? ServiceNow's retention of customers is a rock-solid 97% and as discussed, customers are increasingly expanding the range of services that they receive from ServiceNow.Given the software is delivered on a subscription basis, ServiceNow’s customers must pay for the ongoing ability to access this mission-critical software. Unlike perpetual license models, they can’t sit on old versions and lack of payment or renewal means access is lost. ServiceNow's customer base also tends to be large global enterprises, with roughly 80% of the Fortune 500. These are large, complex organizations with sophisticated IT technology needs who will be unable to 'manage around' a loss of ServiceNow access. This show of confidence in the future is reflected in ServiceNow's pledge to not lay off any staff in 2020. In fact, a business that is looking to hire and fill more than 1000 jobs in the US in 2020 alone.ServiceNow also comes into the crisis from a position of strength. The business has more than $1.5B in cash and short-term equivalents, providing it with significant resources to manage through any additional uncertainty.Unfortunately, for new investors, the market has discovered ServiceNow's role as a rock in a sea of uncertainty. ServiceNow is up more than 20% year to date, compared to a decline of more than 10% in the S&P 500. This is reflected in a price to sales ratio that is towards the top of its trading range over the last five years. As such, ServiceNow is not the bargain that it was in late 2019 when current CEO Bill McDermott stepped in. However, during times like this, some measure of certainty as far as ongoing business continuity and viability is worth its weight in gold in an investment portfolio. ServiceNow is one of my highest conviction ideas in my own portfolio and is not a business that I will part with lightly."

The SaaS (Software as a Service) company did cut its growth expectations for the year, but still expects 27% subscription growth. There are five reasons why Service Now is a great long-term buy and hold opportunity, especially in conjunction with portfolio overwriting (out-of-the-money covered calls). Today's price action presents an attractive breakout setup.In the very beginning, Service Now had to aggressively double down on marketing expenses to drive revenue growth and create scalability. With over 1.1 billion USD in expected free cash flow in 2020, that picture has changed as the company's revenue growth rate will fall to 30%. The good news is that free cash flow margins have improved noticeably from 6.6% in 2014 to 25% this year. With a targeted annual FCF margin improvement of 100 basis points, slowing revenue growth should not be seen as an insurmountable issue.(Source: Option Generator)Despite the fact that revenue growth rates have come down in absolute terms, the exponential picture is still intact with free cash flows doubling every three years. In terms of revenues, it's highly realistic to assume that Service Now can reach the 10 billion USD threshold by 2024, thereby propelling the free cash flow number to 3 billion USD.(Source: Option Generator)2) Digitalization And Wide MoatAlthough the coronavirus crisis may create short-term pain, the long-term gain will be substantial. More enterprises opting for Service Now's digital workflow solutions, a highly consistent retention rate of 97% in the last quarter and increasing margins will continue to sustain 25+ % growth in FCFs. The fact that the company is expanding its long-term partnerships with ACVs in excess of $1M growing at a YoY growth rate of 48% underpins the favorable business outlook. The high retention rate can be explained by the elevated switching costs if clients decide to replace Service Now with one of its competitors.(Source: Service Now Presentation)When it comes to NOW's moat, the initial strategy of focusing solely on acquiring market share as fast as possible has borne fruit. Today, the company controls close to 40% of IT Services Management and has recently stepped up efforts to repeat that success story in the IT Operations Management area. By offering complementary products, 75% of NOW's customers are subscribing to more-than-one service, while expanding beyond non-IT areas will deepen its pipeline and further improve cash flow visibility.3) Excellent Management ExecutionBack in May of 2018, the company held an analyst meeting during which the following graph was shown. In order to estimate the capacities of a management team, it's worthwhile checking out the promises made regarding long-term revenue targets.(Source: Service Now Presentation)Based on what we've seen so far, I believe Service Now's management team ranks among the best in the entire technology industry, which justifies a valuation premium (see later). They've kept their promise and are actually on track to beat their ambitious goals.The coronavirus stock market crash separated the wheat from chaff. Great business benefiting from secular growth trends are now the new safe havens. The fact that NOW shares are trading at all-time highs should be seen as a positive. The stock currently makes it to the best 6% of the S&P-500 in terms of momentum and belongs to the 3% best when it comes to earnings consistency and cash flow growth. Moreover, it has done so with a great portion of consistency, which is quite remarkable given the volatile nature of high-growth companies.(Source: Service Now Annual Report)While Service Now shares are far from inexpensive, a projected FCF of 3 billion USD by 2024 and a net cash pile of 10 billion USD (assuming no M&A) would lead to a forward EV/FCF yield of 5.4%. Without a doubt, that's a lot more affordable than its current 1.8% EV/FCF return. Although there's always a present risk of a sudden re-rating to 2%-2.5%, lowering your cost-basis by selling covered calls can provide a solution to cushion future corrections.By selling monthly out-of-the-money covered calls, one can generate a cash premium of 3% while enjoying 4%-5% upside potential (under normal circumstances). If the option is in-the-money at expiration, you can roll out and up for either a small debit or still sizable credit.The June 19th covered call options generate the following returns:(Source: Option Generator Spreadsheet)Technically speaking, the directional movement remains bullish (green bars) with the MACD bouncing back up from the signal line, well above 0. The last time Service Now generated a buying or accumulating signal was in 2016 at $75-$85. The stock has since more than quadrupled, with new buying signals presenting themselves at the lower end of the channel.(Source: Pro Real Time)Service Now is firing on all cylinders and the stock is still a long-term buying opportunity with shares looking to break out. However, questions may arise about whether the current multiples are justified. I believe the threes don't grow into heaven, at least in the short term, which is why selling out-of-the-money covered calls and nibbling at your cost-basis might be a good advice."
4343130,103480,2020-05-05T13:14:12-04:00,"ServiceNow is one of the few stocks in the market trading near 52-week highs.
        Shares have leaped ~20% since reporting Q1 results, despite ServiceNow's assertion that the company will bear the brunt of the coronavirus impact in Q2 and Q3.
        ServiceNow cites that new business, renewal timing, and overall spending of existing customers in coronavirus-impacted industries are all big unknowns.
        ServiceNow's current valuation at ~15x forward revenues virtually prices the stock for perfection, and is far above other software peers in the ~30% growth bucket.","Large-cap tech stocks, particularly those in the enterprise software sector, have been investors' chosen safe haven during this market rout, and ServiceNow (NOW) has been one of the big beneficiaries. Fresh off a leadership change that installed Bill McDermott, longtime boss of the much larger software company SAP (SAP), at the top of ServiceNow, the stock is now trading near 52-week highs as investors express confidence in the recently-released Q1 earnings results and in ServiceNow's ability to weather the coronavirus storm. Shares of ServiceNow have risen nearly 20% in the last week alone as investors cheered the quarterly earnings:While ServiceNow has functioned well as a port in the storm over the past few months, we now have to question if the company's fundamentals can support its soaring valuation - especially as many other high-growth stocks in ServiceNow's caliber, such as Workday (WDAY), have seen their multiples compress since the correction began. I've long been wary on ServiceNow due to its heady valuation multiples, and now it's even more concerning given that ServiceNow has echoed uncertainty for its growth trajectory this year. Stay on the sidelines here. Let's start with some good news: for now, ServiceNow is still a growth champion. ServiceNow's Q1 results, shown in the table below, blasted past Wall Street's expectations. Figure 1. ServiceNow 1Q20 resultsSource: ServiceNow 1Q20 earnings releaseTotal revenues grew 33% y/y to $1.05 billion, beating Wall Street's expectations of $1.01 billion (+28% y/y) by a solid five-point margin; subscription revenues, which investors watch even more closely, grew one point faster than total revenues at 34% y/y. The good news: ServiceNow, as of yet, has not seen any meaningful deceleration to Q4's exiting growth rate at 33% y/y in total revenues (35% y/y subscription).At a high level, this makes sense - we wouldn't expect ServiceNow's core clientele to be among the types of functions that will be pressured by the coronavirus. To some extent, the reason why investors have backed away from other major software companies like Workday and Salesforce.com (CRM) is because their core users are more heavily impacted by the virus. Salespeople can't travel and new deal activity has slowed down, so CRM tools aren't getting as much usage, while wide layoffs and pressure to keep costs down may impact staffing in HR departments, hurting HCM products like Workday. On the other hand, ServiceNow's platform and workflow management tools are heavily oriented around IT teams, which if anything have become even more prominent with the rise of work-from-home.This does not, however, absolve ServiceNow of coronavirus-related risks. In particular, the company noted that (obviously) new deals would be under pressure as ServiceNow's sales teams are forced to take a breather, while customers that would typically renew in the near term may choose to downsize their subscriptions or entirely defer their renewals. And though ServiceNow has noted that sales performance through April has held up fine, CFO Gina Mastantuono noted on the Q4 earnings call that several of ServiceNow's clients in impacted industries (representing roughly one-fifth of ServiceNow's revenue base) may choose to rethink their spending:The important takeaway here: ServiceNow is still uncertain about the overall impact of the coronavirus, believing that it will be mostly seen in Q2 and Q3 renewals, and its revenue visibility will be impacted this year. Figure 2. ServiceNow guidance updateSource: ServiceNow Q1 earnings deckServiceNow's updated guidance reflects this uncertainty. The company is pointing to a steep deceleration in Q2 subscription revenue growth to 27-28% y/y (representing six to seven points of sequential deceleration), and it has also reduced its full-year revenue guidance by ~$100 million and its full-year billings outlook by ~$180 million, about half of which is due to adverse FX changes and the remaining half due to bona fide demand uncertainty.Growth aside, there's some good news on the profitability front - the company managed to improve pro forma gross margins by one point year-over-year and pro forma operating margins by three points, driven by continued efficiencies on the sales and marketing side. Free cash flow, meanwhile, grew 30% y/y to $408.6 million, a strong indicator at a time when many tech companies have had to reduce staffing in order to preserve cash (ServiceNow, meanwhile, has pledged not to lay off any employees at all in 2020). There's no doubt that ServiceNow is a strong category-leading company that is delivering both strong growth and rich margins/cash flow - but the point here is, given that we're looking at growth slipping below 30% for the first time in the middle of this year, does ServiceNow still deserve its sky-high valuation multiples? Are expectations so high for this company that the stock will trip up later?At present share prices around $355 (only about 1% away from ServiceNow's all-time peak notched in February), the company has a market cap of $67.63 billion. After we net out the $2.94 billion of cash and $701.3 million of debt on ServiceNow's balance sheet, we're left with an enterprise value of $65.39 billion.As shown in the prior chart, ServiceNow's updated FY20 guidance now calls for $4.125-$4.145 billion in subscription revenue (+27% y/y); on a total basis, assuming the company's usual ~6% contribution from service revenues, midpoint total revenue is expected around $4.39 billion. This puts ServiceNow's current valuation at 14.9x EV/FY20 revenues.Here's the problem: we have plenty of other software companies that are expected to grow somewhere in the high 20s/low 30s this year that are trading at far lower multiples. Some, like Workday (WDAY), we know will have slightly more adverse impacts from the coronavirus this year - but even so the widening of ServiceNow's valuation premium against this peer group is concerning.ServiceNow's valuation - in some cases double some of these peers - seems to imply that investors believe the company will vastly outperform its estimates and see minimal deceleration this year. While ServiceNow does deserve some level of premium thanks to the company's strong balance sheet with >$2 billion net cash and strong ~40% FCF margins, ServiceNow will be hard-pressed to continue outperforming the broader stock market with its valuations already reaching an upper ceiling. I'm neutral, rather than fully bearish, on ServiceNow for the simple reason that the company's combination of 1) strong liquidity/cash flows, 2) superstar management team with Bill McDermott leading the helm, and a 3) product that isn't directly impacted by the coronavirus, will likely continue to make ServiceNow a safety hedge in the current market. At the same time, I don't think another rally in this stock (especially after a ~40% jump in the past month alone) is likely, given where ServiceNow's valuation stands amongst similarly-growing peers.ServiceNow is currently priced for perfection, even though the company has signaled uncertainty around current customers' renewal trends in Q2 and Q3. I would prefer to err on the side of caution here."
4341941,105539,2020-05-01T10:16:48-04:00,"ServiceNow reaffirmed its place as one of the greatest SaaS businesses with its Q1'20 performance.Given the recent guidance, I perform a series of valuation tests that show the business as slightly undervalued.It is a good time to start a position in these uncertain times given the highly recurring revenue nature, scale, and experienced management team.The team is also adapting to the new covid reality.","ServiceNow (NOW) is one of the greatest SaaS companies of all time. It reaffirmed its position with its recent Q1'20 performance, where it lowered overall guidance only 1% due to covid. Given the highly recurring nature of the business (>90% is recurring), scale ($4 billion this year in top-line), and experienced management team, this company remains one of my top picks for a long-term oriented SaaS investor.Source: eWeekI valued the business, incorporating the new financial results and outlook, on a variety of comparable and intrinsic methodologies. My conclusion after this valuation is that the business is slightly undervalued. Given the uncertain times we are in, if we see overall market drops it is a great time to start building a position. I would keep this on my watch list.The output of my valuation shows a price target of $375, about 16% above current level (as of this writing).Source: Valuation outputLet us dive into each of these approaches. First, let's start with comparables. We can see the business is still driven on an EV/S basis, and on an earnings is relatively expensive. It is one of the few SaaS plays that has shown consistent profitability, and that deserves a premium.Source: Comparables and management estimatesLooking now at the DCF, we can see stable cash flows into the FCF model. Management provided guidance at 29% of revenue, which we flatlined across the period. It resulted in a significant undervaluation. Take this with a grain of salt as the inputs are highly sensitive. That is one reason I average all my approaches in the valuation model.Source: DCF modelManagement breaks out recurring and non-recurring revenue. It is striking to see that this is a pure SaaS business operating at scale. The real only other one at this type of scale is Salesforce (CRM).This predictability allows the company to accurately forecast its revenue into the future. Management guided down just 1% on the recent earnings call.This business model does well in uncertain times, and I could see technical fund flows moving into ServiceNow due its recurring nature. I could also see short-sellers come to the name as it heats up while other parts of the economy stay muted. This eventually will drive up the price when they cover, if you are a long-term holder and believer as I am.Looking beyond the business statistics, I think looking at management is critical for any long-term holding. ServiceNow has had turnover in its senior staff, so this is an especially important point to focus on. Can the existing team manage through the crisis and at scale? After doing an analysis, my answer is yes.Bill McDermott recently joined the company. He was former CEO of SAP, a diversified $150 billion company, where he was the boss from 2010 to 2019. I believe he brings knowledge about scaling to ServiceNow that will help it weather this storm (he saw 2008 at SAP) and also achieve new heights. ServiceNow is at half the value of SAP today (roughly $60 billion).Source: ServiceNow websiteChris Bedi (CIO), CJ Desai (CPO), and other notable senior members have been in their post for some time, which allows the new management team to learn. I think this mix of experience is important for a business that already has a track record of extraordinary performance and wants to grow to the next scale without losing what works.Beyond these fundamental attributes, I believe the current virus reality presents an opportunity for the team to show how they react in a tough environment. I am impressed by their recent product moves. The company has launched emergency response apps on its platform as shown below, and built upon its existing ecosystem. These four apps are offered at no charge (taking advantage of low marginal software costs). The goal is to keep customer priorities in mind.Source: ServiceNow websiteFurther, the business announced that 70 global and regional partners are helping customers through the covid crisis. I believe this customer-centric view bodes well for long-term shareholder growth.Valuation is a risk in the short term. After recent earnings, I would not be surprised if the stock ran up to or past its fair value. For long-term investors, it is an opportunity to hold and sit tight. For those trading shorter-term, you can play both sides of the coin.Great performance also brings competition. Given that ServiceNow has a significant pipeline of international and large deals, some may take longer to close. We will not see the impact of these indicators for a few quarters, but it something to keep in mind."
4337863,21815,2020-04-16T00:40:08-04:00,"The company continues to build out its very valuable platform which aligns and simplifies a host of business processes for its customers.Demand for these ""re-engineering"" capabilities is likely to endure even during the pandemic-induced economic downturn.While the shares are fully valued at the moment, we would be dip buyers, as we're pretty sure opportunities will present themselves in a volatile market.","ServiceNow (NOW) is one of the big winners from the digitalization of business, which has much further to run. The company is using the COVID-19 crisis to double down on efforts to increase customer and employee loyalty, metrics which are associated with long-term stock outperformance.While the shares are fully valued at the moment, we think investors will benefit picking up a few on the occasional downturn in what is almost certainly going to be a very volatile market.There can be no doubt that the company has been one of the big winners from the digital transformation of business:Data by YChartsAnd that has, of course, translated into a stellar stock price performance:ServiceNow is the ultimate platform with an increasing number of products. From the 10-K:While it started out as an IT service platform, it has basically evolved into a big digital re-engineering platform which enables companies to streamline processes, crossing departments and systems, all on a single platform. Here is how the new CEO sees it (from the Q4CC):New products and functionality is added on a continuous basis, coming from R&D (like financial close automation) and from small tuck-in technology acquisitions (here is a list) and customized solutions from ecosystem partners developed on the company's Now Platform App Engine and sold on its ServiceNow Store. This growth has three self-reinforcing effects:How the whole is bigger than the sum of the parts becomes clear from the following (arguably somewhat self-congratulatory) description (from the Q4CC):The value of the platform for customers is revealed by a 97% retention rate. Basically, the only reason why ServiceNow loses customers is through M&A.The cross-sell and up-sell opportunities are particularly manifest in the following graph from the Q4 earnings deck:ACV (annual contract value) rises with each cohort - very impressive. Some of the recent acquisitions are:Management argued that these had zero contribution to revenue in Q4, but that is irrelevant, as they had been acquired for their world-class capabilities.ServiceNow has a few other growth initiatives besides new functionality through R&D, acquisitions or ecosystem, like:The initial verticals which the company will focus on upon launch of its vertical strategy are banking (partnered with Deloitte) and telecom (partnering with Accenture). On its Investor Day, it will reveal more verticals. The rationale (from the Q4CC):The idea is to capitalize on workflows that are industry-specific and leverage the Now platform. It requires some investments (R&D, S&M), but management argued this won't go beyond keeping OpEx margins stable, or even expanding.Since the company already has 80% of the Fortune 500 companies as clients, international growth becomes more of an imperative. International sales represented 34% of revenue, but it isn't growing as a percentage of revenue. From the earnings deck:No surprise that the quarterly results beat expectations, revenue ($951.8 million, +33%) was 11.6 million better than expected and non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.96, which was 9 cents better than expected.Subscription revenue came in at $899 million, growing 35% y/y. ServiceNow closed 76 transactions with more than $1 million in net new ACV (+49%). The company closed the year with 892 total customers with more than $1 million in ACV (+32%).There was some (rather rudimentary) split in the 10-K:The GAAP earnings were massively boosted by a one-time income tax benefit of $574.2 million from the release of the valuation allowance on the Irish deferred tax assets.From the Q4CC:Data by YChartsFor the year, S&M declined from 46% of revenue to 44% of revenue, while R&D increased from 20% of revenue to 22% of revenue, with G&A declining from 12% to 10% of revenue, producing a little operational leverage, with OpEx increasing by roughly 200bp (GAAP figures).From the 10-K:ServiceNow does generate impressive amounts of free cash flow, but to a large extent, this is the result of huge stock-based compensation. From the 10-K:With no major acquisitions and tons of free cash flow (a guided 29% of free cash flow margin for 2020), there shouldn't really be much dilution, but the share-based compensation is, of course, changing that picture quite a bit as well:Data by YChartsThe company has $782.5 million in convertible notes outstanding, but $1.7 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of Q4.Data by YChartsValuation metrics are in the stratosphere, which isn't all that surprising given the quality of the company and its growth prospects. Analysts expect an EPS of $4.18 this year, rising to $5.43 in 2021, but that is, of course, rather dependent on what happens with the economy as well.The impact of the pandemic and its economic fallout is a mixed bag, in our view. On the negative side:However, the crisis also offers ServiceNow some opportunities:An example of the latter is the series of Emergency Response Apps (which are free) that the company offers which can help clients with the management of dealing with the pandemic and its organizational consequences.While it is difficult to gauge what the end result will be of these vectors (or the best guess would argue for fairly mild headwinds), here is what the CEO had to say on April 15:This is a pretty robust reaction, although the company has enormous buffers, so it might be less indicative of operational performance going forward than investors might think at first sight, but it should reduce investor concerns at least to some extent.We are quite impressed by the company's reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. It shows that ServiceNow takes customer and employee care pretty seriously, and these are typically traits of companies which have a stellar long-term performance. Take, for instance, the following (from the CEO letter April 15):That same letter contains a short description of some examples of organizations which use their platform and apps for improving their response to the pandemic.We see several unique features in this company that construct a bull case:However, on the negative side:We would not buy right now but wait for a better opportunity, which is almost certainly going to arrive in this volatile market."

The compelling revenue growth was paired with strong growth in billings and RPO, which suggests growth durability. The market seemed to be delighted with the results and extended the stock’s previous rally to roughly 50% from its levels of October 2019. The company’s core products continue to grow at +30% rates, while emerging products are consolidating their share of total revenues. The growth in customers decreased a bit during the year, but remains strong for a company reaching ~80% of the Fortune 500. Still, the company was able to continue growing its customers with more than $1 million in ACV at a strong rate.The company’s guidance indicates growth deceleration that seems reasonable given its scale. It also implies further improvements in operating and free cash flow margins. Also, it is refreshing to see the new CEO taking the helm in such an enthusiastic way. Bill McDermott has the knowledge base to take NOW to the next stages of growth.The valuation remains fair in my view. Comparing the stock with the whole SaaS sector and a few close peers back my opinion. Still, high growth names have significant risk to bear in mind. In this case, the stock has been rallying for some months, gaining roughly 50% since recent lows, therefore I am not buying the company shares at these levels. I would recommend to wait for a pullback to take action. ServiceNow is an exceptional company and I will buy if the opportunity arises.(Earnings Release)During the last quarter, the company generated subscription revenues of $899 million, representing a growth of 35% Y/Y. The total revenue figure was $952 million, up 33% Y/Y, and above the company’s guidance and analyst expectations. This level of growth represents an acceleration from both the growth rates of Q3 2019 and Q4 2018. Still, this growth rate was affected by currency fluctuations (see the table below).(Earnings Release)Subscription billings was the most impressive, amounting to $1.3 billion or a growth of 36% Y/Y (37% on constant currency). Of course, billings is a volatile ratio, and, as the management is used to pointing out, investors should watch the trend in remaining performance obligations (RPO) or the backlog, rather than that of billings. Similarly, RPO performed well, ending the quarter at $6.6 billion (see the chart below), growing 34% Y/Y, and showing no signs of deceleration.(Investor Presentation)The revenue growth was quite balanced across product lines. It is favorable to see the core products growing at almost the same rate as newer products. This is a differentiating factor for NOW vs. similar peers like Workday (WDAY) whose core product (human capital management) is slowing down as it reaches maturity. Furthermore, this balanced growth and the one-to-two new products that NOW expects to launch per year are indicators of growth durability. On the earnings call, the management pointed out that the HR and CSM products are now generating $200 million each, demonstrating the consolidation across emerging products.(Investor Presentation)The behavior seen in the product lines has also been replicated across geographies.(Investor Presentation)As this quarter was the last of the year, the company updated on its number of customers. The figure was ~6,200, and represented a growth of ~14% Y/Y, or 800 net new customers. This rate of growth means a significant slowdown from the mid-20s of previous years, but it gets difficult to keep high growth rates when the company serves ~80% of the Fortune 500.The company didn’t report its net expansion rate, but the figure will be shared with investors on the company’s Financial Analyst Day on May. With the growth in customers slowing down faster than revenue growth, it is reasonable to expect a figure close to 130% as in 2018. The renewal rate was 97%, two points down from the 99% reported in Q3 2019. The decrease was influenced by M&A activity between customers. This rate should improve over the next quarters. See the comparison between quarters below.(Investor Presentation)Although the stream of new customers is slowing down, the company continues to expand the use of its solutions by new and existing customers. The table below shows the cross-selling abilities of the Now platform, with most of the top deals of the quarter including at least five products.(Investor Presentation)Moreover, the company registered 76 deals with more than $1 million in annual contract value (ACV), representing a growth of 49% Y/Y. Similarly, the number of customers with that amount of ACV at the end of the quarter was 892, growing 32% on a Y/Y basis.(Investor Presentation)Besides beating analyst expectations on revenue, the company reported non-GAAP EPS of $0.96 that also beat analysts’ EPS estimate of $0.87 by 9 cents, or 10%. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $3.03. A tax benefit of $564.5 million during the quarter completely distorted the result. Adjusting for the tax benefit, the company was profitable on a GAAP basis for a few cents.(Earnings Release)Going into details about profitability, the gross margin for the quarter was 78%, and continued to expand from the 76.5% reported in Q4 2018. The operating margin was 3% and 22% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, respectively, showing improvements on a Y/Y basis. Also the free cash flow margin was very strong at 36%, and expanded from 34% in Q4 2018. See the chart below for further details.(Investor Presentation)Investors should be happy with the profitability profile of NOW. Very few SaaS companies are able to grow at this pace and show high free cash flow margins. Companies of the quality of Salesforce.com (CRM) or WDAY feature FCF margins of 21% and 17% respectively. NOW leads them on this matter.The guidance for Q1 2020 and FY2020 is compelling. According to the numbers, the company expects to grow subscription revenues around 29-30% in 2020. A deceleration of 450-550 bps from FY2019.Keep in mind that NOW has been growing in the 30s for four years without material acquisitions. Smaller peers have not been able to sustain this level of organic growth for so much time. This is indicative of an unusually large TAM. On top of this, NOW has $1.7 billion in cash and equivalents to use for acquisitions and maintain this level of growth for more time. And that is without considering the introduction of new products that the company intends to launch every year.Getting back to the guidance, here are the details:(Earnings Release)(Earnings Release)By reading the earnings call transcript (or listening to the webcast) it is difficult not to feel the excitement of the new CEO, Bill McDermott. I saw McDermott on CNBC when his hiring was announced, and he seemed quite impressed with everything on ServiceNow. He was eager for the job.As a reminder, McDermott brings to the table extensive experience on segments such as Customer Relationship Management, Enterprise Resource Management, Product Lifecycle Management, Supply Chain Management and Supplier Relationship Management, among others, that he acquired on SAP (SAP). Bear in mind that SAP is perhaps the leader of ERP and one of the largest software companies in the world on revenues, behind the likes of Oracle (ORCL) and Microsoft (MSFT).With that background, the new CEO has the basis to state the priorities for ServiceNow under his leadership. Here is an excerpt from the earnings call:(Earnings Call)He certainly knows what he wants to do on ServiceNow, and how to do it.One point that investors should appreciate from this quarter is the way the finance organization of ServiceNow has assimilated the CEO and CFO transition. This suggests that the company is well prepared for future changes in leadership, and that it may succeed despite the volatility at the top management.After the post-earnings rally, the stock remains fairly valued in my view. Comparing the stock’s valuation to that of a median SaaS stock and that of similar peers backs my perception.The median public SaaS company has trailing revenue growth of roughly 31% and its stock trades at a trailing EV/S multiple of around 10x after the recent market sell-off. Fundamentals for this median company include an FCF margin of ~5%, a Rule of 40 of ~40% (some say that the “40” of the Rule of 40 is just an arbitrary number, well, it does not seem so), a net retention rate in the low 110% and a gross retention rate in the low 90%.NOW beats the median SaaS company in all these figures. It features an impressive net retention rate above 130% (I only know a few companies with at least 130% of net retention rate, and all of them are growing their revenues at +40% rates), and a staggering gross retention rate of ~98% (±1% every quarter), which I think is what sets NOW apart from the rest. A strong gross retention rate will decrease the risk profile of a SaaS company (hence the risk of the investment), making valuations higher than same-growth peers with slightly lower ratios.As NOW beats the median SaaS company, it is expected to trade at a higher multiple, or above 10x trailing revenues.Comparing the stock with similar peers in the SaaS space throws similar results as above. This market is rating stocks based on a mix of revenue and profitability, alongside some other SaaS-specific metrics where NOW is a leader. Moreover, it is growing faster than most of these peers, and its Rule of 40 is very close to the leader Adobe (ADBE).(Author)Beyond comparisons, I would be cautious on NOW. The stock has had a nice rally since bottoming out in October 2019, and it is already in correction territory, along with the overall market.After seeing such strong quarterly numbers, ServiceNow remains one of the best options in the SaaS space, and the bullish case is intact. My greatest concern is valuation. You may profit from buying at these levels, but the possible returns may not justify the high risk of a growth name. The stock has experienced significant drawdowns, and an overall sell-off such as the one the market is going through these days, may have a deeper impact on the stock. Furthermore, a significant slowdown in revenue growth, or a deterioration in profitability margins, could lower the valuation. Stand by for now; the stock is already falling. I would consider a position below the $300 level."

4333915,104941,2020-03-24T13:46:27-04:00,"I lay out exactly what I've been buying and why these companies remain fantastic buys.I briefly demonstrate the thinking behind each of the buys, and I share more in-depth discussions of the companies, on which I've previously written (via links throughout the article).I rate ISRG, NOW, SQ, GOOG, and TWLO all strong buys.","Source: Mission Mindfulness BlogOk, now that you've taken a deep breath, prepare to enter a world of positivity and forward-looking optimism. In these difficult times, it may be tempting to walk away from your portfolios and bury your head in the sand, which some might believe is a valid strategy, as we could decline further from here.I am here today to offer you another perspective: Now is the time to go on the offensive and to pick your spots (or stocks if you will). Now is the time to be buying quality discounted companies, the likes of which you will find later in this article. Could we fall more from today's prices? Sure, we could. But the companies that I am about to share will almost certainly rebound strongly over the coming 6-12 months.I just quickly want to highlight my performance on nearly all of my calls over the past two months. Commenters on my recent Chipotle (CMG) article were quick to ensure accountability was upheld after it declined in line with the broad market. Interestingly, Chipotle is performing either at or above the market as of writing this article.I am sharing this not only to maintain self-accountability (I take my recommendations very seriously and only really write about stocks in which I've to invest my entire net-worth) but also to share with readers what good companies look like. These companies don't have 10%+ yields. They aren't penny stocks. They aren't companies that produce things like oil and tobacco (with which I don't take any issue, but they certainly aren't good investments). So here are some of my calls and their performance over the last two months.The majority of my calls over the past 2 months have outperformed the SPY; in that, their declines have been less than the declines of the overall market, against which my fund competes. Also, every stock I share in this article is now a very, very strong conviction buy.For example:Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) is down 24.32% versus the SPY's (SPY) decline of 27.52%. I re-iterated in the last week that this is a generational buying opportunity for Alphabet's shares.Source: My Coverage Tab in my Author ProfileLockheed Martin (LMT) is down 25.85% versus the SPY's decline of 26.42%. I re-iterated my buy recommendation on the stock in the last week or so.Source: My Coverage Tab in my Author ProfileServiceNow (NOW) is down 9.42% versus a decline of 17% by the SPY from where I originally recommended buying the stock. This is stock is lagging others, which is creating a very attractive entry point. More about this company later in this article.Source: My Coverage Tab in my Author ProfileAdobe (ADBE) is down 15.12% from where I recommended it versus a decline of 25.85% from the SPY.Source: My Coverage Tab in my Author ProfileAnd all of these stocks have become buying opportunities, of which I've been taking advantage. What's more, even if these stocks were bought last month, one should still expect their projected returns over a 10-year time span, and in many cases, these companies will return to growth as usual over the coming year or so.I share all of this not to boast, but rather to ensure the accountability my readers want. Just as you must pick good stocks, you should also pick good authors and advisors. To further this accountability, I want to share another example of me being ""on the right side of history"".I have been actively railing against tobacco stocks, oil stocks, and many of the ""get yield quick"" REIT schemes that curiously dominate Seeking Alpha, much to the detriment of investors. Again, I am sharing this so that readers understand what good stocks look like, and not just to feel good about myself. This crash should be instructive for those who may have been tempted to chase ""sucker yields"" that inevitably imploded.Here's some evidence of my position on the aforementioned:Source: My Comment HistoryMany of these ""high yield REITs"" (those that had yields in excess of 10%) are now down 60%-90%, and some have already slashed their dividends.And as for my opposition to oil stocks, here's the evidence for that. My comment history details my opposition to tobacco stocks also.I also want to be clear that I'm far from perfect.I've been bullish on Boeing (BA), which has proven to be a bad call; not because it's down, but because it now faces existential risk, which could become systematic risk to the economy if not properly addressed by the government.I'm glad you asked!Below you will find my top five buys to capitalize on this panic. If you'd like more recommendations from me, simply go through my past articles and look at the total expected return near the end of each article.What I've found very interesting in analyzing my past articles is the following. You will find a pretty direct correlation between expected return and level of decline experienced recently. That is, you will find that ""riskier"", less proven companies had higher expected returns than the more proven and stable companies. I did not create the valuations with that dynamic in mind, so it's interesting to see that my models' expected returns mirror the beta of each of the companies I've publicly examined.This dynamic also lends great credence and legitimacy to my L.A. Stevens Valuation Model, which you can see demonstrated in action here, or in most of my articles.Anyway, let's get into the analysis!I wrote at length about my in-person visit to the company and at length about the company as a whole here. In the article, I arrived at the conclusion that Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) would generate annualized returns of about 11% at a purchase price of ~$575. I then went on to say the following:So here we are, an all-in scenario.You can read my original piece on the stock to understand its future prospects for growth, which are still strongly intact; however, today, I will look at its balance sheet to assess the strength of the company's financial position.Here's a little look at it:Source: YChartsAs can be seen above, ISGR has $3.2B in cash on hand. This could cover its entire COGS, SG&A expense, and interest on debt expense for an entire year. What's more, its total liabilities are only about $1.4B, which makes for a very small interest expense. Therefore, ISRG has very little risk of bankruptcy and will likely resume normal operations in the coming weeks.Thus, ISRG is currently offering a value that likely won't come around ever again. That is, ISRG below $400 will generate well over 20% annualized returns over the coming decade, based on the math illustrated in my L.A. Stevens Valuation Model in my original article on the stock.I wrote at length about ServiceNow recently, after realizing that it is set to become the ""platform of platforms"" for thousands of major businesses. ServiceNow is the platform of platforms in the sense that the company provides the railways on which information within a business travels to and fro. From HR to IT, NOW digitizes the entire workplace experience on a simple, seamless platform.In my original piece on ServiceNow, I wrote about the ""business herd effect"", which theorizes that hockey stick growth is on the horizon for the company, as consulting agencies and competitive businesses realize that incredible efficiencies in IT, HR, and employee/customer interactions can be derived by using NOW's platform.The benefit of NOW is so incredibly clear now that I couldn't imagine CEOs not rushing to become subscribers. Take this scenario for example:Alright, so it's a great company, but what's going on with the financials?Here's a snapshot of the company's balance sheet:Source: YChartsWith $1.7B in cash on hand and $835M in receivables, NOW has positioned itself well to weather this storm and emerge even stronger, as companies realize that they must put their entire business' workflow in the cloud, which NOW enables.Further, once NOW becomes a part of a company, it becomes vital to the functioning of that company; therefore, it would be literally the last subscription a business would cancel, as doing so would destroy information flows exactly when businesses need them the most.Square (SQ) may be controversial for some, as the company will certainly be hit hard by this shutdown of the U.S. economy. However, the company has more than enough cash to weather this storm and emerge even stronger on the other side. What's more, it has shown that it has the right idea about recessions:Go on the offense while others are panicking and withdrawing!As evidence of this mentality, Jack Dorsey has taken to Twitter (TWTR) to announce that Square will be giving away money through its Cash App. This is going to cause an explosion in usage over the coming months, and hopefully, much of the usage will stick.Source: TwitterAdditionally, Jack has addressed how the company will support its small business owners, which will likely entail short term loans that will be repaid as a percentage of transactions over the coming 3 to 6 months.Source: TwitterTo bolster this position as a leader in a crisis, Square received approval for its bank charter recently. This approval means that Square's moat has become even larger.Competitors like Clover have bundled their offerings with banks, which made such an offering more appealing. Square has not had this advantaged (yet continues to dominate the landscape), but now, with the approval of its bank charter, there's much less incentive for merchants to use inferior offerings simply because they're attached to a bank and its many services, such as business credit cards. Square will now be the one-stop-shop for small business development.And Square is extremely well capitalized!Source: YChartsIt could exist for well over a year without a single dollar in revenue, all while paying its employees as usual. Hence, Square's declaration that it will start handing out money on its Cash App makes sense. Square was born in the great recession, and this recession will only empower the company further!Many of you are probably aware that I have been vocal about Alphabet's need to return capital to shareholders, especially when it's extremely attractive to do so during this temporary panic.Aside from that ideological position, I am a huge believer in the company due to explosive growth in YouTube and Google Cloud, both of which are growing well above 30% annually.According to my sum of parts valuation analysis in the article linked above, Alphabet remains undervalued by about 50% at its present valuation of around $750B. And I believe this undervaluation remains even in light of the inevitable revenue and free cash flow hit the company will take due to the virus-induced shutdown.Source: YChartsAs can be seen above, Alphabet currently trades at a valuation touched only at the very bottom of the great recession.New flash market! Alphabet is more profitable and better positioned than ever! This undervaluation highlights exactly why Alphabet needs to act decisively and execute an ASR (accelerated share repurchase), or begin strategically acquiring deeply discounted companies that could, for example, bolster its Cloud offering.Source: YChartsI wrote about Twilio (TWLO) when it was trading at about $120, stating that it was a great value at that price. The article was entitled ""6 Million Reasons Twilio Could Dominate The CPaas Industry"", and it detailed how Twilio's platform strategy would lead to a revolution in the space. So if it were a great value at that price, it's an unbelievable value at $70-$80, granted it can remain solvent, and I strongly believe it can/will.Further, the need for Twilio's services has never been higher!What Twilio DoesEssentially, Twilio provides a communications platform for businesses, whereby these businesses develop their own unique strategy for communication with customers, i.e., the companies communicate through some combination of text messages, Facebook (FB) messenger, email, app alerts, etc.Twilio's platform is used by many of the largest companies on earth, such as Home Depot (HD), Lyft (LYFT), Airbnb (AIRB), and many others. You can read a much more in-depth exploration of Twilio's business here.As for Twilio's solvency, the company has never been in a better position than today, as can be seen below.Source: YChartsWith $1.8B worth of cash and only $1B worth of expenses in the last year, Twilio could easily survive for a year without a drip of revenue dollars.But that's not how Twilio rolls! Twilio's services are predicated on a subscription model, and during a time when the need for communication between businesses and consumers/employees is at its highest, we can be pretty certain that Twilio will not lose many of its customers. In fact, it will likely yank market share out of the hands of inferior alternatives that exist within the communications platform as a service arena.At the risk of making this article unbearably long, I will conclude here. I urge any prospective investors in these companies to read my more in-depth reports so that you can develop a solid idea of what these companies do. Further, in each of my linked articles, you will find precise expected returns. As I mentioned, you will notice that the higher the expected return, the larger the decline in the stock. This proves two things: 1) My L.A. Stevens Valuation Model provides high fidelity projections (but doesn't necessarily guarantee that these projections will come to fruition), and 2) higher expected returns = greater risk (or beta in finance parlance). This means that the higher the expected return, the greater the company will diverge from the performance of the SPY. Such has been the case for Uber (UBER), on which I remain bullish, as it has declined well in excess of the broader market, but that also may be as a result of it being a transportation company.Remember, just because the market is selling off aggressively does not mean the market has any idea what tomorrow has in store for us. President Trump's aid packages could avert a recession, or they could prove to be not enough and could plunge us deeply into another great recession.Whatever transpires, all of the stocks listed in this article have fantastic cash positions that will enable them to survive this downturn and even emerge stronger on the other side!Here's a quote I will leave you with:As always, thanks for reading; please remember to follow for more, and happy investing!"
4327702,104941,2020-02-27T10:34:24-05:00,"ServiceNow has transformed information technology workflows for tens of thousands of companies.
        ServiceNow's industry leading offering will cause a ""business herd effect"" where companies begin flocking to the best platform to ensure they remain on a level playing field.
        I rate ServiceNow a strong buy.","Source: ServiceNow - The smarter way to workflow™ServiceNow (NOW) is revolutionizing the way businesses operate by providing a platform that serves as the railways for a business's information flows. The ""business herd effect"" is a concept that I've recently developed that explains the massive growth of companies, such as Salesforce (CRM), Zoom (ZM), and Twilio (TWLO). As I will explain, this ""business herd effect"" has really just begun for ServiceNow, as the company projects its revenues to reach $9B by 2022. With its massive margins for both its top and bottom line, ServiceNow truly is just getting started. Today, I rate the company a strong buy.The business herd effect refers to the idea that when adoption of a certain technology reaches a certain threshold, the rate at which the technology is adopted actually accelerates. That is, the ""hockey stick"" effect occurs just when people assume the company couldn't possibly keep growing at its historic rates. There are a couple conditions under which this effect occurs:Once those two pre-requisites are filled, the ""business herd effect"" is ripe for occurring. Businesses rush from one room (a metaphor for old tech) to another room (new tech), so as to ensure that they are not left behind by what's happening in the next room over. Regardless of whether the tech will truly revolutionize their businesses, they do not want to be seen as the company that didn't adopt a certain tech, and that's why their employees are leaving and their business is underperforming relative to its peers. As I mentioned, this effect has been taking place in the enterprise space in a big way recently via companies like Zoom, Twilio, Slack (WORK), and most notably, ServiceNow. In fact, ServiceNow has hit that hockey stick moment, where adoption of its platform has accelerated as it has grown larger. Businesses have come to realize that ServiceNow as the winning formula for providing the tracks on which the businesses operations travel. Here's an example: EY Advisory services (better known as Ernst and Young) are customers of ServiceNow. EY advises business on a range of problems, such as business analytics, business development, and strategy execution.EY is not only a leader in its industry of consulting, which contributes to the aforementioned business herd effect, but the company is also actively consulting businesses as to how those businesses can enhance their operations. Here's a quote from ServiceNow's case studies/customers page:So EY uses ServiceNow, then going out into the world and telling their 10s of thousands of customers... what? Use a different HR solution? No! EY is consulting 10s of thousands of businesses and telling them that they should use what EY knows: ServiceNow!The same dynamic plays out for companies such as Accenture and Salesforce's crm.That is, these consulting firms become very well-versed on one platform, then go out and aggressively sell that platform as a solution for the company's IT or business problems. Then, EY or Accenture turns around and says, ""Look at the great work we did by guiding you to this or that platform!"" ServiceNow is in dead-smack in the middle of this dynamic, and these consulting firms are actively hawking ServiceNow's fantastic platform as the panacea for business operational issues, all of which can be solved via the following segments of ServiceNow's offering.I've already used this analogy a couple times, but it's worth repeating: ServiceNow is a platform that serves as the railways for business information and activities.The components of ServiceNow's business primarily include the following:The ServiceNow platform streamlines the operations of each of these segments.From a broader perspective, ServiceNow offers panoply of enterprise solutions, all of which can be found here.Additionally, for those that read my articles often, you know I'm keenly aware and very bullish on the idea of businesses offering customizable platforms. Twilio, Shopify, Zoom, and ServiceNow sell pre-made solutions to be clear; however, they also offer the freedom for businesses to actively re-arrange the product or create bespoke programs on their platforms. Ok, so now we know that ServiceNow is reaching a hockey stick moment, but what should we pay for it?ServiceNow's valuation is actually extremely straightforward, unlike some of my most recent valuations, which you could find here and here. In both of those valuations, there were no profits or free cash flow to speak of, which makes creating valuations quite difficult due to the number of assumptions that must be made. In the case of ServiceNow, there's massive gross margins and massive free cash flow margins! Too easy! So in order to determine ServiceNow's value, I will use my L.A. Stevens Valuation Model. It consists of three steps:Let's get started!The following chart says about it all. That is, ServiceNow's gross margins are clocking in at 77%, which free cash flow per share soaring hundreds of percent over the last 3 years.Source: YChartsOf course, we can't be sure as to whether this is baked into the stock, so we must execute step 1 of the L.A. Stevens Valuation Model. In order to arrive at a growth rate, I took consensus analyst estimates, which ServiceNow has marginally exceeded in the last 2 years. These estimates were 28%, 26%, and 25% over the next 3 years, respectively. Therefore, I will use a consistent free cash flow growth rate of 20% annually for the next ten years. This is an average, and keep in mind that with the massive free cash flow margins ServiceNow has, it will be able to acquire faster growing tech companies, buy back shares, or some combination of the two so as to further accelerate growth. Lastly, I used a 30% free cash flow margin, which might seem too aggressive, but in light of ServiceNow's nearly 80% gross margins, I believe it's actually conservative.Source: Data compiled from YChartsAs can be seen above, ServiceNow is technically overvalued by about 30%, but this doesn't complete the picture. To truly arrive at what returns we can expect, let's move onto steps 2 and 3.Step 2 usually accounts for the effects share buy backs and share issuances will have on the rate at which free cash flow per share grows. In the case of ServiceNow, I expect that it will continue to issue shares through stock based compensation; however, with quickly growing cash on its balance sheet, I don't expect that share issuances will be excessively used throughout the next decade. For this reason, I will skip step 2, as the addition of new shares may marginally impact the rate at which ServiceNow increases its free cash flow per share, but not enough to meaningfully alter the outcome of this model. Further, if there is another large share issuance, it will likely be to fund a faster growing acquisition, which would only serve to improve the model's outcome.So as steps 1 and 2 communicated, ServiceNow is technically overvalued, but what others will pay for free cash flow and gross margin is essential to the total returns narrative of any stock. Therefore, I will normalize ServiceNow's share price for post-10yr growth.Source: Data compiled from YChartsTherefore, if one were to buy ServiceNow at $330, they would receive a 14.72% annualized return.There are few stocks in today's market that could offer such a great return; however, in the case of ServiceNow, such a return is actually pretty mediocre, considering its gross margins, ability to generate free cash flow, and its position as the go to solution for consulting firms.The greatest risk that's posed to ServiceNow is complacency in light of the massive success that's ahead for the company. Should ServiceNow rest on its laurels as the solution for enterprise workflows, then it could easily be displaced by a lower priced entrant. To sum it all up, here's how you should think about ServiceNow:It is the number one cloud based, digital solution for optimizing workflows for enterprises. It serves as the railways for information within a business. Consulting firms are using it, then recommending it to theirs tens of thousands of customers. And lastly, ServiceNow recently hired a highly respected CEO, who's known to have a Rolodex of big clients on standby.I rate ServiceNow as a strong buy as of today.As always, thanks for reading and happy investing!"

However, the facts don't back up this thesis.As we enter the global recession, companies' investment in IT will no longer be a key priority. This stock is best avoided right now. Here's why:ServiceNow was a stock that gained strong traction by spotting an opportunity to provide digital workflows and cloud solutions to enterprises. This is a rapidly expanding space in which ServiceNow succeeded in growing through land and expand contracts.It succeeded tremendously so much so that the competition picked up momentum and is now underpricing ServiceNow and attempting to take market share.I believe that there's a mismatch between investors looking back to ServiceNow's success, pricing the stock's future prospects and the ultimate reality.The resonance between investing in 2008 and 2020 is uncanny. Back in 2008, the only aspect of investing that actually mattered was balance sheets. After that, everything could be appraised. Back then, there was a very stark pass/fail approach that started with the balance sheet.Currently, investors are still not despondent enough to start their appraisal on ServiceNow's balance sheet (although this is fundamentally strong).For now, investors are still looking out for revenue growth. Said another way, there is a mix of denial and too much optimism that ServiceNow will be able to withstand this global recession.To be perfectly clear, I do believe that ServiceNow will come out from this global recession intact, but my sole contention is that its expected growth rates will pale in comparison with investors' expectations. Here's a graph I highlighted previously:Source: Author's work; using high-end of company guidanceBefore the coronavirus outbreak brought on the global recession, ServiceNow was already pointing to declining revenue growth rates.As I have consistently noted, even though Q1 2020 is pointing towards 33% revenue growth rates, by the end of Q4 2020, its revenue growth run-rate will be expected to fall below 30%.We know that before the coronavirus outbreak brought on the global recession, ServiceNow's renewal rate had fallen to 97%:(Source)Put another way, even though in Q4 2019 the economy was still in full swing, ServiceNow was already posting a decline in renewal rates.Furthermore, we know that as of Q4 2019, ServiceNow had 892 customers with contracts greater than $1 million. This means that the rest of its customers, approximately 4,300, had smaller contracts and came from smaller businesses.Accordingly, we know that during this unexpected global recession, the businesses that will be hit hardest will be smaller businesses. Do we really expect that these smaller businesses will be considering increasing their IT infrastructure during this downturn? I truly fail to see that as the case.In fact, we saw that indirect SaaS peer Adobe (ADBE) note that customers were highly optimistic that when the uncertainty is removed, they will once again return to its platform. We should expect a similar dynamic to hit ServiceNow.ServiceNow is being awarded a premium valuation as investors are expecting two dynamics:1) Strong renewal rates2) Steady and predictable revenue growth ratesHowever, not only are its renewal rates starting to decline, but its revenue growth rate is also now likely to slow down more abruptly than investors had expected.There is no reason for investors to continue to pay 40 times trailing cash flows for a company that is now likely to be growing at sub 30 percent or even slower during this global downturn when there are plenty of much cheaper opportunities elsewhere.ServiceNow is overpriced and has not corrected its valuation to reflect the fact that a global recession is now on the cards. Avoid this stock now."
4321106,69905,2020-02-04T00:23:38-05:00,"ServiceNow's Q4 2019 results and 2020 guidance make it clear that revenues are slowing down.Renewal rates of 97% are the lowest they have been over the past five quarters.Competition in the sector is intensifying.Ultimately, investors would do well to take profits.","ServiceNow (NOW) delivered a strong beat in its Q4 2019 results. The stock rallied significantly, but upon analysis, investors should become more cautious than ever.With an overvalued stock, razor-thin profit margins, mounting competition, and a slowing growth rate, investors would do well to sidestep this investment now. Here's why:Source: Press Statements; ***Company guidanceThe graph above highlights the fact that revenue growth rates are slowing. The company finds itself at a crossroads, proclaiming ambitions to reach a $10 billion sales target in the future, while at the same time, its 3-year 35% CAGR investors had become accustomed to are not likely to be revisited.On deeper analysis, besides the graph pointing to a steady and consistent decline in its top line growth rate, what is arguably more unexpected as well as less frequently discussed is that Q1 2020 is pointing to GAAP revenues to be up 32%, while full-year 2020 is pointing to be up just 30%.Without any need for mathematical acrobatics, it's clear that as ServiceNow gets further into 2020, its top line must be consistently expected to report sub-30% growth rates. What about in 2021, how it is likely to measure up then?Next, let's appraise the facts:(Source: Slide 13)You can see that ServiceNow's renewal rates of 97% have dipped both sequentially and compared with the same period a year ago. You may contend that it's not a significant factor. However, allow me to disagree - this is, in fact, crucial.The whole premise of the stock's valuation is contingent on customers being ""locked in"" and not leaving the platform once they are on it. However, the facts evidently don't line up with that narrative. Customers are leaving, and for a SaaS company, these figures raise a yellow flag.A couple of noteworthy insights. Not only is the IT Operations Management (ITOM) becoming increasingly fragmented, but Atlassian (TEAM) is no longer the pushover it was once deemed to be:(Source: Blended Perspectives)Separately, according to Blended Perspectives, not only is ServiceNow by far the most overvalued package, but Atlassian sells on average the same functionality for around 7% of the cost of ServiceNow.Looking ahead, as ServiceNow's revenues slow down, investors will increasingly look further down its income statement - with more and more questions surrounding its eventual profitability, which thus far look uninspiring, at a paltry 1% for income from operations for 2019.In actuality, ServiceNow's actual costs are reflected in management's stock-based compensation. To consider the company's non-GAAP operating income, with its added-back managerial costs, is akin to arguing that one's salary should not factor in any bills or mortgage payments - this is highly misleading.In fact, when the company declares that 2019 produced free cash flow margins of 36%, investors would do well to look askance. Why?Firstly, because ServiceNow's free cash flow does not factor in its deferred compensation ($168 million for 2019) or its stock-based compensation ($662 million for 2019). Secondly, the company is fairly aggressive in its capitalization of intangibles, reaching $73 million for 2019.You may retort that this is a common industry practice among software companies. Sadly, I disagree. Indeed to put this into perspective I point readers to Microsoft (MSFT), which is one of the best software companies in the world, and its non-existent cost capitalization ethos.(Source: Author's calculations)The most puzzling aspect of the whole story is presented above. We know that ServiceNow's revenues growth rates are unquestionably decelerating. Shareholders may declare that ServiceNow is only getting started, but the facts plainly contradict this assumption.Hence, why should investors pay 50x trailing cash flows (before capex, cost capitalizations, and stock-based compensation) when it is clear that ServiceNow has no sustainable competitive advantage.ServiceNow is a leader delivering enterprise cloud services, thereby aiding enterprises with their digital workflows. Even more, I acquiesce that users unquestionably report a formidable experience making it easier to be productive.My sole argument is that shareholders are overpaying to participate in ServiceNow stock. Ultimately, shareholders would do well to take profits and sidestep this investment."
4320203,103480,2020-01-30T12:36:05-05:00,"Shares of ServiceNow have risen ~7% to new all-time highs after reporting fourth-quarter results and issuing FY20 guidance.Of note is how ServiceNow has managed to maintain mid-30s revenue growth despite the company's >$4 billion annual revenue scale.At the same time, ServiceNow has also been able to keep gradually pushing operating margins and FCF up.However, shares look expensive at ~14x forward revenues.","ServiceNow (NOW), the provider of workflow tools and IT service management products, has just reported its fourth quarter results, the first under new boss Bill McDermott, the former CEO of fellow tech giant SAP (SAP). ServiceNow's results speak for themselves: despite now having become a mega-cap software company exceeding $4 billion in annual revenues, ServiceNow has managed to remain relevant in the software sphere, growing its top line north of 30% y/y despite a wealth of competition from similarly high-profile incumbents including Atlassian (TEAM).Investors took kindly to ServiceNow's results, and especially cheered on higher-than-expected guidance for 2020. Shares of ServiceNow rose ~7% post-earnings, one of the best earnings reactions in the tech sector so far:Data by YChartsThe question for investors now is: can ServiceNow's rally keep going? ServiceNow has consistently already been one of the most expensive names in the software sector; this post-earnings rise makes it even more so. Investors are banking on new CEO McDermott's experience in transforming SAP into a global giant, and hoping he can do the same with ServiceNow. But to what extent is ServiceNow's good results and future growth hopes already priced into its shares? We'll examine ServiceNow's valuation in greater detail shortly, but at current share prices, I believe ServiceNow is more or less priced at perfection.We also have to consider the macroeconomic environment. Perhaps more so than most software companies, ServiceNow is very sensitive to reductions in IT spending. Its flagship products deal with the transformation of IT and modernizing how it's delivered to the modern office - how will ServiceNow position its new business when its prospects are pulling back on new IT investments in the face of an uncertain global environment? U.S. GDP was just reported at its weakest-ever rate in three years; what if IT spending similarly slows down?The bottom line on ServiceNow: there's no doubt that the company is putting up solid numbers and maintaining its technology leadership (Gartner has named ServiceNow as a Leader in its annual ranking of IT service management vendors, six years in a row), but much of this outperformance is already priced in. WIth valuation in mind, I'd rather invest elsewhere.With that being said, we have to acknowledge that ServiceNow has posted incredibly strong results that distinguish its fundamental performance from the rest of the software sector, in particular by balancing mid-30s growth alongside strong profitability. ServiceNow's fourth-quarter results give investors a good inkling of why its shares are so pricey.Take a look at the company's earnings summary below:Figure 1. ServiceNow Q4 earnings resultsSource: ServiceNow Q4 earnings releaseKey to note here, of course, is ServiceNow's tremendous growth. Revenues grew at 33% y/y to $951.8 million, surpassing Wall Street's expectations of $940.1 million (+31% y/y) by a solid two-point margin. Subscription revenues grew even faster than that at 35% y/y. Again, recognizing ServiceNow's growth in the context of its scale (~$1 billion in quarterly revenues) is incredibly important. Take Workday (WDAY) for example, often a useful comp against ServiceNow because both companies dominate a subsector of enterprise cloud software and are of a similar scale. In Workday's most recent third quarter, the company generated $938.1 million in revenues (about the same scale as ServiceNow), but growth clocked in at just 26% y/y. ServiceNow is growing seven points faster than a similarly-scaled rival.We can see from the chart below that ServiceNow has barely showed any deceleration in revenue growth over the past several quarters, though deceleration has been a fear across the industry (especially in Workday, who announced last year that its core HCM product had reached a saturation point):Figure 2. ServiceNow growth trendsSource: ServiceNow Q4 investor presentationWe even note that ServiceNow's subscription billings growth rates accelerated in Q4 to 37% y/y, setting the company up nicely for 2020. For the upcoming year, ServiceNow has guided to 30% y/y growth in subscription revenues - but considering that the company exited Q4 at a 37% y/y growth rate in billings (which is often the best forward-looking indicator of future revenue growth), this seems like an easy hurdle to exceed.Figure 3. ServiceNow guidance updateSource: ServiceNow Q4 earnings releaseBill McDermott, ServiceNow's new CEO, has outlined five key priorities to keep driving ServiceNow's growth in 2020, listing them during his prepared remarks on the Q4 earnings call:Of course, amid all the focus on ServiceNow's growth, it's easy to forget that the company has also delivered incredible profitability. Take a look at the chart below:Figure 4. ServiceNow margin trendsSource: ServiceNow Q4 investor presentationServiceNow managed to drive a one-point y/y improvement in pro forma operating margins to 22%, while free cash flow margins jumped 2 points to 36%. For the full year FY19, ServiceNow generated a stunning $971.1 million in revenues, growing 33% y/y and representing a 28% FCF margin. ServiceNow even expects FCF margins to continue rising in FY19, with its guidance calling for 29% FCF margins. With all these bullish results behind us, however, we'll revisit the original question: to what extent is this outperformance already baked into ServiceNow's current share price. Based on the ~$335 price at which ServiceNow is currently trading, ServiceNow has a market cap of $64.41 billion. After netting out the $2.70 billion of cash and $0.69 billion of convertible debt on ServiceNow's balance sheet, we arrive at an enterprise value of $62.41 billion.For the coming fiscal year, ServiceNow has guided to subscription revenues of $4.22-$4.24 billion. Subscription revenues have extended to comprise ~94% of ServiceNow's total revenue base, so if we gross this guidance up, we arrive at full-year revenues of $4.47-$4.49 billion in revenues, or a midpoint of $4.48 billion (+29% y/y). Applying a 29% FCF margin against this number also yields a free cash flow forecast of $1.30 billion, up 34% y/y. This implies that ServiceNow is currently trading at 13.9x EV/FY20 revenues and 48.0x EV/FY20 FCF. On a revenue basis, that puts ServiceNow squarely in the company of some of the most expensive names in the large-cap software space:Data by YChartsWIth markets continuing to march to new all-time highs, I'm more inclined to invest in more beaten-down software names, even if they're slower-growing. On the large-cap side, I far prefer VMware (VMW), which like ServiceNow is also capable of generating rich free cash flows. I fear overall that ServiceNow's price is setting up unrealistic expectations for perfection, and in an uncertain economic environment for 2020, even the slightest misstep could cause a huge correction in ServiceNow stock - similar to what happened to Workday last year. Stay on the sidelines here until valuations come down to more moderate levels."

The transition of middle market and large enterprises from on-premises systems to cloud systems is a multi-decade process that is only partially complete.Companies such as ServiceNow are squarely in the middle of streamlining IT operations across a range of functionalities.NOW’s valuation appears to be a function of its revenue growth and potential for future earnings, not based on its current earnings.In effect, investors buying the stock at its current level are betting that its growth will take it to new heights and that it will start generating much larger earnings.Perhaps, but a discounted cash flow analysis using very generous 20% earnings growth assumptions still doesn’t pencil out:Source: GuruFocusThe DCF shows a forward earnings baseline of $3.24 growing at 20% per year for ten years, with a discount rate of 8% and still the stock is overvalued by more than twice.Maybe NOW will meet or exceed the dreams of its cheerleaders, but I’m NEUTRAL until it starts to justify its valuation with significant earnings and not just revenue growth and TAM expansion."
4313171,69905,2019-12-18T13:34:52-05:00,"ServiceNow is nowhere near an asset-light, high-margin enterprise.Investors are rotating out of cloud-based stocks.Overvalued ServiceNow is no longer a compelling investment.","ServiceNow (NOW) has been a very rewarding investment for shareholders the past five years, two years, and twelve months, easily outperforming the S&P 500 (SPY) over these time frames.During the bull market when investors were unquestionably willing to pay up for strong growth potential and more than satisfied with having to endure razor-thin profit margins, ServiceNow had been terrific.But in the post-We Company (WE) (formerly WeWork), the investment landscape has now changed. Looking ahead, ServiceNow has the makings of a very poor risk-reward investment and is a stock best avoided.CEO John Donahoe is soon stepping down to take a position as Nike's (NKE) CEO. President and CEO Bill McDermott will be taking the reins at a critical junction for the company, as shareholders look for direction. McDermott certainly has big shoes to fill and I wish him luck.Moving on, last month I noted ServiceNow's declining revenue growth rates and I will not repeat myself here, but simply add this graph for context:Source: ServiceNow Slows Down, AvoidServiceNow IPOed at just the correct time to benefit from the huge demand from customers for enterprise cloud solutions.The problem is that competitors have also benefited and the market has now become rapidly crowded with a plethora of competitors, as well as incredibly fragmented, as customers' IT needs become increasingly specialized.ServiceNow highlights to investors that it is determined to grow the company from 2019's GAAP revenues of $3.3 billion all the way to $10 billion. This sounds highly alluring, of course - although no time frame is noted.Hence, I believe it makes sense to question the key drivers of ServiceNow's revenues. ServiceNow has two services:ServiceNow's Professional services are largely uninteresting because they are driven by a third-party network of partners, one-off in nature, with partners responsible for customer implementations. Also, more importantly, professional services carry gross profit loss margins of 21%.Thus, we are solely left with ServiceNow's subscription services as the coveted recurring business model, with high gross profit margins hovering around 83%.The trouble for investors is that ServiceNow's main costs are accounted for in the form of stock-based compensation:Source: author's calculationsThus, even though ServiceNow portrays itself as an asset-light cloud-based recurring revenue business model, in actuality, it barely makes much in the way of profit (before taxes).For as long as the stock ""performed"", meaning increased week after week and month after month, shareholders were not overly concerned about its poor profit profile.But given that the past six months the stock is largely unchanged, I suspect investors will start to question its prospects a little closer.Source: author's calculationsIf you have followed my work in this space for some time, you will no doubt have noted that I'm overly bearish this sector as a whole.With too many players, all grossly overvalued, investors at some point will start to reconsider whether paying up north of 45x trailing cash flows for a company clearly growing at sub 35% makes for a truly compelling investment?Data by YChartsWith the exception of Adobe (ADBE), which is the only player in this space that I have acquiesced could be viewed as interesting investment, the rest of this space has underperformed the S&P 500 during the past six months.Altogether, all the facts appear to point towards the investment landscape finally starting to change and investors may be rotating out of cloud-based stocks.For now, ServiceNow has strong tailwinds to its back, as customers' demand for digital transformation and cloud-based solutions are still nascent and expected to increase at a rapid clip over the coming several years.Having said that, this narrative is already factored into the share price many times over, and investors will require more good news to become positively ""excited"" about ServiceNow's future prospects and to find its stock a rewarding opportunity.On balance, I fail to see a compelling enough investment opportunity and believe the stock is best avoided."
4317842,35181,2020-01-20T05:26:52-05:00,Stock price has recovered from the drop due to the announced exit of CEO John Donahoe back in October.Former SAP CEO Bill McDermott was the right selection for taking ServiceNow to the next level.The stock is now surging to new all-time highs in bullish SaaS market conditions.,"ServiceNow, Inc. (NOW) stock had a shaky summer and fall of 2019 amidst the general collapse of SaaS companies. The drop in stock price was capped by the announcement that CEO John Donahoe was leaving for greener pastures. But the stock has now recovered and appears to be breaking out to new all-time highs.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)ServiceNow is not alone in this bullish move. I have already covered several stocks this year that are breaking out including Splunk Inc. (SPLK), Five9 Inc. (FIVN), and NICE Ltd. (NICE). This is a broad move amongst digital transformation stocks and investors should not be caught on the sidelines. The malaise of 2019 is done, gone, finito. It is time to jump on the bandwagon or be left behind. And ServiceNow is one of the big SaaS companies leading the charge, with a very sticky product and apparently limitless TAM, at least according to the CEO. Revenue growth is above 30% and free cash flow is excellent. New CEO Bill McDermott, formerly the CEO of SAP SE (SAP), is fully capable of leading ServiceNow to the next sales plateau, a target of $10 billion. For these reasons, I am retaining my very bullish rating for ServiceNow.ServiceNow will be very well served by CEO Bill McDermott. Under Bill McDermott's leadership, SAP's market cap grew from $39 billion to $163 billion. ServiceNow's market cap is close to $60 billion. Who better to take it to the next level?The challenge for ServiceNow is to get product visibility at the C-suite level and Bill McDermott has the connections, not only in the USA but internationally, to achieve the required visibility at the top level.When asked about possible disruption during the transition period, Bill McDermott's response was as follows:In other words, leadership at the CEO level, and CFO as well, is in transition, but the sales organization is extremely stable and won't be disrupted by the changes.As I have explained in previous articles, high-growth companies generally don't measure up based on traditional value metrics. In fact, such companies often confound analysts who inevitably attempt to apply their beloved value metrics, with the result being a lost investment opportunity. In place of traditional value factors, I generally focus on other measures, such as revenue growth, free cash flow margin and the software company ""Rule of 40.""ServiceNow has excellent annual revenue growth of 32%, down from the 5-year rate of almost 44%.(Source: Portfolio123)ServiceNow’s free cash flow margin TTM is a very strong ~26% of revenues. This margin level has been retained since mid-2017.(Source: Portfolio123)One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help software companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40; some analysts use EBITDA and others use free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin TTM.The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more, then the SaaS company has growth and cash flow in balance and is considered financially healthy. In ServiceNow’s case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 32% + 26% = 58%The calculation easily exceeds 40% leading me to conclude that ServiceNow's financials are healthy.I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated Y-o-Y sales growth for the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated Y-o-Y sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate,"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, ServiceNow is above the best-fit line, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is higher than its peers', given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that ServiceNow is valued higher than the average stock in my digital transformation universe, based on Sales/EV multiple.However, my value assessment changes when I substitute estimated forward gross profits for forward sales.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)Given the results shown on this second scatter plot, I have to conclude that ServiceNow is only slightly overvalued, not significant enough to prevent withholding a bullish or very bullish rating.While software stock valuations have come down in recent months, they are still high on a historical basis. Uncertainties, such as the rising tension in the Middle East, trade disputes and President Trump's impeachment, could cause a market downturn. Software stocks tend to get hit hard during any market turbulence.While I don't believe that the top-level shuffle of both CEO and CFO will impact company performance going forward, it is conceivable that this could happen. If it turns out that either CEO or CFO is a misfit then the stock price will suffer. One danger is that the new leaders may, for political purposes, make the company appear to be in bad shape, thus giving them the appearance of ""righting"" a ""wronged"" ship, but I doubt that will happen in this case as the company performance is pretty strong.ServiceNow is another SaaS company at the heart of the digital transformation revolution. There is very little that I can find wrong with this company. Revenue growth is above 30%, free cash flow margin is strong and stable. The product suite is very stable with a customer retention rate of 99%, the best in the industry.I don't believe that the change in leadership will affect company performance. In fact, Bill McDermott may be the right person to lead the company to $10 billion in annual revenue.ServiceNow stock is slightly overvalued by my relative valuation technique, but not so much to stay on the sidelines for this stock that is breaking out to all-time highs.For all of the above reasons, I am retaining my very bullish rating on ServiceNow."

ServiceNow was founded in 2004. The business is focused on IT asset management and IT operations management.ServiceNow developed a SaaS (Software as a Service) platform to allow simpler ticketing and helpdesk visibility for IT departments. Put simply, the organization's core mission is workflow automation for IT. The business serves almost 900 of the Fortune 2000 enterprises and has a market capitalization of nearly $60B and is on track to do almost $3.5B in revenue in 2019. ServiceNow has delivered annualized returns of over 35% per annum over the last five years.It is a core holding for the Sustainable Growth portfolios where it was added to in October 2019 and has returned almost 30%.Improving IT workflow automationServiceNow has a critical role in the bowels of IT management. The business works to improve IT workflow and functionality across IT departments globally. IT departments face a variety of issues in performing service delivery to internal customers within an enterprise. These include such tasks as IT asset management, new device ordering, provisioning, IT trouble ticket management, and employee onboarding. Such processes create a variety of tickets and escalations which need to be acted upon. Successful completion requires employee input, ticket handling and escalation, and ultimate resolution all within required service-level agreements that IT departments have with the lines of business.ServiceNow has been able to help IT departments improve their productivity in executing all these various tasks via a common interface accessible to IT employees, helping to provide visibility into IT task execution and serving as a record of the status of various IT requests. Further, the company has streamlined the process by which employees in an enterprise interact with their IT department, providing an intuitive software portal that serves to manage interactions as an alternative to e-mail and phone. This is a critical service delivery function that enables the IT departments to meet service delivery obligations on time and on budget.ServiceNow has progressively extended its IT Service Management toolset to Field Service Management and Facilities Service Management. Along with the core IT Service Management product, this represents a market of almost $20B for the company, growing at 10% annually.Sticky service which makes IT departments look goodIT task management is a core function central to the operations of IT departments. Once ServiceNow establishes a beachhead within an IT department, they become very difficult to dislodge, particularly if ServiceNow is able to add significant productivity to the functioning of these departments. Deploying an alternate IT management system adds considerable costs to re-training existing internal IT employees on the use of that new system, with potential productivity gaps as users ramp up on a new system, not to mention potential confusion in task priority, handling, and resolution.While competitors in ServiceNow's markets do exist, such as IBM (NYSE:IBM), HP (NYSE:HPQ) and BMC, these vendors have generally tried to enter the market via acquisitions, which has given rise to complex integration where work is required to implement and make systems talk to each other rather than ServiceNow's organic approach.In addition, by working hand in glove with IT organizations, ServiceNow becomes a friend of IT departments and aids the agenda of IT departments to centralize and coordinate other systems and technology workflow management across other business units within an enterprise. In doing this, ServiceNow not only assists the IT departments' agenda of expanding internal influence, but also makes IT departments an ally in helping ServiceNow expand influence into other areas within an enterprise.Automation of workflow beyond IT expands value to an enterpriseCustomer service, employee onboarding and systems management have similar workflow to the type of tasks that ServiceNow performs for IT departments. By being hand in glove with IT, ServiceNow is able to use IT as an advocate to help competently prove its credentials to be able to handle some of these other functional areas, with these business units often seeking the input of IT or consulting with them in the implementation and delivery of such workflows. Thus ServiceNow is able to progressively expand the scope of services and revenue that it extracts over time from a given customer.ServiceNow has had considerable success here and has implemented a Customer Service Management module, helping employees manage customer service tasks, as well as a Human Resource Management module which helps with employee onboarding and employee recruitment. These newer modules account for 40% of new contract value today, a number which has been rapidly increasing recently. Further, successfully adding new modules and functionality has helped ServiceNow increase its addressable market to an estimated $165B by 2023.Source: ServiceNow Investor PresentationExpanding its tentacles across an enterprise from one department to another enables NOW to create such a lock on a given customer, which becomes difficult to unseat, with widespread loss of productivity across multiple functions within an enterprise if ServiceNow is displaced. This interesting aspect of the ServiceNow business model shows up in the extremely high retention rates that it experiences which have been steadily improving and are close to 99%.Source: ServiceNow Earnings PresentationFurthermore, greater than 75% of ServiceNow customers typically deploy multiple modules, which speaks to the success that the company has in being able to branch out beyond just the IT function.ServiceNow has grown revenue at a rate of 43% annualized over the last five years, and in its most recently reported results, the company grew revenue at 33%. It has been able to increase new customers at a double-digit rate, as well as successfully retain existing customers and sell them more over time. Gross margins have improved steadily over the last four years, from 67% in 2016 to almost 77% today. ServiceNow also does an excellent job with revenue to cash flow conversion, with almost 20% of cash flow being retained net from revenues generated.Unfortunately, all of this comes at a high price for new investors today. A general sell-off in SaaS businesses and investor consternation over a CEO change took ServiceNow's share price as low as $220 in October. Since then, it has strongly rebounded, rising more than 40% to currently trade at $312 per share, putting the business on almost 19x sales, well up from 13x sales that it recently changed hands at and well above its average price to sales ratio over the last five years of 13x sales.Incidentally, ServiceNow's CEO change is a development that investors should welcome, with John Donahue's exit to Nike (NYSE:NKE), allowing Bill McDermott, former CEO of SAP Europe, to take the top post. McDermott comes well credentialed and is a veteran of the enterprise software space through his tenure at SAP.ServiceNow has built a very lucrative niche in the workflow automation space with IT being its core customer. It plays in a fairly large market which is very sticky and has large barriers to entry. The business is extremely financially disciplined with very robust rates of growth currently that should also continue well into the future. While current valuations leave little room for any margin of error, this is a name that investors should put on their list to add with any pullback in valuation."

However, I strongly contend that not only is this stock overvalued, but it has the making of a risky investment.Investors would do well to reconsider this holding.Investors hate bad news. And anyone who objectively demonstrates facts that are at odds with their own underlying hypothesis often rises in them feelings of apathy.Source: author's calculations, press statementsHighlighted above you can hopefully see that as 2019 progressed that ServiceNow's steady and predictable subscription billings are not all that steady.Furthermore, I'll acquiesce that whereas 2018 finished with subscription revenues increasing by 38% year-over-year, for 2019 this is guided to 36% to 37%. Here, you'll proclaim that ServiceNow is sandbagging or that the difference between ServiceNow growing at 38% and at an expected 36% to 37% is a tiny deceleration hardly worth questioning.However, two noteworthy aspects come to fore:Accordingly, seen that Q1 2019 was up 40% year-over-year, this obviously pushed up ServiceNow's full-year 2019 results. But investors should now start to think ahead: what about Q1 2020? And the Q2 2020? What happens when it comes to lapping those strong results from this year?(Source)While the stock is rising or even stable, investors are incredibly patient. 'Buy and hold' strategies are acknowledged to be the best and the only strategy to carve out one's riches. What's not to like?Nobody is going to ask difficult questions, least of all the sell-side, as they will be only too happy to peddle the stock forward under the guise of steady/predictable/recurring/cloud/SaaS platforms (at this point you can probably add a couple of terms yourself).But the problem here is slightly more subtle than a 1% to 2% deceleration in year-over-year subscription revenue.Source: author's calculationsHighlighted in the graph we can see that just at the point when ServiceNow's growth rates are decelerating is the exact point at which investors are paying the biggest premium over its sales.Source: author's calculationsAs you can see, the whole sector trades at a premium. This is understandable given the utterly explosive growth in this space over the past 5 years.This space is new, it's cool, it's recurring, it's in high demand - and that's all true.However, when investing understanding these criteria are not sufficient; investors need to incorporate 'price' into the equation too - and here it gets more complicated.What follows in the graph below is a depiction of ServiceNow's GAAP revenues. The difference between this next graph from the one at the start is that this graph includes professional services and other revenues. This one is ServiceNow's consolidated revenues.Source: author's calculationsAnd we can see that once we analyze point-blank ServiceNow's trajectory, its revenues growth rates are unquestionably slowing down.As ServiceNow becomes bigger, it becomes more challenging to find new accounts that are able to 'move the needle' on its top line - this is to be expected.But at the same time, this is the exact moment when investors are happy to pay the biggest premium for the company. This popular name is best avoided."

Assuming modest growth rates for the next 5 years, this target could be achievable by 2024. The below sections provide a breakdown of how this can be achieved by making modest assumptions.Source: Author’s calculationsExpansion of ITSM NeedsThe cloud ITSM market is expected to be worth $10 billion by 2024, with a five-year CAGR of 19%, vs. the current market value of $4.4 billion. Assuming approximately 55% of subscription revenue comes from cloud IT products. ServiceNow’s IT product (ITSA, ITSM, ITBM, ITOM) revenue can be approximated to $1.88 Billion indicating a 42% market share. This calculation is validated by the report from the research by a leading technology market research firm.Below are my projections for ServiceNow’s cloud IT performance until 2024.Source: Author’s calculationsSource: Author’s calculationsIn my opinion, ServiceNow’s IT product segment (ITSA, ITSM, ITBM, ITOM) is well established but will continue to lose market share to other smaller players. (This has been accounted for in the projections.)Emerging ProductsCSM (Customer Service Management), HR, Security, and Intelligent Apps are ServiceNow’s emerging products. With emerging products, ServiceNow is expanding its presence beyond IT.Currently, this constitutes ~30% of the subscription revenue ($1.02 Billion FY2019). In my opinion, this segment will see strong growth in the next 5 years through:The ability to expand the scope of sales with existing customers is a key factor in the company’s growth. The evidence of this is already visible through the performance in FY19. Along with an excellent renewal rate of 99%, we are able to see an expansion in the relationship with existing customers through the growing number of customers with sales > $1 million.Source: Investor PresentationSource: Author’s calculationsAssuming modest growth rates, I anticipate the Emerging Products space to constitute approximately 50% of ServiceNow’s top line by 2024.Now PlatformThe Now Platform offers Platform-as-a-service capabilities to enable organizations to build intelligent applications. Low Code development is another aspect of this platform’s strengths. Market research suggests these PaaS capabilities to be worth close to $53 Billion.ServiceNow is not a major player in this space yet, but the high renewal rates and customer satisfaction puts them at a strong position to cross-sell the PaaS capabilities to existing ITSM customers. It is quite early in the digital transformation timeline and PaaS considerations are yet to become discussion topics for several industries (see section below on digital transformation).Assuming less than 10% market share in the PaaS space, I create the following outlook for ServiceNow’s Platform stream.Source: Author’s calculationsIn my opinion, the growth numbers indicated are very conservative estimates. As the digital transformation trend continues, it is likely that the growth will be faster than projected.In 2016, a study was done by McKinsey Global Institute and the results were published by Harvard Business Review. This study revealed that knowledge-intensive sectors such as IT, Media, Professional services, Finance and Insurance industries were more digitally advanced.Source: McKinsey Global Institute and Harvard Business ReviewWithin the categories outlined in the McKinsey Global report, ServiceNow provides the organization the ability to perform:A much more recent report from McKinsey Global Institute reveals that the sectors with the maximum impact of digital transformation have been almost similar since 2016, with the addition of Retail & Automotive. Hence there is still a lot of runway for growth.Source: McKinsey Global Institute reportServiceNow’s emerging products and platform offering enables businesses to build capabilities to scale their operations. As the story of digital transformation is still in its introductory chapters, with more sectors digitizing aspects of their business, there is a high probability that we will see increased adoption of ServiceNow. I am expecting the next wave to see the increase in Financial Services, Insurance and Retail customers.Source: ServiceNow commands 0.29% market share in Cloud Platforms & ServicesDifficult to replaceServiceNow was recently named as a leader in the ITSM space by Gartner. These ratings along with its spectacular renewal rates of 99% demonstrate the level of satisfaction of its customers.Moreover, ServiceNow’s products, once deployed and functional are relatively hard to replace.New LeadershipWith current CEO John Donahoe stepping down to take up the chief executive role at Nike (NYSE:NKE), the company will bring in Bill McDermott, the former CEO of SAP SE (SAP).With a career championing the leading roles in technology spanning more than 19 years, Bill is known for his innovation-led strategy for SAP has resulted in expansive increases in customers, total revenue, market value, and profitable growth. Since taking over as CEO of SAP in 2010, SAP's market cap has increased from $39 billion to $160 billion at the present time.There is a lot of similarity in SAP and ServiceNow’s businesses. Both are cloud-driven technology solutions that aim to digitally transform organizations and enhance business productivity. Bill took over SAP when it was about the same size (in terms of market cap) as ServiceNow is today. The expectation from Bill here in ServiceNow is to recreate the magic and his experience and relationships with former customers should be able to guide him well.ServiceNow aims to continue IT products' growth while rapidly accelerating its emerging products and platform offerings. In my opinion, Bill McDermott is an ideal candidate to power ServiceNow’s growth and achieve its strategic objectives.Source: YCharts3. ServiceNow made several acquisitions to strengthen its Now Platform. Details of those acquisitions are elaborated in my previous article on the company ""Now Platform May Be The Next Chapter In ServiceNow's Growth."" Long-term investors should be wary of the fact that during the process of growing the emerging products and the platform divisions, the company may make more acquisitions in the future and this could impact its profitability.4. Competition is high in the cloud technology space. At present, the capabilities offered by ServiceNow are industry-leading and well-rated by popular technology reviewers. However, the markets for the landscape is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and has relatively low barriers to entry. As mentioned above, the difficulty to replace the technology is a strength, but competition could impact the ability to acquire new customers.ServiceNow stock has experienced sharp selling in the past week. I believe the matters surrounding the drop in price constitute a lot of noise and are failing to consider the long-term growth path ahead of the company. The cloud IT suite, emerging products and the PaaS platform have the potential to expand with the digital transformation wave. The strong and growing customer base, excellent renewal rates and the promising ability to cross-sell new offerings to existing customers are the strong fundamentals ServiceNow has to take advantage of the opportunity. I rate ServiceNow as a buy."

ServiceNow also announced a change in leadership, and investors believe that the company's growth will continue under the new leader.ServiceNow's quarterly revenues grew 32% over the year to $885.8 million, marginally shy of the market's expectations of $886 million. Adjusted earnings of $1.03 per share was ahead of the market's forecast of $0.99 for the quarter.For the quarter, non-GAAP Subscription revenues grew 35% to $847.6 million. Professional services and other revenues improved 11% to $51.7 million.Total billings improved 28% over the year to $921 million with subscription billings growing 29% to $869.1 million and Professional services growing 12% to $51.9 million.ServiceNow expects to end the current year with subscription revenues of $3.302-3.307 billion. The market was looking for revenues of $949.68 million for the quarter with an EPS of $0.96 and fiscal year revenues of $3.46 billion with an EPS of $3.24.ServiceNow is driving growth through enhancements to its mobile and AI offerings. Earlier last month, it announced the release of native mobile experiences for everyday work across the enterprise. The mobile offering is powered by the Now Platform and helps employees by providing a simple, user-friendly interface. It manages complex enterprise workflows across functions, departments, and systems, thus making complex tasks easier. It also includes a new Onboarding app that helps new employees when they join an organization.Within AI, ServiceNow announced the acquisition of the cognitive search capabilities of Attivio, an AI-powered answers and insights platform player. Boston-based Attivio was set up in 2007 to deliver natural language processing, machine learning, text analytics, and AI-powered search capabilities to organizations. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Prior to the acquisition, Attivio had raised $102 million in funding from investors including Per-Olof Söderberg, Tenth Avenue Holdings, General Electric Pension Trust, and Oak Investment Partners.The addition of Attivio's search engine to the ServiceNow platform will help ServiceNow improve its search capabilities to move beyond keyword-based search. It will be able to deliver out-of-the-box, conversational AI, and search experiences at scale to customers. ServiceNow plans to integrate Attivio's technologies in its IT, customer, and Employee workflows.Additionally, ServiceNow continues to expand its market reach through product enhancement and market expansion. Earlier this quarter, it announced that its HR Service Delivery product is available on SAPApp Center, the marketplace for SAP partner offerings. The organizations and their employees will now be able to access their ServiceNow and SAP SuccessFactors task lists and approvals anytime, anywhere through an omni-channel service experience with ServiceNow Virtual Agent and Now Mobile app. Employees will also be able to get a better service on tasks that may begin with one department, but may involve multiple functions or departments to ensure completion.As part of its geographic footprint expansion, ServiceNow recently opened a development center in Hyderabad, India. This R&D center will be its second largest center globally. The center will lay specific emphasis on AI and mobile experiences for its products.ServiceNow also announced that its CEO John Donahoe will be stepping down by January. He will be replaced by Bill McDermott, who recently announced his exit from SAP. While John Donahoe's exit came as a shock, analysts are looking forward to Bill's leadership. Analysts already believe that, as with SAP, he will continue to propel ServiceNow's growth through acquisitions.Bill will have plenty of companies to choose from for his acquisition shopping cart. ServiceNow, for instance, could benefit from the addition of IT Business Management vendor like Apptio (NASDAQ:APTI). Apptio's SaaS solution helps organizations analyze, plan, optimize, control, and collaborate on the IT investments. An acquisition by ServiceNow will help ServiceNow continue to deepen its presence in all the functions of an organization. Earlier this year, Apptio was acquired by private equity firm Vista Equity Partners for $1.94 billion.Other interesting players could be Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) or Freshworks. Global help desk automation player Zendesk would be an expensive buy. It is currently operating at annual revenues of $800 million with a market capitalization of $8 billion. Zendesk's rival Freshworks is smaller with annual revenues estimated at $100 million and a valuation of over $1.5 billion. Either of their acquisitions would help ServiceNow expand its ITSM capability significantly.Its stock is currently trading at $241.22 with a market cap of $45.2 billion. It hit a 52-week low of $147.63 in December last year. In July this year, it touched a record high of $303.17.Original PostEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."

If you truly regret a purchase, sell it immediately. You can always buy it back after you are sure.","Trump's speech yesterday was bellicose and threatening. If this was 2 months ago, it would have cratered the market. He threatened to raise tariffs if there was no agreement, and by stating that ""if there was no agreement,"" it meant that Phase 1 was not baked into the cake. Remember when the deal was announced with great fanfare? All it needed, and I am quoting the ""dealmaker-in-chief"" was that the agreement needed to be ""papered"".What did the market do? Surprisingly or actually not (at least to this observer) it closed flat yesterday, and after weakness this morning coming in from Europe and Asia influencing our futures, the market is continuing higher. There are two theories:Theory 1: Trump is just being Trump, the Chinese are dithering and stalling. They want some good faith reduction in current tariffs and not just rescinding the next tranche of tariffs on December 15.The White House is divided into 2 factions. Those who want to get any kind of deal on the books and then do the heavy lifting into next year at the height of the election campaign. They want a win now.The other faction is the trade war hawks that don't care if the stock market sells off and argues that Phase 1 is the most important step. In this theory, logic will win out, and there will be a deal no matter what because both sides need it.The market is wisely discounting that a deal will happen by looking through the current static to see a positive end result.Theory 2: The market is bored with the whole thing by now. In the teeth of this scare, the US is doing just fine, and the consumer is rocking.In this scenario, the market is contrarian in that international corporations have had years moving what they can move out of China, and now the additional tariff costs will be borne by a combination of the consumer and product mix. In this logical argument, the market participants make note of the fact that the world is recovering from the change in trade flows and the US is growing at a 2% rate. This is where many economists say is the US trend anyway.If China and the US walk away from each other, the market dips 3%, consolidates its gains, and then moves higher like it's doing already. Powell has committed to NEVER raising rates ever again, or at least that is what it sounded like this morning. Employment has been below 4% going into the second year. Workers, while not plentiful, are coming into the workforce. Corporate profits are predicted to grow between 6% and 9% in 2020. Goldilocks!It should surprise no one that I ascribe to ""Theory 2"". The market is just jaded and has moved on; it has discounted the effects of tariffs, and there has been no hint of inflation, and no hint of the consumer not powering ahead. In fact, I think that if the trade deal does come through, the market goes that much higher.In ""Theory 1"", the market has already decided that the trade deal is happening and the only reason for this rally is that the trade deal will happen. When the deal is announced, the market will sell on the news. I am sure you have heard that the market is a ""discounting mechanism""; the key is figuring out what the market has already discounted.Bottom line? The market is rolling like a runaway train; we are going way higher. That doesn't mean we don't get a 3% dip here and there, but this week was the week that I thought we'd get a little static, and... nothing.Proof of my assertion? At the time of this writing, it has been announced that the negotiation has hit a snag over agriculture purchases. The indexes went flat; in the olden days, the indexes would be down 7% in a snap. We are now right back to where we were. Any questions?The health of the market continues to be proved by the constant announcement of deals. We see private equity trying to jump in now while the funding is plentiful and stock prices are CHEAP. That's right, private equity are looking to pick the bottom and sell the high. Going after Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and now this announcement about Tech Data (TECD) tells me that the stock market is a Bargain. To wit: TECD, the technology products and services distributor, agreed to be acquired by affiliates of Apollo Global Management (APO) for $130 per share, or about $5.4 billion.This week I have been writing that the Industrials and the transports are part and parcel of this rally. I want to also note that the tech names have also woken up, so have the chips. So I want to chart 3 names in the cloud space that look like they are waking up and should be bought.Shopping Shopify (SHOP)Source: tradingview.comIt looks like Shopify has woken up after market participants treated it rather poorly. We see a classic ""Head and Shoulders"" formation. The right shoulder has fallen lower than the left shoulder, the classic result of that formation. It has since bounced from that level and has shot right through the downtrend line. I believe that SHOP will now move higher. Perhaps not to new highs this year but certainly higher from here.MongoDB (MDB)Source: tradingview.comMDB is displaying an even better formation here. We have an inverse ""Head and Shoulders"" formation, with the right shoulder higher than the left. We also see a broken downtrend line. This is a flat out buy as well.ServiceNow (NOW)Source: tradingview.comThe NOW chart has the craziest ""Cup and Handle"" formation I have seen in a long time. In all fairness, NOW went through a terrible headline bomb. Nike (NYSE:NKE) plucked the CEO of NOW away to take the place of Mark Parker, who will now take the Chairman's seat. Chatter was rife with rumors of NOW having some kind of accounting scandal. Then Bill McDermott got into the fray as the new CEO and reassured market participants that all is well. Attention went back to the quarterly results which were near-perfect.Now, the question is, does NOW still deserve higher prices? The answer is a resounding YES! We see that gap down, in technical parlance, charts will fill gaps. In this case, the gap down will likely be easily filled by the upward movement of NOW. The caution is, how much of the gap that will be filled. I am not sure of that but a gap acts like a magnet and it will pull prices up into it. NOW is a buy right now.Luckin Coffee (LK): The big China-based coffee chain lost $0.32 per share for its latest quarter, smaller than the $0.37 loss expected; revenue was above forecasts. The Starbucks (SBUX) rival also forecast better than expected current-quarter revenue.My Take: Beware, LK IPO lockup is today. Stock is up strong on this positive news. Does that mean that insiders are holding off selling, or have they sold into this rally? Well, the IPO offered 33 million shares. Let's keep an eye on this name and see how much trading volume there is. The normal number of shares traded per day is nearly 3 million. As of 2:45 pm Eastern, 15 million shares have traded. I would stand back.Datadog (DDOG) had its price target raised by analysts at Needham & Company LLC and at Stifel Nicolaus from $45.00 to $48.00 and from $40.00 to $43.00, respectively. They both now have a ""buy"" rating on the stock.My Take: DDOG has grown revenue by 88% and no losses in its earnings results. That is amazing. I would be cautious about buying it right here. It peaked at $41.92 and is now at $39ish. I would trade against that $41.92 level, and if you can get in at below $37 in the next week or so, great give it a shot. Otherwise, wait for it to break above that intraday high for a fast trade.Chesapeake Energy (CHK): R. Brad Martin Director bought 250K shares at $0.91 for $225,500,000 and the CEO Robert D. Lawler bought 50K shares for $45.5K.My Take: This was after the ""Going Concern"" filing last month. If there was a real ""Going Concern"" issue, would these guys throw away a collective $250K? Maybe, but it's trading for $0.80 cents, maybe just for the goof buy a few hundred shares?Their actual performance in moving to oil and liquids is working. Look, I hate the oil business right now. But I love a good risk/reward; if you spend $160 for 200 shares, that's like a bad week of sports betting. If you like taking a train to Jersey to get on Draft Kings, then fine. If you want the same thrill and stay on this side of the Hudson, why not? Obviously, this article is not written just for New Yorkers, but you should get what I am saying in any case. It's a gamble; if you treat this as an ""All In"" recommendation, then please seek counseling.Personally, I am going to hold off and see if there is more insider buying or upgrades by analysts. It got a downgrade by Morgan Stanley. Still, I am very intrigued, I actually bought some, thought better of it and sold it at a tiny loss five minutes later. The lesson here is, there is no shame in changing your mind.Very often, in my past, when my ego was all wrapped up in trading, I would NEVER do that. Once you take a position you should stay loyal to the end. No, my friend, this is not a hometown sports team or adopting a dog, dating or marriage. This is your money, and if you have regret and it is real, then take that loss immediately.The first part of this paragraph was written before I bought CHK, and the latter part was after. I will track this name, and if I get any further confirmation, I WILL pull the trigger. Right now I am glad I dropped it like it was hot.Once again, Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) is running higher and I am rolling my call spread higher. I got long MDB as well and went back into Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) as well. I spread The Trade Desk (TTD). Finally, I bought, then regretted and immediately sold CHK."

Morningstar stated that $60 billion left mutual and ETF equities. This is the highest outflow since 2009. Those kinds of outflows don't happen before stock market peaks and ahead of a correction. That kind of negativity says there is a lot of money on the sidelines, making for buying in the coming months.Right now, we are about 12 points from a breakout according to the futures. Katie Stockton, a brilliant technical analyst, was on CNBC's Squawk Box yesterday and said that 3,028 was the breakout point; I had 3,024, but no matter. Once we do close above this level, it will draw a lot of traders back into the market. I know a lot of you eschew technical analysis and might think charting is voodoo, but let's just agree that a LOT of professional traders use it and even total bottom-up money managers know the levels.Aside from the fact that a new level in a widely followed index draws less active traders and investors back into the market, it will embolden the aforementioned skeptics on the sidelines to take more risk. Risk is not always a bad thing if the reward is there. Breaking out is proof that reward is in the offing. There are also no ""stranded buyers"" overhead to sell against the rally. Let's step back from the indexes and talk stocks. No one seems to remember but only a year ago Apple (AAPL) fell from about 228 to 144, more than 40%. Many critics at the time said that AAPL's best days were behind it, etc. It took a year for AAPL to break above all those stranded buyers (this is what is meant by overhead resistance) to approach even. At this higher point, the resistance is the strongest since you then had traders with profits from the low plus the long-suffering buyers who bought at the top and never thought they'd get money would begin to sell. Once AAPL broke out, there were no longer any ready sellers, and naturally, the stock would rise and is now rising day after day. It is now above 240 (up about 10% from breakout), and all the analysts are falling all over themselves to raise the price target. This is why you should care about breakouts if you are a trader. If you are an investor, you should let dividends be your first filter. When a stock is moving up so fast the dividend becomes smaller, you should hold off, and look for other stocks that have better income profile.Microsoft had a very good quarter. Some criticized Azure that it is growing less fast at 59%. Let's bear in mind that this growth rate is 1/3rd faster than Amazon's (AMZN) AWS (more on that later). MSFT is easily the safest growth stock for a money manager to get behind in a breakout. MSFT itself has been contending with overhead resistance for months and I believe is destined to break out. Market participants are not blind to what just happened with AAPL, and they will take the next logical step and look at MSFT. Let's take a quick look at the chart ourselves and think about where it could go.The above chart reflects yesterday's close. MSFT opened up 2 points and clearly is showing that it broke the downtrend (the red line). The lower line is at about 133, so with the all-time high at 142, it gives us 9 points. We should see MSFT hit 150 in very short order. All this is technical analysis; adding the recent bottom to the top to see where a stock could go is a guesstimate that many traders will use. I would even say that traders that rode AAPL up 10% will go over and ride MSFT and hope for the same. I never thought I'd say this, but MSFT is a fast money trade, and it is a longer speculation. If you have room for a growth name (it has a dividend), then MSFT is an investment. That's a trifecta in the making.Now, what does this mean for the overall cloud market? A 59% growth in Azure means that there's more demand for Elastic (ESTC), Twilio (TWLO), Okta inc. (OKTA) and all the tools that make the cloud work. It is true that much of the growth in Azure is corporate legacy applications leaving corporate servers and moving to Azure. Still, the momentum of moving to the cloud is alive and well. Any new applications will need the services of a VMware (NYSE:VMW), and a Nutanix (NTNX), etc. Put it another way, if Microsoft is healthy, then Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud is healthy, and AWS is healthy. There is plenty of business to go around. There is so much demand for cloud platforms to support new applications and old that the triumvirate is not yet bumping into each other.We now have confirmation that Donahoe is turning over NOW at the height of its game. No wonder McDermott was so excited. I boosted NOW as a trade yesterday, and I hope some of you took advantage. NOW is up an additional 9% this morning at 240. The all-time high is 300ish, so there will be a point that overhead resistance will kick in. I bet there will be a bunch of upgrades based on McDermott taking over. Is McDermott a better CEO than Donahoe? We don't have to go there. McDermott is a DIFFERENT kind of CEO, sort of in the mold of the late great Mark Hurd who sadly passed away recently. McDermott knows enterprise sales, he understands that market really well, and he grew SAP (NYSE:SAP) against the toughest competition like an Oracle (ORCL) and Hurd who was co-CEO there. SAP is also a horizontal application, while NOW is THE corporate digitization application and horizontal as well. I think we will see a new ""sales forward"" style of management and some big enterprise wins fairly quickly. What the results for NOW mean for the overall market is another confirmation that the cloud names like MongoDB (MDB), Splunk (SPLK), or an Arista Networks (ANET) and the other previously named cloud tools and platforms are still in growth mode. The jury is out on Workday (WDAY) that is more of a business app, if only because the field is getting more crowded there, or that an SAP or an ORCL is getting more competitive. We do see it with New Relic (NEWR) competing with a Datadog (DDOG), so there is no question that over time the horizontal space will further differentiate and new winners will emerge. However, for now, I expect good things from many of these names.PayPal's total payment volume, a closely watched metric, reached $179 billion in the third quarter, up 25% from a year ago. That should read through to American Express (AXP), Visa (V), Mastercard (MS), Square (SQ), Discover Financial (DFS). For the third quarter, PayPal said on Wednesday that it earned an adjusted $723 million, or 61 cents a share, and is well ahead of analysts' consensus expectation of 52 cents. PayPal's revenue came in at $4.4 billion, even with estimates higher and up 19% from last year's $3.7 billion. The health of payments is a great indicator of the health of the consumer and the willingness to adopt new services like Apple Pay and the joint venture between Apple and Goldman Sachs (GS). I didn't include GS with the other Fintech names, but rest assured, GS is the sleeper in this space. GS was always a technology powerhouse, and now it is focusing on the Fintech space instead or in addition to trading technology. Of all the banks, GS is the one that excites me the most. I digress, PYPL is a good trade, though I might wait a day or two to find a lower entry point.The first hurdle is AWS. We need to see at least 37% growth. That is just table-stakes more than that, like a +39% level, and we are off to the races for the cloud names overall and maybe we get some leadership from AMZN. The other piece is that I am concerned that expenses are about to get to the level that will hammer overall earnings. I think that the current AMZN investor is not the old style that looks at low profits and even no profits as the company making growth investments for the future. Same-day delivery and taking up the infrastructure for more and more of the last-mile delivery cost mucho dinero. Of course, AMZN has other ambitions, namely the desire to totally disrupt healthcare.Right now, it is about drug distribution and online pharmacy, but it's going to get bigger in overall healthcare going forward. I wouldn't be surprised if that is discussed in the conference call. Also, the overall logistics approach and competing with FedEx (NYSE:FDX) from the airfreight perspective is a big investment. Finally, I am sure there'll be an analyst on the call that'll ask about JEDI, the $10 billion winner-take-all defense contract. This is a marquee contract. Anyone who gets this will be the acknowledged technology leader and also to having the corporate heft to tackle any mega-enterprise services contract. The accepted wisdom was that AWS was the ""shoo-in"", not so. Word is that now it's 50/50, with Microsoft tipped as the come-from-behind favorite. Why? Everyone in Washington hates Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google and Amazon. It is the only place that Trump is aligned with Bernie, AOC, and Pelosi in hating on AMZN. I think AMZN will have to acknowledge on the call that it is anyone's guess who walks away with the trophy. I think more than one analyst will comment that it's more than 50/50 that AWS doesn't get JEDI. On the other hand, if AMZN finds a way to preserve earnings, grows AWS above expectations (even a little), and still makes progress on new initiatives, then it gets back to old highs, and the cloud names get even more of a head of steam. As an aside, if AWS does lose the JEDI, the clamor for spinning out the cloud business will accelerate.I would hold off on trying to ride Tesla (TSLA). There is a lot of short covering going on. It might take a few days, but I think we will get some kind of a retracement. I would then trade it. TSLA has answered all the naysayers and is once again rallying. I think the old pivot point of 320 will be an interim top, and maybe look for 270ish as an entry-point as TSLA fills in some of this up-gap.MSFT is a trade. If you are really a technician, wait for the breakout and ride the new highs. I think MSFT IS going to break out. I think it attracts sponsorship from traders who have been riding AAPL and all of those money managers who are sitting on the sidelines. I am long MSFT options.NOW is still a trade. If you got in yesterday, no one would blame you if you took profits today. I might wait a little for NOW. Perhaps there is a sale on Friday. Look at it then, but NOW is going higher.Trade cloud technology names. There are a bunch of great cloud platform tools that I have mentioned. Look into them and pick a few that had good earnings reports that surprised to the upside previously. Chances are they will again. Start small. I still feel there is a good chance that some names will sell off on earnings.Long-term investors or speculators with patience should really take a look at GS. Make up your own mind, but I think it will be a disruptor like Square (SQ) and still has all the heft of a mega-bank.I still like DocuSign (DOCU) as a trade, and Boeing (BA). I keep trying to buy them cheaper and am not getting filled. Buying right is a challenge, especially options. Keep emotions out of buying. If you don't get filled, try not to chase.Just a reminder I will be starting a subscription service through Seeking Alpha for options education and community. It is called ""Put-Call Community"". In the community, I will be sharing how I would set up options trades on the above trading ideas and how to surface new opportunities. It is a community, so you will have a chance to participate, contribute and learn. I want to learn, too!"
4297807,69905,2019-10-22T09:43:45-04:00,"Going into Q3 earnings, what actually matters?The valuation is piping hot - any mishap and the stock will get a haircut.Why investors should avoid ServiceNow.","ServiceNow (NOW) is a stock that reflects too much optimism, and none of the pertinent questions are being reflected, such as what happens when a stock which is priced to perfection hits a speed bump in execution.What follows are my reasons for sidestepping this investment.Back in the summer, I wrote an article titled ""ServiceNow: Has No Edge Right Now."" Since then, the stock's performance has been as follows:Source: Author's coverageMore recently, I noted the company's ""ultra-steady growth rates"" and highlighted the following:Now, I'm a big believer that the market is often right. The problem, though, is that it sometimes it's slightly too right and prone to overreaction. What does this mean?This means that ServiceNow's very steady and highly predictable recurring revenues are the reason why investors are more than happy to pay $43 billion for the stock.I urge investors not to focus on management's version of free cash flow, but on what is actually ""clean"" free cash flow. Specifically, please note:Source: Company Q2 2019 Press StatementSeen above is management's version of ServiceNow's free cash flow. In the chart below is what I contend is a closer approximation of its actual free cash flows:(Source)Q2 2019's actual cash flows from operations are closer to $232 million. Then, one should account for:Accordingly, ServiceNow's free cash flow is in actuality much closer to $146 million. Rather than $194 million that management highlights, the company's free cash flow is 25% lower.Sentiment is an incredible driver of near-term returns. When ServiceNow was swinging along, the multiple which investors were happy to pay to become a shareholder was rapidly expanding.The problem, though, is that when the share price stops its near-daily appreciation and shareholders start looking under the hood, they start to question what they are actually paying for the stock.Source: Author's calculationsThe table above is a reminder that the whole sector is trading at a premium.This is understandable given what I declared earlier: that the market was mostly right, that this space has been expanding at a rapid clip, and that investors, in general, erred on the correct side of the equation.But paying up more than 14x trailing sales for a company growing at approximately 35% is a problematic investment, particularly when it is barely breaking even on a GAAP basis.Next, I prefer to focus on P/Sales ratio, as this metric is less prone to underlying vicissitudes of the business' performance - it's a cleaner metric and more easily comparable to its own historic pricing.We can see that ServiceNow's P/Sales ratio is slightly ahead of its historical average going into Q3 2019 earnings. In other words, investors' expectations are so high right now that it will take an incredibly strong positive surprise for the stock to rise.The more likely scenario is that ServiceNow performs ''in line'' with consensus and shareholders decide to take profits on the stock.The problem as it stands right now is those bullish shareholders who contend that even if ServiceNow is overvalued, so too are the rest of its peers - that amounts to faulty thinking. In the event that the stock sells off during Q3 2019 results, that insight will not keep investors feeling warm if they end up with a permanent loss of capital."
4333719,41961,2020-03-23T14:43:01-04:00,"Service Now provides a critical role for IT productivity, and increasing customer service and HR productivity also.
        The business has provided strong returns to investors over the last 5 years.
        Having lost 30% of its value in the last 2 months, Service Now provides a worthwhile entry point for investors.","There’s never been any question in my mind that ServiceNow (NOW) is an excellent business. Providing productivity tools to help make IT‘s job simpler and more automated has made ServiceNow a huge winner for investors. Assisting IT with such mundane tasks as asset management, IT ticketing and workflow automation has provided investors in the business returns of almost 26% annualized over the last five years. The company has grown revenues at a rate of 35% annually over the last three years while deriving a return on equity of just under 40% and a return on invested capital of almost 24%. Fears of an economic recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic have had a dramatic effect on ServiceNow’s stock price, resulting in a share price decline of almost 30% within the last two months.While businesses of all shapes and sizes will be re-prioritizing enterprise spending in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and potentially decreasing discretionary expenditures, I don’t believe that the spending which IT departments make on ServiceNow will be reduced in any meaningful way. ServiceNow has a retention rate amongst its enterprise IT clients of almost 99%. There is every reason to think that the demands on enterprise IT during this period of self quarantine and shut down are likely to be just as high and potentially more challenging to manage. IT departments will have to manage a variety of issues associated with remote access and distributed application management, all of which are still likely to lead to trouble tickets and support requests.ServiceNow likely will play a far more important role to its IT stakeholders in helping them to productively sort through and manage what is likely to be elevated workflows over the next few months and allow enterprise IT departments to continue to be as productive as they were. Thus rather than retention of enterprise IT customers being reduced, ServiceNow likely enhances its stickiness, helping IT teams that are even more distributed to maintain higher levels of productivity in serving internal stakeholders.Part of ServiceNow’s success in recent years has come from steadily expanding its reach within an enterprise beyond IT departments into other areas such as human resources and customer service. ServiceNow has recently had considerable success with its customer service management module as well as a human resources management module in improving task management and productivity in each of these areas. The customer service management module assists employees manage customer service tasks including call handling and resolution, while the human resources management module provides assistance to HR departments to manage employee on boarding and recruitment.Such has being the success of both of these new modules to Service Now that they account for almost 40% of new contract value today. In the near term, retention of these modules is likely to continue to remain high as the essential functions that ServiceNow provides to both of these departments will need to continue to be performed to simply ensure business continuity of existing operations. In fact, it’s highly likely that human resources department’s will need to continue to manage through employee on boarding while customer service operations will also continue to have a similar volume of customer call handling, with both groups needing to maintain essential operations and productivity in the presence of a more distributed workforce.While I don’t expect Service Now to experience any adverse effects in its retention rate in either its core IT practice or in newer areas of HR management or Customer Service management, where it may see some impact is in sales cycles to close new business. With decision makers likely focused on disaster recovery and contingency planning, decision making for new licenses and productivity spend may slow temporarily. Key decision-makers action to green light new spending will lengthen given decision maker distraction and lack of focus.However, I expect this behavior to largely be short short term and resolve rather quickly as the coronavirus pandemic runs it’s course.The bigger question will however be if there is a broader economic decline as a result of decreased activity brought about by the virus, sending the global economy into recession. In such an environment, while NOW’s growth may slow as companies reduce incremental spend, it’s important to realize that ServiceNow plays an important part in productivity management and potentially allowing internal groups to consolidate spend and make do with fewer functional staff in areas such as IT, HR or customer service. To that end, as a cost containment mechanism for the enterprise, Service Now expenditure may be evaluated more favorably in a time of more depressed economic conditions.While in the near term ServiceNow’s rate of growth could be affected as far as onboarding new business due to lengthening sales cycles and conservatism among IT departments to commit new spend, this doesn’t change the strong long-term growth profile of ServiceNow and the massive markets that the business is chasing.ServiceNow’s total addressable market across IT workflows, employee workflows and customer workflows is estimated to grow at a forecast growth rate of 8% to a TAM (total addressable market) of $165B in 3 to 5 years. While a slower economic environment may reduce the rate of growth of NOW’s markets short term, I don’t believe it will change the overall size or trajectory or underlying trends that ServiceNow will ride. Bringing increased levels of productivity and task automation to the critical functions of IT, customer support and human resources, in addition to new markets in the enterprise, is a need that won’t dissipate with time.The only thing that’s really changed about the ServiceNow business in the last few months is that it is now available at a far cheaper price. Irrational fears about retention of existing customers and fears of a growth slowdown have served to slash the company’s share price by almost 30% since February highs. At current levels, Service Now trades at the bottom end of its historical price to cash flow and price to forward earnings ratio‘s when measured over the last five years.While the stock is not at the bargain basement levels of October 2019, when John Donahoe departed the business and when cloud stocks generally were sold off, investors looking to position in an attractive growth business with a very steady core customer base couldn’t do much better than to look at ServiceNow."
4295809,24634,2019-10-09T18:42:00-04:00,ServiceNow is a company that continues to be a leader in the cloud computing space.The recently announced partnership with Microsoft Azure increases visibility for “sustainable” Revenue and EPS growth.ServiceNow continues to build a “suite” of products with strong renewal rates.I currently own NOW in both the Gunderson Premier Growth and the Gunderson Ultra Growth Portfolios.,"ServiceNow's (NYSE:NOW) geographically-diversified cloud-based SaaS (software-as-a-service) business model makes it a compelling “sustainable” growth play in the technology sector.ServiceNow became a public company in 2012, debuting with a $210 million IPO. Shortly after going public, the company relocated from San Diego to Silicon Valley. The ServiceNow platform offers enterprise customers an integrated cloud-based solution that simplifies enterprise workflows by automating, predicting, digitizing and optimizing business processes and tasks such as IT, customer service, security operation, and human resources. The company’s mantra is “We make the world of work work better for people.”I wrote about ServiceNow, Inc. a little over a year ago - An Explosive Large-Cap Growth Story - and thought it was a good time to revisit the company and underlying stock. Since my previous article back in September of 2018, the shares are up almost 30% (up over 50% at the 52-week high of $303.17). In September of 2018, NOW was 117 out of 5059 on my Best Stocks Now! rankings list. Any company consistently ranking in my top 250 garners attention. Fast forward 13 months and ServiceNow still sits in the top 100 of my rankings (97 out of 5,333). Whenever I see a name year after year in my top 250, my first thought is… why?As my previous readers know, m rankings blend Fundamental and technical analysis. I assign a weighting to factors across both disciplines and those stocks scoring the highest make up the upper echelon of my rankings. Historically as an industry, financial analysts have looked a fundamental and technical characteristics of stocks in a vacuum. In my 22 years-plus of experience, I have found that incorporating both into my models allows me to better avoid “value traps” and “high fliers” with great charts, but no visible earnings to back them up.ServiceNow is a bit of a “unicorn” in my rankings. NOW currently has an “A-“ Valuation Grade, doing so with no true GAAP EPS earnings and an astronomical P/E approaching 21,000. What gives? The answer lies in the NOW business model and strong top line revenue growth that can visibly flow through to the bottom line (in the form of EPS) in the foreseeable future.NOW has continually grown top line revenue at 36% over the last three years (expecting to break through the $4B mark in 2020) and this trend has a high probability of continuing. ServiceNow’s SaaS business model generates 84% of their revenues from “subscription” customers, 766 of which were doing more than $1MM annually with NOW during the last quarter. These subscriptions have shown an unheard-of 98% renewal rate and generally are inked via three-year contracts. The structure of these commitments and strong renewal rates accompanying them allow our analysis to give a high “confidence” factor for the continuance of NOW’s historically high revenue growth.Revenue growth from “subscriptions” also are continuing to accelerate. In Q2 of 2019, ServiceNow announced a 34% growth in subscription revenue. The ability for NOW to add additional subscription revenue increases our visibility for future revenue/Non-GAAP EPS estimates ($4.44B/$4.30 respectively in 2020).ServiceNow is proving to be very successful at “cross selling” their product suite across new and existing customers. During the last earnings call, NOW stated that “17 of our top 20 deals involved three or more products and we landed several large deals in the financial services, technology and automotive industries that involved multiple IT products.”In addition to “organic” growth generated through cross selling their product suite, ServiceNow has forged a potentially lucrative strategic partnership with Microsoft Azure (NASDAQ:MSFT) in an effort to increase penetration in the government and highly regulated industry sectors. The partnership with Azure allows NOW to benefit from Microsoft’s data centers approved for highly regulated and secure enterprises. According to ServiceNow’s management team, the partnership will allow them to “more fully leverage and integrate our platform and products with Microsoft's leading enterprise technology and capabilities.”Additional verticals being created by the partnership already are proving to be beneficial, with the announcement of NOW working with Microsoft in Australia. Currently, ServiceNow is generating 30% of their revenue overseas. NOW’s ability to partner with Microsoft in other deals abroad will help bring additional revenue while diversifying the geographic footprint of their revenue streams.As mentioned earlier in the article, “Momentum” also plays heavily into my rankings. Since 2013, ServiceNow has outperformed the S&P 500 in six of seven years. Annually averaging 41% more than the S&P 500 over the last three years (52.3% to 11.1%) and 27% over the last five years (35.7% to 8.5%). A big feat for a company only seven years from an IPO (especially given the IPO backdrop we find ourselves with today). NOW continues to be an alpha generator in my portfolios.Similar to most “high valued” stocks, the chart has been bumpy over the last year, with a majority of the volatility coming in the tough fourth quarter of 2018. NOW embarked on a strong breakout in late January, with the 50-day moving average crossing above the 200-day moving average in February 2019. The chart began to break down at the beginning of July, but has found some support around the $247 level, a sharp rise from the $155 support level seen in Q4 2018. Resistance for the shares remains around the 52-week high of $303 and we sit roughly 11% away from that number. We likely will not test resistance until after the earnings call on Oct. 23.Over the last year, ServiceNow continues to maintain its place in my rankings. Ranking higher than 98% of the securities I follow. I remain “Very Bullish” on NOW (I hold it in both my Premier Growth and Ultra Growth portfolios at Gunderson Capital Management) and currently have a five-year target price of $533 (98%-plus over the recent closing price) for the shares.I'm eagerly awaiting any additional guidance management gives on he upcoming earnings call on Oct. 23. As with all “highly valued” stocks, any hiccup in earnings and/or guidance can create immediate selling pressure.Historically, NOW’s management team has been very transparent in terms of the business, providing little deviation on the downside from actual results. As ServiceNow continues to build strategic partnerships with key customers, guidance should become increasingly visible, reducing the risk of “surprise” misses and subsequent corrections to the stock price.Note: All images, unless otherwise noted, show data from the Best Stocks Now database."

It was a buy yesterday and remains a buy today.After really giving McDermott a hearing, I am supportive of him. I saw real excitement, confidence and strategy in his interview this morning. He can grow NOW.Don't read the terrible news at TXN as fact, use CAT as the key to the cycle bottoming. Other chips are doing great. Also, SNAP is snapping and it is a buy, but not a trade.","Nike (NKE) Chairman and CEO Mark Parker will be replaced by ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) CEO John Donahoe, who is currently on the athletic footwear and apparel maker’s board of directors. Let's leave aside any moral judgment of a CEO leaving a perfectly good growth darling for Nike. Who could refuse the prestige and ease such a company can provide.It was widely known that NOW demands a 24/7 level of devotion because of the torrid growth pace. The founder was known to have a bed in his office because of the time demand in growing the business. Perhaps the pace was wearing him down, and frankly, Nike is a global brand. The siren-song would be too much for anyone to turn down. However, the market took it differently. The market viewed it as abandoning a sinking ship, at least at first. Let's put that past us and look at what is before us.ServiceNow will replace Donahoe with former SAP CEO Bill McDermott. Let's be frank, SAP (NYSE:SAP) started out as a staid German-based software application company for the mainframe. Under McDermott, SAP's market cap rose from $39B to $160B. SAP grew $20 billion of cloud-based business in that time as well. No slouch NOW rose 160% under Donahoe.In conjunction with the bombshell announcement, NOW provided preliminary third-quarter results and full-year guidance. The company reported $885.8 million in revenue for the quarter. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had been looking for $885.0 million. ServiceNow said it expects $3.240 billion to $3.245 billion in subscription revenue for all of 2019. The midpoint of that range is below the $3.253 billion FactSet consensus estimate.Please note that the following text is a paraphrase from an interview on CNBC. I tried my best to capture the conversation. I am putting the below in quotes, but it's not a pure quote. Some text may have been rearranged for readability -""NOW is a ""cloud-first"" company, no major acquisitions necessary here, we have the highest customer retention rates in the IT industry. We want to organically grow our functionality. Born in the cloud with great extensibility, we want to keep our fully integrated platform. Only small tuck-ins, if any acquisitions at all.CNBC: How do NOW's prospects relate to the difficulty Workday (WDAY) talked about during its investor day?WDAY is a different type of service, it is a vertical (HR) WDAY might see some headwinds. We (NOW) are a horizontal application and don't see any turbulence ahead. NOW financially is doing well, steady as you go the pipelines are supportive of the current growth path. NOW is a horizontal enterprise application for productivity.NOW is at the center of digital transformation, we can expand by industry and geographically, and this platform is a collaborative platform for other applications. It can address IT, Customer, Human Capital management. I will kick this growth into high-gear"".My Take: I will be honest, I was always put off by McDermott's tinted glasses, and not being able to see his eyes. I felt like the '80s should call and ask for its fashion faux pas back. To me, it took some humanity away, like the cyborg/human ""Mentat"" from the Dune novels and I just instinctively felt distrust.All that prejudice dissolved this morning by the real excitement and emotion exhibited by McDermott, and I felt a tinge of shame judging the man just because he probably has some sensitivity to light. This is a man who knows what he wants to accomplish with NOW, and totally confident AND very excited that he can take it to the next level.NOW is a buy. As of this writing, it has already recovered much of the losses from last night when I believe NOW was below $200. It opened at $213 and is now trading at $221. I expect NOW to recover completely, so if you want a trade, this is it.Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) really let us down. This is a name that has been a reliable grower month-in, month-out. Its strength relied on the electronification of industry & machinery. This has been a secular trend that everyone thought would continue without a falloff. However, it seems that it is vulnerable to the industrial cycle now. Until recently, the need to integrate computing to machinery was so great that it overshadowed the boom-bust of cyclical businesses. TXN is involved in all aspects of IoT, from autos to every piece of heavy equipment. It will be interesting to see if there is a read-through with NXP (NXPI) which also is heavily involved with industrial and IoT.Caterpillar (CAT) related to it is because TXN is now tied to industrial as CAT is. Look how the market is treating CAT, as opposed to TXN. CAT gave a terrible earnings report and the stock is essentially flat. What I am seeing here is that the market perceives that we are at the bottom of the industrial cycle. So in spite of the terrible results, the market yawns. With TXN, the market was taken by surprise; however, I see these two results connected to the industrial cycle. CAT is telling us that we are bottoming in this cycle, and as we saw with other industrial companies that have turned in better results, TXN is likely seeing the bottom as well. I think TXN is a good long-term investment. I don't see TXN as a trade.Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) are holding up very well by the market. I think this is very exciting. I think overall Chips are a good ground for trading and speculating. Teradyne (TER) is a chip-testing company that reported this morning. Look at the great results for memory chips... Memory Test shipments grew 23% sequentially on Flash demand, Semiconductor Test demand for 5G infrastructure remained strong. Tellingly, Industrial Automation revenue is up only 4% from Q3'18. MU and AMD are a buy. Also, Skyworks (SWKS), Qorvo (QRVO), and Broadcom (AVGO) should be growing for the 5G area.In the pre-market, Boeing (NYSE:BA) fell into the $320s but once again found support above $325. BA is now trading up this morning. Why? Because BA confirmed that at least one regulator will have the Max flying this quarter (read FAA). I said BA was a pound-the-table buy yesterday, now it's a double-fisted pound-the-table buy!I called for CEO Dennis Muilenburg to resign, instead Boeing is removing Kevin McAllister.Boeing named long-time executive Stan Deal to take over the Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA) unit and turned the reins of the company’s largest business over to a seasoned leader with significant supply chain and customer support experience. The move, announced Oct. 22 and effective immediately, puts Deal in charge of a wobbly business that has two of its major programs, the MAX and 777X, in severe turbulence.I think that Muilenburg's head is still on the chopping block and a lot is riding on his testimony to Congress next week. Barring any bombshells, if BA dips going into that meeting, it might be another opportunity to buy BA. I maintain that BA heads towards $390 in the next few months if not sooner.Snap (NYSE:SNAP) was a wild ride after-hours today. They were down 9% after an earnings beat. During trading hours, the stock market is being more rational, and right now it's down about 2.5%. They reported 210 million daily active users versus the estimated 206.1 million.SNAP is a unique asset that is once again growing DAUs every quarter by the millions. And they have a special cohort, 90% of 14- to 22-year-olds are Snapchat users. This is the most difficult group to reach.As SNAP improves its ad serving and continues to grow DAUs, I think that SNAP will go back to old highs and higher. I think SNAP is an interesting speculation, and I believe that politicians that want to motivate young voters to register and vote will boost revenues as well.SNAP is a buy on any weakness for a trade and longer-term speculation. Bank of America upgraded it Friday with a 31% upside PT of $18, and that is good enough for me. JPMorgan also upgraded SNAP just this morning after the earnings report, that should be good enough for you. I see SNAP as a speculation (as I define it).One would imagine that the stock would be down hard. Confoundingly to the beginner, FB is up nicely this morning. The trading adage ""Buy on the rumor, sell on the fact"" applies. Everyone who knew about the congressional testimony already sold. A trader should buy FB and make some fast money.Blackstone (BX) – The private-equity firm reported distributable earnings per share of 58 cents, 5 cents a share above estimates. Revenue came in above analysts’ forecasts as well. Fee-related earnings were up 27% from a year ago and assets under management grew by 21%.The trades for today are BA, SNAP, NOW and FB. I would express BA and FB as call option trades. I would accumulate NOW and SNAP in equities.I am taking this moment to announce that I will be starting a subscription service through Seeking Alpha for options education and community. It is called ""Put-Call Community"". Stay tuned for more details.Happy trading!"

When the price appeared to be breaking out of a trading range, Workday disappoints analysts on its presentation, because of growth concerns on its HR core product, and SaaS stocks sold off on the aftermath.But it was not enough for NOW. A few days later, the company announced a leadership change that took its shares down, close to the $200 level in after-hours trading activity. Finally, NOW reported its quarterly results, and the market was contented with what it saw.So, let’s take a look for ourselves!Source: Q3 2019 Fact SheetAuthor’s note: All figures here are non-GAAP, except otherwise stated. Check this out for GAAP reconciliation.Revenue for the quarter was $899 million, representing a strong growth Y/Y of 34% (only 100 bps less than in the prior quarter), and 5.5% Q/Q. The sequential growth is worrying on an annual basis (24%), and at this pace, it wouldn’t take long for growth to decelerate below the 30% levels. Also, this is the second quarter in a row with sequential growth of ~5%. NOW needs to sequentially grow revenues at a pace more like that of Q1’19 (12% per quarter), for some quarters if it wants to keep investors’ favor.Getting into details, revenue by geography was the same Y/Y, but the EMEA region, which was gaining traction on prior quarters, suffered a negative growth of 2.6% on a sequential basis. The chart below doesn’t include this information, but it is helpful on computing it:Source: Q3 2019 Investor PresentationRevenue by product class continues to diversify away from IT products, with emerging products and add-ons now representing 45% of net new annual contract value (NYSE:ACV) from only 39% a year ago:(Q3 2019 Investor Presentation)Subscription revenue was $848 million (35% growth), total billings were $921 million (28% growth), and subscription billings were $869 million (29% growth):Source: Q3 2019 Investor PresentationDeferred revenue was $1.8 billion, growing at an annualized rate of 29.4%, in line with billings growth. Backlog (RPO) was $5.6 billion, growing at an impressive 36% rate Y/Y, with current RPO being $2.8 billion, growing at the same rate. It is important to keep this figure in mind, the gap between billings growth and RPO growth is ~7%, indicating that the former could strengthen in the next quarters, driving a higher revenue growth.Source: Q3 2019 Investor PresentationGross margin was 81%, 100 bps up Y/Y as subscription revenue gains share of total revenue. Subscription gross margin was 86%, flat Y/Y.Source: Q3 2019 Investor PresentationNOW realized significant operating leverage during the quarter, as S&M and G&A expenses were down 550 bps, offsetting an increase of 150 bps in R&D expenses. This change pushed the net profit margin 250 bps higher to 21.7%.On a dollar basis, net income was $193 million, up 49.6% Y/Y, while EPS was $0.99, with a growth of 45.6% Y/Y.Source: Q3 2019 Investor PresentationOperating cash flow was $234 million, representing a 26% margin and a 45% growth Y/Y. Free cash flow was $126 million (14% margin and 10% growth Y/Y).Source: Q3 2019 Investor PresentationNOW continues to expand the amount of customer with more than $1 million of ACV, with 809. The number is growing at 32% Y/Y, but the rate of growth has been decelerating as of late (check out the second chart below). Still, it is a significant amount of growth for a company with such a size, and especially considering that NOW is the platform of preference for the top 10 firms in most industries:Source: 2019 Analyst DaySource: Q3 2019 Investor PresentationAlso, 18 out of the top 20 deals of the quarter, included three or more products, the same amount Y/Y and one more Q/Q. The ability of NOW to cross-sell its products has been astonishing in the past, and the run continues. Notice the success of the HR product. It is gaining strength, and having a strong momentum.Source: Q3 2019 Investor PresentationCustomer retention is once again excellent, even for a SaaS company. The renewal rate (or gross retention rate) jumped back to 99% during the quarter. Once again NOW proves the stickiness of its platform.Source: Q3 2019 Investor PresentationCEO ExchangeOn the day before the earnings release, NOW announced the departure of its CEO John Donahoe, and the arrival of Bill McDermott, former CEO of SAP (SAP), to take the seat.SA contributor David H. Lerner has some favorable commentary on McDermott and the outlook of NOW under his leadership.The media is praising the return achieved by McDermott as CEO of SAP. SAP was worth $39 billion in February 2010, when he took the helm, and now is worth more than $160 billion, but what about the S&P 500 (SPY), or the DAX 30. During McDermott’s tenure, SAP generated a 15.6% compounded annual return on its stock price, and a dividend yield of ~1%, so the total return was around 16.6%. During the same time, the S&P 500 and the DAX 30 returned 12.7% and 12%, respectively, in capital gains and dividends.My conclusions?From a shareholder’s point of view, McDermott outperformed both indices by at least 400 bps on an annual basis. Then, the question is, will he repeat his winning formula with NOW? There is an important factor to consider: his record started with the beginning of a new economic cycle (after the 2007-2009 recession), and he will take the lead in a time when most experts are forecasting a recession for 2020 (his first year). That is a tough headwind!Off course, McDermott has a lot to bring to NOW. He worked 17 years at Xerox (XRX), was President of Gartner (IT), was a sales executive at Siebel Systems (it was acquired by Oracle (ORCL) in 2005). In 2002, he was hired by SAP to be the CEO of SAP America, and then in 2010, was promoted to co-CEO of the whole company.In 2016, McDermott was the best paid executive the DAX index, with more than 11 million EUR as direct compensation (Source: Wikipedia). In conclusion, McDermott brings more than 35 years of IT experience to NOW.Valuation UpdateDepending on the valuation methodology used, NOW may be expensive, fair, or even cheap, when compared to similar SaaS peers.Source: Y-ChartsUsing a forward revenue multiple (more traditional for growth stocks), it appears overvalued. From the peer group that I have chosen, Shopify (SHOP) is the only one that surpass it, but it is an outlier. Maybe, if NOW were growing faster than the other three, its valuation would have been justified, but no, it is not the case:Source: Y-ChartsOf course, this chart doesn’t take into account adjustments to revenue, such as foreign currency matters, which make for a couple of growth points in some of these companies. So, still it is slightly overvalued given its forward revenues.Source: Y-ChartsGoing on with the valuation, a forward earnings multiple, gives a fair/cheap valuation. See that NOW only exceeds Splunk (SPLK) with this method, but not by much, and it is also close to Square (SQ) and Workday (WDAY). Again SHOP is the outlier. This valuation makes more sense, considering revenue growth, so it seems fairly valued, according to its 12-month forward earnings.Source: Y-ChartsFinally, on a Price/Cash Flow from Operations basis, NOW looks clearly undervalued. Its closest peer is WDAY, and is 30% more expensive than NOW.My conclusion from these three methods is that NOW is undervalued against its closest peers on the SaaS space. I could say that it is overvalued, given its revenue multiple and the relevance that revenue growth has on these stocks. But the eyes of the market are turning to profitability instead of revenue growth. Investors are flying away from high-growth loss-making stocks, and I think that this is the focus of most participants at this time.Quarterly TakeawayThe market saw these results with good eyes, and so do I. A soft growth in billings is less relevant with RPO growing (and accelerating) at such a pace. If NOW is to decelerate going forward, RPO will be the leading indicator. So I’m not particularly worried about NOW’s growth prospects. With McDermott as CEO since January 2020, the company seems well guided on its way to maturity. At this valuation, the stock appears to be a good buy opportunity."
4294850,100666,2019-10-03T13:23:39-04:00,"ServiceNow is a big SaaS stock (a market cap of $48B) and just as other SaaS stocks, it has lost quite a bit over the last few months: -18.4%.ServiceNow's business might seem boring, but it is essential to companies and that can be seen in its extremely high client retention of 98%.ServiceNow is a very innovative company, Forbes' #1 of 2018, and it is a master at cross-selling its products.My 10-year forward P/E and virtual PEG, which I have used before to value Shopify successfully, show that ServiceNow is more or less fairly valued for its growth.","ServiceNow (NOW) is a SaaS stock and with most SaaS stocks, the company has fallen from its 52-week high over the last months:YChartsAs you can see, the company is down 18.4% over the last few months, a bit less than high-flying SaaS birds like Okta (OKTA), The Trade Desk (TTD) and Zscaler (ZS), which are all down more than 30% from their 52-week highs.The reason why ServiceNow is down less is probably because of its size: it has a market cap of $48B. In this article, I will try to show you why I think ServiceNow may be one of the very best SaaS stocks to own.(Source)What ServiceNow does can be summarized in one sentence: it digitizes work in all sorts of ways on its Now platform. ServiceNow provides cloud service management apps, digital workflow for customer service, HR, security, risk management and many other departments of bigger enterprises. It takes care of workflow automation, electronic service catalogs and portals, configurations of management systems, data benchmarking, encryption and much more. It is also very useful for developers and other ITers.While this all seems maybe a bit boring and a lot of mumbo jumbo talk, these things are essential for companies. This fact and the fact that ServiceNow does a terrific job can be deducted from the company's incredible renewal rates:(Source: Q2 2019 earning call slides)The reason is simple: ServiceNow saves time by automating paperwork in a simpler digital workflow. Think of a lot of processes: internal audits, project approvals, inventory tracking, contractor management, visitor approvals, vacation requests, recruiting requests, sales proposal approvals, call center scorecards, customer feedback and many more are all integrated into the NOW platform.Such high predictability of renewals at 98% is a great position to be in. Financial projections are easier when you can keep almost all of your existing customers. And because the costs of the operation go up as much as the income, the extra clients bring in money that boosts the bottom line directly.This is a SaaS dream and there is no company that I know of that has such high renewal rates as ServiceNow. If you know one, please, let us know in the comments. I will give an example, just for some context. Adobe's Creative Cloud, which includes often indispensable programs like Photoshop and Acrobat, has a renewal rate of about 80%.Here you can see an interface of the NOW platform:(Source)I think one of the reasons of ServiceNow's success is the integration of functionalities on its platform. There are tons of fragmented software solutions on the market. They are so specific for one solution that you have to buy 10+ bundles before you cover all your needs. With ServiceNow, you get a lot in one solution. The NOW platform can also perfectly integrate with a lot of the best and most used platforms of this time, such as Slack (WORK), Microsoft Office and Azure (MSFT), SAP (SAP), AWS (AMZN), Salesforce (CRM), Oracle (ORCL), Workday (WDAY), DocuSign (DOCU), Atlassian (TEAM), Adobe (ADBE) and more:(Source)ServiceNow's success is also visible in the number of leaders that use ServiceNow in several industries:(Source)The ServiceNow platform has 3 million DAUs (daily active users) and they use the platform very intensively:(Source)20 billion transactions, that means about 222 transactions per user per day, which indicates that users really work a lot on the platform.ServiceNow was also named the number 1 most innovative company by Forbes in its top 100 innovators in 2018:(Source)And ServiceNow keeps innovating. NowX, the innovation team of ServiceNow, keeps expanding and in Q2 2019 75 full-time employees are at work to develop new products:(Source)The first NowX product will be launched broadly in this quarter, Q3 2019:(Source)I'm looking forward to the results of the new product when the Q3 2019 results are announced, on October 22. The impact on the general revenue will be limited, but a lot of these innovations together can really move the needle, especially if the company is able to sign big clients for new products. And they have already quite a few:(Source: 2019 Q2 Presentation)ServiceNow has now 766 big clients, customers doing for more than $1M in business with ServiceNow annually. This number has grown 33% YoY and 6.4% QoQ. These clients are not only important because of the fact that they bring in so much money. They also are more stable clients because they have higher switching costs if they would consider to go to another platform.ServiceNow is also doing a great job at cross-selling. 17 out of the 20 top deals in Q2 2019 had at least 3 products. 14 even had 5 or more. This shows the broadness of ServiceNow's products.Another important metric to look at is the total addressable market or TAM. Your growth can be huge, but if you already have a huge chunk of your TAM and that TAM is shrinking, you are not in a good position over the long term. You want to see a high TAM that is expanding. And ServiceNow is in the sweet spot here. It projects its TAM at $165B in 2023: (SourJust for context, ServiceNow's revenue last year was $3B, so there is a long way to go in this growing market.Maybe you have heard about the new accounting principles called Accounting Standards Codification number 606, or ASC 606. This is the new GAAP accounting standard for revenue from contracts. The basic reasoning is that in contracts, as in the subscription model ServiceNow works with, certain performance obligations can be pinpointed. Therefore the price of the subscription should be divided over the year. That introduced a new acronym: RPO, or remaining performance obligations, also called backlog.While the revenue and subscriptions of ServiceNow grew by 34.8% YoY, the RPO has grown by 37%. The RPO that will be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months is about $2.7 billion. So even without new deals, ServiceNow already has $2.7B of revenue. How many companies can say that? This is what Michael Scarpelli, ServiceNow's CFO had to say on the Q2 2019 conference call about the subject:So a lot of longer deals have already been signed throughout the year, but will only occur on paper at the end of the year, making Q4 a very strong quarter.ServiceNow has no big GAAP earnings. It has a P/E of 1675, according to finviz.com. For those who think valuation matters a lot, this may be as attractive as a visit from the taxman, but you should look further. The forward P/E is 58. Not cheap, but not in the same ballpark as 1675.But there are better ways to evaluate SaaS companies that grow very fast and have high gross margins. In my article Shopify: A Valuation Guide I introduced two new concepts: the virtual PEG and the 10-year forward PE. Both showed that Shopify was not overvalued at the time of the article, in November 2018, at $141. But when I used these methods again to value Shopify at $329 in September 2019, I concluded that the stock was expensive.Both the 10-year forward P/E and the virtual PEG pretend the company is a mature company. ServiceNow projects FY 2019 revenue between $3.245B and $3.255B. Mostly ServiceNow beats expectations and often raises the guidance, but let's take the middle point here: $3.25B. There are 194M shares outstanding. That is a revenue of $16.78 per share. The gross profit margin of ServiceNow is guided to be 86% or $2.795B.Once the company becomes mature, net profit margins will rise. Because of the nature of its business, I think it is safe to say that ServiceNow can get to a net profit margin of 28%, just like some comparable big SaaS companies like Adobe and Microsoft. They have net profit margins from the high 20s to the low 30s. If you project the revenue growth of the next decade, which will inevitably decrease as the numbers grow, this could give us a guesstimate for the next decade:(compiled by the author)Suppose ServiceNow has a profit margin of 28% by 2028, this would add up to earnings of $6.19B. We don't know how many shares will be outstanding by then. But let's take a total growth of 33% (although I hope it's less). That would give 258M shares. Earnings of $6.19B divided by 258M shares means EPS of $23.99. At ServiceNow's price (at the moment of writing) of $245.55, that is a 10-year forward PE of just 10.23.Just as a reference: here is the 10-year forward PE of a few established companies:(Compiled by the author)So, as you can see, ServiceNow is actually cheap compared to some random other stocks. There are a lot of moving parts here, but I think the 10-year forward P/E gives you a way to value a high-growth name and compare it with slower growers for the long term, the only holding period that I think gives the individual investor an edge. These projections show that investors are not crazy to pay up for ServiceNow.But let's do it differently, with less assumptions: let's take the final net profit margin of 28% and apply it to the revenue projection of 2019: $3.25B. That would add up to $910M in profits. With the current 194M shares, that would be EPS of $4.69. With a stock price of $245.55, this would mean a P/E ratio of 52.36. With an expected EPS growth of 33%, this comes down to a 'virtual PEG' of 1.58. Not dirt cheap, but certainly not very expensive as well.With a market cap of $48B, ServiceNow is already a big company, but it is still growing at about 35% annually. Its churn rate is impressively low at just 2% and that means the company has high predictability, which is the dream of every SaaS company. ServiceNow is also a great innovator and new products keep coming out. With 766 companies doing more than $1M of deals annually with the company, big business is certainly sold on the NOW platform.Our 10-year forward P/E suggests that ServiceNow is relatively cheap and the virtual PEG suggests it's not really overvalued. Therefore I think it's a great move to build out a starter's position at this level and gradually build out a full position over time. I'm pretty sure you will be rewarded.If you have enjoyed this article and would like to read more articles from a long-term perspective, please hit the follow button next to my name.In the meantime: keep growing!P.S.

4294294,69905,2019-09-30T19:03:29-04:00,ServiceNow is an amazing SaaS platform - but everyone knows that already.ServiceNow stock was a rewarding investment. But what about going forward?Common sense alone dictates the stock is already pricing in many future years' profits.,"Two months ago before Q2 2020 results come out, I wrote,Subsequently, we have seen ServiceNow's (NYSE:NOW) share price get a 15% discount. Why? Because investors are starting to become a little more rational. When investing, at some point, valuation matters. When? That's difficult to say.But we know enough to know that ServiceNow is best avoided, for now.Looking back over any time period, be it twelve months, two years, or longer and ServiceNow has been among the best investment, fully beating all benchmarks - awesome! But that is done and is now in the past.What matters to today's shareholder is how will the future shape up?Digging into ServiceNow's Q2 2019 results and it is easy to understand why ServiceNow is as highly praised as it is.For example, the strongest evidence that ServiceNow offers a very strong value proposition can be seen in the fact that ServiceNow's platform is being adopted by most of the large fortune 500 companies.Moreover, particularly impressive is its low churn rates. For instance, whereas most software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platforms boast of having approximately 10% churn rates, ServiceNow has close to no churn rates, as it regularly sees its churn rate stay as low as 1% - offering ServiceNow's shareholders ample reason to be proud about their company.Also, it is important to bear in mind that as large and small businesses continue their digital migration to cloud-based platforms, ServiceNow is going to continue to be a beneficiary in this fundamental shift, meaning that it has long tailwinds to its back.Source: author's calculations, including guidanceAnother reason why investors have been more than happy to pay whatever multiple to become ServiceNow shareholders arguably boils down to its ultra-steady growth rates, highlighted above.Accordingly, the combination of low churn rates, together with approximately 94% subscription revenue, which makes up recurring revenue sources, lends itself to a stock which is unlikely to offer shareholders surprises.To be fair, there are not many companies being priced at close $50 billion market cap and still growing their revenues at close to 35%.ServiceNow's balance sheet has close to $1 billion of net cash. Why so much cash? Surely, the fact that it nearly all its customers are on annual contracts implies that ServiceNow has minimally need to carry on its balance sheet such a large net cash position?Well, in actuality, it needs this surplus cash to weather any potential storms. How so? Because ultimately, on a GAAP basis, ServiceNow struggles to breakeven. What's more, personally, wouldn't put too much weight on the fact that ServiceNow's is guiding investors for its free cash flow margin to hit 28% of revenues in 2019, because this figure doesn't factor its consistent capitalization of intangibles.But arguably, the biggest contributor which is not accounted for in ServiceNow's version of free cash flow is the taxes paid for settlement of equity awards -- this figure accounts for close to 40% of its cash flow from operations.The table which follows notes what is abundantly evident, that ServiceNow has no margin of safety in its valuation.Source: author's calculationsA long time ago, investors had already recognized the rapidly growing SaaS sector and fully rewarded ServiceNow's prospects.In fact, I've read that on a P/Sales ratio that ServiceNow is not very expensive, but the reason for this is because it still does not make an actual clean and consistent GAAP profit. For now, investors have no idea just how high or low its operating margins will fall.Positive sentiment has already been reflected in the share price many times over. ServiceNow might be amongst the best workflow companies, at the cutting edge of technology helping customers along their digital journey. But that side of the story has already been factored in many times over.Investors should wait for a safer valuation to prevail before entering this stock."
4292693,105400,2019-09-20T12:26:26-04:00,"ServiceNow has fallen by roughly 15% since its 52-week highs.The company has grown to become the leading platform in the IT service management space.However, ServiceNow is slightly overvalued by roughly 10% based on my estimates.","ServiceNow's (NYSE:NOW) stock price has fallen roughly 15% from its 52-week highs, mostly due to multiple adjustments. Despite the big drop in share price, I believe that NOW is a leader in its space with growing switching costs. At $261, however, the stock is still expensive and investors can wait for a better time to build a position.(Source: Google)ServiceNow has been able to execute high growth with positive free cash flows. Subscription revenues have grown roughly 5x from $567M to $2.5B in just four years. Free cash flows have also grown from $87M to $732M in the same period. With revenue of $3B, the company still has a long runway for growth as its penetration into its total addressable market of $110B is less than 3%.(Source: ServiceNow Analyst Day)(Source: ServiceNow Analyst Day)ServiceNow started off in the IT service management space. It differentiated itself by having a superior user interface and provided a flexible way to automate a wide variety of workflow processes. It then expanded into the IT operations management market by adding those features onto the platform.NOW's platform has grown to become mission-critical for companies, as seen from the high renewal rates of above 95% in recent quarters. IT service management and operations are core to companies with a long installation process with steep learning curves. Switching could lead to lost productivity and companies would not want employees distracted with new systems that take time away from their core competencies. If ServiceNow continues to deliver value, it makes little sense for companies to switch even if competitors are offering similar solutions at a reduced price. (Source: ServiceNow 2019 Q2 Presentation)Another way that ServiceNow is growing its switching costs is through partnerships that enable seamless customer experience across platforms. Companies use multiple tools to get work done, and companies that can make workflows seamless across those tools are likely to experience strong customer retention. As seen from ServiceNow's transcript:ServiceNow recently offered an application development platform in a platform as a service (PaaS). However, the capability offered by ServiceNow is new and yet to gain much traction. The intention for this offering is likely to further entrench customers into its platform. However, the strength of this PaaS offering is correlated to ServiceNow's brand. If the features do not meet needs relative to competitors, it could dilute ServiceNow's brand and negatively impact customer retention.High-growth software stocks are also very sensitive to any market volatility, as seen from the recent pullback across software stocks. If the economy experiences negative shocks, ServiceNow could experience further pullbacks even if its business improves.To value the company, I used a DCF model with the following assumptions:1) Revenue growth at 28% for the next five years, then dropping to 2% in perpetuity starting from the year 2025. The high growth rates in the first five years reflect ServiceNow's lead in the cloud IT service management space as well as its ability to cross-sell its other solutions. This is also in line with analyst estimates. Coupled with low penetration in its total addressable market, ServiceNow should be able to execute high sales growth for at least the next five years. However, it will face competition against companies like IBM (NYSE:IBM) and others that might come up with more innovative solutions. If ServiceNow is unable to convince large enterprise customers to remain on its platform, it might experience lower sales growth in the next few years.2) Operating margin of 30% from 2024 onwards. Enterprise software players generally have high operating margins due to their high initial fixed costs and low incremental costs. Operating margin of 30% is considered high, but it is similar to Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) current margins. Moreover, ServiceNow's gross margins have been expanding in recent years, from 63% in 2014 to the current 76%. However, if competitors are able to develop innovative solutions and price becomes the only differentiating factor, there could be some downward pressure on ServiceNow's margins.3) A sales-to-capital ratio of 2 is in line with its software peers. Developing software is not capital-intensive, so I estimate ServiceNow will be able to generate $2 of sales with every $1 in incremental capital.4) ServiceNow has a weighted cost of capital of roughly 8% since it has achieved high positive free cash flows for several years. As such, it should have a lower cost of capital than its money-losing software peers.(Source: Author creation using ServiceNow financials)The value I derived for ServiceNow is roughly $42.8B for the entire company. This represents a 10% downside from its current price. As with all DCFs for high growth companies, my point estimate valuation of $236 is likely to have a large spread of possible outcomes. To overcome this shortcoming, I compare its pricing multiples against similar software companies.(Source: Author creation using data from GuruFocus)Compared to established peers like Oracle and SAP, ServiceNow is expensive on both Price/Sales and EV/Sales multiples. However, those established ERP players also have much lower sales growth of less than 10%. ServiceNow is also more expensive when compared to Paylocity, which has lower sales growth but is a profitable HCM company.Potential investors have to decide if they believe ServiceNow will be able to extend its double-digit growth rates beyond 10 years. If not, its recent pullback does not make it a good time to buy."

In this article, I explain why I believe NOW has a rosy future and give my verdict on shares at these levels.NOW was ranked as the #1 most innovative company by Forbes in 2018, and it's easy to see why. NOW is a software company which gives its customers the ability to make a variety of business processes digital which traditionally have been recorded by paper and required lots of human handling. When a company lends out computers to their employees, that requires ""paperwork."" If you want to allow your customer to return an item, that requires a complicated process. NOW makes these kinds of ""workflows"" digital and easier to manage for their customers.As we can see below, these workflows include not only IT workflows but also employee workflows (like allowing employees to bring visitors to their office) and also customer (that is, customers of NOW's customers) workflows (like customer feedback):(Source: 2019 Analyst Day)These digital workflows help not only to reduce the use of paper but also to reduce the need for human interaction for these many menial and thankless tasks, which help reduce human error, reduce costs, and enable their customers to offer a better experience for their employees and their own customers.In this space, NOW is undoubtedly the best of breed operator. As we can see below, they are listed as the leader on Gartner's magic quadrant for service IT management:(Source: Gartner Magic Quadrant)NOW has emerged as a serious threat to incumbents BMC, Ivanti, and others and is showing this may really be a ""winner takes all"" market.As the most innovative company of 2018, NOW, of course, is a leader and visionary for more than just IT Service Management - in fact, they have leadership across 5 different product lines:(Source: 2019 Analyst Day)One of the reasons that NOW has been able to grow so quickly is that its applications work across a variety of different organizations, silos, and systems (you might recognize a lot of these names):(Source: 2019 Analyst Day)Their strong reputation and ease of use have made NOW the service of choice by the market. In fact, NOW is clearly the market leader as it has essentially taken the business of all the market leaders from each of the industries below:(Source: 2019 Analyst Day)Having these top tier customers is very valuable as this provides easy networking and ""word of mouth."" After all, competitors in any given industry are going to want to compete neck to neck with the market leader and thus can be argued to be more likely to work with NOW in order to level the playing field.NOW has been able to capitalize on their strong name brand recognition to continue growing the number of ""large customer"" relationships:(Source: 2019 Q2 Presentation)SAAS companies are known for their recurring revenues and high renewal rates, but NOW's retention rates are even higher than the normal 90%. NOW has been able to generate very high renewal rates near 99%:(Source: 2019 Q2 Presentation)Not only that, but NOW has been able to continuously ""cross-sell"" and market their other product offerings to existing customers.(Source: 2019 Q2 Presentation)In terms of numbers, they have been able to increase the annual contract value markedly over time - the longer one works with NOW, the more services they end up subscribing to:(Source: 2019 Q2 Presentation)Best of breed operators tend to have best of breed financials. NOW has been able to grow their subscription revenues at a very rapid pace:(Source: 2019 Analyst Day)The reason I like SAAS companies so much is because of their high gross margins - new customers don't directly add incremental costs, and thus, the extra revenue just flows to the bottom line. We have been able to see this through NOW's impressive operating leverage:(Source: 2019 Analyst Day)NOW's tremendous growth may just be getting started - they estimate their total addressable market to be very high at around $110 billion and growing:(Source: 2019 Analyst Day)As of the latest quarter, NOW had over $1.6 billion in cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. NOW also carries roughly $420 million in operating lease liabilities as they lease their corporate offices. While this represents a net cash position, I do not adjust this in my calculation of valuation because NOW is still not free cash flow positive on a GAAP basis. However, their non-GAAP free cash flow positivity and net cash on the balance sheet mean that NOW has a strong financial position fit to handle a slowing economy.NOW does have $661 million in 2022 convertible notes which can be converted to common stock at a price of $134.75 - much lower than today's levels. This equates to roughly 5.81 million dilutive shares - I have accounted for this by including the total in entirety in my calculation of price to sales below.For the 2020 fiscal year, NOW has guided for $3.25 billion in subscription revenues at the midpoint, representing growth of 34% YOY, and 194 million shares outstanding. In my calculation for valuation below, I have added 5.8 million shares due to the 2022 convertible notes.NOW doesn't have any GAAP earnings to speak of, and I don't like using non-GAAP earnings when there is a lot of share-based compensation added back, as is the case with NOW and other tech companies. This means that we can only use price to sales using close peers.In order to use price to sales, we must first determine an estimate of their future operating margins. Microsoft (MSFT), Adobe (ADBE), and Facebook (FB) have operating margins of 33%, 28%, and 38%, respectively. Given NOW's comparable gross margins, plus their long growth runway and market leader position, I anticipate them being able to have at least 30% operating margins in the future.Next, we need to make sure we are using the right revenue numbers as not all revenue is created equal. For example, while NOW reported $2.6 billion of total revenues in 2018, $187.5 million of that was non-subscription based. We need to adjust that out because that actually has negative gross margins:(Source: NOW 2018 10-K)This comes out to $2.8 billion in trailing twelve months ('TTM') subscription revenues or $14.08 per share. At current prices, NOW trades at around 19 times trailing sales. Applying 30% operating margins, NOW trades at a ""future equivalent multiple"" of 60 times earnings. With revenue growth of 35%, this is conservatively (because not assuming operating leverage) just around 1.7 times ""price to earnings growth"" using that forward earnings number, which isn't out of the ordinary, given NOW's long growth runway.NOW would be a strong buy if it traded under 15 times sales, or $213 per share. NOW is one of those stocks that, due to being in the early stages of their growth runway, finds itself with a very large valuation range in which it is ""reasonably priced."" As a result, there are many prices at which NOW would likely be a strong performer, as long as one's time horizon is long enough.While 18 times sales is more than I normally would pay for a company not yet producing meaningful free cash flows, NOW has fast enough growth and a long enough growth runway to make me confident in a buy at current prices.(Source: 2019 Proxy Statement)Topically, this looks to be on the low end as compared to peers, and I prefer companies led by ""owner-operators"" as they would have more financial alignment with shareholders. That said, this isn't a red flag, and management has not made any moves to cause any concern about shareholder misalignment yet.NOW is a best of breed digital workflows operator which has seen its valuation shoot higher along the rest of the tech rally. Even so, its high quality products make me confident that they will more than grow into their valuation. I rate shares a buy.(TipRanks: Buy NOW)"
4284866,35181,2019-08-12T12:32:58-04:00,"ServiceNow is a leader in ITSM and also offers several workflow management products.Now Platform is extremely sticky with a customer renewal rate of 98%.The company fulfills the Rule of 40 with greater than 30% revenue growth and strong free cash flow margin.The stock price is ever-so-slightly overpriced relative to other SaaS stocks, but the recent pullback provides a good investment opportunity.I rate ServiceNow as a strong buy.","The recent pullback in SaaS stocks is presenting some great opportunities. One of them is ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW), one of the bigger players in transforming the workplace. In the article ServiceNow Is On The Road To Becoming A 100-Bagger, I articulated my bullish case for this company. Since that time almost four months ago, the stock has gone from $237 to $300 and then retreated to a recent price of $264. This pullback brings the stock price back down to almost fair value. Thank you, Mr. Market!I believe this is an opportunity for investors that previously missed the boat to now get on board. ServiceNow handily meets the Rule of 40 with 30+% annual revenue growth and oodles of free cash flow. I am therefore reiterating my strong buy rating from four months ago.Built from the ground up, the Now Platform provides digital workflows that streamline processes across business systems, functions and departments.(Source: ServiceNow)ServiceNow's original focus was on IT Service Management (ITSM), but in 2014, the company began a strategic transition from being an IT tool vendor to a one-stop-shop for workflow management software, a platform that would enable business transformation. This shift involved the development and acquisition of cloud-based SaaS products that could be cross-sold to other parts of its customers' business.Current products include ""IT service management, IT business management, customer service management, HR service delivery, security operations, IT asset management, field service management, and governance, risk, and compliance.""(Source: ServiceNow)ServiceNow is able to sustain growth at such a rapid pace for one reason and that is product stickiness. With a renewal rate of 98%, customers that choose the Now Platform stick with it. This is the highest renewal rate of all SaaS companies that I have seen to date.(Source: ServiceNow)Given that ServiceNow is developing multiple areas of business with sticky products, the potential for significant cross-selling, and operating in business segments exhibiting double-digit growth, the company will in all likelihood experience strong growth on a long-term basis. In fact, Morningstar analyst Andrew Lange employs a long-term growth rate of 26.5% in his model for ServiceNow's valuation.I determine the stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to SaaS peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be valued more than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple. To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of forward gross profit/enterprise value versus estimated YoY sales growth for the 82 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV, ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, ServiceNow is sitting ever so slightly above the trend line, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is modestly higher than its peers, given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that ServiceNow is slightly overvalued relative to the average stock in my digital transformation universe.When it comes to software companies, I don't rely on traditional value factors; instead, I focus on other measures, such as the ""Rule of 40,"" free cash flow margin and cash burn.The Rule of 40 is a metric for software companies that help them balance growth and profitability. The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate plus profit adds up to 40% or more, then it has balanced growth and profit and is financially healthy.There are several different ways of calculating the Rule of 40:Growth - The standard growth metric is to use the Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) growth rate. For my Rule of 40 calculation, I use percentage sales growth TTM. There are three reasons for this: (1) ARR is not always available; (2) most SaaS companies grow not only organically but also by acquisition; and (3) many companies are in the middle of a transformation to SaaS and have a significant amount of product sales.Profit - I have seen many variants for the profit metric. Some analysts use EBITDA margin, and others use operational cash flow margin or free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin, as I believe that is the most meaningful factor from an investor perspective.ServiceNow's revenue saw growth of 33% for the most recent 12 months. Revenue growth has been slowly declining since 2013, but that is to be expected. Growth becomes harder to accomplish as a company gets larger. (Source: Portfolio123)ServiceNow has a free cash flow margin TTM of 26.8%, fairly flat for the last two years. This is an exceptional figure for a high-growth company.(Source: Portfolio123)ServiceNow's YoY revenue growth was 33%, while free cash flow margin for the trailing 12 months was 26.8%. Therefore:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 33% + 26.8% = 59.8%Since the Rule of 40 calculation comes out substantially higher than 40%, I conclude that the company is healthy with balanced growth and profits.Normally, when a company fulfills the Rule of 40, I don't analyze cash burn. But I am providing the SG&A expense here for reference. In the case of ServiceNow, the SG&A expense is 77.2% of the total revenues. SG&A has been declining since the mid-2015.Note that SG&A includes Sales & Marketing, General & Administrative, and R&D.(Source: Portfolio123)SG&A expenses of 77.2% are reasonable for a SaaS company still in high-growth mode. In order to demonstrate just how reasonable, I create a scatter plot of forward operating income/EV versus forward sales growth for all stocks in my digital transformation stock universe. The forward operating income for this purpose is before depreciation and amortization and is calculated as follows:Forward Operating Income = Forward Sales - Cost of Goods Sold TTM - SG&A Expense TTMThe forward versions of cost of goods sold and SG&A expenses are assumed to be the same as the trailing 12 months.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)From the above plot, you can see what the effect of the SG&A expense has on forward operating income for ServiceNow. It is positive and slightly above its peers, meaning that future operating income is modestly better than its peers.Based on fundamentals, ServiceNow is a buy. The stock is ever-so-slightly overvalued, but I wouldn't stay on the sidelines at this stock price. The recent pullback presents a buying opportunity that should not be ignored. The stock chart shows that the share price has recently approached Support Level 1 at ~$250, and then bounced back.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)If the stock price drops below $250, then conservative investors should exit and take a loss. Aggressive investors may instead want to give more leeway for this trade and place a stop loss at Support Level 2 at ~$230.While the long-term picture for ServiceNow appears to be quite rosy, there are several investment risks that investors should be aware of.The first concern is that the investment is based on lofty revenue growth expectations that may fail to materialize. Outlook failure may occur as a result of new technological trends, increased competition, erosion of customer retention, or a recession.Some consider SaaS stocks to be in bubble territory, and it is possible that we could experience a dot-com-like crash in the future.High-growth SaaS stocks are also very sensitive to any market volatility, even if not related to the company's area of business. Growth tends to magnify volatility.As ServiceNow increases its footprint, it increasingly competes within other business verticals where it again has to be an industry disrupter.Finally, ServiceNow will eventually need to focus more on smaller enterprises in order to fuel growth expectations. As the company expands into smaller businesses, total annualized contract value, or ACV, will shrink and potentially weigh on margin expansion efforts.ServiceNow is a dominant player in ITSM and is gaining traction in ITOM. The company also offers a wide range of workflow management products. The Now Platform is extremely sticky with a renewal rate of 98% for existing customers.The stock price is ever-so-slightly overvalued, but ServiceNow fulfills the Rule of 40 with greater than 30% revenue growth and strong free cash flow. The stock price is sitting just above a support level, and I suggest entering long here. A stop-loss should be placed below one of two support levels: $230 or $250 based on your investment style or comfort level. I rate ServiceNow as a strong buy."

Right after the results, its stock registered a 60% price increase since the start of the year. Given ServiceNow's growing tie-ups to expand market reach, that growth will most likely continue.ServiceNow's quarterly revenues grew 35% over the year to $833.9 million, ahead of the market's expectations of $831 million. Adjusted earnings came grew 44% to $0.71 per share and were ahead of the market's forecast of $0.63 for the quarter.For the quarter, ServiceNow's software billings grew 31% to $871 million, ahead of the estimates of $855 million. However, its subscription revenue rose 33% to $781 million, falling short of the estimates of $782.7 million. Professional services and other revenues grew 16% to $52.9 million.For the current quarter, ServiceNow forecast subscription revenues of $830-$835 million, falling short of the market's forecast of $836 million. The company expects to end the current year with subscription revenues of $3.25-$3.26 billion, in line with the Street's forecast of $3.25 billion.ServiceNow is going full steam ahead by entering into various strategic partnerships with bigger tech giants. Earlier in the year, it had announced a partnership with Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) to integrate Adobe customer experience data with customer data. The alliance was aimed at leveraging Adobe Experience Platform and ServiceNow Now Platform to enhance Adobe's real-time customer profiles with rich customer data, allowing mutual customers to integrate and leverage digital workflows, service catalogs and content.And, more recently, it announced another tie-up with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). As part of the agreement, ServiceNow will use Microsoft's Azure cloud to host workloads for the US and Australian governments and enterprises. The agreement is the first of its kind where ServiceNow will make its software available for use with a major public cloud-computing vendor. Microsoft also will sell ServiceNow applications, thus helping ServiceNow expand its market reach in other geographic regions. The move will help ServiceNow leverage Microsoft's security certifications as it pursues government contracts around the world. In return, Microsoft will gain significant lift in the cloud-application space.The company also entered into an agreement with Deloitte to jointly develop, coordinate, and bring to market new products, assets, and solutions built on the Now Platform. The tie-up will help deliver seamless digital experiences across the enterprise, improve workflows, and enhance productivity. Deloitte also will be the lead launch partner for its new financial operations management product. ServiceNow's first application is Finance Close Automation, which will help finance and accounting teams digitize their workflows to reduce finance close risk, improve team satisfaction, and accelerate the finance close process.Its stock is currently trading at $256.81 with a market cap of $47.64 billion. Like other technology stocks, its stock also has fallen to a 52-week low of $147.63 in December last year. It had touched a record high of $303.17 last month.The recent dip in the stock price is attributed to market concerns on its high valuation and the lower than expected subscription revenue outlook for the current quarter. Some analysts believe that ServiceNow is rather highly valued with a P/sales multiple of 19.2 compared with the peer group median multiple of 15.2."

But what lies ahead is what matters most to today's shareholder.I lay out why shareholders today have no compelling edge to remain invested in ServiceNow.Source: author's calculations, SEC filingsThe graph above highlights just how steady ServiceNow's revenue growth rate has been. It has consistently been punching above 30%, which for a company of its size is an extremely challenging endeavor to accomplish.ServiceNow will announce its Q2 2019 earnings on Wednesday after hours. Anything less than bullish guidance and its shares are likely to meaningfully sell-off.Please note that this is certainly not the case that I'm a doom and gloom author. Not at all, but this is simply common sense investing.If I was to declare that ServiceNow had not made any profits during the past 7 plus years, this would be met with readers' blank gazes or antagonistic stares (more likely the latter).The well-versed spiel would be along the lines that although ServiceNow doesn't make profits, its cash flows are extremely strong. Although, in reality, it transpires that this is actually not the case.Above, on the blue line, I have backed out stock-based compensation from ServiceNow's cash flow from operations. You can see that for a company trading with a $55 billion market cap, to be making less than $300 million in cash flows is indeed a worrisome affair.For the line immediately below it, the orange line, I have taken its cash flows from operations and backed out its stock-based compensation once more, as well as this time, backing purchases for property and equipment as well as intangibles. This orange line is what I argue is ServiceNow's actual adjusted free cash flow.At this juncture, two separate issues should become immediately obvious. First, that ServiceNow's ability to generate free cash flows is paltry, with less than $20 million being made in 2018.The second point, which is insightful, is that narrative aside, ServiceNow's free cash flow is not consistently growing. In fact, it appears to be volatile and not congruent with company narrative, what-so-ever.Ultimately, ServiceNow's business model carries a lot of appeal, which is supported by the fact that its churn rate from existing customers hovers around 1%.Additionally, the fact that ServiceNow serves 75% of the Fortune 500 companies, is another reason why the company merits special attention.In essence, I have no argument that ServiceNow is in actuality providing a very necessary service. What I do have an issue with is, what kind of margin of safety do investors presently have?Source: author's calculations, morningstar.comWe have all become so familiar with tech stocks carrying elevated valuations that we have started to turn caution to the wind. However, compared with its peers, ServiceNow's valuation is certainly the most extended on a P/Sales multiple.Additionally, perceptive readers will have noticed that even when compared with its own valuation, ServiceNow's 18.8x multiple to trailing sales leaves very little room for further expansion. This is made more piercing when we compare its present sales multiple with its own historical multiple of just 13.5x. How much more upside can there actually be?Shareholders are going in Q2 2019 earnings holding one of the most sizzling stocks in the sector. In the event that guidance comes out with anything less than a surprise to the upside, the market will likely punish this stock.Stay tuned!Author's note: If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive emails of my latest research, please click ""Follow"" at the top of this article."

While Appian is a leader in low code development, ServiceNow has a good opportunity to increase its market share in the space.1. Increased spending in the short termServiceNow is new to the PaaS space. Organizations considering to utilize cloud platforms for building apps and low code development have a lot of choices. ServiceNow has the opportunity to attract customers through attractive license bundles with their existing offerings.

CompetitionIt is worth mentioning that there are several competitors for ServiceNow in the PaaS offering. At present, the capability offered by ServiceNow is at its infancy and yet to be tried and tested by customers. The market for low-code development platform is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, and has relatively low barriers for entry.3. Changes in the EconomyPoor economy will be bad news for ServiceNow. Though digital transformation is a major priority for organizations today, an economic downturn in the near future may result in companies spending less on IT transformations.

4242874,22786,2019-02-21T11:27:04-05:00,ServiceNow enjoyed a spectacular rally after releasing fourth quarter earnings.Buying looks tired and is overdone.Downside valuation introduced.,"ServiceNow (NOW) is a fast-growing firm whose profitability is so impressive that the market did not hesitate in bidding the stock higher by over 20% since its last quarterly earnings report. Though the stock does not suit the do-it-yourself value investor due to price-earnings multiples, tech investors may want to look for an entry point.ServiceNow reported earnings of just $0.04 a share but investors piled on the stock after it spent months at between $170-$190. Though shares appear to have peaked at $237.49, the rationale behind the rally is the Q4 outperformance. Subscription revenue of $666 million beat guidance by $3 million while non-GAAP subscription billings of $952 million topped guidance by a solid $50 million.Value investors demanding value will not like that actual yearly growth for FY 2019 is below previous year growth. FY 2018 actual growth also slowed compared to last year. Refer to the last two sets of bar charts below:Source: ServiceNowGiven the lack of cheap IT services stocks on the market today, investors are not picky in paying a premium for the moderate new customer growth rates. Per Seeking Alpha’s Peers tab, Splunk (SPLK) and Salesforce.com (CRM) traded at a premium (on a P/E multiples basis) for years. And each quarter, both companies reported strong customer acquisition growth and per-seat revenue. But all valuations are relative and if SPLK and CRM stock fall, NOW shares might correct to more reasonable valuations.Data by YChartsInvestors are enthusiastic over the number of G2K customers added quarterly. ServiceNow added new customers consistently for the last eight straight quarters. Upsells, as measured by ACV/G2K, is climbing steadily and reached 10% for the first time since Q4/2017. Management highlighted that 19 of the top 20 deals included more than three products, so clearly the satisfied customer is willing to open its budget and maximize its spending.A short-term risk factor is that the fourth quarter is typically the strongest period because customers want to spend whatever is remaining in their IT budget. The first quarter is typically ServiceNow’s lowest billings quarter. Management did not forecast stronger growth either but instead, suggested that the numbers will be bigger. At a market capitalization of $41 billion and the stock valued at ~16 times sales, the market really should not have increased the stock price by over 20% in the last month. Still, the consistently high renewal rate of 97%-99% in the last year is impressive.On top of that, the top line mix is shifting to subscriptions. In the fourth quarter, subscriptions grew to 93% of GAAP revenues, up from 91% last year. That did wonders for Adobe (ADBE) and Autodesk (ADSK) stock.Below: ServiceNow managed to outperform Autodesk and Adobe in the one-year period.Data by YChartsThe difference between these stocks and NOW stock is that the former offers a unique product that cannot be matched by the competition. No one offers anything better than Adobe’s graphics suite or Autodesk’s 3D drawing programs. Conversely, customers have plenty of ways to find digital workflow solutions.Despite my reservations for ServiceNow, expect the company’s sales team to sustain sales for 2019. The structural change of its sales organization will lead to enterprise customer wins. ServiceNow is focusing on that market and investing in that space.If investors apply the Revenue Multiples model and compare NOW stock to Salesforce, Splunk, Adobe, and Autodesk, notice the EV/LTM Revenue is sharply higher than its peers:Source: finbox.io (click on the link to change EV/LTM revenue multiple and implied fair value range).At an EV/LTM Revenue multiple of between 10–11 times, ServiceNow stock could fall back to the $145-$160 trading range.ServiceNow performed well, helped by strength in Europe and North America. Organic growth will continue as cross-selling leads to higher product sales per customer. But analysts may be right not to raise the price target beyond the ~$235 stock price. Instead of buying this stock at these levels, wait for the company to report another solid quarter before starting a position."

Addressing a huge market with leading technology and proven innovation track record, we think that ServiceNow will grow into its steep valuation and that today’s investors will be handsomely awarded over time.ServiceNow delivered yet another earnings beat on top and bottom lines, but shares sold off on the report. The quarter was marked by a large deal performance with the company closing 39 transactions with more than $1 mn in net new annual contract value (ACV) and customers paying more than $1 mn in ACV grew 32% highlighting demand for the company’s products by large customers.During the call, the management pointed out a few, what we think are unimportant, issues regarding the business which may have been the reasons behind the -5% knee-jerk price action. The company increased its 2019 subscription billings guidance but by less than the quarterly beat. This was, according to company management, due to subscription revenue lagging due to self-hosted renewal timing but billings coming in better than expected due to early closures. ServiceNow Management also pointed out poor performance in the European business but stated that this was offset by other regions.Although the management didn’t give further details, we suspect that these reasons are due to slowing spending in the face of slowing global economy. However, we also think that the tides will turn in 2H 2019 and in 1H 2020 and growth will pick back up. We are more bullish on the company after the results and think that the market is being shortsighted. Analysts seem to agree with us. In our view, ServiceNow is treading along nicely.ServiceNow is targeting to optimize enterprises IT operations much like Salesforce (CRM) did their sales, and SAP (SAP) and Microsoft (MSFT) did their internal workflows. ServiceNow’s Now Platform targets to digitally transform an enterprise by allowing IT departments to connect with the rest of the business in a streamlined and user-friendly fashion. The product also brings significant cost savings with automatization or increased efficiency in mundane administrative tasks.In addition to its flagship IT services management (ITSM) software, the company offers other SaaS products designed to increase workflow efficiency of its customers. ServiceNow uses its ITSM product as a launching pad in its upsell efforts.With all its verticals, Taylor Hoffman Research puts the company’s total addressable market at $77 bn. ServiceNow stands to benefit from the secular growth trend of digital transformation.The opportunity and demand for the company’s software is evident in its metrics. Its astonishing 3-year revenue CAGR of 36% was fueled by ServiceNow being chosen by industry leaders. Apparently, 69% of U.S. based global 2000 customers used ServiceNow’s services as of January of 2018, and probably a lot more do today. On its analyst day, the company stated that more than 7 of the top 10 global companies in each industry used its services.Source: ServiceNow Analyst Day PresentationThe land and expand model that ServiceNow uses has been proven by industry stalwarts. Leading enterprise vendors such as Microsoft, Salesforce, Oracle, SAP, and many others used their flagship product to tie a customer and then up/cross-sell other products to continuously grow within existing customers. ServiceNow is executing this strategy today as evidenced in its customer cohort growth and renewal rates. ServiceNow reports stable 97-99% renewal rates and states that annual growth of ACV increases over time per cohort.Source: Analyst Day PresentationMuch like for those aforementioned leading enterprise vendors, ServiceNow’s growth depends on innovation. It needs to protect its product by maintaining its best-in-class status so that new customers keep choosing it, and it needs to keep innovating new ones to fuel growth.ServiceNow’s Management is aware of this fact and prioritizes R&D in both launching new products and improving existing ones. Over the past 2 years, the company managed 2 product releases per year and grew its number of engineers 2.5 times and its user experience designers 6 times. The company spends a whopping 21.3% of its revenues on R&D.Source: Analyst Day PresentationMuch like with all high growth SaaS vendors, the valuation is difficult to grasp. It is very difficult to make sense of an equity trading at 17x sales. What is also difficult to understand is accelerating growth in a large addressable market. What we argue isn’t that ServiceNow is under or over or fairly valued today but that if they keep executing, then current valuation is very attractive. As stated above, with an addressable market of $77bn (and growing with new product launches) and current sales of $3 bn, the company has a huge opportunity. If they capture a meaningful share of that market, the current $53 bn market cap will be a bargain.We’re ones to argue the bull case. We think that the Management has proven itself over the past years with flawless execution both financially and operationally. Given the quality of product, large TAM, and innovation ability, we think that ServiceNow will become one of the great enterprise vendors and steadily appreciate in value.Source: Seeking AlphaIf new products fail to catch on, investors will punish the company. The growth estimates bake in successful launches of new products. If the company fails in these, it will be difficult to justify the R&D spending and will result in a selloff. We, however, think that this is an unlikely scenario given the success of existing products and have faith in ServiceNow’s R&D department.The steep valuation amplifies execution risks. An example of this is the current quarter. The company reported solid results but was met with a 5% drop in price. The expectations are high for ServiceNow, any disappointment in results will have harsh effects."

ITSM is a critical function for all organizations that possess information technology assets. The term refers to the set of Information Technology [IT] services offered to internal or external customers, including:While ITSM is a hot industry now, it was once considered to be stagnant, weighed down by aging stand-alone legacy applications, fraught with device dependencies, increasing support and maintenance costs, and software obsolescence.The industry had a total lack of vision, with vendors being content to offer the status quo. Then one day ServiceNow arrived on the scene and disrupted the industry with its Software-as-a-Service [SaaS] solution:ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) quickly became a major part of a broad movement known as the ""Digital Transformation,"" which involves the integration of digital technology into businesses, fundamentally altering how a company operates and delivers value to customers.ServiceNow began the process of modernizing ITSM by introducing a SaaS platform, driven by macro-trends such as:NOW's platform was built from the ground up, and addressed the complex IT needs of enterprise-level companies, including global server/device provisioning and maintaining service-level agreements [SLA] across a variety of cloud and on-premise apps.Corporations soon woke up to the problems associated with their legacy ITSM implementations and as a result, began to embrace the digital transformation en masse. Legacy ITSM challenges include:At the center of the ITSM renaissance is ServiceNow, the focus of this article. As a result of ServiceNow's foresight and product positioning, the company currently sports a 40+% market share in ITSM, up from 10% in 2011.IT Service Management Applications (ITSM) Market Shares as of 2017. (source appsruntheworld.com)Instead of attempting to produce a good original summary of the benefits of the ServiceNow platform, I would like to quote the list benefits that the Royal Bank of Scotland Group observed after converting from legacy ITSM to ServiceNow. The list appears to be extensive:A good summary of the ServiceNow functionality and competitors' is located here. Features are listed below. Please excuse me for not going into detail on these items.Although ServiceNow has captured the most market share, the company did so by being first out of the gate with a next-generation SaaS offering. This begs the question for investors: ""Does ServiceNow have the best product"".The answer to this question is ""It depends"". The best product is a function of the needs of each individual company and depends on many variables, including cost, required functionality, scalability, ease of use, etc.In my opinion, ServiceNow has the ""best-positioned product"" for major enterprises, and that is where most of the money is.Gartner's Magic Quadrant, Source: gartner.comAlthough there are many ITSM competitors, there is only one serious combatant capable of taking market share. That company is BMC (NASDAQ:BMC); ServiceNow has (at least) three times more market share.As mentioned earlier, ServiceNow's product was designed from the ground up, resulting in a single platform located in the cloud, allowing easy and automated updates. The application includes everything you would expect from an enterprise platform, including workflows, notifications, and approvals, and it was designed to achieve challenging availability and performance specifications. The application sports a friendly user interface, with app-building capability by pointing, clicking, dragging and dropping.While BMC also provides a great product, it wasn't designed from scratch, and the company suffers from an ongoing market perception of legacy Remedy brand experiences.The follow-up question is ""Does it matter if ServiceNow has the best product?""I do believe that ServiceNow is in a corporate sweet spot, similar to where IBM was back in the 1960s and '70s. Back then, the saying was that ""a manager has never been fired for choosing IBM"" implied that one couldn't go wrong by choosing IBM, even if the product was more expensive or provided less performance. The same applies to ServiceNow. The process of digital transformation will impact enterprises in significant and profound ways. If a manager chooses a product that doesn't meet the company's needs then heads will surely roll. However, it is pretty much certain that ServiceNow is capable of meeting the needs of large enterprises, given the current level of penetration and customer satisfaction.The term ""ten-bagger"" was coined by Peter Lynch in his book ""One Up on Wall Street."" Lynch was an avid baseball fan and used the term ""bag"" in reference to any of the four bases on a baseball diamond. A ten-bagger, therefore, suggests a player hitting for ten bases total in a game. This could be achieved by hitting two home runs and a double or some other combination of hits that add up to 10 bases. Any way you look at it, it is an impressive performance for a baseball player on any given day.In stock market terminology, a ten-bagger implies a 10x stock price gain. ServiceNow recently became a ten-bagger, starting from the stock's IPO price of $23.75 in 2012 to a recent $240 as shown in the chart below.ServiceNow became a ten-bagger within 7 years from IPO. Source: seekingalpha.com with MS paint editsThe company's amazing growth story has been aptly summarized by Morningstar's Andrew Lange in an analyst note:ServiceNow not only caught BMC Software off-guard but left other established players in the dust as well, companies such as CA Inc. (CA), Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE), and International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). Note: Micro Focus (MFGP) acquired Hewlett Packard Enterprise's software assets in 2017.My answer to this question is ""No."" Ten-baggers occur more often than one would like to believe, and in fact, one out of every seven stocks becomes a ten-bagger in a company's lifetime, or within 35 years.I would like to digress back to the baseball analogy for the moment. If you are as old as I am and also a baseball fan, you might remember the date October 18, 1977, the day Reggie Jackson became ""Mr. October"".Reggie Jackson hits his third consecutive home run of the game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 6 of the World Series at Yankee Stadium. Source: newsday.comWhile many big-league players have hit one, two, or even three home runs in a single game, few can claim to have hit three home runs in one World Series game. In fact, only four players have done so: Babe Ruth (twice), Albert Pujols, Pablo Sandoval, and Reggie Jackson. Mr. Jackson did so in spectacular fashion by hitting first-pitch home runs against 3 different pitchers in Game 6 of the 1977 World Series. Technically, Jackson's feat was a twelve-bagger, not a ten-bagger, but who is counting?My point is that ten-baggers are not special on their own. They are only special if they contribute meaningfully to the desired outcome. In the case of baseball, the desired outcome would be a world championship. In the investment world, a meaningful contribution could be larger than normal portfolio returns. A ten-bagger delivered over 35 years would result in a Compounded Annual Growth Rate [CAGR] of 6.8%, similar to (or less than) the long-term return of a stock market index. Such a contribution would not be meaningful to most Seeking Alpha readers. On the other hand, a ten-bagger that occurs within 10 years would have a CAGR of 26%, a meaningful contribution to most investment portfolios.Comparison of ten-bagger scenarios: 10-year versus 35-year timeframe. Source: EXCEL spreadsheet calculationsThe technology sector delivers many of the 10-year ten-baggers, the reason being is that disruptive or revolutionary technology tends to provide the catalyst for explosive growth.Examples of 10-year ten-bagger stocks within the technology sector include (but not restricted to) Apple Inc. (AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL), and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT). Apple invented the smartphone, Alphabet introduced us to personalized advertising and Microsoft gave us the default PC operating system.In 2007 no one knew (except for Steve Jobs) that the iPhone would become a generation-defining product, and that the iPhone would achieve phenomenal worldwide sales. People I spoke to at the time (engineers, marketers, etc) overwhelmingly condemned the product as ill-conceived. Who would want a phone that only runs for two hours between charging?Well just about everyone wanted a smartphone as it turns out.Apple shares achieved a 900% gain measured from the first iPhone release in 2007, taking approximately 7.5 years to become a ten-bagger.Apple ten-bagger.

Source: seekingalpha.com with MS paint editsIn the 1980s it would have been difficult for any company to dislodge the default operating system (MS-DOS) from a product with unlimited growth potential, the IBM Personal Computer. In 1986, Microsoft had a wide economic moat and used that advantage to launch new products such as Microsoft Office, and Windows.When it comes to 10-year ten-baggers, ServiceNow is no slouch. The company's stock performance has been right up there with recognized technology giants.There are three key factors necessary for tagging potential 10-year ten-baggers. Without these factors in place, no company is likely to achieve the desired performance.Factor 1: Wide Economic MoatThe term ""economic moat"" was popularized by one of the most successful investors of our time, Warren Buffett. An economic moat represents the long-term sustainability of a company's competitive advantage. The wider the moat, the more sustainable the business is.In my opinion, an analyst can only assess a company's long-term outlook by first understanding its economic moat. If there is no moat then you might as well do your analysis by flipping a coin. The company being analyzed may have had its 15 minutes of fame but will soon be dislodged by the next flash-in-the-pan.In general, a wide economic moat should be readily identifiable from the get-go. This was the case for the case studies provided: Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft.While a wide economic moat is easy to identify, the remaining two factors (rapidly expanding industry and small starting base) are less so.Factor 2: Rapidly Expanding IndustryThe second key factor pertains to the industry (or industries) that the company operates in. The industry must be in a state of rapid expansion, giving the company a strong tail-wind. Rapid expansion is not always easily identifiable, particularly in the case where new or disruptive technologies are involved as there is no prior history to base analysis on. For example, in 2007 there was no way of knowing that smartphone sales would explode. In 2004, few analysts had an inkling that digital advertising revenues would skyrocket.Factor 3: Small Starting BaseThe third key factor is a logical and obvious necessary ingredient for 10x stock price appreciation. Many analysts interpret ""small starting base"" to mean small-cap or mid-cap companies. I disagree. My interpretation is that the starting base (market capitalization) must be small relative to the size of the business opportunity.For example, Apple was the 8th largest publicly listed technology company by market cap ($106 billion) in 2007. The only thing that mattered was that its market capitalization was small RELATIVE to the ultimate size of the smartphone industry, which was massive. Without the relative difference in size, a 10-year ten-bagger would have not been feasible.One area that I avoid is buying into technology IPOs. I may appear to be a bit of a hypocrite given two of my three ten-bagger examples were technology IPOs. In my defense, this is a problem that has been starting to show its ugly face in more recent times, with IPOs such as Facebook (FB) in 2012. My two examples, Microsoft and Google, were further in the past when there was much less greed involved in the IPO process. The problems may still have been there but much less prevalent.Recent IPOs have showcased the greed there is on the part of venture capitalists, early private investors, so-called ""key employees,"" and investment bankers. There is undoubtedly a cash grab at the time of the IPO. Early private investors want an instant return on their investment, key employees want to become rich, founders and venture capitalists want to be beyond rich. And the investment banks underwriting the IPO are more than willing to support the cash grab so long as they get their lofty cut as well.The IPO for Facebook in 2012 is a case in point. There was such pent-up demand for Facebook shares that both investment banks and private shareholders bumped the limits on IPO share price, and number of shares released to the public, beyond what could be reasonably sustained in subsequent market activity.Facebook's share price dropped by 50% shortly after IPO, Source: Portfolio123.comFor this reason, I don't waste my time on IPOs as they are stacked against small public investors in today's markets. There may be exceptions but in general, investors should not expect a fair price when buying into an IPO.Needless to say, the ServiceNow opportunity identified in this article is not an IPO and does not have this concern.ServiceNow recently became a 10-year ten-bagger from its IPO price, and it is my contention that there is still more exceptional performance to come. ServiceNow is a growth stock, and by achieving another 10-year ten-bagger performance, ServiceNow will be a hundred-bagger. I believe this to be not only possible but likely, as I shall explain in this article.In order to assess this opportunity, let us do a deeper dive into the three key factors for identifying potential 10-year ten-baggers. As a reminder, the three factors are: (1) a wide economic moat; (2) rapidly expanding industries; and (3) a small starting base.I can state with a great deal of confidence that ServiceNow has a wide economic moat, not because I performed exhaustive analysis using my own blood, sweat, and tears, but because Morningstar, with its hundreds of analysts, has done so.The Morningstar wide moat designation underscores their belief that the company will likely maintain its advantage for at least 20 years. Morningstar's economic moat assessment includes both qualitative and quantitative factors. Quantitatively, Morningstar employs among other metrics, a measure of financial health called ""Distance to Default"", a metric that many financial analysts use to determine the sustainability of profits and the likelihood of bankruptcy.In the case of ServiceNow, Morningstar has determined that the company has a wide economic moat:I have a confession to make. This article took a long time to write, a lot longer than I originally anticipated, and at the beginning of my effort, I had a peek at the holdings of the VanEck Vectors Morningstar Wide Moat ETF (MOAT). All ETF companies are required by law to divulge current ETF holdings, so why not take advantage! This ETF was as a convenient starting point for discovering good wide moat investments.At the beginning of my efforts, ServiceNow was indeed held by the MOAT ETF. With the article near completion, much to my chagrin, I have now observed that ServiceNow is no longer being held by the ETF. As it turns out, the stock was removed, not due to concerns over the company's wide moat, but due to the analysts' conviction that ServiceNow has reached fair value.Removed constituents - MOAT® VanEck Vectors Morningstar Wide Moat ETF, Source: vaneck.comThe people running the Morningstar wide moat index seem to have this crazy notion that the index should be filled with value stocks trading below what analysts deem fair value. Imagine that!The principle that investment returns are a function of the price an investor pays for the business, may be based on unreliable forecasts and tends to lead investors astray, particularly when it comes to fast-growing companies.So I ask you... Is it not better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than potentially miss an exceptional opportunity entirely while watching from the bleachers? ServiceNow is a growth stock, not a value play, and despite having reached fair value in the eyes of certain analysts, I still consider the stock to be the best long-term growth stock in the universe of U.S. stocks, bar none.ServiceNow is in the business of providing products to enterprise customers, products that provide structure and automation to IT services and other business functions. The company initially focused on ITSM but in 2014, ServiceNow began a strategic transition from being an IT tool vendor to a one-stop shop for workflow management software, a platform that would enable business transformation. This shift involved the development and acquisition of cloud-based SaaS products that could be cross-sold to other parts of their customer's business. In the words of Adam Mansfield:The company now has six ""mission-critical"" verticals aimed at capitalizing on the secular shift to cloud applications. These opportunities include three overarching IT verticals:Add to that three roadmap opportunities: Customer Service, Human Resources and Security Operations.Given that ServiceNow is developing multiple areas of business with ""sticky products,"" the potential for significant cross-selling, and operating in business segments exhibiting double-digit growth, ServiceNow will in all likelihood experience strong growth on a long-term basis.Morningstar analyst Andrew Lange employs a long-term growth rate of 26.5% in his model for ServiceNow valuation. Coincidentally, this figure is in line with the 26% CAGR required for ServiceNow to be a 10-year ten-bagger.We have established that ServiceNow has a wide economic moat based on sticky products that could persist for as long as 20 years. We also know that the company has a business strategy for long-term rapid growth, similar to that of Salesforce.com, Inc (CRM) and that Morningstar has pegged long-term growth at 26%.The third factor and final determinant of whether ServiceNow is a potential 10-year ten-bagger candidate lies with ServiceNow's starting base. At present, ServiceNow a market capitalization of $44 billion.A good starting point in addressing the third key factor is with CEO John Donahoe's vision to achieve $15 billion in revenues in a few years. Current revenues are approximately $2.5 billion. Based on sales-growth estimates alone, ServiceNow could potentially grow 6x in stock price, assuming the stock trades at a fair value both today and in 10 years hence. But sales growth is not the complete picture.The best growth-oriented companies sacrifice profits for optimal growth, plow profits back into the company instead of paying taxes or rewarding value-seeking shareholders. If you don't believe me then ask Jeff Bezos, the founder of the most successful company in the world Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).ServiceNow is pursuing a growth strategy similar to that of Amazon.com. Profits have been sacrificed while building out its sales force, launching new products, and heavily investing in SG&A and R&DServiceNow's quarterly EPS chart, Source: portfolio123.com.Admittedly, the earnings picture has been ""ugly,"" but should not matter to anyone except for a few value investors. A more important measure of financial stability is an ongoing positive and expanding Free Cash Flow.ServiceNow's Free Cash Flow (Trailing Twelve Months) chart, Source: Portfolio123.com.While sales growth could potentially result in 6x stock price appreciation, the more significant factor is operating leverage as highlighted by Morningstar:In terms of the baseball analogy, sales growth will be pitched for the first 8 innings. The sluggers will be brought out in the ninth inning. This will be when growing operating margins crank out massive operating profits, making ServiceNow a probable candidate as a hundred-bagger within the next 10 years.ServiceNow Annual Growth Rates (as of April 2019)Source: Portfolio123While the long-term picture for ServiceNow appears to be quite rosy, there are several investment risks that investors should be aware of.The first concern is that the investment is based on lofty revenue growth expectations that may fail to materialize. Outlook failure may occur as a result of new technological trends, increased competition, or erosion of customer retention.As ServiceNow increases its footprint, it increasingly competes within other business verticals where ServiceNow again has to be an industry disrupter.Finally, ServiceNow will eventually need to focus more on smaller enterprises in order to fuel growth expectations. As the company expands into smaller businesses, total annualized contract value, or ACV, will shrink and potentially weigh on margin expansion efforts.Due to the length of this article, I have chosen not to discuss some items that may be of interest to investors:ServiceNow is the top company on my list of potential 10-year ten-baggers for several reasons. The company satisfies all three of my key ingredients, including a wide economic moat, rapidly expanding industries and a small starting base.The company has a vision of where it wants to go and is actively progressing towards that goal, transforming from an IT tool vendor into a platform that enables business transformation.ServiceNow currently finds itself in a corporate mindset sweet spot, similar to the position IBM was in the 1960s and '70s. The conservative mindset dictates that ServiceNow is the platform of choice for large organizations given the company's record of success.I am also a strong admirer of any company able to produce sticky products and achieve a high customer retention rate. These properties suggest a well-thought-out product with high quality.While the long-term picture for ServiceNow appears to be quite rosy, there are risks that investors should be aware of. The risks include unforeseen industry disrupters, lofty growth expectations and the eventual need to focus on smaller enterprises, leading to compressed margins.While ServiceNow has already become a ten-bagger, I have high expectations that a hundred-bagger performance is in the works, within the next 10 years."

Adjusted EBIT margins hit 21% which is quite impressive given the growth of the company. Going forward, ServiceNow is projected to continue to expand its top-line over 30% while EBIT margins will slightly increase. Given the uncertainty in the macro environment, investors will likely pay a premium for balanced growth with profitability, multi-product offerings, and expanding margins.ServiceNow is a leading and innovative provider of IT helpdesk software which aims to be an intelligent and intuitive platform to manage across IT operations, HR, customer service, and security applications. The ServiceNow cloud services automate, predict, digitize, and optimize business processes and tasks. The company has been successful in expanding into related products to boost margins and grow organic sales.Owing to strong recurring revenue, ServiceNow has grown repeatedly over the years with virtually no large kinks (drops) in the interim. Year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter charts demonstrate this particularly well. Although, as the company grows even larger, growth rates will likely attenuate, it is on track to deliver in the range of 20-30% annually over the next five years.Source: KoyfinSource: CompanySource: CompanyAs a result, free cash flow generation is also quite predictable which reflect higher earnings quality from recurring subscription revenues.Source: KoyfinThese costs are inclusive of share-based compensation. In total, share-based compensation is about 20% of revenues which is also unchanged throughout the quarter as opposed to some peers where non-cash compensations kept growing or were more volatile.Sales & marketing expenses are the biggest cost centers due to the focus on expanding the top-line which is natural given the high growth nature of the company. A softening trend is a good sign as the revenue becomes more robust and less reliant on commissions to boost sales.Source: CompanyGiven the company's ability to meet its EBIT margin targets and sometimes surprise on the upside, my forward EBIT margin of 22% is about 100bps above the company's guidance of 21%. I think sales incentive will grow as the company has been aggressive in hiring sales personnel in 2019 but will fall slightly as a percentage of revenue due to continued high revenue growth rate. In addition, gross margins should continue to improve while other admin costs should generally be fixed/decoupled from further revenue growth. These factors should help improve overall margins.Due to the good visibility of growth, the company deserves a premium in valuation. It is currently trading at about 70x forward earnings (non-GAAP). Compared with its broader peers, it is richly valued but in line with other cloud companies.2-year average forward: 70x P/ESource: BloombergApplying a 70x forward PE to 2019E earnings, we get a price target of $222 which puts it in line with the current market price. If we project 2020E earnings to continue to grow mid 30s (on better margins, sustained top-line growth of 28%) and apply a discounted 2-year forward PE of 55, we get $235, implying about 5% upside.I think ServiceNow is one of the more robust cloud companies out there due to its superb margins which balance well between high growth rate and profitability. Due to the recurring subscription model, the cash flow generation is solid and less subject to volatility. Multiple product offerings make it stand out among peers. That said, valuation is mostly full and may serve better as a long hedge if an investor is short broader tech sector or other cloud companies.Disclaimer: All research, figures, and interpretation are provided on a best effort basis only and may be subject to error.

The Dow crashed more than 600 points earlier this week, erasing all of the gains made during the year. The market is concerned about a slowing economy and rising interest rates. Valuations for startups have been falling, and investor confidence appears to be shaking. It doesn't help if companies don't report a strong outlook for the coming quarters. The story was no different for ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), which surpassed market expectations for the reported quarter but reported a weak billing outlook for the current quarter.ServiceNow reported third quarter revenues at $673 million, growing 37% over the year. It ended the quarter with net income of $0.04 per share and adjusted EPS of $0.68. The market was looking for revenues of $657.7 million and an adjusted EPS of $0.60 for the quarter.By segment, Subscription revenues grew 39% to $627 million. Professional services and other segment revenues grew 9% to $46.5 million.During the quarter, ServiceNow closed 25 transactions with more than $1 million in net new annual contract value. It now has 614 customers with more than $1 million in annual contract value, recording 37% growth over the year.Total billings for the company grew 32% over the year to $720.5 million. Subscription billings grew 35% to $674.2 million, while Professional services and other billings grew 1% to $46.4 million.For the current quarter, ServiceNow forecast subscription billings of $900-$905 million, falling short of the Street's forecast of $914.7 million. It expects its subscription revenues to come in at $660-$665 million for the quarter.ServiceNow continued growing inorganically during the quarter. Earlier this month, it announced the acquisition of San Francisco-based FriendlyData. Founded just two years ago, FriendlyData's technology provides a natural language interface for databases. It simplifies technical terms for non-technical users, making it easier for them to ask quantitative questions in plain English. ServiceNow plans to leverage this technology by integrating it with the natural language query interfaces of the Now platform, applications for IT, Human Resources, Security Operations, Customer Service Management, partner products, and for developers. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.FriendlyData's financials are not publicly known. It's estimated to have raised $280,000 in funding from investors including Bulba Ventures, VentureBot, Digital Future, TMT Investments, GWC Innovator Fund, and Starta Accelerator over the last two years at undisclosed valuations.This was the second natural language-focused acquisition for ServiceNow this year. Earlier in the year, it had announced the acquisition of Parlo, an AI startup, for an undisclosed sum. San Francisco-based Parlo was also founded two years ago and is an AI and natural language understanding-based workforce solution. Borca is Parlo's most advanced natural language and AI-powered virtual agent solution that helps create better experiences for enterprise employees by making machine interactions more conversational. ServiceNow plans to integrate Parlo's technology across its entire suite of services on the Now Platform as well.ServiceNow is clearly focusing its efforts on AI to drive the next round of innovations. But it's not the only player counting on AI to drive the next level of growth. Competitors like Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) and Freshdesk (now Freshworks) too have their versions of Chatbots that attempt to offer personalized experiences for customers using machine learning and AI tools.I would like to know from the users about their experience with AI and natural language tools as customers of the service. Do Chatbots understand you and deliver the service you are looking for? Have Chatbots helped reduce your organization's spend and improved customer experience at the same time?The stock is currently trading at $170.21 with a market cap of $30.3 billion. It had touched a 52-week high of $206.30 in September this year. The stock has climbed from the 52-week low of $112.84 that it was trading at in December last year."

Shares of the Software-as-a-Service leader are trading near all-time highs on the back of explosive financial performance from the company.Source: KoyfinLet's take a look at the main return drivers for ServiceNow's stock and what the company has to offer in terms of potential returns going forward.ServiceNow is a market leader in the IT Service Management (ITSM) industry. The company has leveraged on its leadership in IT to expand into new areas such as human resources, security, legal, and finance in recent years.ServiceNow's solutions are characterized by being technologically advanced, flexible, and having a friendly user interface. Gartner has recognized ServiceNow as a leader in high-performance enterprise applications for the platform as a service on the basis of three key features:Among other recognitions, ServiceNow was named as the World's Most Innovative company by Forbes last year, and the company earned the Innovation of the Year award from the ITAM Review.Customer retention rates are outstanding, consistently near 98%. This is not only very important in terms of financial performance but also speaks well about the company's ability to drive value for its customers.Source: ServiceNow Investors relationsServiceNow is both gaining new customers and expanding its relationships with existing customers. New customers are planting the seeds for future growth opportunities, and more revenue from existing customers represents a major growth engine and a key source of profitability for the business.Source: ServiceNow Investors relationsRevenue growth has been nothing short of spectacular over the past decade, and the company reported $740 million in subscription revenue last quarter, representing a 40% increase in constant currency terms.Data by YChartsRevenues are growing at a faster rate than expenses, and ServiceNow is retaining an increasing share of revenue as free cash flow in recent years. The company announced in the most recent quarter that free cash flow represented a big 40% of sales during the period.Source: ServiceNow Investors relationsManagement calculates that the size of the total addressable market is worth nearly $110 billion today, and it's expected to reach $165 billion by 2023. ServiceNow is in a position of strength to profit from massive growth opportunities through both explosive revenue growth and expanding profitability in the years ahead.Fundamental momentum can be a powerful return driver for stocks. Current stock prices are reflecting a particular set of expectations about the future of a business. When analyzing the earnings numbers from a company, the market reaction to those numbers does not depend on the financial metrics in isolation, but on the numbers in comparison to previous expectations.In simple terms, if a company can consistently deliver better than expected earnings, this generally means that the stock price will need to rise in order to reflect increasing earnings expectations for the business.The table shows the expected earnings figures and the actual reported numbers for ServiceNow in the past four quarters. The company has an impeccable track record in terms of outperforming expectations.Source: Seeking Alpha The chart below shows how earnings expectations for ServiceNow in both the current fiscal year and next fiscal year have significantly increased over time. Like usually happens, earnings estimates and the stock price tend to move in the same direction.Data by YChartsServiceNow is an explosive growth business, and the company has consistently surpassed earnings expectations over the past several years. For this reason, current earnings are not really telling the whole story about the company's long-term cash flow generation capabilities.The fundamental value of the business ultimately depends on the cash flows that such a business is going to produce over the long term, and valuation should always be forward-looking.A discounted cash flow analysis necessarily carries a large margin of error, since it's practically impossible to make accurate predictions about free cash flow generation over the long term. However, the main idea is not reaching a precise estimate of the company's true intrinsic value, but rather assessing if the stock is reasonably priced or not based on conservative assumptions of cash generation over the years.The following discounted cash flow analysis is based on the following assumptions:Based on these assumptions, we can reach a fair value estimate of $289 per share for ServiceNow, which is 5% below the current market price of the stock.The average price target among the Wall Street analysts following the stock is $285 per share, and Cowen has recently issued a new price target of $295 per share for ServiceNow.The company will need to deliver strong performance in order to justify the current market price of the stock, but the discounted cash flow numbers are still assuming a considerable deceleration in growth over time.With revenue growth reaching 36% and free cash flow generation amounting to 40% of revenue last quarter, it's not unreasonable at all to say that the business is solid enough to meet or even exceed those expectations in the coming years.It's easy to understand that companies with strong financial performance, vigorous momentum, and reasonable valuations should deliver attractive returns over time. However, it's not easy to quantify all those variables together in order to analyze a stock from a multi-factor perspective.The PowerFactors system is a quantitative algorithm available to members in The Data-Driven Investor. This algorithm ranks companies in the market according to a combination of quantitative factors that includes: financial quality, valuation, fundamental momentum, and relative strength.In simple terms, the PowerFactors system is looking to buy good businesses (quality) for a reasonable price (valuation) when the company is doing well (fundamental momentum) and the stock is outperforming (relative strength).Data from S&P Global via Portfolio123The backtested performance data indicates that companies with a high PowerFactors ranking tend to deliver superior returns over the long term. This bodes well for ServiceNow, since the stock is in the top 3% of stocks in the US market with a PowerFactors ranking of 97.3 as of the time of this writing.Backtested performance does not guarantee future returns. The algorithm shows that a group of companies with strong quantitative metrics tend to outperform the market over the years. But this does not really say much about what kind of performance a particular company such as ServiceNow will deliver in a specific year such as 2019.That being acknowledged, the quantitative data shows that ServiceNow is well positioned for attractive returns when considering multiple quantitative drivers for the stock.With the stock trading near all-time highs in a volatile market environment, there is no reason to rush into building a position at current prices. Being patient and slowly building a position over time sounds like a more reasonable approach in terms of timing.That being said, ServiceNow is an outstanding growth business, driven by vigorous momentum and trading at valuation levels that are not unreasonable considering the company's long-term potential. This makes of ServiceNow an attractive growth business to consider buying on any pullback down the road."

What smaller startups are out there that it could benefit from?","According to researchers, the global IT Service Management applications market is expected to grow at nearly 10% annually to $2.8 billion by 2022 from $2.6 billion in 2017. ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is the leading vendor in the market followed by Atlassian Software (NASDAQ:TEAM). ServiceNow's market share is estimated to have grown 42% in 2017.ServiceNow recently reported an impressive first quarter. Revenues for the quarter grew 30% over the year to $715.4 million but missed the market's expectations of $717.8 million. It ended the quarter with a net income of $7 million, compared with a net loss of $17.3 million reported a year ago. Adjusted diluted EPS came in at $0.77, significantly ahead of the market's forecast of $0.64 for the quarter. Earnings also offered an impressive growth over previous year's EPS of $0.43. This was the fourth consecutive quarter that the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates.By segment, subscription revenues, adjusted for constant currency, grew 35% to $673.6 million, ahead of the management's guided range of $664-$669 million. On an adjusted basis, professional services and other revenues grew 2% to $50.1 million.Total billings grew 39% over the year to $1.02 billion. This was the first quarter ever that ServiceNow exceeded the billion-dollar mark for its billings. Non-GAAP adjusted subscription billings grew 39% to $958.9 million and Professional services and other billings grew 30% to $61.9 million.ServiceNow ended the year with revenues growing 35% over the year to $2.6 billion with an EPS of $2.49.For the current quarter, ServiceNow forecasts subscription billings of $736-$741 million. It expects its subscription revenues to come in at $3.256-$3.276 billion for the quarter. The market is looking for revenues of $762.92 million in total revenues with an EPS of $0.67 for the current quarter and revenues of $3.36 billion with an EPS of $3.11 for the current fiscal year. ServiceNow is targeting revenues of more than $4 billion by the year 2020.Over the past few years, ServiceNow has been diversifying from being a pure IT Service management vendor to an enterprise-wide software service provider. Those efforts are paying off. Both its HR and customer service products now have more than 20 customers doing more than $1 million. Nineteen of its top 20 deals in the quarter now bill for three or more products. ServiceNow believes that it's able to deliver this growth by continuously innovating its product lineup that focuses on improving user experience and user interface, creating simple, intuitive mobile experiences, and making its platform and product easier to deploy and upgrade. The focus for ServiceNow this year is improving its mobile capabilities and user experience. It wants to help organizations manage the nearly 30%-40% of an employee's workday that is squandered on administrative, redundant, and low-value tasks.To help with these goals, the company made a few small acquisitions last year. Some of them include San Francisco-based FriendlyData that provides a natural language interface for databases. FriendlyData was privately held and had raised a modest $280,000 in funding from investors prior to the acquisition. It had also acquired Parlo, a Sunnyvale-based vendor of an AI and natural language understanding based workforce solution. Prior to the acquisition, Parlo had raised $3.1 million. Last year, it also acquired VendorHawk, the provider of cloud-based application that centralizes cost implications and enables users to make smarter decisions about SaaS and software vendors. VendorHawk had raised $1.3 million in funding prior to the acquisition. Terms of these acquisitions have not been disclosed.ServiceNow has been carefully building its capabilities through the addition of bootstrapped or smaller, capital-efficient startups. It's a move that appears to have stood it in good stride so far. What other similar technologies or capabilities should ServiceNow be looking to acquire? What smaller startups are out there that it could benefit from?Its stock is currently trading at $225.14 with a market cap of $40.4 billion. It had touched a record high of $228.41 earlier this week soon after the result announcement. The stock has climbed from the year low of $137.60 that it was trading at a year ago. ServiceNow's stock has delivered stellar gains over the last three years. It has tripled in value since January 2016. Analysts estimate the growth to continue as some predict that it will cross the $10 billion revenue mark by 2025."
4238669,104855,2019-02-06T13:56:11-05:00,ServiceNow released strong Q4 results and Q1 '19/full-year 2019 guidance.Management is excited about bringing mobile to the enterprise market in 2019.The stock is trading at a premium forward PE multiple compared to the average of SaaS companies.,"ServiceNow Inc. (NOW) delivered an exceptional Q4 '18 and fiscal year 2018 results beating the top-line analysts' estimates by a wide margin. Following the strongest fourth-quarter results ever, the stock price reached an intra-day all-time high of $228.40 on January 31, 2019. The management is confident about the strong momentum in 2019, driven by IT digital transformation and a healthy demand across major segments and geographies. Mobile entering the enterprise market and strong market demand for the emerging SecOps and Intelligent Apps products offer the strongest growth opportunities in 2019.The CEO John Donahoe stated:Source: Investor Presentation, January 2019The company reported total adjusted non-GAAP revenues of $723.7 million in Q4 '18 or up 32% Y/Y, beating the analysts' estimates of $717.7 million. Adjusted non-GAAP subscription revenue was $673.6 million for Q4 '18 or up 35% Y/Y, and the reason for an increase was primarily because of the strong demand for all products across major geographies with exceptional growth in EMEA region. The company has invested a lot in the new sales leadership team in Europe over the last several years and expects a continued pay off in 2019-2020. Adjusted non-GAAP subscription billings were $1,020.7 million for the Q4 '18 or up 39% Y/Y, making the total billings over $1 billion for the first time in history.Source: Investor Presentation, January 2019IT digital transformation is a key catalyst and growth driver at the moment. ServiceNow serves now almost 75% of Fortune 500 companies as major corporations are looking for solutions to improve their productivity. The company helps them to automate their workflows, reduce the number of redundant daily tasks and improves their cross-functional support across the enterprise. Therefore, ServiceNow landed on average 20 new customers on a quarterly basis over the past couple of years. Top line Q4 '18 performance was driven by 51 new transactions over $1 million. 6 out of 51 were net new customer transactions while 45 were extensions of existing customer relationships. The company reported the total of 678 customers with over $1M in net new ACV in Q4 '18 or up 33.4% Y/Y. However, in a subscription-based business model, landing of new customers isn’t sufficient enough without a strong upsell and cross-sell opportunities of the existing customer base.Source: Investor Presentation, January 2019ServiceNow has a strong upsell momentum and an important business metric average ACV per G2K customer (“ACV/G2K”) ratio was up 10% Q/Q in Q4 '18. Another important metric renewal rate is consistently over 97% over the last several quarters.CEO John Donahoe emphasized land-and-expand strategy during the most recent earnings call:Donahoe is especially excited about bringing mobile to the enterprise market in 2019. For example, a worker is doing an important project on a corporate laptop and it suddenly stops working. He can then take a picture with the ServiceNow mobile app and its algorithm that is using advanced image recognition capabilities identifies the laptop and offers a solution. That way workers can solve redundant administrative tasks with only 2 clicks and spend more time serving their customers. I also believe that mobile will enhance customer engagement and that will lead to significant upsell and cross-sell opportunities.Source: Investor Presentation, January 2019According to the figure above, the majority of customers in the new top 20 deals decided for core IT products like ITOM (15 out of 20) and ITSM (16 out of 20). The management sees a strong growth opportunity and a healthy market demand for emerging products like Security Operations and Intelligent Apps. 9 out of 20 customers who conducted new top deals decided for both emerging products. The company doesn’t plan to compete in a highly fragmented cyber security market, but does see plenty of demand for GRC government risk and compliance. Market demand is strong across the entire portfolio product as 15 out of top 20 new deals included 5+ products and only 1 deal included 1-2 products. That clearly reflects what a strong brand image and a compelling customer value proposition ServiceNow has on the market. I expect this robust momentum growth to remain over the next several quarters.The company reported GAAP subscription gross margin of 83% or up 100 bps Y/Y. Non-GAAP operating margin and free cash flow margin in Q4 '18 was 21% or up 100 bps Y/Y and 34% or up 700 bps Y/Y, respectively. Given the strong revenue growth and improved DSOs, the company continues to drive operating leverage expansion. I believe as it scales in size it will be able to drive even higher operating leverage than 200 bps Y/Y over the next several fiscal years.Source: Investor Presentation, January 2019The company reported Q4 '18 non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $145.6 million and $0.77, respectively, beating the analysts’ consensus EPS estimate of $0.64 and up 120% compared to Q4 17 numbers. It is a big question, how will the partial federal government shutdown affect its business performance in FY19. Donahoe stated that Q3 FY19 results will show a total impact of the federal shutdown.Following statement was his answer on the analyst’s question about the federal shutdown:The company didn’t report its full income, balance sheet and cash flow statements in the most recent quarterly release, therefore investors must wait for the upcoming 10-K filing later in this month.Source: Finviz, February 2019Following the strong upbeat earnings results, the stock price surged 13.4% on January 31, 2019. If we take a look at technical analysis, an ascending triangle pattern clearly shows that the market was biased towards stronger earnings reports. Another bullish pattern was an SMA 50/200 crossover at the beginning of 2019. In my opinion, as long as bullish momentum persists, the stock will continue to test new highs before the next quarterly earnings announcement in May 2019. The current 50 SMA and 200 SMA are both at $180 level or 23% below the current stock price that reflects a very strong momentum. In the case ServiceNow reports unexpected bad news or there is a strong correction in the U.S. technology sector, the stock price can first drop to the previous resistance level of $195 and then maybe even to $180.Data by YChartsBefore the major U.S. stock market correction in October 2018, the stock was trading at forward PE multiple of 80. Even though the stock is recently testing new all-time record highs above $220, it is trading at a lower forward PE multiple of ~ 72. Given the stock’s strong momentum, that makes a 10% upside potential or a price target of $250. However, compared to SaaS average forward PE of 20-25, the stock is trading at an excessive premium compared to its peers. In the case ServiceNow reports lower than expected Q1 FY19 earnings results or provides weak guidance, the stock price can drop 20-30% in a short period of time.Source: Press Release, January 2019ServiceNow provided very strong guidance for Q1 FY19 and full year fiscal 2019. The guidance well-exceeded analysts’ expectations which was an additional fuel to the stock price increase post earnings release. The company expects the following:The management also provided a strong outlook for the full-year 2019 subscription gross margin, operating margin and free cash flow margin of 86% or up 300 bps Y/Y, 21% or up 100 bps Y/Y, and 28% or flat Y/Y, respectively.The stock price is breaking record highs following the outstanding Q4 '18 results and investors are looking for a continuation in the subscription revenue and earnings growth trend. The stock is trading at the moment at hefty forward P/E and EV/FCF multiples, therefore any major negative press release represents a high downside risk. Major corporations are investing a lot to modernize their IT systems, therefore, ServiceNow is well positioned to land new clients and upsell & cross-sell emerging products to the existing customer base. Based on my valuation analysis, I see the upside potential of 10% to $250 and downside potential of 20% to $180 over the next couple of months. However, if the company maintains its very strong subscription revenue growth combined with improved margin expansion, then it can still be a solid investment for investors with higher risk appetite."
4203589,21523,2018-09-01T16:55:00-04:00,"ServiceNow offers cloud-based service portal, categorization, routing, and assignment software for IT, HR, and customer-facing service departments.The business model has several highly attractive characteristics.The stock, while pricey by traditional metrics, actually appears reasonably priced at present.","While it's not the most glamorous thing in the world, all businesses - particularly large scale enterprises - need efficient service operations.What if an employee's computer won't boot up? What if someone needs a new monitor? What if an associate requires access to a software system? These are just a very small subset of potential IT-related problems employees face every day. Reporting, tracking, managing, and resolving these requests can be a complex process that frequently frustrates both employee (""why is this taking so long?!"") and IT manager (""don't they know the process for reporting these?!"").Of course, IT is just one - albeit the most prevalent - department where service requests are routed. Human Resources departments have to manage employee requests and questions every day: ""How do I change my tax withholding?""... ""There was an error in my paycheck!""... ""Where do I go to check my 401(K)?""... and so forth.Similar service management is needed for customers, too. Requests come in daily for warranty issues, product information requests, billing info updates, etc.Historically to solve these issues, enterprises have come up with all kinds of systems, most of them specific to certain areas with little to no integration into a single whole. For example, to request new hardware, you may have to use one system vs. a completely different system to request software access permissions. Not only is this frustrating and confusing for users, but it saps productivity and efficiency from organizations as a whole.Over the past decade, one company has stepped into this void and made a huge impact. Let's take a closer look at ServiceNow (NOW).ServiceNow offers enterprises an integrated, cloud-delivered platform-as-a-service (PaaS) that allows them to design service processes from a top-down perspective, integrating a lot of formerly separated tasks.The company's software was initially focused on IT. ServiceNow offers a consumer-like help desk experience, allowing requesters to easily request new services, report problems and incidents, etc. On the back end, it performs automated categorization of requests, routing to the appropriate department, and assignment of work to facilitate a faster solution.This is the best of both worlds. It offers the employee with a problem a one-stop place to go to report that problem, while also automatically handling the management work of finding the right department and people to solve the issue.The platform can do a lot of other things, as well. For example, ServiceNow provides asset and cost management, allowing a firm to catalog every IT asset (computer, laptop, monitor, server, etc.) it owns, monitoring the health, current configuration, and update status of said asset. It also provides a wealth of dashboard and reporting tools for high-level views of service organization performance, as well as software APIs for companies to develop their own applications off of the ServiceNow platform.IT continues to be ServiceNow's bread and butter, accounting for about two thirds (66%) of revenues. But the firm also has seen much success pushing its platform into other departments of the enterprise. Three departments in particular - Human Resources, Security, and Customer Service - are natural service-heavy organizations to expand into. These three areas - lumped into ""Emerging Products"" - already account for close to 30% of revenues.In general, there are three business model characteristics that identify excellent, long-term investment opportunities. So how does ServiceNow stack up on each one?So there you have it. A growing recurring revenue base combined with very high switching costs for existing customers makes for a fantastic business model. Its cash flows are highly predictable, allowing management to aggressively invest for growth, and protecting the firm against economic swings. ServiceNow has outstanding business characteristics.Many numbers-oriented investors will naturally ask: ""What about the profits?""Well, to be frank, there are none. ServiceNow has been GAAP unprofitable for virtually its entire history as a public company, and remains so to this day.That can't be good, right?I'm not too concerned with it. Far more important are cash flows, and here ServiceNow comes out in good shape, with nearly $600 million in free cash flow over the past 12 months, a 25% margin on revenues. In fact, the firm has been free cash flow positive for the last five years. This is because it must recognize subscription contract payments as revenue rated over the contract duration, but it receives the cash up front. This phenomenon can be seen on the deferred revenue line, where deferred revenues have grown from $252 million in 2013 to an impressive $1.3 billion today. From a cash perspective, ServiceNow is quite profitable already.Also, most of the firm's operating costs are marketing - almost 50% of revenues. This makes sense given the huge addressable market and emerging competition in the space. Given the high switching costs once a client is on board, management is in a ""land grab"" scenario, where it's spending now to grab (and keep) customers while there's opportunity to. Over time, I expect marketing to ease down to a more industry standard 15%-20% rate.As for the balance sheet, it looks fine. There's nearly $2 billion in cash and equivalents vs. $860 million in debt, and current ratio is in very safe territory at about 1.3. Remember, this is a very predictable business, so it makes sense for management to aggressively finance growth at this stage.ServiceNow's main competition from a ""full-suite,"" cloud-based perspective is probably Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Service Center System Manager (or SCSM). SCSM is mainly geared toward IT service management, so it competes directly with ServiceNow's bread and butter. There's also legacy competition from on-site software, notably BMC's Remedy suite. However, ServiceNow has eaten much of BMC's market share over the past six years. ServiceNow has raised its market share from 10% in 2011 to over 40% today.That said, there are fairly low barriers to entry, and many large software companies have entered into portions of it. Some examples here include IBM (NYSE:IBM) and CA (NASDAQ:CA) in IT service management, AppDynamics (owned by Cisco (CSCO)) or Splunk (SPLK) in dashboarding, and Zendesk (ZEN) in the customer service vertical... among others.Despite the competition, ServiceNow's rapid growth, success in up-selling, and incredible customer retention point to a superior product that its customers value. This gives the firm a leg up in winning new business, and we've already established how high switching costs protect those sales against the competition after it's won.Obviously, with a lack of GAAP profits valuing ServiceNow on a P/E (or any earnings) basis doesn't make much sense.However, I think we can make a few assumptions here. There are a few key factors we can look at: Revenue and revenue growth rates (obviously), gross margins, marketing spend, and free cash flow.Revenue run rate for 2018 is about $2.6 billion, about 34% up on 2017. Analysts generally see about 29% revenue growth for next year, putting us at about $3.34 billion. From there, revenue growth is forecast to continue growing at solid 20%-25% annual rates at least for five years.ServiceNow's gross margin is roughly 76%. This sector (business SaaS) generally runs anywhere from 75-85% gross margins, so the company probably has a few points of upside here. Currently, marketing spend is 48% of sales. As we mentioned earlier, this makes sense given the greenfield opportunity, but I believe longer term this settles into more of a 20%-25% figure (similar to someone like Cisco or Microsoft). Even at current spend levels, ServiceNow is generating an impressive 25% free cash flow margin. At more nominal marketing spend levels, this could easily reach ""Microsoft-ian"" levels in the mid-30s.Given these relatively reasonable assumptions, let's calculate a nominal-spend 2019 free cash flow rate of ($3,340 * 0.30) = $1.0 billion. The firm's $32 billion market cap today would be a clean 32x multiple on that free cash run rate. That's only about 1x the revenue growth rate here - well below the general rule of thumb that an earnings/cash flow multiple should not exceed 2x the growth rate.So, at the end of the day, a good case can be made that ServiceNow is reasonably priced right now - perhaps even a bit under priced.SaaS is an epic shift in the way software is developed and distributed, and those of us that missed the 90s enterprise software boom have another opportunity to catch this wave. ServiceNow looks like an excellent choice within this mega trend, offering highly recurring and rapidly growing revenues, very sticky product offerings, and even a reasonable valuation."

I made a lot of observations during my travels that I believe can be very helpful to investors. s.There is still only one asset class that is working in the markets. I am not an asset allocator, Instead, I have been parked on this asset class all year long, looking to pull up as many winners as I can until the fish move once again.I looked at thousands of charts during the week. There are a lot of strong stocks right now, but this is the best growth story that I found all week.Cloud service provider Box (BOX) traded down almost 10% on August 29th after reporting an earnings beat and record revenue but delivering disappointing forward guidance. This sent many other cloud software-as-a-service or SaaS companies to sell off in sympathy.But one of my favorite names in the space, ServiceNow (NOW), whose enterprise software integrates with Box, remains on an upward tear after posting blow-out Q2 results. The stock is up more than 52%, YTD.ServiceNow is a cloud computing company headquartered in Santa Clara, CA. It was founded in 2004 by Fred Luddy, the previous CTO of Peregrine Systems and Remedy Corp based in San Diego.ServiceNow became a public company in 2012, debuting with a $210 million IPO. Shortly after going public, the company relocated from San Diego to Silicon Valley.The ServiceNow platform offers enterprise customers an integrated cloud-based solution that simplifies enterprise workflows by automating, predicting, digitizing and optimizing business processes and tasks such as IT, Customer Service, Security Operation, and Human Resources.The company’s mantra is “We make the world of work, work better for people.” Contrasting Box’s results, ServiceNow’s quarterly results were stellar. The cloud is not dead, it is just floating in another direction. ServiceNow beat and raised their guidance.The company’s focus on enabling digital transformation in the workplace is driving revenue growth, with the company likely to finish the year with $2.8 billion in sales. Q2 revenue jumped 45% to $631 million thanks to an expanded portfolio of offerings which is being well-received.Some highlights from the company’s recent Q2 earnings results:*In Q2, ServiceNow closed 28 deals with annual contract values of more than $1 million, up 47% over last year’s Q2 results;*Close to half of those million-dollar-plus customers are based outside the U.S.;*ServiceNow has 575 customers generating more than $1 million in annual revenue;*The company has doubled the number of customers doing more than $5 million in annual revenue, a number that now stands at 58; *It has one customer doing $25 million in annual revenue.Digital transformation is more than a “buzzword”, it is becoming a central priority for companies and C-Suite execs around the globe. And ServiceNow has become a strategic partner of choice to help enable companies digitally transform their enterprise.So how do the small SaaS vendors such as ServiceNow compete with tech behemoths? They remain hyper-focused on customer success. The company’s offerings boost productivity and allow resources to be optimized by using machine learning and other tools to automate processes and generate cost-savings and increased efficiency.Looking at former Oracle CCO Bob Evans’ Cloud Wars Newsletter, which each week releases a Cloud Wars Top 10 Ranking, ServiceNow is ranked #7. As you can see, ServiceNow has quietly become a major player in the cloud wars. Earnings growth over the last five years has averaged a meteoric 190% per year.Data from Marketsmith.comFrom a standing start back in 2012, the company is projected to earn $2.33 per share this year and $3.13 per share next year.Furthermore, the company is expected to continue growing its earnings at a 26% CAGR over the next 5 years. From these projections, I am able to currently establish a 5-year target price of $335 per share. The stock closed at $196.36 on Friday.While this is not currently the most undervalued stock around, 190% growers do not come cheaply!Data from www.BestStocksNowApp.comI purchased this stock in my Ultra-Growth portfolio back in October of last year. That position is up over 64% since then. I made a new purchase of the stock this past week in my Premier Growth portfolio, as I believe there is still plenty of upside potential from here.My Best Stocks Now methodology combines valuation with momentum. Let’s have a look at how the stock has done on this front.Data from www.BestStocksNowApp.comAs you can see, the stock has put up some big return numbers over the last 1, 3, and 5 years.

However, the company's revenue outlook for the third quarter was below analyst estimates.Revenues for the second quarter of the year grew 41% over the year to $631.1 million, ahead of the market's expectations of $618.3 million. Net loss was $52.7 million or $0.30 per share. Adjusted EPS of $0.49 was up 121% and beat analyst estimates of $0.43 for the quarter.By segment, revenues from subscriptions grew 45% over the year to $585.3 million and professional services revenues were flat at $45.8 million. Subscription billings grew 36% to $616.9 million.The strong performance in the quarter was driven by 28 deals with net new average contract value of more than $1 million. ServiceNow has 575 customers with annual contract values of $1 million.For the third quarter, ServiceNow projected subscription revenues of $610 -$615 million and subscription billings of $648-$653 million compared with the market's projections of $674 million. It expects to end the current year with subscription revenues of $2.4 -$2.41 billion.ServiceNow continues to leverage the unprecedented opportunity that the SaaS companies have today and make acquisitions within the SaaS space. This year, it already announced two acquisitions.Last quarter, ServiceNow announced the acquisition of Seattle-based VendorHawk for an undisclosed sum. VendorHawk is a SaaS player whose cloud systems help customers discover, rationalize, and optimize SaaS subscriptions across their organization. It supports its customers by helping them manage spending on more than 36,000 SaaS applications and mapping redundant applications for them. It analyzes application utilization and optimizes SaaS subscriptions for top applications such as Salesforce, Box, and Google G Suite.ServiceNow plans to leverage VendorHawk's capabilities to strengthen its Software Asset Management offering. It will integrate VendorHawk within the Now Platform and offer it as part of a ServiceNow Software Asset Management release in 2019. VendorHawk's financials are not widely known. Prior to the acquisition, it had raised seed funding of $1.3 million.ServiceNow's intelligent automation capabilities help improve agent-employee and customer interactions with more human-like conversations, drive complex actions to resolution quickly thorough intelligent agents, automate filling out forms and prioritizing service tickets, and make it faster and easier for partners and customers to develop intelligent apps using the Now Platform.During the second quarter in May, ServiceNow announced its plans to acquire Parlo to expand its AI capabilities. Silicon Valley-based Parlo is an AI platform that trains algorithms for conversational machines. Financial details of the deal were not disclosed. ServiceNow will integrate Parlo's natural language understanding technology called Broca into its Now platform for business process automation. Broca will enable the Now platform to understand the nuances of conversational language. Parlo's financials are not widely known. Prior to the acquisition, it had received a seed funding of $3.1 million.Its stock is currently trading at $180.88 with a market cap of $31.6 billion. It had touched a 52-week high of $194.81 last month before its results. It hit a 52-week low of $103 in August last year."
4238245,103231,2019-02-05T13:48:22-05:00,"The recent profitability of ServiceNow has become an additional argument to its growth story, making it a better option now.As margins expand in the long term, ServiceNow’s price will show a more reasonable value for GARP investors.Although ServiceNow continues to be a company trading at a high premium, it has slight advantages over its Workday and Atlassian peers.","After reporting the fourth quarter of 2018, ServiceNow Inc. (NYSE: NOW) saw a rapid appreciation in its market value after showing better results than expected. Despite being a company with a high valuation within the application software industry, an analyst in Goldman Sachs (paywalled) initiated its coverage with a buy rating and a price target of $260.Like other companies that offer software and applications in the cloud, ServiceNow has generated high expectations of growth coming from the digital transformation of IT systems. On the other hand, after a comparative analysis, we see that the company's business model offers slight advantages over peer companies that make it a little more attractive, especially in the medium and long term.The strong momentum from its digital transformation products continues to keep revenues in a strong growth spurt. For its last quarter of 2018, ServiceNow reported that its subscription revenues increased 33% compared to last year, surpassing analysts' expectations, and positioning it at $666 million. For its part, revenue for the quarter was $715.44 million, growing 27% thanks to the expansion in services offered to customers.Data by YChartsWe see that its offer based on the cloud has a solid competitive advantage given the nature of ServiceNow’s IT services, which have allowed the cross-selling and expansion of services in its customer base. Its strategy of creating long-term relationships with organizations, which have allowed unlocking opportunities in IT services, has kept ServiceNow in a strong secular trend. Executives remarked that by the end of 2018 their renewal rate was 98%, placing the company as a leader in customer retention within the industry.We consider services such as IT Service Management (ITSM) and IT Operations Management (ITOM) as having strong competitive advantages given the high switch cost of these services from other companies, which gives greater long-term strength to the revenues. In addition to this, we believe that diversification towards emerging opportunities such as customer service, human resources, and security will allow the company to unlock new sources of growth over time.At the moment, it seems that revenues will continue their current streak despite fears of a slowdown by some analysts. For fiscal year 2019, subscription revenues are expected to reach $3.2 billion, which would represent 34% growth compared to 2018.Source: Data provided by Ycharts.Comparing the growth of ServiceNow with that of the industry, we see that the company's revenues have increased at a rate similar to that of its peers Workday Inc. (NYSE: WDAY) and Atlassian Corp. (NASDAQ: TEAM), making them more suitable for a comparative analysis.We see that these companies have been characterized by a lack of positive net profit as they invest large amounts of money in sales and marketing strategies, as well as innovation and development, to maintain their current growth. Despite this operating leverage, we see that the management of ServiceNow and Atlassian have managed to grow the free cash flow steadily, making them a little more attractive compared to Workday.Data by YChartsIn relative terms, although ServiceNow has seen a slowdown in its revenue growth in recent years, the company still ranks among the fastest growing in the application software industry. We believe that this slowdown is common in this type of company, especially as the company approaches $1 billion in quarterly revenue.Another quality that makes ServiceNow a bit more attractive compared to its peers, comes from the recent operating profits that the company has presented over the last couple of quarters. This profitability is largely due to the expense discipline that management has implemented, and to higher contracts value, resulting in an expansion of margins.Sales and marketing expenses continue to represent the largest cash outflow of the company, which is directly associated with the large number of personnel in this department. By the end of 2018, the company reported that this area had 3,061 employees, representing 37.5% of all its headcount. Expenses such as salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for the entire year totaled $1.2 billion, or 46% of total revenues.Another factor that weighs on ServiceNow's operating leverage comes from research and development expenses; although comparatively speaking, these expenses are lower than that of its peers. For the last quarter of the year, the company destined 21% of its revenues to R&D compared to 42% for Workday and 44% for Atlassian. The management innovation strategy has been executed through organic innovation and small acquisitions such as Digital Telepathy, SkyGiraffe, VendorHawk, and Parlo, which have all strengthened both ServiceNow’s IT products and emerging products.Data by YChartsWe see that ServiceNow's cost discipline comes mostly from controlling its most important cash outflow. In the last five quarters, management has maintained similar cash outflows in S&M despite the increase in revenues. We attribute this to their strategy of expanding and extending its services within their current clients, which not only provides growth on the top line, but also offers better margins as they reach economy of scale.In addition to this, the expansion of its gross margin has allowed the company to gradually report operating profits. This has allowed net profit to enter positive territory in the last couple of quarters after years of losses.Source: Data provided by Ycharts.On the balance sheet side, we see that both ServiceNow and Workday have lower leverage levels than Atlassian. This is a quality that we consider attractive, especially in the face of a scenario of increased interest rates or the possibility of a contraction in liquidity.In the case of ServiceNow, we see that most of the long-term debt comes from convertible notes due in 2022. In comparison, the company holds $704 million in cash and cash equivalents, plus $922 million in short-term investments, so we do not see a solvency problem in the future.Source: Data provided by Ycharts.Although the three companies present a convincing growth argument, we believe that both ServiceNow and Atlassian hold a slight edge over Workday, from a fundamental point of view. On the other hand, we believe that this discreet advantage for these two companies has been reflected in a slightly higher premium compared to the entire industry.In the case of ServiceNow, the price to book ratio suggests that the company's shares are positioned at the highest end of the entire industry, which leaves little margin for error, even for investors with little risk aversion.Source: Data provided by Ycharts.Looking back, we see that ServiceNow has been characterized by having high multiples compared to the rest of the industry. This high premium could be justified as the company has become the largest provider of ITSM in the market, despite competing with more established companies. With this in mind, we believe that ServiceNow's business model is quite solid, which will allow revenues to grow in the 25% range in the long term.We hope that as the company becomes more profitable in the short term, the price of the shares will be more attractive compared to their peers, as their forward ratios suggest. We believe that this will attract new investors looking for a more reasonable entry point and a better price compared to its fundamentals."
4213482,20715,2018-10-23T12:54:40-04:00,"The enterprise software company reports earnings Wednesday after the closing bell.The stock has gained 275% since its 2016 low.Analysts love the stock, but short sellers are pessimistic toward it.","Software provider ServiceNow (NOW) has been a top performing stock in the last couple of years. The company provides enterprise cloud computing software that helps clients define, structure, manage and automate services.The Santa Clara-based company is the number one ranked stock in the software enterprise group by Investor’s Business Daily. When the company releases earnings after the close on Wednesday, investors want to know if it is maintaining its pace of growth.Over the last three years, ServiceNow has averaged earnings growth of 108% per year while sales grew by 39% per year. In the last earnings report, earnings grew by 123% and sales grew by 41%. Analysts are predicting earnings growth of 75% for 2018 as a whole and sales growth of 34.3%.The company shows a current return on equity of 46.8% and a profit margin of 17.7%.ServiceNow is a growth company and that leads to a few negatives on the stock. The current P/E ratio is one concern, at 100. Another small concern is the $857 million in debt. The company currently has over $1.76 billion in cash and equivalents, which explains why the debt isn’t a bigger concern.Analysts expect the company to earn $0.60 on revenue of $657.7 million. The consensus estimate on the EPS is up a penny over the last 30 days. The revenue estimate is 32.3% higher than the revenue from the third quarter of 2017. The revenue growth has been a key factor in how the stock has performed in recent years.NOW Gained Almost 350% in Two and a Half YearsWhile the company has been growing sales and earnings, the stock has been rising at an incredible pace. From February of 2016 through the high in September, ServiceNow’s stock price gained just shy of 350%. The stock has slumped in the last couple of months, but it is still above its long-term moving averages.We see on the weekly chart that the recent pullback has only trimmed about 16% off the stock price and the 52-week moving average is still approximately 7% below the current trading price.One positive to the recent pullback is that it has brought the 10-week RIS down below the 50 level for the first time since April 2017, and it reached its lowest level since late 2016. The stock was hovering between $70 and $80 at that time.The weekly stochastic readings moved out of overbought territory on this latest pullback and they are reaching their lowest levels since December ’16. Once the stochastic readings made a bullish crossover back then, the stock was off to the races.Analysts Love ServiceNow, But Short Sellers are PessimisticLooking at the sentiment toward ServiceNow we see mixed signals from the different groups. There are 34 analysts covering the stock and 30 of them have the stock rated as a “buy” and the remaining four rate the stock as a “hold”. That is one of the most optimistic groupings I have seen recently, but given the company and the stock’s performance it isn’t surprising.One indicator that is surprising is the short interest ratio. The ratio stands at 4.84 currently and that is actually down from a reading of 5.53 in mid-September. That is surprisingly high for a stock that has been steadily climbing and for a company displaying the growth that ServiceNow has shown.Option traders aren’t showing as much pessimism as short sellers, but the put/call ratio is skewed to the pessimistic side. There are currently 21,510 puts open and 26,016 calls open, putting the put/call ratio at 0.827. The put/call ratio is a little higher than it was on July 25 when the company last reported earnings. I would have expected a lower put/call ratio given how well the company and stock have performed.What I Expect from EarningsI think ServiceNow’s pullback in the last few months is a buying opportunity. The company’s earnings and sales growth are very attractive and the short interest ratio makes me think the rally is far from over.Looking at the past earnings results, the company has beaten estimates in three of the last four quarterly reports, but the reactions haven’t been positive each time they beat. The company beat in July and the stock moved up 4.6% the day after earnings, but then dropped 8.5% in the next three days. In April the company beat estimates by a wide margin—$0.56 actual vs. $0.37 estimate. The stock did move up over 12% in the next two weeks.Even when the company missed in January, the stock didn’t react all that violently. It was considerably more volatile, but that was right when the market was dropping sharply.ServiceNow has an impressive global client list and a diversified product roster. This insulates the company from slumping growth in certain segments and from the global trade disputes that have affected many tech companies.Given the way ServiceNow has had rather muted reactions to its earnings reports in the past, even when they missed estimates, I think you can buy the stock before earnings and not have to worry too much. I think the odds of a move higher are greater than a move lower after earnings.If you are more risk averse and would like to wait for a signal that the pullback is over, you could use a bullish crossover from the stochastic readings as the trigger point on a bullish trade.However you decide to play ServiceNow, I look for the stock to move significantly higher in the coming months."
4190335,103480,2018-07-26T06:32:56-04:00,"ServiceNow continued a trend of recent outperformance with its Q2 earnings release, beating on both the top and bottom line.Revenues accelerated 4 points to 41% y/y growth this quarter.However, the lack of a meaningful raise to ServiceNow's guidance range makes this quarter a bit less exciting.ServiceNow's double-digit revenue multiple, as well as a consistently high valuation, makes it difficult to support a bullish case for this company.","So far, the Q2 earnings season has proven to us that there is no such thing as invincible names among the high-flying tech stalwarts. Both Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB) have suffered harrowing falls after reporting their results; last quarter, software favorites Workday (WDAY) and Red Hat (RHT) also saw plummeting stock prices after releasing Q1 results. The recent series of upsets has investors wondering: is this going to be the big reset year for the perpetually high technology sector?Among the fall of these giants, however, ServiceNow (NOW) has consistently stood tall. The dominant vendor of IT service desk software has continued its rapid growth trend yet again this quarter; even as it approaches a ~$3 billion revenue run rate, it still managed to post a four-point acceleration to revenue growth to exit the quarter at a >40% y/y growth rate. We can't underplay this accomplishment - ServiceNow and its management team certainly deserve kudos for driving the business so effectively.Yet I've always been extremely cautious on ServiceNow's stock, especially now that its valuation has soared through the roof amid a market environment that is incredibly sensitive to valuations and even the slightest of earnings misses. ServiceNow has been careful over the past few quarters never to raise its expectations too high (in fact, a tamely increased guidance range this quarter is one of the reason I don't think this Q2 release is that exciting), so it runs a lower risk of missing Wall Street estimates. Yet at what point will investors be unwilling to keep plowing money into ServiceNow's continually expanding valuation? Year to date, shares of ServiceNow have already jumped more than 40%, while the stock now sports the second-highest forward revenue valuation at 12.3x in the large-cap SaaS sector, second only to another perpetual high-flyer in Adobe Systems (ADBE).NOW data by YChartsNOW EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsWhile it's true that ServiceNow's growth is impressive, it won't be long before the company hits a deceleration curve. While there's nothing wrong with focusing on core strengths, ServiceNow's potential for category expansion seems rather limited - whereas a company like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) has the opportunity to dive into multiple areas within SaaS. ServiceNow has always traded at a valuation premium to Salesforce and other SaaS peers - and at the point where its growth rates begin to converge with the rest of the market, ServiceNow's massive premium will shrink. For sure, there's a lot to like about the business as it currently stands, but it's difficult to expect more than the same measured ""beat-and-raise"" cadence that ServiceNow has already trained investors to expect.ServiceNow isn't a bad company - in fact, as one of the first and largest pure-play SaaS companies, and one that's making noticeable progress to profitability especially in this quarter, ServiceNow is definitely a model company for smaller-cap software stocks as well as startups. However, there are simply better (and cheaper) SaaS stocks to invest in. I tend to favor fallen giants, so Red Hat and Workday seem like good picks here. ServiceNow, on the other hand, is more likely to trade flat. My price target on the stock is $163, implying 10x EV/FY18 revenues (roughly in line with where Workday fell post-Q1 earnings) and 12% downside from current levels.Here's a look at where ServiceNow's results landed in the second quarter:Figure 1. ServiceNow Q2 resultsSource: ServiceNow investor relationsAs previously mentioned, one of the major highlights of the quarter was the four-point acceleration in revenue growth, with revenues growing 41% y/y to $631.1 million versus just 37% y/y growth last quarter. Despite the company reaching such a tremendous scale (it's the fourth-largest pure-play SaaS company behind Adobe, Salesforce, and Workday), the fact that it can manage to pull off this level of acceleration is a testament to the strength of the underlying business. Analysts were not expecting it - Wall Street had penciled in a consensus revenue target of $618.5 million (+38% y/y), which ServiceNow squarely beat.Underpinning this growth was a jump in subscription revenues, which as a SaaS company is the mainstay of the company's business (professional services is actually performed at a loss, as seen in the financials above). Subscription revenues also saw acceleration to 45% y/y growth this quarter, up from 40% y/y last quarter. John Donahoe, ServiceNow's CEO, called out strong renewal rates of 98.5% as one of the major drivers behind the subscription growth.Also supporting revenue growth was an uptick in large deal activity, which always creates a buzz for enterprise software companies. The company reported 28 deals with an annual contract value (ACV) in excess of $1 million in the quarter, up 47% y/y; and now 575 of ServiceNow's customers are contracted for more than $1 million in annual contract value. Within these customers, 58 of them are in excess of $5 million, with the largest customer providing a revenue stream of $25 million per year, making full use of ServiceNow's IT and HR help products.Billings also saw strength in the quarter, rising 36% y/y to $617 million. I'll caution here, however, that as billings is a longer-term view of revenue growth, it tends to foreshadow and become a leading indicator of future growth rates. In other words, ServiceNow's jump to >40% revenue growth this quarter seems to be more of a one-tie incident, one that is unlikely to be sustained.Perhaps that's also why ServiceNow held in its guidance range to roughly where it was before. For the full year, the company is now guiding to subscription revenues of $2.405-24.15 billion, or 38-39% y/y growth. The midpoint of that growth range is just $2.5 million higher than a prior guidance range of $2.40-2.415 billion in revenues; in fact, the company just shaved off $5 million from the lower end of its guidance range without raising the top. With such a weak increase to guidance, can we really get all that excited about ServiceNow's growth acceleration in just a single quarter?Thankfully, the company made up for some of the guidance shortfall with improved profitability. GAAP operating losses slimmed down to -$32.0 million and representing a near-breakeven operating margin of -5.1%, 330bps better than -8.4% in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was the major driver here, rising 300bps to 75.7% due to a stronger subscription versus professional services mix in the quarter. The more that ServiceNow can support its revenue growth and customer acquisition while minimizing professional service needs, the better for the company's margin.On the earnings side, the company's pro forma EPS of $0.49 also handily beat analyst expectations of $0.43. One sour note for ServiceNow's bottom line metrics, however, is the fact that free cash flow saw compression in the quarter due to higher capex. Operating cash flows of $125.9 million in the quarter were relatively flat to last year, but after netting out $53.0 million of capex, free cash flow of $72.9 million declined more than -20% y/y from $92.8 million in the year-ago quarter.Going forward, I believe ServiceNow will have to lean toward its cash flow metrics to support its valuation, as its revenue metrics are getting somewhat out of hand. Though the company's top-line performance this quarter was impressive, investors could have used a bit more excitement in free cash flows. And given the fact that ServiceNow's current enterprise value of $30.6 billion trades at a 42.4x FY18 FCF multiple, based on an implied free cash flow guidance of $722 million for the year (subscription revenues of $2.405-2.415 billion, plus a ~10% contribution from professional services revenues implying total revenues of ~$2.675 billion, and applying the 27% free cash flow margin guidance that ServiceNow provided this quarter), free cash flow support is where the company needs to focus its attention.Overall, it seems that ServiceNow is firing on all cylinders on the growth front, so it's hard to be overly bearish on this name. The problem with ServiceNow has always been valuation, and in my view, there is limited upside for this stock when it's already riding at a ~12x revenue valuation."
4170141,20521,2018-05-04T18:54:08-04:00,"Earlier this quarter, ServiceNow announced the launch of an R&D center in Hyderabad, India.The new center is its first R&D operation in Asia and is capable of housing 1,000 employees.Will there be other moves for the company in India?","Cloud-based enterprise applications provider ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) recently announced first-quarter results. As usual, the company continued to outpace market expectations. In fact, given ServiceNow's performance, the company recently qualified as one of the ""cloud kings"" by analyst Jim Cramer. It has been one of my favorites as well.ServiceNow saw revenues grow 37% over the year to $589 million. Adjusted earnings also increased 81% over the year to $0.56 per share. The market was looking for revenues of $573 million and an EPS of $0.37 for the quarter.By segment, Subscription revenues grew 40% to $543.3 million. Professional services and other segment revenues grew 11% to $45.9 million.Total billings for the company grew 33% over the year to $689.4 million. Subscription billings grew 33% to $638.4 million, while Professional services and other billings grew 29% to $51 million.For the current quarter, it expects its non-GAAP subscription revenues adjusted for constant currency to grow to $548-$553 million. It expects subscription revenues for the year to be between $2.34-$2.35 billion. Earlier, it had forecast revenues of $2.31-$2.33 billion for the year. Non-GAAP subscription billings for the year are estimated to grow to $2.76-2.77 billion, ahead of the earlier forecast of $2.74-$2.76 billion.Last quarter, I had asked ServiceNow's board about its acquisition strategy. As expected, the company is leveraging the unprecedented opportunity that SaaS companies have today, and making acquisitions within the SaaS space.Continuing with its small acquisition strategy of last year, it recently announced the acquisition of Seattle-based VendorHawk for an undisclosed sum. VendorHawk is a SaaS player whose cloud systems help customers discover, rationalize, and optimize SaaS subscriptions across their organization. It supports its customers by helping them manage spending on more than 36,000 SaaS applications and mapping redundant applications for them. It analyzes application utilization and optimizes SaaS subscriptions for top applications such as Salesforce, Box, and Google G Suite.ServiceNow plans to leverage VendorHawk's capabilities to strengthen its Software Asset Management offering. It will integrate VendorHawk within the Now Platform and offer it as part of a ServiceNow Software Asset Management release in 2019. VendorHawk's financials are not widely known. Prior to the acquisition, it appears to have received seed funding of $1.3 million. This acquisition speaks to the strategy that many startups ought to follow: Get to product market-fit with small amounts of capital, and then seek early exits into the arms of larger firms looking to bring in good products to expand their TAM, up-sell into existing customers, so forth.Besides acquisitions, ServiceNow also is expanding offerings through tie-ups. It recently announced its partnership with Tenable, a cyber security player, to simplify and accelerate the way organizations understand, manage, and reduce cyber risk. Together, the two companies will help organizations in automatically assessing IT, cloud, and IoT assets for vulnerabilities and prioritize management of security issues to accelerate remediation.Earlier this quarter, ServiceNow also announced the launch of an R&D center in Hyderabad, India. The new center is its first R&D operation in Asia and is capable of housing 1,000 employees. ServiceNow plans to leverage the center to support regional and global clients with specific focus on its next generation AI and machine learning capabilities. As earlier, I would like to know if ServiceNow is scouting the Indian market for acquisitions in the space?The market is very pleased with ServiceNow. Its stock is currently trading at $168.73 with a market cap of $29.3 billion. It had touched a high of $176.56 in March this year. The stock has climbed from the 52-week low of $93.73 that it was trading at in May last year."

Perhaps unsurprisingly, ServiceNow (NOW) posted yet another beat-and-raise quarter, the latest update in a long string of quarterly wins for this titanic SaaS name.Like most of its peers in the software sector, ServiceNow has entered true correction territory. Relative to its all-time high of $206, the stock is now down about 15% - yet, relative to other mid- and large-cap tech names, this is still a fairly modest decline. Post earnings, ServiceNow shares rose another 3% (after having fallen more than 6% in the regular trading session), and the stock is still up 30% year-to-date:My argument against ServiceNow always has been predicated on price, a view I expressed last quarter. There's no doubt that ServiceNow is in the ""big leagues"" of the SaaS sector, posing a nice combination of strong revenue growth amid robust free cash flows. Its flagship products, primarily in IT service management software, are the premier ""best-of-breed"" applications in the space with few close rivals. But is it truly worth >12x forward revenues?Multiples contraction in the software space has happened rapidly. Dropbox (DBX), for example, cratered from a high valuation of ~10x forward revenues (reached just mere months ago) to now just over 6x revenues, slicing 40% off the stock's market cap in under one quarter. ServiceNow, however, has remained relatively unscathed in the Nasdaq's bloodbath: Its revenue multiple still towers over many large-cap SaaS peers and has barely dipped from peak levels.In addition, investors have one extra fundamental result to worry about this quarter: Revenue growth. ServiceNow has long prided itself on being able to sustain ~40% y/y growth over several quarters, most of which is organic (unlike many rivals whose growth depends on acquired targets). This quarter, however, ServiceNow faced a fairly noticeable deceleration in its top line, raising the question of whether this company is nearing a saturation point.With the recent market downturn, many previously expensive names have suddenly become digestible buys. Among safer, large-cap tech names, I particularly like Red Hat (RHT), Workday (WDAY), VMware (VMW), and Facebook (FB). ServiceNow, on the other hand, has plenty of room to fall.Amid unusual market volatility in the tech sector, what we needed to see in ServiceNow was a blowout quarter - and unfortunately, we got rather uninspired results. Take a look at the full quarter results below:Figure 1. ServiceNow 3Q18 resultsSource: ServiceNow investor relationsTotal revenues grew 37% y/y to $673.1 million, surpassing Wall Street's expectations for $653.6 million (+33% y/y). We note, however, that last quarter, ServiceNow had grown its top line at 41% y/y, so this quarter marks a rather harsh four-point deceleration. Unfortunately, these results call into question whether deceleration will be the norm for ServiceNow going forward.This is especially true when we look under the hood at both the subscription and billings metrics:Figure 2. ServiceNow revenue metricsSource: ServiceNow investor relationsSubscription revenues of $626.6 million still grew faster at a 39% y/y pace relative to total revenue growth but decelerated a full six points relative to last quarter's 45% y/y revenue growth. Billings, too, saw relative weakness, growing 32% y/y on a nominal basis, down four points from last quarter's billings growth rate of 36% y/y. As SaaS investors know, a billings growth rate that's in excess of revenue growth is one of the surest indicators of long-term revenue potential. When billings growth sags beneath revenue growth, on the flip side, it's a leading indicator of a future revenue slowdown.On the customer front, ServiceNow ended the quarter with ""more than 5,000"" total enterprise customers, while signing on 25 transactions with an annual contract value greater than $1 million. While there may be some seasonality at play, this also is down from 28 mega deals in the second quarter.There's one positive point to note here, however: ServiceNow has continued to ramp its public sector activity, which is obviously an incredibly lucrative vertical for large-cap software companies. ServiceNow's CFO, Michael Scarpelli, noted the following on this quarter's earnings call:Still, we note that ServiceNow is not unique among large-cap SaaS names to have FedRAMP certification and significant federal government opportunities in the near future, Salesforce.com (CRM) being the notable other - and Salesforce is a stock that's trading at a much more reasonable valuation of ~8x forward revenues.ServiceNow's so-so top-line results also were accompanied by rather lackluster results on the bottom line as well. From a margin perspective, ServiceNow managed to nudge up its gross margin to 80%, up two points from the prior-year quarter. Operating margins also saw a two-point improvement to barely over breakeven at 1%, better than -1% in the year-ago quarter. This was due largely to sales and marketing efficiencies: The company spent just 42.9% of its revenues on sales and marketing this quarter, 130bps better than 44.2% in the year-ago quarter.As a result of this margin expansion, ServiceNow's pro forma EPS of $0.68 edged out over Wall Street's expectations of $0.59. We have to note, however, that while ServiceNow also managed to grow free cash flow by 17% y/y, its FCF margin shrank two points to 17%, down from 19% in the year-ago quarter.Strong FCF is one of the defining attributes of an investment in ServiceNow, given that so few SaaS companies are able to turn positive free cash flows. Should this FCF deterioration become a trend, investors will have another situation to worry about alongside revenue deceleration.Overall, ServiceNow still remains a staple of the SaaS sector that will likely still be around for many years, but its days of outperforming the market are likely behind it. ServiceNow is an example of a great company, but a poor stock. This is a company that has routinely been valued at a steep premium relative to other SaaS peers, and right now, richly valued tech names are being targeted by bears. Investors are better off betting on better-valued software names."
4200456,104662,2018-08-20T07:01:26-04:00,"ServiceNow has built a moat in ITSM and ITOM.However, new product offerings and high R&D and sales and marketing expenses suggest the company will not slow down.Success in cross-selling HR and Sales products that act as an extension, and not as competition, to popular SaaS vendors presents a bullish outlook on revenue growth.The company's moat in IT presents a high floor for investors, though the valuation expects high levels of success in its expansion.ServiceNow's business model validates its high valuation, and the company's new products prevent an overvalued thesis.","I first learned about ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) back in college. My school worked very closely with recruiters and company partners to make sure the curriculum stays up to date with the fast-paced IT industry. As part of these discussions, ServiceNow’s ITSM (IT Service Management) and ITOM (IT Operations Management) platforms became the main software tool for our class in IT Systems Analysis.Shares have more than doubled since that time, and investors need to reevaluate ServiceNow. Now a market leader in ITSM, the growth prospects in the company's core sector have decreased, as it has already disrupted the ITSM field. Although ServiceNow is continuing to widen its moat, its future prospects will depend on the ability to gain market share in other areas of IT, as well as create a market for service management platforms outside of IT. Because of the company's current moat in ITSM, its ability to provide service management to a variety of use cases outside of IT, and its success with multi-product customer contracts, ServiceNow should continue its high levels of revenue growth, as the business model supports its valuation.ServiceNow has consistently grown in market share over the last several years and is now the current market leader in ITSM. The characteristics of the company's products creates an easily established moat in the industry once ServiceNow gains market share. Not only does the company benefit from the main benefit for cloud providers - high switching costs - but it also benefits from networking effects. As more customers start using ServiceNow to optimize workflows and manage their infrastructure, the workforce adapts to these technologies. Not only that, but since ServiceNow takes time and resources to integrate with a company’s IT architecture, customers will lose their ability to freely switch vendors the longer they use ServiceNow.Source: Apps Run The World (link here)Morningstar has also recently noted this, explaining the moat: “ServiceNow has followed the successful software paradigm of introducing a single, mission-critical product in a market vertical and expanding from that beachhead into other niches, providing ample upselling and cross-selling opportunities.”Source: ServiceNow IR (presentation here)As mentioned above, ServiceNow’s moat is based on its ability to lock customers in and maintain high customer renewal rates, currently at 98%. ServiceNow also operates on a subscription basis, locking in customers to a multi-year contract, providing the company with a stable revenue source from these deals.ServiceNow’s current business model also benefits from vendor lock-in, which is explained as when “a customer uses one company as their main cloud provider, and the cloud infrastructure becomes so ingrained into the customer’s business that a customer is 'locked in' with this software. This gives the vendor pricing power, and leads to an overall shift of power as the customer is a victim to whatever terms the vendor gives.”ServiceNow will continue to drive revenue growth from maintaining its current customers, raising prices, and locking in new customers. All these provide a nice floor for the company but does not justify its valuation. ServiceNow’s key to continuing growth will be expanding its services and creating an ecosystem that will become operation-critical for its customers, as the company continues to grow upsells to its current customers as well.Already establishing dominance in ITSM, ServiceNow is expanding to include CSM, HR, and security offerings, among others. However, the interesting aspect is that the company is focused on becoming an add-on and an enhancement for current cloud providers, rather than a competitor.For example, two of ServiceNow’s new offerings are in HR and CSM. Both of these areas are already dominated by two vendors: Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) in HR and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) in CRM and CSM. In both of these cases, ServiceNow is avoiding direct competition. In HR, it integrates with Workday in an effort to provide end-user services and combine Workday’s capabilities and ServiceNow’s HR offering to automate common HR-related problems and create efficient workflows for employees.With Salesforce, ServiceNow focuses of providing additional services based on data given by Salesforce. Although Salesforce is beginning to provide an end-to-end solution itself, ServiceNow has continued to see success in customers preferring to use Salesforce for its sales and have ServiceNow use this data to create workflows within the company, with an example use case below.Source: RoboMQ (link here)ServiceNow’s ability to expand beyond its core offering, while leveraging its platform to engage with other vendors rather than compete directly, lowers the risk of competition taking market share from the company. This strategy also allows ServiceNow an opportunity to expand beyond IT as well. Future products and expansions for the company provide a clear path to continue its growth as it attempts to use its moat in IT to become a complete enterprise offering.Investors should note that ServiceNow will be relying on new product offerings to validate its valuation, which presents several risks, such as wasted R&D spend and marketing expenses, as well as product offerings that aren’t successful. However, the company has appeared to avoid this, as it is currently gaining new customers that are open to using several new products from ServiceNow outside of ITSM, as shown below.Source: ServiceNow IRThe diversification of its product offerings outside of ITSM and ITOM are becoming more prevalent. By establishing dominance in its original offering, the company has become more diversified, as well as shown success already in generating more revenue per contract, by successfully including add-ons.ServiceNow can also see one of the major cloud providers begin to target market share of the company, but it might be too expensive for a large vendor to come in. Although fears such as Workday and Salesforce attempting to offer similar products is a relevant risk, there have yet to be any threats as of now. However, ServiceNow’s diversification of product offerings would offer limited downside in such a case.As mentioned throughout this article, ServiceNow will continue to add product offerings to expand its ecosystem. Because the company has offered no hints of limiting its growth, investors will still have to value ServiceNow as a high-risk play despite its moat in ITSM and ITOM, due to elevated costs. R&D and sales and marketing costs have shown no hint of meaningful decreases, which is exciting from a business model point of view but risky for investors.ServiceNow’s main risk is its high valuation. Basically, the market likely sees no real risks from a business standpoint, and has valued the company as such. Below, we’ll compare ServiceNow with similar SaaS companies experiencing high growth - Workday, Salesforce, and Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX).Source: Yahoo FinanceServiceNow is not an investment for those looking for an undervalued option. The company's P/S ratio is extremely high, and even though P/S/G suggests that it isn’t too high relative to sales growth, investors should recognize that most of its current offerings are priced in. From a financial and valuation standpoint, there are no clear indicators of ServiceNow being a buy.However, ServiceNow does have a clear growth path in terms of business model expansion. I believe that the company has several products offering new capabilities that its peers aren’t offering, and which are therefore still in an early adaption phase. Because of this, I believe the company has a clear revenue growth path, despite its market share in ITSM. Although the fundamentals don’t support it, ServiceNow’s business model supports its high valuation, and diversified product offerings support the high P/S. If ServiceNow continues to present sales growth above 30%, and the business model does support this, I do not believe the company should be considered overvalued. Its moat presents a high floor in the valuation, and with suggestions that customers are buying their new product offerings, I believe the company's sales growth will continue to support its valuation.At current levels, ServiceNow is simply not an investment for everyone, presenting little margin of safety. Although the company's fundamentals present a short-term bearish case, I believe its established moat in IT will present investors with a high floor, and the new product offerings should continue to see rising adoption rates, with the possibility of non-IT revenue making up 50% of its revenue sources.With this said, I believe most of this information is priced in. However, I believe the company's business model and integrations with current SaaS providers provide a high revenue growth potential. With its business model and new offerings which have a higher possibility of success than the market believes, revenue growth above 35% for the next year should be easily achievable, which would validate its current valuation levels.Investors looking for growth should focus on business models, and ServiceNow has an excellent one. A high valuation suggests a possibility of high volatility, so I’ve been slowly increasing my position on each dip. I believe the current moat is priced in, but the company's success in working with, and not competing against, other vendors outside of IT provide an opportunity to continue its growth levels and allow ServiceNow to continue to be a buy for long-term, growth-focused investors.Disclaimer: The above references an opinion and is for information purposes only.

4167408,103480,2018-04-30T02:38:32-04:00,"ServiceNow posted a beat to Q1 earnings, rebounding after Q4 results missed Wall Street's expectations (rare for this company).Subscription revenues grew 40% in the quarter, decelerating from 44% growth last quarter (which missed analysts' expectations).This suggests that Wall Street's expectations have come down slightly, but ServiceNow's valuation has not. The tech sector selloff of March and April has barely touched the stock.ServiceNow is extremely expensive at 10x forward revenues.","ServiceNow (NOW), the cloud software giant and provider of IT Service Management software, has just released Q1 results that seemed to break away from a harrowing trend in Q4. Last quarter, ServiceNow posted a rare disappointment in its earnings release, missing Wall Street's expectations by $3 million. It seems Wall Street has adjusted their models too far downward, however, as ServiceNow came back roaring this quarter with an $18 million beat to analysts' top-line expectations.The wide beat to earnings expectations has given additional fuel to a rally that seems endless. Since reporting earnings, shares of ServiceNow are up almost 5%, adding to 25% total gains in the year-to-date period. It's as if the March and April selloff that occurred in the technology sector for virtually every other stock didn't happen for ServiceNow - it keeps barreling forward. I've been bearish on this company for a long time, but not because I don't think ServiceNow is a fantastic company. It looks a lot like Salesforce (CRM) - rapid growth, market-leading products, and positive cash flows but limited GAAP net income. In fact, ServiceNow could be Salesforce's clone in all but valuation - the latter trades at 7x forward revenues, a more normalized valuation for a SaaS stock. As seen in the chart above, ServiceNow has perennially traded at industry-topping valuations. The company now sports a $28.2 billion market cap and $27.0 billion enterprise value (giving credit to the company's $1.2 billion in net cash), against a forward revenue guidance that implies ~$2.68 billion in FY19 revenues. ServiceNow's valuation at 10.4x EV/FY18 revenues is among the highest valuations in the enterprise software sector. Along with the likes of Workday (WDAY) and Adobe (ADBE), I think of ServiceNow as one the three software kings that don't have much room on the valuation front to move much higher. So far in 2018, even as the tech sector sold off, the valuation gap between the highest and the lowest valued of tech stocks have continued to widen. Growth has continued to outperform value, with names like Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), and ServiceNow powering to new all-time highs while competitors suffered pullbacks. Eventually the trend will turn and bring these highfliers back down to earth.Now is a good time to lock in profits on ServiceNow. The stock has been riding high for too long. We can already see in this quarter's earnings a continuation of the top-line deceleration that spooked investors last quarter. ServiceNow's growth is no longer the >40% ""hypergrowth"" that deserves a double-digit revenue multiple; nor does it have the earnings margins or cash flow to support a sky-high valuation. As long as the valuation continues to top 10x revenues, investors would be wise to be cautious.Here's a lookout ServiceNow's first quarter earnings summary:Figure 1. ServiceNow Q1 resultsSource: ServiceNow Q1 resultsBefore diving into this quarter's results, let's recall where we left ServiceNow last quarter. In Q4 - the most important quarter for any software company, due to IT departments offloading the remainder of their budgets - ServiceNow missed expectations and saw subscription revenue and total revenue growth of 44% and 42%, respectively. By any measure, those are good results - but not enough to beat Wall Street's high expectations. After all, ServiceNow has always been a richly valued stock trading at >10x revenues - its earnings results should match the caliber of its valuation.This quarter, ServiceNow saw material deceleration, with subscription revenues growing 40% y/y to $543.3 million (400bps deceleration from Q4) and total revenues growing just 37% y/y to $589.2 million (500bps deceleration from Q4). Yes this quarter, ServiceNow's results were billed as an $18.9 million beat over analyst consensus of $570.3 million (+33% y/y).To me, this seems not like ServiceNow's business has materially improved from last quarter, but rather that Wall Street's expectations have come down too much, recalibrating their models too harshly (a good thing for ServiceNow) after last quarter's disappointment. I'm focused more on the deceleration than the beat margin.How much larger can the company grow in the first place? While it's likely that ServiceNow will be able to sustain growth in the low 30s or high 20s for at least the next several years, the company faces meaningful competition from the likes of Salesforce's Service Cloud, Atlassian's (TEAM) Jira, and Zendesk (ZEN). ServiceNow just recently acquired VendorHawk, a cost-management platform for IT professionals, which will pit it against Apptio's (APTI) technology business management software, but inorganic growth through acquisitions isn't likely to last the company forever, either.Another anemic data point - billings grew just 33% y/y this quarter, as seen in the chart above. Q4 billings growth had been 41%, at least. Given that ServiceNow is primarily a subscription company that relies on long-term subscription agreements, billings is an even better indicator than revenue growth of the company's long-term growth potential. Though it's true that the billings metric may see some irregular choppiness from time to time, the fact that billings decelerated 800bps from Q4 to Q1 is a major warning sign that the business could see an even deeper slowdown going into 2018.In my opinion, I'd rather take Q4's results over the current Q1 results - yet the market seems to blindly march on, snapping up shares of ServiceNow like there's no tomorrow.Meanwhile, the company continues to make little progress toward profitability, as it can't seem to gain sales leverage and ratchet down its sales and marketing spending as a percentage of revenues (48% of revenues this quarter, the same as last quarter). GAAP operating losses of -$20.3 million this quarter were essentially flat to -$21.8 million in 1Q18, and represents an operating margin of -3%, versus -5% in 1Q18. Due to an income tax benefit, GAAP net income actually swung to positive $10.6 million, but this is still an essentially meaningless 2% net margin. Pro forma EPS of $0.56 beat analyst estimates of $0.37, but again, I do believe Wall Street's estimates are anchored too low. In my view, there is almost never a good reason at all to buy a technology stock trading in excess of 10x forward revenues. The likes of ServiceNow, Workday, Atlassian, and Adobe should all be avoided at the moment in favor of much cheaper technology stocks. Names in my portfolio that I like in particular are Cloudera (CLDR), trading at 4x forward revenues, and Yext (YEXT), trading at 5x forward revenues. At its current valuation, ServiceNow is priced for perfection - and even the smallest stumble could send shares into a wide correction. Tableau (DATA), the BI software company, represents a good cautionary tale - once an investor darling that traded at ~12x forward revenues, Tableau reported sales execution issues in February 2016 that sent shares sliding more than 50%. They still haven't recovered back to their all-time highs. Though it seems that ServiceNow's business is firing on all cylinders, the hints of deceleration in subscription billings this quarter are possible red herrings for additional earnings misses in the future. The upside seems limited from here, and the risk-reward profile is tilted heavily against investors' favor."

Profitability remained strong, with the non-GAAP op margin of 18% beating the guided 17%.The crucial 2018 outlook was delivered to investors' satisfaction, as all relevant financial metrics are projected to land ahead of consensus expectations -- from subscription sales of over $2.3 billion to non-GAAP op margin of 20% that, if achieved, would mean a four-percentage-point expansion. Consensus 2018 EPS, as a result, has been raised about 9%, from $1.81 to $1.97 (see the summary table below):Source: Company press releaseUnfortunately for value players like me, NOW continues to be priced like the growth stock it is. As non-GAAP EPS continues to climb higher YoY (2018's is projected to grow a whopping 66%), forward earnings multiples have come down from the stratosphere. At a 75.5x multiple, the stock is hardly a steal -- although a long-term PEG of 1.4x could convince a few potential investors otherwise. Without having partaken in the recent stock market sell-off, NOW is as far as it has ever been from the bargain bin.NOW P/E Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsI like the company's recurring business model that produces predictable subscription revenues, 91% of total sales last quarter, coupled with growth that is not showing signs of materially slowing down. As the top line expands, operating leverage should allow for faster bottom-line growth.But at the same time, it is hard for me to justify buying a stock at an all-time high when the tech sector seems to be still priced for perfect execution. While I'm not concerned so much about the health of the company, I still prefer to keep NOW away from my portfolio just so I can sleep a bit better at night."
4163313,21815,2018-04-16T15:41:51-04:00,"We were worried about high valuation half a year ago, and the shares have added almost 50% since.This gives the stock little margin for error.However, the company has one of the best business models we have seen, and it has multiple avenues for growth.","We looked at ServiceNow (NOW) half a year ago and had some concerns about high valuation, slowing growth, and the amount of stock-based compensation. Has the situation improved in these past six months?Well, as you can see, even if we had some valuation issues, others clearly didn't as the stock just kept on rising and even accelerated after a little selloff early December, even if it hasn't escaped the more recent market turbulence.SaaS business software companies are among the best business model out there, which is why the stocks are usually exorbitantly valued.But that valuation is often justified, as these platforms usually have great first mover advantage, generate considerable switching cost, and have plenty of ways to keep revenues growing and generate even faster cash and profit growth.One could describe the general SaaS business service model in the following steps:We won't go through the whole list, but note that the company is particularly strong in point 8, generating revenue from additional products and services (or modules).The killer app with which the company started was IT Service Management, but they've added a host of new products and services (or modules, as its software), and customers have been biting:Management described the process during the Q4CC. They are talking to lots of companies who want to move to the cloud, but need a few trusted platforms to help.They chose the likes of Amazon (AMZN) AWS or Microsoft (MSFT) Azure as infrastructure, and (Q4CC):And since the company offers a host of modules, it not only generates lots of up-sell opportunities, it also offers a host of different entry avenues. In fact, customers themselves seem to drive this process, at least in part (Q4CC):And this process is often so involving that the company really becomes a strategic partner of their customers (Q4CC):You see third party ecosystem mentioned in that answer (our point 6 above), and this is another growth generating impulse. When asked how ecosystem partners like the Accentures (NYSE:ACN) and DXCs (NYSE:DXC) of the world see the company (in the same light as Microsoft and SAP?), management responded (Q4CC):Which is saying that they really are becoming a SaaS-based rival to ERP vendors, the likes of SAP (SAP) and Microsoft. The ecosystem partners help with implementation and process change of ServiceNow customers, but the company also has its own service department, whose role has changed a bit (Q4CC):There are other ways in which success breeds success, which is based on the learning within ServiceNow and its ecosystem of partners itself.As it evolves from a provider of single solutions to an integrated partner and provider of multiple solutions, it becomes an ever more important strategic partner for companies.And, this itself is a learning experience that the company can leverage and increase its value proposition to new and existing customers (Q4CC):And, there is a good deal to be learned from customer experiences which can be leveraged (even if they cannot code! From Q4CC):It's not only learning in a traditional sense but also using machine learning, which is a more prominent feature of the new version of their platform (Kingston), helped by the acquisition of DxContinuum a year ago.The company also has a thriving third party development market in which third party offer apps on top of the company's core functionality (point 10 in the list above) from the Q4CC:Not only does this enlist the intelligence of people outside the company, it also has a habit of increasing the functionality of the platform and thereby increasing its stickiness.So, basically, many of the improvements and innovations are customer-driven, and this experience is then leveraged, increasing functionality and switching cost. That seems a very good business strategy to us, and it leads to stuff like this (Q4CC):NOW Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YChartsAt first sight, growth seems to have re-accelerated, after a normal slowdown as a result of the law of big numbers. Yet, there are a few tentative signs of some slowdown:SA contributor Gary Alexander, who writes excellent articles about ServiceNow and other tech names, already covered this more thoroughly, so we point to his latest article on ServiceNow, in which he:And this is actually worse because $20M in billings that arrived in Q4 should have been in Q1 as they were pulled forward. Management blames this largely on increased seasonality of the business as big clients were early with renewals and prepayments.Gary is right to argue that, in and by itself, it's not much to worry about, but given the really steep valuations of the shares, there isn't much room for error. Nevertheless, the market took these figures in stride.Things are a little problematic as they move to the new 606 accounting standard. Q1 guidance:Full year 2018:Overall, a slight deceleration of growth but some margin improvement.NOW Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsGross margins have trended up significantly over the years, but operating margins (at least in their GAAP version) don't seem to have, although the figure is very much scaled to accommodate the Q1 2016 outlier, so it's difficult to perceive. Here are the non-GAAP figures:Although this only goes a year back, there seems to be some operational leverage.NOW Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsThe company's cash generation, after dipping in 2016 due to acquisitions, is clearly trending upward in a meaningful way, which is encouraging for shareholders until you realize that much of it is due to rising share-based compensation.NOW Net Debt Issuance (TTM) data by YChartsGiven the steep valuation metrics of the shares (see below), we were somewhat surprised to see that the company has $630M in long-term debt. But it also has $1.77B in cash and short-term investment so there are no balance sheet worries. There is a considerable degree of growth in the shares outstanding, though, and no buyback program.NOW EV to EBITDA (TTM) data by YChartsNearly 15x sales, that is steep, there is now way around that. EPS was $1.19 per share in 2017, analysts expect that to rise to $2.02 this year and $2.98 the next.While that is really very rapid EPS growth, it also gives the shares an earnings multiple of 55 in 2019.We think ServiceNow has one of the best business models in the business. It has plentiful levers to enlist its own, and perhaps equally if not more important, customer and partner intelligence to increase the functionality of the platform, thereby create more up-sell opportunities, a better value proposition for the platform and more stickiness.Worries of a slowdown in revenue or billings are not reflected in analyst expectations of EPS growth, which far exceeds these.So, there is a reason for a serious premium in valuation, but investing at these levels would give us a bit of vertigo, there is no margin for error here."

4166414,101421,2018-04-26T14:43:13-04:00,ServiceNow has agreed to acquire VendorHawk in an all-cash deal of undisclosed amount.VendorHawk has developed a software application that helps businesses optimize their myriad subscription software and data assets.NOW is buying VendorHawk to beef up its software asset management capabilities as enterprise clients continue to transition to the cloud.,"Enterprise software firm ServiceNow (NOW) has announced an agreement to acquire VendorHawk in an all-cash transaction.VendorHawk has developed a SaaS-based system that enables enterprises to track and optimize their software subscriptions.NOW is acquiring VendorHawk to bolster its software asset management capabilities. As enterprises continue their historic transition from on-premises legacy systems to the cloud, NOW is positioning itself to take advantage of customer demand for software service optimization.Seattle, Washington-based VendorHawk was founded in 2015 to assist businesses in achieving greater visibility into the software subscription spending and utilization.Management is headed by co-founder and CEO Patrick Lowndes, who previously held various positions at PayScale.Below is an overview video of VendorHawk’s system:(Source: VendorHawk)VendorHawk’s offering includes the ability to analyze data from accounts payable and other expense systems to develop a full list of software apps.It also enables the ability to track upcoming renewals and usage through its various third-party integrations.The service offering starts as low as $450 per month.Investors funded a total of $1.3 million in seed and Series A funding and included venture capital firms and individuals from the Northwest U.S. and Canada.The market for managing SaaS subscription spend is a relatively small but growing segment of the larger technology vendor management market.According to a 2017 market research report by Research and Markets, the Global Vendor Management Software market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.63% during 2017-2021.There is a trend toward integrated vendor management software suites that can access numerous cloud services to provide a more holistic view of software vendor status and activity.Competitive vendors that provide similar capabilities include:ServiceNow didn’t disclose the acquisition price and didn’t file an 8-K or disclose a change in financial guidance, so the all-cash transaction was likely for a non-material amount to its $29 billion market cap.NOW is acquiring VendorHawk as part of an initiative to rapidly expand its offerings in the software asset management space.As enterprise customers continue their transition to the cloud, they are increasing their usage of subscription-based software and data vendors. In addition, the need to determine which software expenditures are being relatively underutilized is increasing.As ServiceNow stated in the deal announcement,VendorHawk will be added to the Now Platform as part of its Software Asset Management release in 2019.ServiceNow’s stock has risen dramatically in the past 12 months, from $94.00 to as high as $174.NOW announced the acquisition as part of its current quarter earnings release and investors are bidding up the stock over 5% in response to those earnings.The chart below shows NOW’s stock performance in the past year:(Source: Seeking Alpha)While the deal itself is a small acquisition, it presents investors with a window into understanding management’s interest in expanding its offerings in the software asset management space.I expect to see additional moves by NOW to increase its capabilities in this growing area as enterprises are still in the early phases of what promises to be a multi-decade move from on-premises, legacy systems to the cloud and connected applications."
4117963,103480,2017-10-30T06:06:44-04:00,"ServiceNow, the cloud SaaS giant, reported a decent Q3 last week.Despite beats in revenue and earnings, the market showed a disinterested reaction, with shares approximately flat since the earnings release.This may be a signal that ServiceNow - trading at nose-bleeding 10x EV/FTM revenues - might be reaching its peak valuation.","Since the dawn of the SaaS age, two companies have long reigned as Wall Street’s favorite cloud companies, seemingly incapable of doing any wrong: Workday (NASDAQ: WDAY) and ServiceNow (NASDAQ: NOW), each sporting market caps of ~$21 billion. They are the second and third largest pure-play public SaaS companies, behind only Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) at ~$68 billion - though Salesforce has encountered much criticism by investors for failing to produce profits at its ~$10 billion revenue scale.I believe this inclination is misguided and I am a huge fan of Salesforce relative to Workday and ServiceNow, based on valuation alone. While Salesforce trades at a reasonable ~6.5x EV/FTM revenues, Workday and ServiceNow carry almost a 50% premium - at times both crossing the double-digit revenue multiple threshold.ServiceNow’s Q3 earnings release may have provided a window into its bloated valuation - it seems that despite good results, the Street can’t tolerate any higher of a valuation. $21 billion, after all, is a lofty market cap for a company that’s on track to do only $2 billion in forward revenues and $200 million in operating cash flow. Its growth, while still growing in the ~40% range, is no longer enough to impress analysts. Billings results, in particular, showed limited upside vs. analyst consensus, suggesting that the next few quarters may be softer in terms of upside surprise than in the past.Multiples in excess of ~8x are dangerous territory for software companies, and are only tenable in the case of recent IPOs that are growing at rapid clips and can quickly grow into their valuations. Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA) and MuleSoft (NYSE: MULE) are examples of this category. In the case of decades-old companies like Workday and ServiceNow, support for these valuation levels may quickly erode as the market moves on to either newer, more exciting names or value plays like Twilio (NYSE: TWLO) and Cloudera (NYSE:CLDR).ServiceNow is a bit harder to place relative to other software companies, as it operates a fairly large portfolio of application products. Broadly speaking, ServiceNow is a leader in the so-called IT Service Management (ITSM) category, providing software that helps the IT department quickly and efficiently deliver its services to end-users (aka, corporate employees). It also has similar service desk software for customer service employees and HR help desk employees.The overall value offering of the ServiceNow platform is the automation of routine tasks - helping HR and IT employees manage cases and improve service times and experience - hence the name “ServiceNow.”The below infographic, taken from ServiceNow's website, showcases the capabilities of its core IT Service Management product.ServiceNow's software is delivered via the cloud-based model, with the bulk of its revenues derived from subscription fees. Customers are typically billed annually in advance for the right to access the ServiceNow platform.The company was founded in 2004 and went public in 2012 at $18 per share - delivering massive returns for the faithful who’ve held on since then - though that gravy train may have slowed down, as it appears ServiceNow is reaching the ceiling of its valuation limits.By now, high growth rates have become more or less expected of ServiceNow. The company posted Q3 revenues of $498.2 million, up 39% y/y, beating consensus of $491.6 million. Subscription revenues of $455.4 million (+43% y/y) drove the bulk of that growth, with subscription revenues providing about 90% of ServiceNow's revenues and the remainder going to implementation and professional services fees.On the billings front, the company still beat consensus, but the upside was more limited. Recall that billings is the sum of revenue and the change in deferred revenues - for a software company, this is a measure of the revenue that was recognized in the quarter as well as the deals booked in the pipeline up to one year out, so billings is arguably the more important measure of ServiceNow's quarterly performance.ServiceNow's billings of $546 million was essentially inline with consensus of $544 million. Without an excess of upside, there just isn't that much to be excited about.Where ServiceNow did excel in this quarter was in closing out its profitability gap. The company's operating loss of $7.1 million represents only a -1.4% GAAP operating loss margin, versus a -7.5% operating loss margin in 3Q16. Year to date, through the nine months ending in Q3, ServiceNow has posted an -$88.3 million operating loss (-6% operating margin), versus -13% in the prior year (excluding the impacts of a one-time legal settlement in 2016 from operating results).ServiceNow has been able to scale toward profitability faster than most of its cloud peers, and perhaps that's why it's been able to sport a premium multiple. The majority of its increased operating cost savings are due to greater sales and marketing efficiency, as ServiceNow's spending on its salesforce is growing slower than its top line, indicating greater sales leverage.Cash flow from operations increased to $141.9 million in Q3, up 47% y/y from $96.7 million in 3Q16. Netting out $46.8 million of capex, the company also posted $95.1 million in free cash flow.ServiceNow's results are good, but not enough to completely impress the market. Recall that a host of large-cap tech companies reported in the same week as ServiceNow - Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) - and their shares all jumped up 6%, 5%, and 13%, respectively, sending the Nasdaq to record heights. There was no such reaction to celebrate ServiceNow's results, with shares actually going negative in aftermarket trading immediately after the earnings release, before eventually turning flat.ServiceNow has already posted stellar stock performance in the year to date. Its stock has arguably already priced in several quarters of good results. ""Better than expected"" was already expected. Anything less would have killed the share price.Whenever a company's shares pop 70% in any year, that gives me reason to pause. Many investors like buying on momentum, thinking that something on the way up can only keep going up, but when a company like ServiceNow reaches peak valuations, its upside is likely capped.Software companies are subject to sudden multiple re-rations, compressing the share prices to much lower values when there is little investor appetite for growth stocks. At present, ServiceNow trades at a chart-topping 11x EV/FTM revenues multiple - even despite its superior growth at scale, margin performance, and strong cash flow, there's a point at which stellar fundamentals can't excuse outrageous valuation.At trough levels, ServiceNow's multiples have compressed to the ~6-7x range (which is in-line with other high-growth cloud stocks), implying that the share price can shrink by as much as 40%. While I don't see any clear signals that compression will happen, given ServiceNow's good results, I also don't see how the valuation could trudge any higher from here.ServiceNow is also far from getting cash flow support for its valuation. The company is guiding to a 25% pro forma free cash flow margin on ~$1.73 billion of FY17 revenues, indicating it's expecting about $433 million in free cash flow this year. ServiceNow is trading at ~40x that figure - hardly a value play.I would stay on the sidelines on this one and wait for a pullback before going long."
4142069,103480,2018-02-01T06:37:12-05:00,"ServiceNow reported Q4 and full-year 2017 earnings, hitting consensus EPS estimates but missing revenue expectations (arguably the more important metric for a growth company).ServiceNow has historically had a spotless earnings track record, but has missed revenue expectations for two consecutive quarters now.The stock barely fell in after-hours trading, and it remains one of the most expensive stocks in the software sector.With risks to the top line, ServiceNow's double-digit revenue multiple is now extremely precarious.","ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), one of the cloud software sector's largest players (now sporting a ~$25 billion market cap, after a phenomenal 60% rise in the past twelve months), has reported a rather underwhelming end to its fiscal 2017. Yet, it seems that the stock continues to carry the favor of tech investors, with ServiceNow barely falling a few points in after-hours trading after reporting its earnings and retaining its massive valuation.There's a lot at stake for ServiceNow, and with such a robust valuation at ~10x forward revenues, the onus is on the company to prove that it's worth the premium. I've been cautious on the company for months now, but after seeing this $3 million miss to the top line, I'm skeptical that ServiceNow can continue the fantastic growth trajectory that has fueled its outperformance in the markets. Even the favored darlings of tech investors are beholden to the laws of gravity - the miss in revenues seems to be indicating that ServiceNow is reaching a wall of saturation in its core IT Service Management (ITSM) space, much the same way that Salesforce's (NYSE:CRM) growth has tapered off in recent quarters due to saturation in its core Sales Cloud product.But Salesforce is supported by multiple ""Clouds"" with billion-dollar revenue streams. The company's Marketing Cloud, Community Cloud, and PaaS products have stepped up and contributed to growth, where Sales Cloud is losing steam. While ServiceNow, too, operates a broad portfolio of tertiary products (including a Performance Analytics app, an IT Business Management app to compete against Apptio (NASDAQ:APTI), and several others), none have scaled quite like Salesforce - and none, frankly, really have the TAMs to support billion-dollar growth. ServiceNow's second consecutive top line miss is indicative that the company's high-growth era may be coming to an end. Though it has forecast 35-37% growth in subscription revenues for FY18, can we really believe the company will achieve its guidance after two revenue misses?Here's a look at ServiceNow's earnings history dating back to 2015. Note that it's only started slipping recently:Figure 1. ServiceNow earnings recordSource: Seeking AlphaMy argument is not that ServiceNow is a poor company. In fact, for a company to reach a $2 billion-plus run rate the way ServiceNow has is extremely rare and commendable. My point, however, is that it just isn't worth its multiple. There are better and cheaper software stocks that have exceeded their goals to invest in. With the stock already up near 2x in the past year, it's probably time to take some cash off the table.To see the valuation gap that I'm talking about, see below for a comparison of ServiceNow's forward revenue multiple against those of other large-cap software companies. Salesforce is probably ServiceNow's best comp, and ServiceNow is trading at a ~2.5x multiple premium to Salesforce:NOW EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsSee below ServiceNow's fourth-quarter summary results, taken from its earnings press release:Figure 2. ServiceNow Q4 resultsSource: ServiceNow Investor RelationsThe company reported total revenues (subscription plus professional services) of $546.4 million, up 42% y/y. Wall Street consensus had called for $549.4 million in the quarter.You might think -$3 million isn't a huge deal in the context of ~$550 million. But recall that ServiceNow is a high-growth software company with mostly recurring revenues and a high degree of forward-looking revenue visibility. In the enterprise software sector, a careful series of ""beat-and-raise"" quarters - which ServiceNow had previously pulled off - is essentially expected. Of a typical pool of ten software companies to report earnings, nine will report a beat. You don't want to be an investor in the odd one out. In software, careful earnings management is so widespread, it's become an expectation.And yes - several factors can influence a revenue miss, some that might not even be too detrimental to the business. Deal cycles may have prolonged. A customer may have churned. But again, for a company that's trading at ~10x forward revenues, perfection is a must. A software company with a double-digit revenue multiple can be thought of as a professional bowler - if you're not hitting mostly strikes (and maybe a couple of forgivable spares) in a game, you probably don't belong in the big league. Same goes for richly valued tech stocks.Also note that total billings in the quarter were $734.3 million, comprising $684 million of subscription billings and $50.4 million of professional services. ServiceNow's billings grew only 37% - meaning that the rate at which it billed new revenue and added to backlog lagged behind revenue growth (as revenue ""consumes"" deferred revenue backlog in the quarter), which is a slightly concerning sign for future growth.Perhaps the company's only saving grace is that it drastically reduced its operating loss - GAAP operating loss shrunk to -$13.1 million in the quarter, nearly half of the previous Q4's loss of -$23.6 million.The company produced pro forma net income of $63.6 million (which adds back stock comp and other non-cash expenses to GAAP net income), translating to pro forma diluted EPS of $0.35, matching consensus expectations of exactly $0.35.Free cash flow also grew 27% y/y to $150.1 million. A quick additional note on free cash flow: ServiceNow is projecting 27% y/y growth in FCF for FY18, implying somewhere around $625 million in free cash flow for FY18.Now, that's not bad, but in the context of ServiceNow's $24.6 billion enterprise value ($25.6 billion market cap less $1 billion of net cash), this is still an EV/FY18 FCF multiple of 40x. The company is still far from having FCF support for its valuation (and neither does it have revenue support).Looking forward, as previously mentioned, ServiceNow is eyeballing 35-37% y/y growth in subscription revenues ($2.36-2.38 billion in revenues). If we take the company's 90% historical mix of subscription revenues to total revenues, we can do a back-of-the-napkin calculation to drive at ~$2.63 billion in total revenue guidance for FY18.There's a lot of risk to this figure, in my opinion. With subscription billings growth (probably the best forward indicator of revenues) at just 41% y/y this quarter, it's hard to imagine that subscription revenues will barely decelerate in FY18. Billings growth is more subject to timing irregularities than revenue, and if ServiceNow has a huge miss in billings at some point this year, the stock will get pummeled. Given the company's recent track record of lagging behind analyst revenue expectations, this isn't a risk to ignore.Is ServiceNow still an exciting company? Maybe, but still not enough to warrant its valuation. Again, I'll stress here that valuation is the problem, not fundamentals in and of themselves. Perhaps the only ""wow factor"" to pull from the company's earnings was its margin improvements, but without real cash flow or earnings support for its $25-plus billion market cap, it's hard to stand behind ServiceNow and be a true bull about it."

4127601,21815,2017-11-25T11:27:33-05:00,"It looks like a combination of industry growth, new clients and up-sell opportunities to existing clients and new functionality will keep growth going for quite a while.Add to that operational leverage which is starting to kick in and the company should also do well on earnings and cash generation.However, there are some worries about a slowdown in growth.And we have more serious problems with valuation and the amount of stock-based compensation.","Here is another company that seems to be firing out of all cylinders, IT services management platform provider ServiceNow (NOW). It's another SaaS business software provider that has strong tailwinds that don't look to be abating anytime soon:The company started out as a ITSM (IT service management) platform, helping clients to digitalize and streamline their IT service management process and bringing it into the cloud.But as so often, having a cloud platform enables the company to add features and modules into an award winning platform. Some of these modules are succinctly listed by Wiki:You can click on these links for a quick overview of what they're offering, or go to the company website for another product overview.The market for cloud based IT Service Management is still projected to grow at a CAGR of 15%. The company makes 90% via subscriptions, the rest they earn in services (which carry a much lower margin).While the company already has 800 or 40% of the biggest global 2000 companies under contract, it doesn't look like the explosive growth the company has been experiencing is slowing down significantly anytime soon.For instance, the company is not only getting these big corporate clients but they tend to start small, which leaves a lot of up-sell opportunities. The company is also increasingly servicing government agencies, some of these are among the biggest customers they have.For instance, they just closed their biggest ever deal with an average customer value of $7M with a federal agency.There are still plenty of growth opportunities, even in their basic modules like ITSM, which was included in 17 of their top 20 deals in Q3. ITSM is what ""gets them in the door with their Global 2000 companies"", according to CFO Michael Scarpelli on the Q3 CC.The company is constantly adding functions and features, developed in-house but also acquired. This year they acquired a host of companies, like DxContinuum, Qlue, Telepathy and SkyGiraffe.One reason is simply to increase cross-selling opportunities, and there is plenty of that:But when asked during the Q3 CC, management actually said that most of the acquisitions are simply platform economics. That is, the improved functionality improves the whole platform, which makes it both more sticky for existing customers and more attractive for prospective ones. But it also improves pricing, here is CEO John Donahue on the Q3 CC:Some of the additions that the company has made are IT security features that collaborate with known security platforms like Palo Alto (PANW) and others that allows companies to respond faster to threats and security breaches.Another whole new growth opportunity is AI (artificial intelligence). The company is rolling out machine learning capabilities especially for customer service management in their upcoming Kingston release.The company has acquired a couple of interesting AI plays this year to help develop these capabilities, like DxContinuum and Qlue. On the former, from ZdNet:They are guinea pigging the DxContinuum algorithms on their own customer support center before it's rolled out to customers with the upcoming Kingston release.Qlue develops virtual agents for better communication with customers. SA contributor Donovan Jones has a more extended take on this.Another acquisition has been SkyGiraffe, a company that enables them to produce easier mobile applications. SA contributor Donovan Jones has a more extensive take on that.In order to be more 'sticky' yet, it helps if the company basically solves problems for their client, instead of just selling it services. The idea is perhaps best put into words by analyst Alex Zukin from Piper Jaffray on the Q3 CC when he argued that (our emphasis):One way they do this is through their Inspire Team:But service is a much lower margin activity, and in order to keep margins up, they're also outsourcing part of this to partners (like Accenture and DXC), although these are complementary to their own sales teams and work in conjunction with them.Here are the GAAP margins:While gross margins have trended nicely upwards, this is much less the case with operating and EBITDA margins, but there is nevertheless real improvement also here:That is, it looks like operational leverage is finally starting to kick in. Another indication of that is the following:A 25% free cash flow margin sounds pretty impressive but is hugely inflated by the rather liberal use of stock-based compensation (roughly 23% of revenues), so we wouldn't get too jubilant about this.As SA contributor Gary Alexander already pointed out, while revenue growth was still topping expectations, billings (revenue + change in deferred revenues) came in as expected and this might signal a limited capability of the company to keep exceeding expectations.Q4 is seasonally their strongest quarter, but they're also going to increase hiring, so we have to wait and see how that plays out. Revenues are still guided to grow 38%-39% in Q4, although billings will grow by 30%-31%, which opens up just a tad of concern that growth is slowing down.Twelve times sales isn't exactly cheap, and mind you, the company has a substantial amount of debt outstanding, the result of a considerable amount of acquisitions.One should also be aware of a substantial gap between GAAP and non-GAAP figures. Despite a considerable improvement, the adjusted EPS of $0.38 in Q3 turns into a GAAP loss of $0.14.The biggest part of that is stock-based compensation. For instance, for the first nine months of the year, stock-based compensation totaled $288M, a good 23% of revenues ($1.24B). That, and the acquisitions lead to the following:That count is going to 181M in Q4.The company has $1.67B in cash and $1.15B in long-term debt on its books. This year the company is expected to produce an EPS of $1.2 (non-GAAP), rising to $1.8 in 2018, the latter gives it a forward multiple of 71.Given the amount of share-based compensation and the rich valuation, we cannot but see the shares as fully valued. That doesn't mean there is no upside.The market is very likely to keep on growing at substantial rates (some 15% as a market research has it). The company is likely to do substantially better than that, but whether they can remain at their current 40% pace remains very much to be seen.However, the company's platform has a strong and established position. We haven't found anything about churn rates, but we would be surprised this would be anywhere near significant.The company will continue to up-sell and cross-sell, and it will continue to develop new functionalities and modules and acquire these, creating a more sticky and attractive platform with more opportunities to up-sell.Also, operational leverage has started to kick in so the company basically has three tailwinds, revenue growth, up-selling opportunities and operational leverage.However, it also has something of a headwind, the liberal use of stock-based compensation and acquiring quite a few companies is pushing debt and the share count upwards, blunting part of the leverage.A good scenario would be where the company can roughly maintain their growth whilst cutting those headwinds (operational leverage would allow them at least in part). In that case, the shares would still be interesting.A bad scenario where growth diminishes and not much is done about the share and debt issuing is equally possible in our view, and in that case, it's much harder to see significant upside for the shares.These SaaS platforms are the darlings of Wall Street at the moment, and rightly so, as these platforms are sticky and offer numerous ways to add additional revenue streams, but the valuations are really quite stretched."

The growth in the industry is driven by the continuing adoption of mobile and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies across organizations. But that is not the only cloud-based enterprise service that is expanding. Another report by by Gartner estimates the global Public Cloud Services market to grow from $209 billion last year to $383.5 billion by the year 2020 with enterprise offerings of human capital management (NASDAQ:HCM), customer relationship management (NYSE:CRM) and the financial application services becoming the second largest line of business. Gartner expects these services to grow from $38.6 billion last year to $75.7 billion by 2020.ITSM provider ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) recently announced impressive second quarter results. Revenues for the second quarter grew an impressive 40% over the year to $478.5 million, ahead of the market's expectations of $463 million. Loss per share of $0.25 was significantly higher than the Street's forecast loss of $0.18 for the quarter. Adjusted earnings of $0.22 per share were better than the market's projected EPS of $0.20.By segment, Subscription revenues accounted for 87.2% of total revenue and grew 43.5% to $417.1 million. Professional Services revenues grew 21% to $61.5 million. Total billings for the quarter grew 35% to $504.9 million, falling short of the earlier forecast range of 36-37% growth. Subscription billings grew 37% to $456.6 million, and Professional Services and other billings increased 15% to $48.3 million.ServiceNow began as a Cloud-Based ITSM provider. But it is no longer focused only on ITSM and has diversified its offerings to other cloud-based enterprise services to keep in line with the growing demands of the market. During the quarter, 58% of its net new ACV came outside of ITSM compared with 40% a year ago. The company also noted that today nearly 75% of its customers used more than one ServiceNow product including HR, Customer Service Management and security services. Its HCM offering is seeing strong adoption and it recently added a leading airline to its customer list with net new ACV of almost $3.5 million. Its Customer Service Management product also is doing well and it recently debuted in Gartner's Magic Quadrant.For the third quarter of the year, revenue is expected to grow 36%-37% over the year to $485-$490 million with subscription revenues growing to $440-$444 million and Professional Services and other revenues growing to $45-$46 million. The company forecast billings to grow 34%-35% over the year to $540-$545 million. Analysts are projecting revenues of $480.1 million for the quarter.For the full-year, ServiceNow forecast revenues of $1.903-$1.913 billion, representing 37%-38% year-over-year growth.ServiceNow recently announced plans to roll out a machine learning engine that will help predict outages, routing, workflow, outcomes, and benchmark performance. The Intelligent Automation Engine leverages the DxContinuum acquisition that ServiceNow completed earlier this year. The Engine will be deployed across the ServiceNow platform and cloud services and will be tailored for each customer account.Continuing with the AI trend, ServiceNow also announced recently the acquisition of virtual agent technology firm Qlue for an undisclosed sum. Palo Alto-based Qlue was founded in 2015 and has developed a virtual agent bot that enables better communication between companies and their customers - both existing and prospective. Qlue leverages AI to power virtual agents. Its bots are able to answer frequently asked questions and problem diagnostics. ServiceNow plans to leverage Qlue's virtual agent technologies across its workflows on its platform for IT, HR, customer service, and security.ServiceNow has been an innovative company all along. Here's my podcast with its founder Fred Luddy, which provides great insight into the person who founded this stellar organization.Its stock is currently trading at $106.54 with a market cap of $18.64 billion. It has been slowly climbing from the 52-week low of $71.25 it was at in August last year. It had risen to $115.85 earlier last month.I think that ServiceNow is a great buy for any big tech company looking to make a move in the cloud-based enterprise application market. IBM, for instance, could do well by adding ServiceNow to its portfolio. IBM has been in the dumps of late - steady revenue declines and no sign of recovery in sight. A merger of the two companies would be interesting. They already have a strategic partnership that integrates ServiceNow's platform with IBM's analytic tools to help organizations automate their processes. IBM doesn't have all the cash though. It ended the last quarter with $12.3 billion of cash and marketable securities. That number won't be enough to buy ServiceNow, which could command a premium of 30%-50% over its market capitalization. However, IBM stock is still worth a lot."

4074762,20521,2017-05-19T13:26:16-04:00,,"Cloud-based enterprise services provider ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) continues to outperform market expectations. It recently announced a leadership change when it brought over former eBay and Bain & Co. CEO John Donahoe as the new CEO. ServiceNow’s exiting CEO Frank Slootman took the company from $75 million in revenues to revenues of $1.4 billion last year. And now, the new leader is aiming to grow faster to cross the $5 billion milestone.ServiceNow’s FinancialsRevenues for the first quarter grew 36% over the year to $416.8 million, ahead of the market’s expectations of $409 million. Adjusted EPS of $0.24 was significantly better than the Street’s forecast of $0.17 for the quarter.By segment, revenues from subscriptions grew 43% over the year to $382.7 million and professional services increased 6% to $40.6 million. For the quarter, Subscription billings grew 44% to $478.7 million and professional services and other billings increased 11% to $50.5 million. Total billings of $529.2 million translated to a 40% growth over the year.For the current quarter, ServiceNow expects revenues to be between $458-$463 million, far ahead of the Street’s forecast of $450.9 million. ServiceNow forecast the year’s revenues at $1.86-$1.88 billion, ahead of the Street’s forecast of $1.837 billion.ServiceNow’s Product GrowthServiceNow has been improving its product offerings to gain a bigger foothold in the enterprise market. And this quarter was no different. Earlier this month, it announced the release of several new services. By the third quarter of the year, its customers would have access to ServiceNow’s Trusted Security Circles, which is a new cloud-based application that gives enterprises the ability to share and receive hyper-relevant threat intelligence in near real-time. ServiceNow believes that most enterprise security teams fight threats in isolation. The new service would allow security teams to reach out to peers, suppliers, and partners and be informed about threats and their associated risks. They can thus be forewarned of targeted attacks and help build safety within the community.To manage risk, it also announced Vendor Risk Management, another cloud-based application that organizations can use to automate third party risk management, onboard new vendors, and gain visibility of their overall risk posture. Since most organizations work with different vendors who have access to sensitive data, the new application offers a centralized system of action that automates the third-party risk management process.It is also leveraging its earlier acquisition of DxContinuum and released the Intelligent Automation Engine. The new service can be used by organizations to develop models that prioritize and route tasks across departments. The engine can help businesses identify problems to prevent service issues, benchmark services, and predict performance. It will help organizations with application development, knowledge management, performance analytics, reporting, and subscription management.It continued to build on the theme of communities within its offerings and announced ServiceNow Communities, a new application in its Customer Service Management solution. The Communities provides a personalized, self-service experience for every customer. It offers capabilities such as managed forums, curated topics, support for multiple content types, moderation, and granular permissions. It has been integrated with the ServiceNow Customer Service Portal to deliver a personalized offering where customers can see or edit their profile details, cases, products, services, and notifications in the same place where they can engage with the community. It also offers seamless contextual searching to help customers get information faster with a single search and focuses on a customer-specific activity stream that provides relevant content and updates in the forefront.To help organizations keep better track of their software assets, it also announced the industry’s first software asset management solution. Software Asset Management combines catalog, procurement, and orchestration in one system so that enterprises can quickly allocate and reclaim software licenses to address non-compliance and avoid issues arising out of vendor audits. The Software Asset Management allows enterprises to automate software license spend, get a real-time view of licensed software compliance position, take a proactive approach to reconciliation and remediation and optimize license usage.I still think that ServiceNow remains an attractive target for Microsoft. Under Satya Nadella, Microsoft has been focused on all things cloud and the acquisition of a company like ServiceNow would help it make bigger, and faster, inroads into the market.One last word on the choice of the new CEO. John Donahoe is a highly respected CEO in the industry, but his background is more in consumer businesses like eBay and Paypal. Why ServiceNow chose John as the leader to take them to the next level is somewhat baffling to me.Its stock is currently trading at $97.95 with a market cap of $16.66 billion. It has recovered from the 52-week low of $63.51 it had fallen to in June last year. It had reached a 52-week high of $99.09 earlier this month."
4088452,98236,2017-07-18T13:59:00-04:00,"ServiceNow is one of the quintessential growth stocks of this decade.The company has made substantial pivots to expand its TAM far beyond the confines of its ITSM home.The company's ability to derive more than 47% of its additions to ACV outside the ITSM space, up from 33%, is a quantitative testimony to the pivot.The company's new competencies in terms of workflow automation and business process optimization are really fallow fields with lots of potential runway for this company.The company is very gradually improving its cost profile but it is still a substantial user of stock based comp to bolster reported results.","There is a certain tradition - in France, the UK and perhaps in parts of the US as well. When a female child is born, the father is supposed to lay down a case of Chateau d’Yquem for use at his daughter’s wedding. The wine will easily last 25 years or more if it is appropriately cellared - I have seen ads recently for 1942 Chateau d’Yquem and have read that because of its elevated sugar content it can be drunk for more than a century after it is bottled.Currently, buying a case of Chateau d’Yquem is a significant investment and will cost the proud parent or grandparent about $2,000. It has proven to be a pretty decent investment because these days a case of 2001 Chateau d’Yquem is going to cost parents, or anyone else, more than $6,000. In other words, the wine has enjoyed a compound annual appreciation - if it is stored properly-based on history of about 14% or a bit more and I have little reason to believe that this cadence will not continue.A few weeks ago, the analyst covering ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) at Bernstein suggested that shares in the company are a perfect gift for young children - to an extent based on a similar theory of that of laying down Chateau d’Yquem - both are high quality assets that will inevitably appreciate over time. Forecasting a 14% annual appreciation for an asset over a decade or more is a truly bold proposition - particularly when looking at the IT space. And whatever else is true, an investor is not going to get to drink electronic impulses in a storage array. Drinking Chateau d’Yquem either at a wedding or at any other time is one of the great pleasures of life - and more so if the reader has a sweet tooth as does this writer. I have been lucky enough to enjoy it twice in my life - neither time at a wedding I may add and there is little drinking of equal - although, perhaps the German Trokenbeernauslese might give Chateau d’Yquem a run for its money - and the German wine is basically a lesser-cost alternative.But after I saw the story about Bernstein’s recommendation, I felt that it might be an interesting project to take a look at which investment might turn out better - Chateau d’Yquem or ServiceNow. It is probably a bit easier for an investor to hold Chateau d’Yquem than ServiceNow shares - you will not have to look at daily quotes or determine if the space is maturing or if there are new competitors of concern - all you have to do is store the wine in a cool dark place until the time of the wedding arrives and commend your foresight. On the other hand, there is something decadent about drinking a glass of wine that comes from a half-bottle that is going for close to $600. The money you earn on investing in ServiceNow is totally without guilt.I have never owned ServiceNow shares myself for a variety of reasons although I do have a case of Chateau d’Yquem cellaring away - not, however, to be drunk at the wedding of a daughter. The rest of this article will be focused on whether I need to lay down a decent position in this name to go along with my case of Chateau d’Yquem. I am not going to try to forecast the company’s results for this past quarter - clearly of the most recent reports on the company the score is 2 to 1 in favor with two positive initiations from Bernstein and JPMorgan and one downgrade from OTR Research. Overall, most analysts rate the shares a buy or a strong buy (27 out of 33) - perhaps not the best set-up in the world although the average price target is essentially consistent with the current share valuation which is likely to lead to a fair amount of resetting when earnings are released. Will this company have a blow-out quarter comparable to the one it enjoyed in March - I don’t know how I would be able to forecast a 40%-plus beat without specific information. It is interesting to note I think that the shares really didn't spike despite the blow-out quarter. They were up about 5% the next day and are now up about 22% since the quarter was announced. That compares overall to an appreciation of 9% for the IGV. While the purpose of the article really isn’t to try to focus on the results of a specific quarter, I think it is likely that if the company does have another blow-out quarter it is reasonable to believe that the shares will continue to generate visible positive alpha.How to determine if investing in NOW can beat investing in Chateau d’Yquem? Or will investing in ServiceNow shares provide readers with the returns required to be a reasonable part of a strategy for a retirement portfolio? I imagine many readers of this article will blanch when I talk about using an investment in NOW shares as part of a retirement portfolio when it has yet to earn a non-GAAP profit. And yet, I think even cautious investors might want to take a look at ServiceNow - this is a company with strong management that has enlarged its TAM steadily and seamlessly dominates a space that has been a core requirement of an IT strategy for users since the inception of IT. And I simply do not see competitors that are able to replicate what NOW provide users in terms of long-term product road map. Will that change in the next decade or more? It is simply impossible to make such a forecast other than to use history as a guide. This isn’t a history article - but what this company did to BMC Software, the erstwhile market leader in this space, could readily be a classic case study at the business school I attended (or any other for that matter) and while there has recently been a CEO transition, this company has “institutionalized” its competitive success to a significant degree. Let me say at the outset that in providing an analysis of this company’s prospects the most obvious issue is going to be growth - and particularly how long hyper-growth can last.Last quarter, NOW’s revenues grew by 36% year on year and its subscription revenues grew by 41% (43% in constant currency). To see 43% growth at the scale of this company is a significant feat. To see bookings growth actually exceeding revenue growth as well is even more of a feat. Those results are clearly far stronger growth than the company’s basic market which is called ITSM (IT Service Management). The results were almost entirely a function of organic growth. The company made two very small strategic acquisitions which in aggregate will probably be less than 4% of revenues. For just how long and by how much can NOW’s growth dramatically exceed the expected growth of a bottle of Chateau D’Yquem?NOW has not yet become profitable on a GAAP basis although it does report significant levels of non-GAAP profit. It also has a high and rising level of reported cash flow from operations. Needless to say, stock based comp is a significant component of the company’s non-GAAP earnings presentation and it has continued to rise, albeit at a slower rate than either reported non-GAAP earnings or revenues. On the other hand, the growth in the company’s deferred revenue increase category was 60% last quarter, suggesting that bookings continue to rise more rapidly than revenues.How profitable can NOW become and how long can it take? Can the company actually grow its CFFO margin beyond the level of 45% it reported last quarter or the forecast of 25% for the full year that the CFO provided on the conference call? The cash flow margin last quarter was not based on any unusual balance sheet items, although the contribution to CFFO from the seasonal reduction in receivable balances was substantial. Like many other forecasts emanating from NOW, it is likely that the company will surpass the forecasted CFFO margin of 25% for the full year. In positioning NOW for its run against a case of Chateau d'Yquem, I will obviously try to make some comments regarding competition both in regard to the company’s longer-term growth potential and also with regards to the ability the company has to improve its overall margins. I would like to say I have some unique insight on that subject, but the fact is that at this point, NOW's competitors simply lack the ""stuff"" to be a real alternative. It is hard to write about competition when the Gartner survey describes the company's largest single competitor, BMC, with the following comment, ""BMC's sales teams tend to be less responsive compared with the competition, and Remedy frequently drops off these shortlists of Gartner clients.""NOW has chosen not to early adopt ASC 606. Had it chosen to do so, it would have forecast somewhat higher earnings and revenues, although probably not enough to really change either anticipated growth or major valuation parameters. It will adopt the new accounting convention at the start of its next fiscal year. Overall, the adoption of ASC 606 would have improved the overall results last year from a reported loss (excluding the one-time legal settlement) of $63 million to a reported loss of $23 million. The company is forecasting non-GAAP operating profit of $360 million for the current fiscal year. The adoption of ASC 606 would add 11% to that amount and it presumably is one factor that has driven the strong projected growth in earnings for 2018.Just for the record, obviously Q1 was a strong quarter for this company which once again substantially exceeded expectations. Indeed, it might be reasonably said, I think, that investors and analysts expect that NOW will consistently exceed expectations each and every quarter or there would be no justification to invest in the shares. Over the past year, the company has beaten earnings expectations by between 50% and 4% - last quarter the beat was 41%. I think that given the extended period over which this company has beaten expectations, it is reasonable to imagine that the consensus really is not an accurate reflection of expectations which are quite a bit greater for all significant operating metrics. So, investors are probably expecting that NOW will grow revenues by close to 40% this year, a slight acceleration from Q1 results, and one most lately buoyed by the decline in the value of the USD. Investors also are expecting that EPS will significantly exceed the reported First Call consensus value of $1.17 for this year and $1.72 for next year. While I will quote the consensus where appropriate in this article, it would be well to remember that the consensus is not really the same as collective expectations at this point. That obviously means that if NOW ""only"" beats current consensus expectations by a couple of percent, the shares are most likely to pullback - that is basically the scenario anticipated by the OTR brokerage to support its downgrade of the shares. . ServiceNow is today, and has been, the leading vendor in the spaces of what is called IT service management and IT operations management according to the Gartner studies linked here. The company has a rather substantial lead compared to its competitors. It is my contention, that for a variety of factors, its competitors do not have either specific sales and marketing capabilities or specific technology that would allow them to challenge ServiceNow’s lead. Despite NOW’s lead in terms of functionality and ease of use, the ITSM space is very fragmented and NOW certainly doesn’t have a dominant market share at this point. So, it has the runway that it needs to continue to grow by adding market share for some substantial time into the future. That is really one of the principle components of a long-term buy thesis - runway. I have linked to a site that has some data on market shareAccording to Gartner, ServiceNow became the leader in IT Service Management in 2014, displacing longtime leader BMC Software which quite frankly had spent a decade or more squandering its leadership position in the space. I am not going to detain readers very long trying to dis-entangle all of the skeins of market share yarn that exist. Overall, I think it is fair to say that NOW is in the leadership position and its share continues to grow because of more effective marketing and because it has been willing to invest prodigiously in order to broaden its TAM. Despite the retirement of the company’s CEO, I doubt that the company’s playbook is going to change all that much. What isn’t broken doesn’t need fixing.It appears that NOW has achieved a 20% share of a space that is forecast to grow, overall, at about 15% going forward. It is important to note that NOW has basically focused its attention on the high-growth cloud-based component of ITSM - that is a major reason for its differentiated growth. It is easily possible for writers to drag in more statistics than readers either need or want to know about. But I think one statistic which is worth noting, especially in terms of the longer term for this company is that 47% of the company’s new ACV came from outside of ITSM - although the definition is probably a bit looser than some would have it And that compares to 33% of ACV from outside of ITSM just a year ago. It is that one statistic that provides me with the basis of my belief that this company will remain in hyper-growth mode for some years to come - long enough, anyway, for me to believe that investing in shares of NOW will out-deal an investment in the long-term appreciation of Chateau d'Yquem.I have no intention of discussing all of the company’s solutions outside of the ITSM space - they are far too numerous to individually review. I did take a look at some of the newer areas that are targets of opportunity for this company when I last wrote about NOW in early February. One of the mistakes or errors in judgment that are made by most observers who consider this to be a short is they do not understand the dynamics of the company. In terms of forecasting the evolution of NOW - and why it is a good stock for small children and those building a portfolio to fund their retirement the case I am making relates to the rapid expansion of the company’s set of available opportunities through its enhanced product road map. It is a strategy that appears to be working well and it is a central component of the growth thesis. The new CEO John Donahoe referred to this trend specifically in the course of his prepared remarks during the prior conference call.Last quarter, in particular, the company CFO reported that NOW saw specific strength in both HR and in security solutions and the strongest percentage growth came in what NOW calls IT business management, particularly including performance analytics. Over time, I believe the company will continue to show faster growth in categories that are included within the ITOM (IT Operations Manager) than ITSM. My belief is that the company will probably continue to show rapid growth beyond its help desk offering. For those interested in such things, the CEO, who has both a consulting as well as an IT background, described the NOW mission as workflow automation or business process optimization. These are perhaps “soft” definitions, but again, the issue to consider when looking at this company is that its growth is not going to come primarily from ITSM over the next 10-15 years but from selling a variety of IT automation technologies. That is why it can grow fast enough to justify its valuation and to successfully compete with Chateau D’Yquem as a long-term investment. These days IT operations management is beginning to rapidly incorporate artificial intelligence. Gartner in the report linked here calls the trend Algorithmic IT operations. The company bought a company called DxContinuum as part of its effort to develop a differentiated set of AI capabilities. Unlike some vendors of AI, the company has developed 4 very specific use cases for AI that can be used immediately, without some long period of gestation/proof of concept. I expect, as will be the case for several vendors, the introduction of AI will make NOW solutions score better in terms of ROI and will thus be another factor that allows the company to achieve higher growth rates longer than many investors might consider.Over the years, I have had different opinions regarding this company and its prospects. For some time, I looked for a chink in its armor besides that of its valuation and its use of a massive amount of stock based comp in its business model. One concern I have had was simply that the space that NOW has come to dominate, i.e. ITSM would turn out to be too small to support the company’s longer term growth aspirations. The concern may have been right. The denouement was hardly what I had expected. I have published a couple of earlier articles on NOW that I would like to take back. While it may be that the company’s ITSM growth rate had slowed as I wrote about almost a year ago, viewed holistically, that has mattered something less than not at all. The company’s pivot into its newer lines of business and to marketing a product strategy that goes far beyond ISM has been more or less flawless. My analysis going back to last August hardly deserves that term.The company has still not quite achieved GAAP profitability and it still has relatively high operating expense ratios. On the other hand, while stock based comp is still enormous, it has begun to decline as a percentage of revenue, cash flow and non-GAAP operating profit. SBC increased about 8% last quarter while sequential revenues rose a bit faster. On a year-over-year basis, SBC dropped from 25% to 21% of revenue and it dropped from 96% to 48% of CFFO - although adjusting out a couple of one-time items from the prior year CFFO the resulting improvement was less dramatic. In terms of operating profit, SBC was 171% of the reported amount in this past Q1 while it was 535% of reported operating profits in the prior year. The company is forecasting an increase of 5% in outstanding shares, not greatly changed from the overall dilution seen in the prior fiscal year. I often times get readers who complain about financial metrics that include SBC. For the record, I agree. But also for the record, at the moment SBC is used to a greater or lesser degree by many hyper-growth companies - and it is part of the convention in evaluating these companies. As these articles are about stocks and not about a discussion on ""what should be"" I will evaluate shares based on the scales used by the preponderance of observers and will provide enough data for readers, if they have an interest, to form their own evaluation as to the importance of SBC. The trend of GAAP operating expense was modestly but noticeably positive. Sales and marketing is exceptionally high for a company of this scale. That expense ratio did drop by 100 bps year on year - but it is still greater than 50%. A bit more improvement was seen in research and development. In that category, the expense ratio declined by more than 120 basis points to just over 20%. General and administrative costs also showed a decent improvement falling from more than 13% of revenues to just 11% of revenues year over year. Perhaps the most significant cost disappointment last quarter was the continued inability of the company to at least break even on its revenues from professional services which rose from 108% of services revenue to 115% of such revenues year-on-year which was offset by an increase in subscription gross margins which rose from 80% to 81.4%.Overall, the company is expecting a steep ramp in operating margins from the start of the fiscal year through to its conclusion. The company, because of the very strong revenue growth it achieved last quarter, had non-GAAP margins operating margins of 13% in Q1 and it is forecasting non-GAAP operating margins of 11% in Q2. So, to reach 16% operating margins for the full year suggests a very strong ramp after this current quarter. Part of the decline in operating margins for Q2 will be a function of the company’s acquisitions which will increase sales and marketing spend by a bit under 3% and will set back operating margins by 1%.How does one value this company? How does one assess its likely returns, both absolutely and vis-à-vis buying futures on Chateau d’Yquem? I think it is fair to say that this company is likely to be able to increase operating margins at 300-500 basis points for several years to come. It will be a function of trade-offs that management makes between percentage growth and the growth of profitability.The sales and marketing spend ratio is directly correlated to expected subscription revenue growth. The company has been able to find productivity gains in its sales and marketing operation despite expanding its footprint and despite a process of increasing sales coverage by dividing territories and adding verticals. I have no reason to believe that this company will not continue to achieve substantial levels of improved profitability and the new accounting standards are going to accelerate that process, at least in terms of reported numbers.Just presenting the standard ratios that I use in terms of valuation. ServiceNow with 179 million shares outstanding has a market capitalization of $19.7 billion. With net cash on the balance sheet of $800 million, the company’s enterprise value is $18.9 billion and based on the company’s current revenue projection, the EV/S computes to be 8.4X. No one said that ServiceNow shares are cheap, but the company’s metric in this category is not extraordinary either.The issue of the adoption of ASC 606 makes computing the P/E a bit murky. That said, however, I will use the consensus value for fiscal 2019 as the numerator. The resultant P/E is 64X, presumably with less SBC as a percentage of earnings than has been true in the past.The company as noted earlier, has raised its CFFO forecast to 25% or about $560 million for this year. Given some of the most recent quarterly cash flow margins, it might appear that this margin is more than a bit low, but contra wise, given the significant changes in balance sheet items, prudence suggests just using the company number with the understanding that it most likely will be noticeably exceeded. The company’s capex is running at a rate of $130 million, leaving projected free cash flow of $430 million. That is a free cash flow yield of 2.3%. About all that can be said of the metric is that it is rising, and given the kinds of transactions the company is booking, it seems likely that free cash flow will rise at a more rapid percentage than non-GAAP EPS.At the very least, I think it ought to be clear that the ServiceNow story is not a product of drinking Cool-Aid. Depending on how one likes to spend one’s money, I think the story ultimately will allow to reap financial returns greater than might be expected from cellaring a case of Chateau d'Yquem .Ultimately, I think your children will thank you for putting this name in their college fund and it will do wonders for a portfolio of names assembled to fund retirement. And one day, the stars will align and it will fit into my portfolio as a long-term holding."
4056463,52012,2017-03-21T09:02:40-04:00,NOW continues to operate unprofitably with no improvement in margins despite substantial revenue gains.I dispel the idea that this unprofitability is simply a result of the company's high revenue growth rate.Executive turnover may finally provide a catalyst for the stock price to drop to more reasonable valuation levels.,"I first disclosed my short position in ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) here at SA in November of 2014. My original short thesis was that the company was not built for profitability; rather it was a ""growth at any price"" company, whose poor metrics were disguised by the use of Non-GAAP accounting which essentially ignores the very real costs of stock-based compensation. I subsequently identified two serious IP lawsuits pending against NOW which could result in large unexpected costs. I was borne out on the latter idea, as NOW ended up taking charges of $270M to settle the infringement suits initiated by HP (NYSE:HPQ) and BMC.However, despite this loss, the stock price has generally appreciated since I wrote my first articles (though it has allowed some nice trading opportunities in the interim.)NOW data by YChartsToday I'd like to revisit/update the rest of my thesis and introduce a new company development that I think could act as a catalyst for a meaningful near-term stock decline.ValuationAs shown in the charts below, despite substantial revenue increases, NOW continues to operate with substantially negative profit margins, with stock-based compensation expenses also continuing to grow.NOW Revenue (Quarterly) data by YChartsNOW Profit Margin (TTM) data by YChartsNOW Stock Based Compensation (Quarterly) data by YChartsYet, despite the unending losses, the market continues to value the company with metrics such as price to sales and price to book that are multiples of the market average:NOW Price to Book Value data by YChartsTurning off the Growth SpigotOf course, bulls contend that such valuations are appropriate because achieving profitability is merely a matter of ""turning off the growth spigot,"" at which point the losses (but also revenue growth) would end. Given the choice between growth and profitability, slanting towards growth is, the bulls insist, the right choice. Of course no one ever shows how or why the company would be profitable if growth stopped, it's essentially an article of faith among investors.As a first method to put the ""turn off the growth"" idea to the test, in previous articles I've developed a heuristic wherein I assume that all revenue growth is acquired at a cost of 1.25X revenue. I then subtract both the assumed cost of new revenue and the resulting new revenues from the income statement, such that the remaining costs and revenues are representative of the company's on-going ""core profitability."" For more details, see my original article on this heuristic.Below is the updated annual table of my ""core profitability"" calculation. The table shows that the company has made no move towards improved core profitability, indeed if anything it's been getting worse. Note too that while the 2016 numbers do include the charge-off for the IP infringement discussed above and this is a one-time cost; it stands to reason that future development costs will be higher than they had been, because presumably the company will be forced to develop its own software rather than simply ""borrowing"" other companies' IP. Thus there's little reason to project that the company will ever operate profitably, even were it to completely cut off growth.Secondly, the ""turn off the growth spigot"" argument also fails because were it true and were the company ever to implement it, then the company would likely be valued at a price to sales ratio of 2.5 at best, which would take 75% off of today's stock price.The final rebuttal to the growth vs. profitability argument is that historically, the best companies (except for Amazon (AMZN)) have managed to grow while simultaneously turning a profit - it really isn't either/or. (See my past articles for more details and illustrations.)Accordingly, NOW is built to be unprofitable and is trading at extremely high valuation metrics. But this has been true for a few years now; so if the stock price hasn't reflected these facts to date, why think it will do so in the future?Executives Leaving (and thereby Freer to Sell)The best answer to that question comes from the recent 10K which contains this important note (with my emphasis):Having so many key people leave at once may be coincidental, or may indicate knowledge that things are as good as they'll ever be at the company; but no matter how you slice it, such turnover has to be considered a substantial negative for the company. The turmoil it might create is certainly one potential catalyst for a drop in the stock price, but also important is the potential that all three of these men exercise their options and sell their stock. Here's a summary of their holdings (taken from the SEC's Form 4s) for reference. Also consider that all three of them have been sellers even while employed at the company (see second graphic), so there's no reason to think they'll simply hold on to their stock now that they're no longer with the company and subject to the scrutiny that insiders receive.ConclusionI continue to hold my core short in NOW and will likely add to it in the anticipation that the exodus of high ranking company executives will precipitate a stock price decline to more reasonable valuation levels (e.g. to 2.5X sales).This article is part of Seeking Alpha PRO.

Rizvi was previously an EVP at Oracle (ORCL), running their Fusion Middleware and Java Products efforts.Below is a brief demo video about Qlue's 'Conversational Customer Service' approach:(Source: Qlue)The company has created a suite of technologies that integrate with enterprise systems and interoperate via all major communication channels, as shown in the chart below:(Source: Qlue)Acquisition Terms and RationaleNeither company disclosed the acquisition price or terms, other than the deal was an all-cash transaction. ServiceNow did not state any effect on its financial guidance, nor did it file an 8-K, so it appears the purchase price was not material to its operations.ServiceNow is a 'low-code' provider of cloud-based enterprise software that aims to streamline customer service, IT incidents and human resource issues within an enterprise's ecosystem of employee and customer relationships.It has created the ServiceNow System of Action on its Now platform, which provides organizations with the ability to replace previously unstructured and undocumented processes with structured, intelligent workflows that create efficiencies and better customer and stakeholder responses.The deal for Qlue promises to bring intelligent virtual agent messaging technology to help it answer FAQs, order status requests, IT issues and problem diagnostics in a more conversational manner.As ServiceNow stated in its deal announcement:The Qlue technology will be integrated into ServiceNow's Intelligent Automation Engine system on the Now platform.While the transaction makes sense as a logical expansion of ServiceNow's service automation approach, my expectation is that outside of its technology company clients, adoption of chatbots will take some time.It's easy to see the potential benefits of software-based automation, but the trick is getting ServiceNow's client customers to use the bots, and changing human habits take time.Once it is integrated, I'm optimistic that the deal will bring benefits to a portion of ServiceNow's client base, but seeing adoption from its less tech-savvy enterprise customer may be awhile in coming.I write about M&A deals and IPOs.

But given the presence of the five tech horses that are dominating the technology sector, I won't be surprised if it gets acquired.","ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) recently reported results that surpassed all market expectations. The company attributes the growth to a successful platform strategy, and rightly so.ServiceNow's FinancialsRevenues for the fourth quarter of the year grew 35% over the year to $391.7 million, ahead of the market's expectations of $379 million. Adjusted EPS of $0.24 compared with the Street's forecast of $0.23 for the quarter.By segment, revenues from subscriptions grew 43% over the year to $350.3 million and professional services revenues increased 1% to $41.4 million. Subscription billings grew 52% to $483.9 million. The growth was driven by an addition of a record 31 Global 2000 logos in the quarter. Some of the big names added during the quarter included General Mills, DNB Bank, and Renault. The quarter was also impressive due to the number of large deals booked. It added a record 27 deals, with net new average contract value of more than $1 million.It ended the year with revenues growing 38% to $1.39 billion. Losses came in at $451.8 million or $2.75 per diluted share.For the current quarter, ServiceNow projected revenues of $416 million-$421 million, compared with the market's projections of $402 million. It expects to end the current year with revenues of $1.86 billion-$1.89 billion, compared above the consensus for $1.79 billion. ServiceNow is confident of reaching its revenue goal of $4 billion by the year 2020.ServiceNow's Offering GrowthServiceNow continued to enhance its portfolio of services. The company may have begun as an ITSM player, but now it has diversified into other cloud offerings, including human resources, customer service, and security software. Last year, 72% of its customers bought licenses for products besides ITSM. 46% of its last quarter net new contract value was for non-ITSM work and 94 of its top 100 deals booked in the fourth quarter included products beyond ITSM.ServiceNow also realizes the importance of machine learning. As part of its intelligent automation initiative, it is working on leveraging the vast troves of data available at its data centers to drive actionable insights and cost savings. It has access to data for more than 10,000 customers worldwide and its customers have access to critical volumes of operational data. ServiceNow plans to leverage this data with machine intelligence to predict outcomes and automate actions that will be able to drive higher productivity and scale of operations. It recently developed ITSM benchmarks that is providing aggregated KPIs for more than 3,000 customers, based on the size of the company and the industry. Benchmarks will help provide areas for performance improvements and other meaningful insights into workflows.To further strengthen automation, ServiceNow recently acquired machine learning start-up DxContinuum for an undisclosed sum. DxContinuum was founded in 2012 by alumni from Oracle, HP, and Fair Isaac. It has been focused on developing machine learning algorithms and predictive analytics software for sales teams. ServiceNow plans to leverage the acquisition to expand into the Internet of Things automation. By integrating DxContinuum's machine-learning algorithms to its customer's data set, ServiceNow will now be able to train machines on how to route IT, HR, customer service, or other requests with higher accuracy.ServiceNow is taking the right moves to expand market reach. But given the presence of the five tech horses that are dominating the technology sector, I won't be surprised if it gets acquired. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a likely bidder as the acquisition will help Microsoft leap forward with its already rapidly expanding Cloud strategy.The ServiceNow stock is currently trading at $90.62 with a market cap of $15 billion. The stock hit a 52-week high of $92.98 after its results announcement last week. It has recovered from the 52-week low of $46 it had fallen to in February last year."
4041757,98236,2017-02-01T19:32:53-05:00,"ServiceNow reported the results of its Q4 and 2016 results last week.The results were very strong with revenue growth accelerating and non-GAAP earnings beating estimates.The company's guidance for 2017 was a modest increase above prior expectations.The shares are highly valued, and it takes beat-and-raise quarters to maintain share price momentum.NOW's shares have reached a valuation in which the upside, and particularly the opportunity for positive alpha, seems limited. Its valuation is at levels that probably scare off potential acquirers.","A different kind of unicornThe common definition of unicorn in the tech world these days is a private company that is worth in excess of a billion dollars. ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is, of course, not a unicorn using that definition. But unicorns have been around for thousands of years at least in literature, and in popular folklore, and recently some Italian researchers found a deer with a single antler that has grown in the middle of its head that looked much like pictures folk artists had drawn of the animal.I used to think of a unicorn as something unique or rare and possibly just a chimera. That is a pretty good metaphor for ServiceNow as a company although it is hardly a chimera. On the other hand, despite the strengths of the company, and its strong record of operational performance, I simply am not able to conjure a good rationale for rating NOW's shares as a desirable investment at this valuation.I confess that sometimes when I review NOW's numbers, I am staggered by the progress the company has made. Partly this has to do with the growth record of the space in which the company operates. IT Service Management has been around for quite some time with different definitions and different competitors some of whom have been acquired over the years. While segments of the space have seen bursts of growth, viewed at holistically, ITSM has been a moderate growth segment over the years. Before NOW became a public company in 2012, the major competitors in the space were BMC Software (now private) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE). Both the record of HPE and BMC are a testament to the lack of growth they have been able to generate in the ITSM spaceAnd part of my wonderment is the very aggressive guidance that the CEO of NOW continues to articulate. At this point, aggressive or not, an observer has to give some of the projections of CEO Frank Slootman the benefit of the doubt. But the question remains as to whether the shares are worth the price. I confess that I am not in the camp that is willing to ignore valuation despite my desire to seek growth far more avidly than income. NOW's shares have been great performers and are well loved by many investors and analysts. But there are few trees that grow straight to heaven, and I doubt that NOW will prove much different in that regard. I will discuss some of the rationale for the company's success and how much the shares might be worth in the balance of the article.The Wages of NOWServiceNow has been one of the best hyper-growth names to own over the past year, and the shares are trading at all-time highs just above $90/share. And so far as that goes, it has been one of the better names of its cohort of public companies for investors to own over a considerable time period. The shares went public in 2012 at a price of $18/share and first traded at around $24. That is a pretty healthy return.Since the company has been public, its shares have traded on growth and particularly growth in orders expressed in terms of Annual Contract Value. The company has almost inevitably managed to exceed growth projections by greater or lesser amounts since it has been public. This past year it initially projected revenue growth at about 35%, and wound up producing 39% revenue growth with subscription revenues, the most highly watched metric rising 45%. Subscription billings rose 44% adjusted for currency and contract duration (one particularly large order came in with a five-year contract duration).Like many hyper-growth companies, NOW has been able to improve non-GAAP earnings - it actually has those - but it has had GAAP operating losses that have trended higher over the years and reached $2.75/share in 2016. Self-evidently, investors have yet to concern themselves with that issue. Stock-based comp expense has been an issue to some regarding this name and to a whole host of hyper-growth companies. While of course stock-based comp is an expense, if investors accept it as a nullity in their valuations, I really can't do other.The trend in GAAP earnings really hasn't shown much improvement with sales and marketing expense rising faster than revenue - 41% vs. 35% (some of that was because of commission accelerators that peak in Q4s). The research and development expense ratio improved last quarter rising only 26% for the period and down noticeably from the 31% for the year as a whole. The issue of research and development spend and its declining trend is one to consider carefully.Stock-based comp is simply enormous at 21.5% of revenue as compared to 23.7% in the prior year. For the year as a hole, stock-based comp was 23% of revenues compared to 26% in 2015. Stock-based comp rose by 22% last quarter, which was a small step in the right direction in terms of ratios.Overall, GAAP operating expense rose by 35% last quarter, in line with revenues, and because of higher gross margins, the GAAP operating loss actually declined a bit. It is interesting that the company doesn't even project GAAP financial performance metrics. I simply do not know if management tries to manage toward any set of GAAP objectives.In terms of non-GAAP expectations, the company projected 12% operating margins at the start of 2016. The actual result was 13%. So far investors have chosen to focus on rising non-GAAP margins and have not focused on a lack of improvement in many GAAP operating expense ratios. That is going to remain a risk for future valuation as there is some level, not really known, at which investors seem to balk in terms of rewarding the company's higher valuations based on improving non-GAAP operating margins.A stake in the groundServiceNow reported the results of its fiscal Q4 and 2016 year last week. The results were a beat, although almost everyone involved with this name expects beats or they wouldn't be owning the shares. I will discuss the specific numbers in the earnings release shortly.Of more interest to me was the company guidance both for this current year and for 2020. The forecast and the goals that the company has put forth really do constitute a stake in the ground. On a constant-currency basis, management has forecast that its subscription billings will grow by 37% this year, really a number that would be a major achievement. Perhaps even more extraordinary is the company's goal of achieving $4 billion in revenue by 2020. The company's revenue forecast for 2017 is $1.835 billion based on current currency values. To reach $4 billion in revenues by 2020 will require a CAGR of 30% for the following three years. That is a bold aspiration for almost any company in any industry at this scale. The question before the house is can that happen and what might margins and cash flow do over that period?The company expects to reach its goal both by generating new Global 2000 (G2K) customers, but of even more importance from generating increases in annual contract value throughout all of its annual cohorts of current customers at rates comparable to those experienced in the past. It also expects to achieve progress at the lower end of the market, but those numbers are not likely to be particularly large in terms of a company looking to achieve $4 billion of annual revenues, mainly from subscriptions.The company is growing its G2K customer base at a reasonable rate. The ACV increases of its cohorts have been extraordinary. Last quarter, upsells within its major customer base showed a 9% sequential quarter increase. From a forecasting perspective, that has been and is likely to remain the company's ""secret sauce."" At this stage, ServiceNow has been more successful than any of its peers in the hyper-growth IT world in weaning itself off of dependence on its initial application, and today, 46% of its ACV is coming from non-legacy product. This is very much a sales-driven company with an uncanny ability to execute.The company has long presented a matrix regarding the trade-off between revenue growth and growth in margins and in free cash flow. It is clearly still in growth mode and obviously plans to remain in growth mode for a couple of years into the future, and the way it operates, that means that margin growth is going to be modest. The company has already come close to achieving its gross margin goals. From here on out, the heavy lifting must come from significant improvements in operating expense ratios. It has forecast non-GAAP margins of 16% this year, up from the 13% achieved in 2016 and its aspiration is to improve operating margins to almost 30% by 2020. That number (30% operating margins) is essentially consistent with its margin growth matrix. I just wonder if that matrix will prove to be a reasonable expectation over the next four years.NOW, as previously commented, is still some ways from achieving GAAP profitability, although results at the end of the year showed some progress in some expense segments in operating expense discipline, and of course, the legal settlement with BMC and HPE is no longer a drain on either resources or time. But with sales and marketing expense at 49% of revenues on a GAAP basis, and continuing to grow faster than overall revenues, it strikes me that it will be impossible for the company to reach GAAP profitability any time in the foreseeable future. The company needs the sales and marketing spend to grow revenues as fast as it has, and it is a significant component in its success in beating the competition. Just as a comparison, when BMC was a public company, it typically spent less than 30% of its revenues on sales and marketing, and I doubt that it has increased that ratio significantly since it was taken over by private equity.Overall, the basic reason investors have bid the shares to current valuations is likely to a belief that NOW will beat the consensus and raise its guidance most quarters. But in addition to counting on short-term performance, investors are also counting on the company achieving its aspirational forecast for 2020 earnings and revenues. That forecast, adjusted for the dilution coming from stock-based comp, and using the 33% tax rate which is that currently accrued, computes to an EPS of about $4 and to free cash flow of $1.25 billion. The company currently has an enterprise value of just greater than $15 billion. I don't propose to discuss whether the current enterprise value is supported by expectations of 2020 performance. The fact is, that at best is a close run thing, I believe although there are surely those with a different viewpoint.So there are a few questions on which to focus in the balance of the article. Can the company achieve its aspirational goals for 2020? What specifically needs to happen to sustain 30% growth at the scale the company will reach at that point. What are some specific risks to consider in terms of the aspirations for 2020? And what should the shares be worth now if the company remains on track to achieve its 2020 aspirations?As mentioned, investors may differ substantially as to the last query. And we have no idea what the terminal growth rate might be or really the direction of operating margins at that point (2020). I am not convinced either that the company can achieve its aspirational margin goals or that the terminal growth rate will be high enough to support ever escalating valuations.How does NOW do it?The idea that a company focused on solutions that essentially relate to what NOW calls a forms-based workflow and on IT Service automation can grow at fantastic rates year after year is a credit to the management and the sales execution of this team. The space in which ServiceNow was founded and which is still the cornerstone of the company's product offerings is called IT Service Management. The IT Service Management market is not insubstantial, but it has a moderate projected growth rate of about 6.5-8% overall. Even the cloud-based IT Service Management space only has an estimated CAGR of 16%.An ancillary market that ServiceNow participates in is called IT Operations Management. Service management is basically concerned with providing software to remediate problems as they arise and to attempt to minimize disruptions to IT operations caused by service outages. IT Operations Management is, as the name implies, the process of managing day-to-day IT infrastructure, including provisioning, capacity, performance and availability of the computing, networking and application environment. The large competitors including BMC, HPE and IBM (NYSE:IBM) usually offer solutions that span both business areas. Operations management has been far more resistant to change than service management, and it therefore probably has a greater unaddressed TAM.All of that being said, however, ServiceNow is growing at least twice as fast as its peers within both the ITSM and ITOM markets. The superior growth rate is not particularly a function of NOW offering unique or uniquely ""better"" solutions. The magic quadrants that Gartner has created rank ServiceNow in the first place, but primarily because of its ability to execute. BMC is said to have a slightly greater ""completeness of vision"" which is Gartner speak for technology.In addition, there are many smaller companies that offer point solutions but they are rarely involved in enterprise transactions. What does NOW do better. I think the preponderance of the company's superior performance has to do with sales execution, solution packaging and positioning. Many readers want to hear about companies that have some kind of special technology moat. There is no special sauce in terms of how NOW solutions work. That would not be easy to achieve given the requirements of the markets in which it operates (At the end of the day, IT management still revolves around resolving trouble tickers or requests for service in an automated fashion that brings the most automation possible to helpdesks). What NOW does better than anyone is figure out how to offer what larger users want to buy at a competitive price. Not to be too picky, but it is really what might be expected of a company that spends almost half of its revenues on sales and marketing and has pledged to even accelerate it sales and marketing spend.I think the other component of success that NOW is enjoying has to do with its expansion beyond ITSM. 46% of net new ACV was outside of ACV and most large deals the company closes include other products. Over time, the ability that NOW has to gain share in the ITSM and ITOM markets is probably reaching an asymptote. I simply do not think that the company is likely to be able to grow its ITSM business, still more than half of total of total bookings, at 25%, the growth rate achieved in Q4 or to see ITOM bookings more than double year over year; that was actually the result in Q4 (It should be noted that ITOM had seen two relatively middling quarters in terms of year-on-year bookings growth and Q4 was most likely a catch-up).A few ago, when this company went public, it had a noticeable technology lead compared to its rivals. Its rivals in the space were basically contributing share and barely knowing what was happening. Please see the link as to how users felt about the company and its technology in 2012. While there continues to be some kind of aura that emanates from this company about its technology, the gap between its ITSM and ITOM solutions and those offered by the other major companies in the space has probably narrowed. Things like that are hard to measure, but I expect that the overall market space will see declining growth through the years and that NOW's outsize market share gains will moderate. As mentioned, ITSM grew 25% last quarter and was still 54% of the company's bookings and a much greater percentage of revenues. The company forecast for this year implies that ITSM's growth will be lower this quarter and this year, and I think that the trend is such as to suggest that ITSM revenue growth for NOW will gradually decline to 10-15% over the next several years.If not through ITSM and ITOM growth, then how does NOW achieve its very bold revenue growth projections? To do so is going to require a raft of successful new products that can be sold at decent margins. It is a difficult bet to handicap because many of the new products haven't been designed, let alone released. This company has had a great record in terms of monetizing its new releases. Most of its 2016 cohort of product releases has apparently had far shorter sales cycles than the company's historical base of solutions and it has allowed NOW to engage both current and prospective customers on a far wider range of offerings than has been the case up till this time.Part of the success that ServiceNow has enjoyed relates to its ability to sell large deals to large customers. The company's business plan involves selling 17 new logos/quarter and increasing the contract size in each of its G2K logos from $1 million to $2 million. In addition to service management and operations management/automation, the company has several other new products. These days, most of its customers order the company's platform to take advantage of third-party products that work with ServiceNow and they also choose to add analytics solutions. The company also sells what it describes as a business management suite for Information Technology departments. Although it is a new offering, it got lots of traction last quarter. In all, of the 20 largest new deals consummated in Q4, 18 customers ordered three or more products.Last quarter, the ACV for the newer products grew by 84% and reached $270 million. I think it would be a brave soul indeed who would think that new products currently released could sustain a CAGR high enough to offset the declining CAGR of ITSM and probably ITOM by 2020. Can the company achieve it aspirational goal of 30% CAGR after this current year? Although I have pointed out several issues that might make it more difficult to achieve NOW's goals, when it comes to revenue attainment, I wouldn't bet against it.The future for margins and cash flow at NOWAs mentioned earlier in this article, one of the long-standing projections that the company has provided investors are its expectations for growth in operating margins at different revenue growth levels. Management has forecast that at a revenue growth of around 30%, it can increase operating margins by about 4%/ year and can increase free cash flow margins by about 2% year. What that might mean for GAAP margins is unsaid and apparently is not of material importance to the company's management.I think it will be much harder for the company to achieve its aspirational 2020 goals than the stock price might suggest. Here is a quote from the CEO Frank Slootman in last week's conference call on what the company's plans are in terms of sales and marketing spend for its newer products:What does that mean quantitatively? My guess is that it means that sales and marketing expense growth, at least in the GAAP presentation, will outstrip revenue growth, making it difficult for GAAP financial results to show lower losses. The company CFO, Michael Scarpelli, is forecasting that non-GAAP operating margins will increase by 300 bps this year, and based on its track record, I would bet against that. And that is consistent with the company's investor presentation matrix. But, for that to happen, it seems to me that the company will have to cut the growth of its research and development function noticeably. Research and development growth was 31% last year and was 25% last quarter and were I to present a detailed model, given management comments on sales and marketing spend, I would have to think that the growth of research and development spending would slow to only 20% or so this year.Will that spend level be an under-investment in research and development? I could make the case, given the likely growth trajectory of the company's core ITSM business, that it probably is. The company is going to need to accelerate the number of new products in its stack in order to maintain a 30% CAGR, and while there is not a perfect correlation between development spending and new products, I think over time that it is hard to imagine that the company will get more products while tightening the growth of development spending. It rarely works that way.I certainly don't claim to have prescience or a crystal ball. It is easier to see great execution in terms of the company's ability to launch products and achieve visible revenue growth than it is to see great productivity in the research and development function. Maybe the company can achieve rising productivity and thus curb the growth of development spending. But my guess is that a slower cadence in the growth of development spending will lead to a slower cadence in new product introductions, and the company is going to have to find ""a next big thing"" if it is to achieve a 30% CAGR after this current year.I tend to look at spending comparisons year on year almost entirely on a GAAP basis unless they have some one-time elements involved. For example, I don't think it is worthwhile to discuss the company's legal settlement earlier this year - it has nothing to do with evaluating future expectations. The company doesn't forecast GAAP and perhaps the answer to my dilemma is that stock-based comp expenses will rise. I don't think that is likely - the growth ratio has been declining.But if operating margins are going to increase by 300 bps, if gross margins are going to be more or less consistent and if marketing spend will to continue to grow faster than revenues, then development spending has to grow more slowly and that is probably a bad choice for a company trying to maintain an elevated rate of revenue growth.ValuationJust how expensive are NOW's shares? On the CS analysis to which I have referred in the past, the shares are expensive but not incredibly so. Less highly valued than the shares of Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), and far more highly valued than Atlassian's (NASDAQ:TEAM) shares. In absolute numbers, the EV/S is just less than 8X. The company currently has a market capitalization of $15 billion, and it has an enterprise value of $14.4 billion. The consensus revenue projection for 2017 is $1.84 billion.The P/E on current non-GAAP estimates is 83X. Estimates for 2018 show more than 50% projected growth in EPS, which is more or less consistent with the company's growth matrix presentation, but which seem unlikely nonetheless. EPS for 2018 is projected by the consensus to be $1.62. Revenue growth for the same period is forecast by the FirstCall consensus to be 28%. To reach consensus EPS number, operating margins need to rise another 300 bps to 19%.The company is projecting a free cash flow margin of 24%. That is free cash flow of $440 million. That provides a free cash flow yield of 3%, not perhaps the lowest free cash flow yield, but a level that is certainly within the upper decile.There are those who think that NOW is a good acquisition target, and certainly from a strategic sense, the projection of a consolidation seems to be pretty reasonable. And Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO) buy of AppDynamics seemingly casts a whole new and different light on EV/S ranges for acquisitions. But this company is more than 4X the size of AppDynamics, and I just can't bring myself to believe that there is a potential buyer out there willing to pay 10X for NOW.NOW's shares, as might be anticipated, are well loved by analysts with 27 out of 31 ratings published on FirstCall at buy or strong buy and only 4 at hold. But, with all of that enthusiasm, the consensus price target is just $102, 13% above current share prices. The numbers just don't quite fit.From many aspects, NOW is an admirable company with prodigious execution capabilities. But it also needs to be considered as a stock. I admire the company; I find the shares at levels that make it difficult to expect that it will be able to generate positive alpha going forward."
4021256,20521,2016-11-08T16:06:16-05:00,"Earlier last month, some leaked documents from a Salesforce.com board presentation suggested that ServiceNow was on a possible acquisition list.ServiceNow has not commented on the news report.It wouldn't be surprising if the company did end up getting acquired.Many believe consolidation in the enterprise cloud space will happen soon.","According to a recent survey conducted by enterprise cloud services provider ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), more than half of the respondents now choose cloud for default IT projects. Of the 1,850 mid- to senior-level managers surveyed in a global study, it was found that 52% choose cloud for new business applications and nearly 77% of them would complete the shift of their organizations to the cloud within the next two years. Given the trend, ServiceNow's recent quarterly results are not very surprising.ServiceNow's FinancialsRevenues for the third quarter grew 37% over the year to $357.7 million, ahead of the market's expectations of $352.2 million. Adjusted EPS of $0.23 compared with the Street's forecast of $0.21 for the quarter. Billings for the quarter grew 41% to $404.3 million, significantly ahead of the Street's estimate of $383.2 million.By segment, revenues from subscriptions grew 43% over the year to $318.93 million and professional services revenues increased 2% to $38.72 million. ServiceNow is benefiting from the diversification into the non-IT service segments. During the quarter, products other than IT services amounted to 41% of the net new average contract values, compared with 28% a year ago.For the current quarter, the company projected revenues of $376-381 million, compared with the market's projections of $377 million.ServiceNow's Product InnovationRecently, ServiceNow announced the launch of the industry's first cloud solution that provides IT leaders with the visibility to financial, project and application portfolios on a single platform through a new offering called IT Business Management Suite (ITBM). ITBM integrates Project and Portfolio Management, IT Financial Management and Application Portfolio Management on a single, cloud-based platform. ServiceNow realizes that enterprises have multiple applications, and the new platform provides core information about thousands of IT applications, assets, services, projects, service levels and risk profiles that are connected to the customer's configuration management database. IT leaders can then use indicators and metrics for the true cost and performance of business applications and services to rationalize investments and focus on innovations in order to improve business outcomes.Earlier last month, some leaked documents from a Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) board presentation suggested that ServiceNow was on a possible acquisition list for Salesforce. The list had 14 potential acquisitions including big names like ServiceNow, LinkedIn (LNKD), Tableau (NYSE:DATA) and DemandWare (NYSE:DWRE). It ultimately ended up buying DemandWare, and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) picked up LinkedIn. Analysts believe that the list is an active one, and that some of these targets may still be getting evaluated for a purchase. ServiceNow has not commented on the news report, but it wouldn't be surprising if the company did end up getting acquired.Many believe consolidation in the enterprise cloud space will happen soon, and when it does, players with bigger cash backing such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Microsoft and Salesforce could end up buying ServiceNow. With ServiceNow having entered into other segments besides IT services, its acquisition by either Oracle or Salesforce would make sense. Microsoft too could be a viable acquirer given its Cloud focus. I have said earlier that Microsoft's potential to make some more big acquisitions in the cloud segment could make it a dark horse in the five-horse race in tech.ServiceNow stock is currently trading at $85.09 with a market cap of $14 billion. The stock has recovered from the 52-week low of $46 it had fallen to in February this year and is slowly climbing to the 52-week high of $91.28 it had touched in December last year."
4083956,101421,2017-06-26T13:40:45-04:00,GE Ventures and ServiceNow have invested in a $10 million financing round for Nuvolo.Nuvolo has developed a cloud-based enterprise asset management system on ServiceNow's platform.The deal provides GE with an inside position for Nuvolo's next generation asset and maintenance management system and a potential success story for ServiceNow's platform.,"Quick TakeGE Ventures (GE) and ServiceNow (NOW) have participated in a $10 million investment round for enterprise service management company Nuvolo.Nuvolo has developed a cloud-based enterprise asset management application on ServiceNow’s platform that promises to improve GE’s far-flung operations while providing a potential success story for ServiceNow’s burgeoning platform.Both investors stand to gain from the deal, albeit in different respects.Investee CompanyJersey City, New Jersey-based Nuvolo was founded in 2013 to provide a mobile-first asset management tracking, maintenance prediction and analytics to enterprises in the healthcare, life sciences, regulated manufacturing, and the wider spectrum of facilities management industries.Management is headed by founder and CEO Tom Stanford, who was previously VP, Sales at Eden Technologies, an IT consulting firm.Below is a brief demo video about Nuvolo’s clinical asset management system for hospitals:(Source: MD Publishing)Nuvolo has built its system on the ServiceNow platform and has developed a robust partnership program divided into three areas:The company hopes to persuade firms to replace their legacy EAM/CMMS (Enterprise Asset Management/Computerized Maintenance Management Systems) solutions with its mobile-centric, cloud-based solution.Investment Terms and RationaleInvestors in the current $10 million Series A round were led by GE Ventures (Noah Lewis) and also included Seed round investors New Enterprise Associates (Chetan Puttagunta) and ServiceNow (Dominic Phillips).Nuvolo has raised a total of $12 million in disclosed financing to-date. Valuation of the current round was not disclosed.Notably, the deal announcement described Nuvolo as ‘the world’s largest and fastest growing clinical asset management platform.’ The company says it is currently managing ‘more than 5.8 million clinical devices across more than 3,125 healthcare providers and 3,750 service workers utilizing its EAM platform.Lead investor GE Ventures’ Noah Lewis also alluded the Nuvolo’s ‘fast growth,' so I wouldn’t be surprised to learn that the deal was valued in the $25 million to $75 million post-money range.What is more interesting is Nuvolo’s focus on regulated industries early in its development and its choice to build its solution on the ServiceNow platform.As Dominic Phillips of ServiceNow Ventures stated in the deal release,I believe GE Ventures and ServiceNow are gaining very different benefits from their backing of Nuvolo.GE operates in numerous regulated industries that are directly impacted by an improved mobile-first asset management system such as Nuvolo’s. GE Ventures invests in companies that can drive growth for its partners and most importantly for its own operations. So, I imagine it will begin to pilot Nuvolo’s solution in many verticals if it hasn’t already done so.For its part, ServiceNow is likely investing in Nuvolo in order to boost the visibility of its platform approach to service processes. By investing and showcasing successful, growing companies that are fully committed to its platform, ServiceNow attracts interest from other companies who are looking to scale their business opportunities via its platform.So, GE gains an inside track with a technology that promises to generate efficiencies across its supply chain and ServiceNow supports a poster child for its growing platform.Now, what’s left is for Nuvolo to execute in the marketplaces it competes in faster than its legacy competitors can react and create their own cloud solutions.Advantage Nuvolo.I write about M&A deals and IPOs.

3965240,52012,2016-04-14T09:38:51-04:00,"I have been negative on NOW due to its unprofitability, valuation metrics and stock-based compensation practices.As a kicker, I've cited potential patent infringement liabilities as an additional negative.Today, NOW disclosed the cost of its patent infringement settlements - and they're more than just a small kicker.","I have been negative on ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) for going on a year and a half now, with core unprofitability and high stock-based compensation as my driving thesis, but with patent infringement lawsuits as a final kicker.For example, in an article written in Nov 2014, I mentioned both the patent infringement case levied by HP (NYSE:HPQ), and more importantly that brought by BMC. The tenor of the pleadings in the BMC case in particular made me believe that ""BMC appears to be taking NOW's potential infringement ""personally"" which could be very costly for NOW."" I provided several details from the cases, including that NOW didn't have a single patent to its name and that BMC had made the following accusation:In December of 2015, I followed up on my thesis, including highlighting a third party appraisal of the suits, which included this conclusion regarding the initial Markman hearing in the BMC case:Today, NOW filed an 8-K announcing that it is taking a whopping $270M charge for litigation settlement expenses. Here's the relevant text:Because the settlement is sealed and confidential, we're not privy to any restrictions that NOW (or the other parties) may have agreed to. But given the seemingly unilateral victories by the plaintiffs, it wouldn't be a stretch to think NOW may be operating under new rules in developing its software. Moreover, it's also interesting to note that the settlement with BMC leaves open the possibility of future patent infringement suits after ""a specified term of years.""To put the cost number in perspective, consider that as of its latest 10-K, NOW reported $285M in revenues for its most recent quarter and listed about $947M in net current assets (crediting back deferred revenue).ConclusionI still believe that the single most fundamental reason to be short the stock is the company's core unprofitability. However, the cost of today's settlement and the implications about a management team that generated this situation is also a strong corroborating factor. As a result, I remain short the stock."

The Software as a Service (SaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) parts of cloud hardware and infrastructure software spending are estimated to grow to $12 billion this year and will grow to $55 billion by the year 2026. Another report by IDC estimates that by 2020, penetration of SaaS versus traditional software deployment will be more than 25% and packaged software consumption in enterprise segment will shrink to 10% of new installations. Most cloud companies are therefore switching gears to address this rapidly expanding market.ServiceNow's FinancialsEarlier last week, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) reported impressive quarterly results. Revenues for the second quarter of the year grew 38% over the year to $341.31 million, ahead of the market's expectations of $333.96 million. Net loss for the quarter came in at $0.30 per share.

It expects to end the year with revenues of $1.37 billion-$1.38 billion compared with the market's forecast of $1.37 billion.ServiceNow's DiversificationServiceNow is now diversifying its service portfolio out of IT service management into management software for human resources, customer service and security. Called the Customer Service Management, the new service will make ServiceNow compete with other cloud players especially Salesforce.com.ServiceNow believes that the options provided by current players in cloud-based customer service, such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP (NYSE:SAP), may be good at customer engagement, but these options don't necessarily integrate the engineering and operational aspects. ServiceNow, instead, is counting on its platform to be able to deliver a streamlined service that can make processes like onboarding of a resource as simple as ordering products from Amazon.The biggest advantage ServiceNow has over Oracle and SAP is that at its core, it is a cloud-based organization that has always been focused on service management and offers a wide range of inbuilt service management tools such as tasks, workflows and forms. Since its launch in May this year, the Customer Service Management offering already has 40 customers, 30% of which are new to ServiceNow and 31% of which are Global 2000s.To help with the expansion into security services, ServiceNow announced the acquisition of BrightPoint Security earlier this summer. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. San Mateo-based BrightPoint was founded in 2011 and was known as Vorstack until a year ago. BrightPoint is best known for its distributed analytics approach to cyber security prevention and detection. Its solutions help organizations identify and understand the level of an attack and measures to deal with it. ServiceNow plans to leverage the acquisition to enhance its cloud application offering so that its firms will benefit from the secure and controlled information sharing to rapidly prioritize and better deal with threats.Its stock is currently trading at $73.23 with a market cap of $11.93 billion. It has recovered from the 52-week low of $46 it had fallen to in February this year. It is still a far cry from the 52-week high of $91.28 it touched in December last year."

The company's Indian phone share is currently pegged around 2%. Tim Cook recently trumpeted the Indian market's long-term potential during a talk with Jim Cramer.WSJ: Bids for ""core"" Yahoo expected to come in at $2B-$3B, less than previously-expected $4B-$8B - For some reason, companies are cautious about bidding on a fragmented web media empire that has guided for ex-TAC revenue to drop to $3.4B-$3.6B this year from 2015's $4.1B and 2014's $4.4B, and operating income to drop to $150M-$250M from 2015's $342M and 2014's $755M. As the WSJ observes, companies could be low-balling their bids a bit in the initial rounds. Verizon (NYSE:VZ), which appears to have dreams of pairing Yahoo with AOL and other online media assets to create an ad rival to Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), is said to remain the front-runner.With Yahoo having closed on Thursday with a $35.1B market cap, the figures provided in the WSJ's report are a fresh reminder that Yahoo's 384M-share Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) stake (current pre-tax value of $30.1B) still has the biggest impact on its shares.Google will build its own VR headset, bring Android apps to Chrome OS in September - After unveiling its Daydream VR platform on Wednesday - it features headsets powered by compatible Android phones, supports a handheld controller, and is much more advanced than Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) current Cardboard VR platform - Google says it'll sell its own Daydream headset, thus competing with OEM partners such as Samsung, Xiaomi, HTC and Huawei. The company predicts hundreds of millions of phones will be Daydream-compatible in a couple of years, and hopes this will allow Daydream to turn into a mass-market platform.Meanwhile, Google says the Play Store (and with it, the store's Android apps) will be available on Chrome OS devices in September, and that it's working with OEMs to launch Chromebooks supporting Google Play out of the box. Exec Kan Liu: ""You're going to be able to get onto your Chromebook and have all your favorite Android apps, games, and media content.""It'll take some time for developers that wrote Android apps meant for handheld touch-only devices to optimize them for cheap non-touch PCs - not all Chromebooks fit this description, but most of them do - sporting keyboards and mice/trackpads. And of course, developers have to feel Chrome OS is important enough to justify the effort. But it's easy to see how Android's huge app ecosystem can boost Chrome OS' appeal to both consumers and businesses, as well as enable PC/tablet hybrids. As SA contributor Mark Hibben has observed, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) can't be thrilled about Google's efforts.Microsoft is prepping a ""Bing Concierge Bot"" that will compete with Google Assistant - A day after Google revealed a ""conversational"" assistant service (known as Google Assistant, accessible via both voice and a messaging app), ZDNet uncovered a Microsoft job posting indicating the company is prepping ""a highly intelligent productivity agent that communicates with the user over a conversation platform, such as Skype, Messenger, SMS, WhatsApp, Telegram, etc."" The agent ""runs errands on behalf of the user, by automatically completing tasks.""Plenty of competition exists: In addition to Google Assistant, there's Apple's Siri, Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa, and Facebook's M assistant for Messenger (still in beta), which combines human and AI-based assistant services. Microsoft can leverage its investments in Bing and Cortana, as well as its recently-launched Bot Framework, which lets third-party developer build Microsoft-hosted chatbot services for messaging apps.Separately, Microsoft has partnered with Sohu's (NASDAQ:SOHU) Sogou search unit (#3 in the Chinese market) to have Bing deliver English-language results on two vertical Sogou search services.Applied Materials surges on strong results/guidance; display and flash memory orders jump - The chip equipment giant's orders rose 52% Q/Q and 37% Y/Y in FQ2 to $3.45B, thanks in large part to a near-6x Y/Y increase in display equipment orders to $700M. CEO Gary Dickerson: ""In the display area, customers are moving to OLED, particularly in mobile, and that increases our total available market by a factor of three."" Apple has been widely rumored to be planning to launch iPhones sporting OLEDs in 2017.Also: 3D NAND flash memory investments led Applied's (NASDAQ:AMAT) flash-related orders to more than double Y/Y, and allowed total chip equipment orders to rise 15% to $1.97B in spite of weak foundry and DRAM-related orders. And solar segment orders (weak for a while) saw some improvement, more than doubling to $108M.Applied's numbers are an apparent positive for chip equipment peers such as Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), KLA-Tencor (NASDAQ:KLAC), ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) and Axcelis (NASDAQ:ACLS). They might also be some positive read-through for OLED materials and IP provider Universal Display (NASDAQ:OLED) and for industrial laser supplier Coherent (NASDAQ:COHR), which has strong OLED exposure.Brocade slumps after issuing weak FQ3 guidance, blames weak storage demand - In case you needed another datapoint indicating enterprise storage demand is weak - see also EMC and NetApp's recent numbers - Brocade (NASDAQ:BRCD) provided it. Thanks to weak storage networking (""SAN"") hardware demand, Brocade (issued an April quarter warning two weeks ago) is guiding for revenue to be down 6% Y/Y in FQ3 (the July quarter) at the midpoint of its range, not counting the impact of the pending Ruckus Wireless (NYSE:RKUS) acquisition. On the bright side, IP networking hardware revenue is expected to rebound in FQ3, and the Ruckus deal will lower Brocade's exposure to a SAN market pressured both by industry weakness and adoption of alternative storage architectures.Samsung Pay will work with Alipay - With Alipay a colossal force in the Chinese online payments market - it claims 450M registered Chinese users, and is only rivaled in China by Tencent's (OTCPK:TCEHY) WeChat Pay - it makes a lot of sense for Samsung Pay (enables in-store mobile payments, including via traditional magnetic stripe point-of-sale terminals) to partner with Alipay. There isn't yet a similar integration deal for Apple Pay.Uber tests a self-driving car in Pittsburgh - Uber's (NYSE:UBER) car, a modified Ford Fusion, is both collecting mapping data and ""testing its self-driving capabilities."" It relies on radar, laser scanners and high-res cameras, and follows an R&D partnership with Carnegie Mellon. Uber proclaims it thinks self-driving cars will eventually ""mean less congestion, more affordable and accessible transportation, and far fewer lives lost in car accidents.""They could also, of course, lower the ride-sharing leader's dependence on human drivers. The volumes of real-world driving data Uber has collected could help it successfully deploy a fleet of autonomous vehicles over the long run, whether those cars use Uber's own self-driving technology or that of third parties such as Google and incumbent automakers. There's speculation Apple's $1B investment in top Chinese ride-sharing provider Didi Chuxing was done in part to strengthen its autonomous driving efforts, particularly given China's embrace of the technology. Rival Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) has a self-driving car partnership with GM.Uber's self-driving car prototypeServiceNow expands into cloud customer service software, takes on Oracle and Salesforce - ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has become a top player in the cloud IT service management (""ITSM"") software space via cloud-based offerings that have taken share from on-premise software from the likes of HP Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) and CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA), and has gradually expanded into the broader IT operations management (""ITOM"") software space. It's now taking on customer service software incumbents such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) with a product differentiated by creating a closed-loop process that covers both engaging with customers (as traditional apps do) and resolving issues via collaboration with engineers, field service workers and others. A ServiceNow VP: ""It's a $9 billion market where no traditional vendor has 20 percent of the market.""Notable Tech Commentary And ReportsPayPal argues it can address over $100T worth of transactions - ""We're about a $10 billion business going after a $100 trillion market. It order to do that, we need to change our value proposition,"" said PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) CEO Dan Schulman at his company's analyst day. Worth noting: PayPal's 2015 payment volume was actually $81.5B (+23% Y/Y), from which the company derived $2.6B in revenue (+17%).Regardless, PayPal still only accounts for a small portion of the non-cash transaction activity of its average user. The online payments giant argues it can benefit from a ""flywheel effect"" in which greater consumer reliance on PayPal's services strengthens its merchant ties and vice versa. It's looking to up-sell merchants on services such as loyalty programs, in-store purchases and financing, while boosting consumer usage via its mobile-friendly One Touch checkout option (lets consumers avoid having to re-enter their login, billing and shipping info). Apple Pay, Stripe (used for payments within Facebook and Twitter's apps) and others also provide fairly painless approaches to paying on smartphones/tablets.Deutsche: iPhone prices are often much higher overseas - Among other things, Deutsche found an iPhone 6 costs (relative to the U.S.) 56% more in Brazil, 31% more in India, 22% more in France and Germany and 16% more in China. Local taxes and tariffs tend to be the biggest culprit. The figures provide some additional context to Apple's efforts to move downmarket by launching the iPhone SE (starts at $399 in the U.S.) and trying to sell used iPhones in emerging markets.Prices for the same iPhone 6 model in various marketsIDC: Chromebook sales top Mac sales in U.S. for first time - With IDC having estimated Q1 U.S. Mac shipments totaled 1.77M (+5.6% Y/Y and good for a 13% unit share), the firm's comments might mean Chromebook shipments were around 2M (unit share around 15%?). One big caveat: Macs are still likely well ahead of Chromebooks in terms of U.S. revenue, given Apple had a calendar Q1 Mac ASP of $1,266 and most Chromebooks are sub-$300 devices.IDC's remarks do, however, show how Chromebooks have been grabbing share from low-end Windows devices, thanks to a strong position in the education (K-12) vertical. And the September arrival of Android apps on Chrome OS could provide a fresh boost.Pew: Only 15% of Americans have used ride-hailing apps and only 11% have used home-sharing services - Uber was valued at $62.5B in its latest funding round and Airbnb (AIRB) at $25.5B. But Pew Research's survey data suggests the vast majority of Americans have never used either. Those investing in the companies at current valuations are clearly betting on much higher long-term penetration rates, both in the U.S. and elsewhere.Also of interest: Pew found only 64% of those who use a ride-hailing service daily or weekly own a personal vehicle, compared with 78% of those who use one less frequently or not at all.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Sales and marketing expenses increased 44% to $158.6 million, and R&D spend increased 32% to $65.9 million. Billings grew 41% to $376.7 million.By segment, first-quarter revenues from subscriptions grew 48.7% over the year to $267.4 million, and professional services revenues increased 20% to $38.45 million. The company now has 249 customers with an average contract value over $1 million, a net increase of 19 in the quarter.By region, revenue from North America was $211 million, EMEA was $74 million, and Asia-Pacific and other was $21 million.For the second quarter, ServiceNow expects revenues between $332 million and $335 million or a growth of 37% to 39%, and billings between $370 million and $375 million. Analysts expect revenue of $333.8 million.ServiceNow expects to end 2016 with revenues between $1.355 billion and $1.38 billion or a growth of 35% to 37%, and billings to grow around 33% to $1.6 billion, just in line with analyst estimates. Analysts expect ServiceNow to end 2016 with an EPS of $0.63 on revenue of $1.37 billion.End of Legal Tussles for ServiceNowServiceNow was involved in patent litigation tussles. In a welcome development, ServiceNow has resolved these disputes. ServiceNow announced last month that:ServiceNow was accused of infringing on seven BMC patents and BMC had received a favorable ruling that gave it an edge over ServiceNow in the proceedings.ServiceNow's AcquisitionsStrategic acquisitions are a better bet for ServiceNow right now. In early April, ServiceNow acquired cloud management provider ITapp for an undisclosed sum. ITapp is currently used by cloud platforms like VMware (NYSE:VMW), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, OpenStack and Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS) XenServer. The ITapp acquisition is expected to strengthen ServiceNow's cloud platform management portfolio. ITapp is expected to be integrated into the ServiceNow platform by 2017.The cloud management space is seeing consolidation. Earlier, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) announced the acquisition of CliQr Technologies, an application-centric hybrid cloud management software provider.Last quarter saw ServiceNow's stock plunge even after beating analyst expectations and crossing $1 billion in annual revenue. This quarter however saw it regaining its market value. Its stock is currently trading at $67.28 with a market cap of $10.96 billion. It hit a 52-week low of $46 in early February and its 52-week high of $91.28 in December 2015."
4051022,24992,2017-03-01T12:32:37-05:00,Company operating with a strong negative correlation between revenue and net income.New share issues have diluted shareholders 17% annually since 2012.Highly improbable that company will meet market's net income expectations over next 12 months.,"Shares of ServiceNow Inc. (NYSE:NOW) are up about 60% over the past 12 months, and this puts current and prospective shareholders on the horns of a dilemma. Should they take the money and run or should they let profits rise at this point? In my view, it makes sense to look upon this run-up in price as the result of mania and get out now and/or avoid the shares. The reasons are related to the fact that, as the company increases revenue, it increases its losses at a similar rate. Perhaps more important are the very optimistic expectations baked into the price at these levels.The Financials: At What Point Do Rising Sales Turn This Company Profitable?The negative relationship between revenue and net income at ServiceNow is one of the strongest I've seen. Since 2012, the correlation between revenue and net income has an r-value of -.958, which means that the more this company sells, the further net income falls. It's as close to a perfectly negative correlation between revenue and net income. It prompts a question: if rising revenue won't increase profitability, what on Earth will?Comparing 2015 to 2016 demonstrates the tenuous relationship between revenue and net income quite starkly. Revenue rose by 38% between 2015 and 2016, but the net loss plummeted from $198 million to $451 million. Even if we give the company the benefit of the doubt and strip out the $270 million legal expense (as if that was paid with monopoly money), the net loss was only decreased by $16.6 million, in spite of the fact that revenue rose by more than $300 million.It's strange, but I need to remind investors that we are compensated by net income. Rising revenues are nice, but the source of all sustainable investor returns from rising book value to dividends is net income. Without it, sooner or later the air will be let out of a stock.Investors can take some consolation in the fact that earnings per share may not look as bad, as there are now about 90 million more shares outstanding than there were in 2012. Dilution is a problem most of the time, but it can hide the growing losses when investors focus in on EPS numbers.Stock-Based CompensationStock-based compensation is the reason for both the large and growing expenses and the dilution seen by shareholders over the last five years. Unfortunately, stock-based compensation is, in some sense, part of the DNA of this business and we shouldn't expect it to abate anytime soon.In terms of specifics about how important stock-based compensation is for the ongoing existence of this business, consider the following. While revenue has grown at a CAGR of about 42% since 2012, stock-based compensation has grown at a CAGR of 62%. This has resulted in the massive dilution we've seen as well as the high level of lingering expenses. In order to understand management's motivations here, you need to look at the statement of cash flows. Since 2012, the company has generated about $750 million in cash flow from operations. This is impressive in a way, but it doesn't get to the cash generating capacity of this business. I want to see what will happen when the business can no longer use its own stock as a kind of ersatz currency. If we assume that the expenses covered by ""stock-based compensation"" had to be paid in cash, the company actually generated a negative $74 million in cash from operations. This is particularly troublesome because there's nothing on the horizon to suggest that this situation will reverse itself.DepreciationAlthough stock-based compensation is the reason for growing expenses and shareholder dilution, there are other problems here, obviously. The nature of this business is such that many of their assets become economically obsolete more rapidly than some other businesses. It's an economic fact of life that computer equipment has a much shorter useful life than, say, a railway locomotive. Thus, the depreciation expense imposed on this business is reasonable in that it suggests real economic deterioration and the need for nearly constant upgrade. If, in addition to striping out stock-based compensation, you additionally strip out the depreciation expense, the cash from operations numbers look even worse, obviously. Removing the (in my view, artificial) depreciation ""add back"" makes the negative cash from operations balloon from $74 million to just shy of $300 million.The StockModeling the stock's price is exceedingly difficult at this point, as there's no anchor on which to base a valuation. Economic losses mount the more the company sells, and shareholders get diluted as new shares hit the market at a CAGR of about 17%. In this environment, the only way I can model the stock price is by trying to unbundle what the market is expecting and use that as the basis of a judgment about the shares. If the market has reasonable expectations about the growth of this business, perhaps shares aren't overpriced. Unfortunately, that's not the case.At the moment, the forward PE for ServiceNow is about 55. If we hold all else constant (including both price and the number of shares), that means that the market is forecasting EPS of about $1.59 from this company over the next 12 months. In order to do this, the company would generate net income of about $261 million of net income, up from its current $450 million loss.This is theoretically possible, in the way that it's theoretically possible that I win the Boston Marathon next year. Theoretically possible is a far stretch from ""likely"" and thus I conclude that it's probably not going to happen. In my view, this expectation is extraordinarily optimistic, and optimism is, over time, punished.Technical SnapshotAs per our ChartMasterPro Daily Price Model the trend for NOW turned Bearish on February 24 when the shares closed below the daily uptrend line which began on February 3. From here, we see the shares dropping to the $75.00 level.Today, we will purchase the NOW 19MAY17 87.50 Put Options which will provide us with approximately 7x leverage on our SHORT trade. Our initial stop-loss exit signal for the trade will be a daily close above $90.00.For investors in the shares, we recommend that you SELL to avoid any further share price depreciation.ConclusionIn order to justify the current stock price, investors have to assume a very rosy future for this company. They have to assume that ServiceNow will suddenly buck a five-year trend and turn rising revenue into rising net income. They must assume that management will actually stem dilution at some future point by buying back some shares.Bulls continue to assume that revenue matters more than anything else, and that is faulty reasoning in my view. I'm waiting for the time when excessively optimistic investors only care about pro forma revenue, or they might eventually focus only on management guidance. Most probably, investors are excited about the nature of this business because it's more exciting or has some other properties that boringly profitable businesses lack. It is true that ServiceNow is more interesting than some businesses. The one thing many boring businesses do have, though, is the capacity to generate large and growing profits. Since profits are what we care about, and since this company shows no signs of being able to generate them, I recommend avoiding these admittedly interesting shares."
3997315,98236,2016-08-08T13:51:05-04:00,"ServiceNow still remains close to the cusp of a growth slowdown, although its strategy seems to be delaying the inevitable for a bit longer than I might have earlier anticipated.ServiceNow reported its Q2 results about 10 days ago. On the surface, all looked well and analysts cheered and the shares did nothing.The company has not materially increased its forecast for the balance of the year and some are concerned about potential deceleration in growth.The company did achieve some decent margin improvement but is now forecasting increased ""investment"" in operating expense in the balance of the year.The growth in the company's core business has apparently seen a material slowdown as yet unacknowledged by some.","The biggest problem is there are too few problems!That isn't entirely true. A couple of quarters ago, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) did indeed have some issues. For a company like this, missing bookings targets for two quarters in a row is not something to be ignored. Much of this article is going to be concerned with what has changed in the last several months and to what extent the share price appreciation since the February nadir has left any potential positive alpha going forward. I wrote about the potential inflection point for this company being hard to call a month later. Self-evidently, my article, in terms of the specifics was premature and the shares have, to a greater or lesser extent, reflected that reality. Inflection points are hard to call and March 15th was the time to be calling that for ServiceNow. And while there are some straws in the wind, just how strong these straws may be is still in question. I am inclined to believe, for reasons laid out later in this article, that Q3 forecasts by the company reflect some unique elements of conservatism that are likely to produce either upsides to various metrics or at least in line results. I am less certain that will be the case in Q4, but in any event, the company is forecasting a slowing of some significant growth metrics in Q4, and if it comes out that way, I think the expectations for 2017 are going to have to be reset lower. In the nature of things, forecasting a surprise in anything is well… a difficult undertaking because it is a surprise. But I still think it is coming and more likely coming in 2017, and I lay out some of the reasons for that projection in the balance of this article.One thing of note is that given this company's size and its valuation, there would seemingly be no denouement that includes its acquisition by anyone. The company has a negligible free cash flow such that it will never make a P/E screen. I simply do not see the revenue synergies that would ever justify this company as a target of a strategic acquirer.It has to be noted, that despite the quarter that was printed, which was a beat on most financial metrics, the shares sold off in the immediate wake of the announcement. And while the quarter was hardly unsuccessful, neither was it a singularly impressive success-based on the results necessary to sustain the valuation. Hyper-valuation needs hyper-growth, and as will be seen, the hyper-growth for NOW is not quite what might seem to be the case just looking at a few headlines. At the moment, the EV/S based on the consensus for the current year is 9.1X while the free cash yield for this year, based on the management projection of a 12% free cash flow margin for the 2016 is 1.36%. There are more highly valued names no doubt, but NOW is pushing the upper bound of what might be considered ""normal."" for hyper-growth companies.The goal of the articles is to find those names that will either generate or fall below the goal of generating positive alpha. If I were evaluating NOW in the abstract and didn't concern myself regarding share price performance, I would almost certainly come to different conclusions regarding how it was doing and its outlook, but to readers the goal isn't to evaluate companies but to evaluate stocks. Beauty really will be in the eyes of different beholders.In the week or so since the earnings were released, the shares have contracted marginally while the IGV software index rose 1%. Taking a bit longer perspective back to my first published report, the shares are up 23% compared to the appreciation of the IGV of about 15%. The shares needed two exceptional quarters to earn 800 bps of positive alpha. Over the past 12 months, the shares are actually flat and the IGV has appreciated by 9%.For most of that time and certainly in the past several months, the average consensus analyst rating has been a relatively strong 1.8 which is between buy and strong buy and the current consensus price target represents an appreciation expectation for the next 12 months of 13.5%. Overall, analysts are estimating that the growth rates for most metrics are going to decelerate to 32% by the end of the year and to 30% for all of next year. The issue for the shares is one of valuation. The shares now have a P/E of more than 115X non-GAAP earnings and are selling for 74X the consensus EPS for 2017. The EV/S projected for this year is 8.8X and the metric is at 6.8X based on the 2016 consensus revenue forecast. With those kinds of valuation metrics, it has proven to be difficult to put together a story that has been credible for many prospective investors that has successfully resonated in terms of higher share prices.From the perspective of this writer, trying to look forward evaluate the strategy of the company in its attempt to diversify its portfolio is also going to be a theme of the article. But for the moment, I want to take a look at the latest earnings report and the one before and see how it is ""On the Sunny Side of the Street.""The Sunny Side of the StreetThe song dates to 1930 and was composed by Dorothy Fields, one of the greatest but now sadly unknown composers of her day. It is a jazz standard that leapt into my imagination when I wanted to update the article I had initially published on NOW back in March. The relevant lyrics of the song talk about leaving worries on your doorstep and how sweet life is on the sunny side of the street, with gold dust at my feet. It was perhaps not the best of times to write such a song or perhaps it was, but it became a runaway success in a nation that would be wracked with years more of a vicious and soul deadening depression. For those of you who have never heard it, it is a very upbeat melody and must have been even more so when entering the distressed homes of the 1930s. And for the most part, results for NOW this past quarter and the one before have represented a journey to the sunny side of the street.For the record, total revenues grew by 38% for the quarter just ended and were up 41% for the first 6 months of the year. Subscription revenues grew 45% last quarter and grew by 47% for the first 6 months of the year. That is a slight deceleration, but the operative word is slight and the fact is that most companies will never see 45% product revenue growth and at the scale that NOW has achieved.Most intriguing, at least to this writer, is that 40% of the company's increase in net new annual contract value (ACV) came from outside service management. This is one of those cases of the glass being either half full or half empty. And no one can really know at this point which it is! This compares to 24% in the year earlier quarter. IT Operations Management (ITOM) was the second largest set of products contributing 13% to ACV this just reported quarter up from 10% in the prior year.For reasons not specifically known to this writer, the company does not provide a specific ACV metric in its press release. CEO Frank Slootman was asked about that metric and its split between the company's foundation which is the IT Service Management space (ITSM) and said on the call that he would not be prepared to make more disclosure, ""I am not going to talk about growth in terms of ACV with Service Management."" This writer interpreted the comment to imply that the net ACV for Service Management was significantly less than might have been previously guessed. There are observers and readers who will doubtless reach different conclusions.If the overall math is right, then it would appear that ITSM showed an ACV growth of only 10% or so, probably the lowest it has been since the company went public. On the other hand, the ACV growth for everything else was above 100%. The growth rate in ITSM is far more sustainable given at 10% or less; on the other hand, the growth rate of everything else at the elevated levels that were recorded in Q2 is most likely not sustainable.One thing to note, however, is that 24 out of 26 large deals still had an ITSM component and this company leads conversations with ITSM. If the ITSM wheelhouse continues to weaken as the above numbers may well suggest (that statement is likely to be one that would be challenged by many, but I cannot think of what else one would call the significant and highly visible drop in growth rate but a weakening), will the other solutions be enough to pick up the slack?This company has a dominant position in ITSM and it has a strong position in the ancillary fields of security. It doesn't sell firewalls; its security offering is part of spotting anomalies in the overall workflow of service management and is hence easy to sell. But beyond service management and security of service management are the new frontiers for this company. Still very small these days and to a greater or lesser extent nascent - but the areas that have to succeed as the core of the company's business begins to show so some signs of ageing. The growth of the non-ITSM categories is likely to be dispositive with regards to the future for the growth rate of the company and the future performance of the sharesOverall, the company's guidance on its conference call was consistent with the revenue trends of the most recent quarter. It should be noted that as the company gets larger, more and more of subscription bookings are going to come from renewals, and as the average installed life of the product continues to increase, it is more than likely that users are going to attempt to negotiate renewal discounts. Every user is well aware that there are few costs other than sales commissions related to renewals and they will be threatening to the final minute to find alternative solutions for workloads. This proved to be one of the more contentious points of the Q2 conference call - or at least as contentious as these conference calls get to be.The company is planning to accelerate its spend on both research and development and on sales and marketing. Perhaps overlooked by some in the current after-glow euphoria is that the company reported it had some issues of deals at the end of the quarter that perhaps related to subscription bookings growth decelerating in this past quarter. The company CFO Michael Scarpelli put it his way, ""Once again, these were renewals that were supposed to have renewed right at the end of the quarter, and it was delays in procurement organizations who tried to renegotiate deals many times, (but the slipped deals) they've been signed already."" Further in his answer, Mr. Scarpelli said that, ""There's deals that get pushed and pulled every quarter on the renewal side. I would say this quarter they tended to be more that got pushed."" Is that an issue? Could it be that the lower level of bookings growth in the last half of 2015 had to with that (never discussed at the time) and that the significant upswing in bookings growth in both the March quarter and the quarter just ended had to do with strong renewals. Again, the transparency isn't there for outside observers to really know. It is those kinds of issues which might be troubling to some including this writer.It should be noted that because this company generates all of its product revenues from subscriptions, it doesn't matter significantly when a deal is signed; acquisition arrangements are charged on a daily basis. The issue only shows up in billings and bookings and it may be that the forecast of a progressive decline in the percentage growth of those numbers, particularly in Q4, is a consequence of issues in getting renewals contracted for at prices sought by the company.If I were a suspicious individual or one who looked for the darned old cockroach under every rock, some of the above might be troubling. Why might it be, that if there were deals scheduled for Q2 that pushed and pulled down bookings growth, and those deals have now been signed in Q3, where they were not supposed to be, that the company might not expect an acceleration in bookings? At the mid-point that is not the forecast of the company. Mr. Scarpelli danced effectively on a question that was essentially on that point. As I mentioned earlier in this article, this is one of the factors that leads me to believe that an inflection point, particularly in terms of revenue metrics, is unlikely to be seen in Q3 results.In any event, the net of the dance is that overall, the company is not forecasting materially different performance in either revenues or in EPS than its outlook had been before the quarter was reported. Nonetheless, 5 analysts out of the 29 analysts who provide estimates to First Call raised their expectations. I am not quite sure how that may have happened, but despite estimate increases and an ebullient market overall, the shares were unable to gain headway.The next set of all numbers will all be GAAP. It is not really worth analyzing cost comparisons any other way, in this writer's opinion since pretending not to be paying people by paying them with stock… well, it is what it is, particularly in trying to analyze year-on-year changes in cost ratiosGross margins in Q2 were 71.7%, up 400 bps from 67.6% in Q2 2015. That is really a significant attainment and understates the improvement in product gross margins as service gross margins were under quite a bit of pressure. Sales and marketing expense was 54.6% and that was down was 90 bps from the year earlier. Research and development costs at 20.5% also improved by about 100 bps from the prior year level. General and administrative costs dropped by almost 200 bps to 10.6%. Overall, operating losses improved to negative 14.1% compared to 21.6% the prior year. The company has a negligible GAAP tax rate of less than 10%. Overall, with the average share count at about 164 million, up from 154 million in the prior year, the per share for the quarter loss shrunk to $.30 from $.40.Stock-based comp represented 23% of total revenues. Stock-based comp which was up by 18% year on year growing just half as fast as total revenues. Stock-based comp increased by $3 million or just 4% sequentially. While this quarter's growth in stock-based comp was far slower than in the recent past, and while stock-based comp is down as a percentage from the year earlier period, some of the comments on the conference call in terms of accelerating hiring suggest to me that these improvements may not prove to be permanent.The company has a reasonably healthy balance sheet, with cash and equivalents totaling $807 million, about unchanged from the start of the year. Long-term investments declined, however. The declines in cash balances were primarily due to the need to help fund an acquisition consummated in Q2 coupled with the significant legal settlements with BMC and Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPE) during the quarter. The company has $491 million of convertible debt outstanding.The growth in deferred revenues is at moderate levels for a company such as this and the company indicated some decline in the length of its average contract signings. Deferred revenues are at 204% of revenues last quarter and that compares to a ratio of 240% in the prior year. I believe that the reasonable expectation for a company such as this is to see the ratio rise rather than fall and this does reflect a couple of quarters of disappointing bookings in the recent pastThe company's cash flow from operations was muddied by accruals relating to some legal settlements for patent infringement claims. Overall, the company paid $270 million in aggregate during the quarter to both BMC and Hewlett Packard EnterpriseThe not so sunny side of the streets in the future!To be sure, I have mentioned some causes for concern or for pause earlier in this article. But there are a few things that were perhaps a bit more telling, at least in the way I read tea leaves. Again, I would almost certainly come to a different set of perspectives if the valuation were lower - when the valuation is at the levels it is, and the margins are where they are or seem likely to be going, it really isn't the most prudent of strategies, ""to leave your troubles on your doorstep and just direct your feet…""One of the issues that I have, and I think it is a self-evident one, is that the company's future growth is predicated on selling its user base almost all of its product portfolio. At the moment, more and more of the company's revenues are coming from upselling, an issue that was discussed on the call. The CFO said the statistic would no longer be disclosed because, as the company had grown, it represented more and more of the total performance. Exactly why that meant the statistic shouldn't be disclosed unless it suggested an inability to close large new name deals, this writer does not know.In any event, the company's growth projection is based on taking the average annual revenue of its large installed customers - the Global 2000 from $941k to $2 million between now and 2020. I am going to say that it is both a very ambitious and a very tendentious target and leaves me more than a bit of a doubting Thomas.Here is an answer that left me more than a bit uncomfortable. Michael Scarpelli said to the call audience:Why do I find that a worrying commentary? Well, again, pulling revenues forward ought to mean seeing an upside in something-bookings, billings reported revenues, something. But it isn't there - at least not in the company guidance. But what is there is a slowdown in growth expectations for Q4. That is what might be expected to happen if you pull forward some revenue elements from Q4 to Q3. And what is the organic level of bookings growth. I am the last person to deprecate a strategy of acquiring around a core set of competencies and all successful software company's do it and need to do it, but I wonder what that might say about the state of demand for the company's core technology?The company articulated that its ITOM business was one of its major opportunities and it has made some significant investments into the space both through acquisition and through accelerated internal development. But the fact is that IT Operations management, which is all about automating help desks, is not either something new or something particularly unique in the service world. For much of its life, NOW has been the beneficiary of its competitors and in particular BMC Software and its Remedy suite of products. BMC has been one of the more generous of share donors on the planet and NOW has been its favored recipient-particularly in this space.So now, a lawsuit that alleged that NOW misappropriated BMC's code in this particular space has been settled, NOW is accelerating its development spend in this area and this area is that which has to support much of the company's future growth. Is that worrisome - even a little? The same scenario is true with regards to Hewlett's Service Manager offering. Somnolence on the part of competitors is a consummation devoutly to be wished, but for investors to rely on it as a basis for valuing an investment strikes this writer as a bit in the same category of going skydiving without a parachute, although I saw a photo of such an accomplishment recently.But in addition to competitors BMC and HPE, there is Computer Associates and there is VMware (NYSE:VMW) Service Manager and then there are a huge cohort of other vendors who are active in this space with offerings that are quite comparable or perhaps even better depending on some particular feature/function mix.My issue is that this is a crowded space, it is somewhat mature and there is nothing hugely better (or to be fair worse) about what NOW is offering. And it has awoken two very large and dangerous competitors who can readily roam the neighborhood if they are sufficiently energized.These days, NOW offers a significant suite of what it describes as Business Management tools. The word ""Manage"" is one of the most overused terms amongst IT marketers and there are those who readily adopt to the lexicon. But what is being talked about is the ability to use the data that is generated by trouble tickets and service desk logs and use it to prioritize which issues and which applications are given the focus of resources. If that sounds as though it might have been done in the past, the reason is because it has. Again, Remedy pioneered many of these solutions 15 years ago.One question on the call suggested that some of the new NOW - which are confusedly labeled as CRM offerings - compete against those of Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and thus suggest a dramatic expansion in the TAM for this company. Without a lengthy discussion to which some readers may take exception, this company isn't trying to accomplish the same set of functions that Salesforce sells. This company sells software that looks at IT processes on a holistic basis and helps users prioritize and automate the resolution of performance issues. That is an interesting market and one that is very important to IT managers and leaders. This company doesn't try to go after selling solutions that address the business processes themselves. The TAM for what it sells is large, but in the nature of things, far less sizeable than the TAM for application software.What seems to have happened is that as NOW has matched its established competitors in capability it has and continues to be able to sell these capabilities, primarily to its installed base and to increase its revenue per customer significantly. The issue isn't whether or not this is a good strategy-it surely is and it is surely the only strategy with even a chance of success. The issue for me isn't whether the strategy is wise but how far the strategy can carry NOW and its growth rate.I clearly erred back in March in my belief that NOW had reached an inflection point visible to the naked eye. That hasn't happened. But there are some issues below the headlines that lead me to believe that the inflection point is a lot closer at hand than is indicated by the valuation. Inflection points are hard to call, but I still see the denouement for ServiceNow as the same as I forecast in March - just delayed.Summing Up!One must, in terms of evaluating NOW, acknowledge the fantastic job it has done in dislodging BMC from its long held position of primacy in the ITSM space. Few would have forecast that denouement back in 2009 and this team and in particular the company founder, Frank Luddy, who has announced his retirement, have to be credited with knocking off the home team against high odds. But at the least, the team on the field has to compete against far too many other teams to sustain a growth rate necessary to achieve positive alpha."

If you sift through the 40-plus public SaaS businesses, you won't find mention of annual recurring revenue, churn, account expansion, or cash collection cycles in most of them - even though these are the the metrics the management teams employ to evaluate and steer their businesses.ServiceNow hasn't published metrics on ARR or payback period, which for most public investors are still esoteric terms. Instead they frame their growth in three parts, familiar to SaaS operators everywhere: land + expand + retain. The image above shows Q1's triptych of new customer additions, expansion as a percentage of new quarterly bookings and quarterly dollar revenue retention.A second slide reveals the contract length for each element of the growth trio - 32-month average contract duration for new business, 23-26 month for upsell and renewal.At a $1B in annual revenue and nearly $12B market cap, ServiceNow is the third most valuable public SaaS company after Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY). And with an average contract value of roughly $300k, ServiceNow falls squarely into the enterprise segment of SaaS businesses.ServiceNow's effort to communicate to investors how the management team measures and guides the business in straightforward terms, rather than industry jargon, is an important step in educating the market on the differences between subscription software companies and traditional licensed software businesses.In addition, SaaS startups might also benefit from segmenting their reports in this way, particularly as the business scales and the fraction of revenue from renewals and expansion outpace new bookings."
3958568,98236,2016-03-15T14:17:04-04:00,ServiceNow has missed its bookings targets for two quarters in a row.Bookings growth has slowed materially.The company is trying to achieve organic growth of 34% in a market space that is thought to be growing by 16%.The company's Q4 cash flow was primarily the product of a rapid increase in stock-based comp. coupled with a rapid growth in accrued expenses.It seems likely that over the next 12 months the company will reach an inflection point with significantly slowing growth ahead and with valuations starting a significant decline as well.,"Forecasting an Inflection PointThere are many challenges we all face through life. In my case, forcing myself away from the dining room table before consuming an extra amount of pasta is a big challenge. Other challenges might include attempting to accumulate capital in a high tax economy or trying to break 100 for a round of golf. Given time, we might all think of things that we find really difficult to do and things we wish we could do better.There are many challenging elements of trying to be more of an analyst than a reporter. It has been something close to 20 years now since Reg. FD made its ugly appearance on the scene and significantly reduced the value of corporate communications. The insider trading ""scandals"" over the past several years have made it treacherous to try to seek out ""anecdotal sources"" for much more than a gut check. The deterioration of the IPO market has reduced the funding for brokerage research efforts. Not too surprisingly as compensation has decreased, so has the quality of the analysis that gets done.I personally think that the most difficult thing that any analyst/commentator can attempt to do is to try to call an inflection point. And yet I think that there has been a significant inflection point reached at ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) that is worthy of exploration. The inflection point isn't all that easy to see just yet. NOW reported what might have been considered to be a decent quarter by many observers. Most of the traditional financial metrics looked fine although stock-based compensation at 25% of revenues is going to catch the attention of most observers. But for me, the most foreboding sign was the continued decline in the percentage growth in bookings.NOW reported its latest quarterly earnings on January 27th and the day after its shares declined by 17%. There is a significant problem in identifying how much of the decline related to sales of NOW by disappointed investors and how much of the pullback was to reprice NOW in line with the substantial repricing that had already taken place in much of the tech stock world.Prior to January 27, NOW shares were down by less than 12% from the start of the year. To an extent, therefore, some of the 17% decline was more like catch-up than a response to an earnings disappointment. NOW shares continued their decline after January 27th. They wound up making a low in early February of $46/share that was just slightly greater than half the $91 high the shares achieved as recently as December 4th, 2015.Looking at cloud software vendors is really not at all like looking at other vendors of tech or of almost anything else. Over time, that will become more and more apparent to more and more people, and perhaps the FASB will see fit to significantly alter what are considered Generally Accepted Accounting Practices for these kinds of companies. But till that day, I urge investors to consider bookings/billings as a much better indication of real sales growth and to look at operating and free cash flow as a reasonable substitute for an earnings metric that does little to even try to match revenues and expenses.Billings for ServiceNow came to $365 million for the quarter, still greater than reported revenues of $286 million. But billings came in at $8 million below the prior consensus forecast and the billings growth rate decelerated to 33% for the quarter compared to 51% for the year. Billings growth was 48% and 50%, respectively, for the first two quarters of 2015 and 38% and 33% for the last two quarters of the year. I think there is very little doubt that if NOW had reported that kind of progression in actual sales growth, the shares would have declined far more than they have thus far and for that matter reported earnings would be far less than they were.I think that operating cash flow is the other important metric to look at in these companies. But as is often the case, the devil is in the details. The raw numbers look fine. Operating cash flow more than doubled in Q4 from about $47 million to $105 million. But the problem is that the doubling of cash flow was a function of two disturbing trends. Stock-based comp. went from $46 million to $68 million. And accrued expenses more than doubled to $21 million. Those two items accounted for $33 million out of the $58 million improvement in operating cash flow. Obviously, the doubling of accrued expenses is not a typical part of a cash flow statement. When 20% of operating cash flow comes from higher accrued expenses, I think it's fair to say that the quality of the cash flow has deteriorated. But when stock-based comp. makes up 65% of cash flow and when stock-based comp. has risen as a percentage of revenue to more than 25% for the year and 24% for the quarter, it might perhaps be an indication that not all is well at ServiceNow.The company didn't act like it had reached an inflection point on its conference call - Why do you think you know better than the company?Basically ServiceNow sells Information Technology Management Solutions (ITSM) solutions although it has extended the use cases of its core solutions into adjacent market spaces. I'm not going to pretend that writing about ITSM is one of the more interesting topics that might be chosen as part of an article aimed at appealing to investors. But it is what ServiceNow does and both the space and NOW's market share are really going to determine its future share. price.Boring though ITSM may be, the fact remains that users actually need ITSM if they are to have a functioning IT effort. It may be more interesting to write about watches and iPhones but not ITSM, not IT. That is both a bad thing and a good thing. It is a great thing in that users need some solution other than service tickets and pegs. But because they do, the space is basically saturated. No doubt, there are exceptions to the rule and on its call NOW talked about a couple of examples. But, for the most part, there are no new name users of significance left to close. New bookings are either the function of users replacing installed ITSM infrastructure as part of an upgrade process or of users migrating to the cloud and choosing a new vendor.ITSM is not the most glamorous business in the world and it has been around for a terribly long time now. The first heavyweight in the space was BMC Software which was founded as far back as 1980. The cloud-based ITSM market which is really the wheelhouse of ServiceNow is thought by a leading market research firm to have a CAGR of 16% through 2019. The major players in the space are large, quite slow moving and have enjoyed little growth in recent years. Of course, the notable exception to that trend has been ServiceNow. The large players in the space include CA (NASDAQ:CA), BMC (Private), IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE). These are all companies struggling to migrate their legacy ITSM offerings to the cloud and all of them have been share donors to CRM for a significant period of time.The growth of NOW until recently has been the result of their pioneer role in the cloud-based ITSM market. Most recently, however, the growth has been a function of superior sales execution against a host of very weak competitors. A Gartner survey suggests that NOW has less completeness of vision than BMC but can execute better which means essentially that NOW continues to gain market share despite no longer having quite the best solution. A study by IDC that is a year older had given NOW top ranking although it was apparently based more on the capabilities the company has developed outside of the core service management space and its overall rapid growth. Forrester has apparently not published a Magic Quadrant on the space and its text analysis reprises that of almost all of the other research vendors. I think, overall, based on what I have been able to glean from all of these studies is that NOW has been able to gain share in ITSM consistently for many years now but that much of its growth in future years has to come from selling its help desk technology outside the core service management area.One thing that is relatively clear from all of the commentary is that NOW has enjoyed a significant lead on its competitors in terms of its sales capabilities. Competing against BMC, HPE and CA has been relatively easy. One issue cited by one of the research services was that BMC didn't always return calls asking for sales presentations. BMC's sales force issues go back many years now. On the other hand, the CEO and sales management at NOW are known as among the toughest group of sales competitors in the industry. Frank Slootman came to NOW after he had sold Data Domain to EMC. He had built Data Domain into a voracious and successful sales machine over the span of a few years and he was able to turn the success he had achieved into engineering a great take-out price for Data Domain. The founder of Service Now, Fred Luddy, who was a key executive at both Peregrine and Remedy, remains the Chief Product Officer at the company. When the competitive advantage of a company is its sales momentum and its sales tactics, assessing an inflection point will never be clear. The CEO, in this case, is not too surprisingly a partisan for his company and for his sales team and will never acknowledge that other competitors are closing the gap.It isn't easy to hire great sales people. BMC has learned that the hard way on more than one occasion. But BMC is now private with a different set of incentives and goals that cannot be achieved if it remains the ponderous, slow moving, unlovely enterprise that it had been for many years. HPE, as well, has a new structure that perhaps will allow it to compete more effectively in the space. It certainly has the technology, part of it bought (Opsware) and part internally developed. The issue for HPE is going to be the focus and the resources that it chooses to bring to bear on the space. And then there is CA about which little ought to be said. CA has shown no signs of arousing from its torpor in any of the spaces in which it competes and I wouldn't expect much to change there any time soon. There are a host of smaller companies in the space, of which perhaps the most significant is Atlassian Corp. (NASDAQ:TEAM) whose JIRA family of products is said by some to offer unique advantages in the ITSM space. But it would take one of these competitors arousing from their slumber or generating some of its own sales momentum to throw ServiceNow's booking targets off significantly.Last quarter, Mr. Slootman explained that the bookings miss was due to FX issues and to the inaccurate roll-up of the sales forecast by the financial team. The first explanation is possible I suppose, although really not all that likely within the space of two months. The second explanation… well you be the judge. I have heard misses blamed on many, many things from the lack of special fax paper to a salesman not understanding daylight savings time. This explanation is more creative than many and rings about as hollow as the other explanations did when I heard them.Forecasted billings growth for this quarter is in the range of 35%, about the attainment for billings growth in the just ended quarter which might suggest that what really is happening is that the company is shifting its growth curve down significantly from the recent past. Indeed, total billings in Q1 are forecast to be below total billings in Q4, a seasonal pattern more typical of maturing vendors. At best, I think it will become increasingly difficult for management to explain slowing bookings growth and maintain share values.Mass Mesmerism Alert - Has NOW managed to relieve investors of their ability to analyze valuations?NOW has an enterprise value of just shy of $10 billion at the present time, despite the pullback in the shares. That valuation creates an EV/S of over 7 based on analyst consensus estimates for 2016. The comparable number for 2017 is 5.5X. The company's valuation isn't being supported by non-GAAP earnings consensus estimates which are $.63 this year and $1.00 in 2017. Remember as well that non-GAAP earnings are a function of an unusually high level of stock-based comp. When 25% of revenues are stock-based comp., it really suggests that the potential dilution will be more than noticeable down the road and that the estimates in place are unlikely to happen as more and more shares are granted to employees.The company is forecasting a free cash flow margin for this year of 24%. Given that its revenue forecast is $1.37 billion, that implies that free cash flow will be about $325 million, an increase of 43% from the levels reached in 2015. But as I was at pains to point out the cash flow achieved last year, and particularly in Q4, was made up of the continued rapid build of stock-based comp. coupled with a stretch out in paying for accrued expenses. Even if the company can report $325 million in free cash flow this year, that puts the free cash flow yield down at 2.3%. If one could credibly argue that this company will enjoy 30% growth for some years and rising margins, it would still be hard to justify such a low yield. But there is simply no way to justify the valuation, given the many uncertainties that exist in NOW's business.Software companies by their very nature are people companies. Employee compensation is by far their biggest expense. If NOW's potential operating leverage is going to be subsumed in rising levels of stock-based comp., what does that mean for the actual profitability of this company? If real compensation expense is dramatically higher than what is reported, that really makes it difficult to maintain that this company's valuation is based on a sound footing.I think that investors in this name, and by that I mean mainly institutions which own 92% of the shares, are taking some very high risk bets. They are betting that the company can retain or reestablish its sales mojo. They are betting that NOW is going to have a relatively easy time in taking its solutions beyond the boundaries of its ITSM home. They are betting that NOW's competitors will continue to exist in torpor and make no effort to slow down this aggressive sales machine. They are counting on operating leverage that seems to be the product of disguising employment costs by rapidly increasing stock-based comp. The failure of any one of these bets, given the valuation NOW still enjoys, has the potential to cause a massive share price movement.To a certain degree, institutions are like lemmings. The concept that they all try to crowd into a few select names is well at work when looking at NOW's valuation. But if sentiment turns, the same institutions who can't own enough of the name now will find a different momentum growth story to back.Some Final ThoughtsIn many ways NOW has been an admirable company up to the current time. It has enjoyed a stretch of prodigious growth, unmarred by any material interruption. But the last two quarters have brought a significant decline to bookings growth that had not been forecast by the company. The company vigorously denies that the bookings growth slowdown had anything to do with competition - hardly surprising given that this management is completely sales focused.Despite a disappointing share price performance in the last several months, the company continues to enjoy a startlingly high valuation. That valuation is part of the scarcity value of momentum growth names. It is hardly credible that so many large institutions could use even the most unconventional valuation tools to justify their positions in this name.While many companies use stock-based comp. as part of their operating philosophy, it is the level and the direction that concern me. The direction of stock-based comp. suggests to me that the operating leverage the company talks about is far less and more distant than the raw numbers might suggest. The company will report in just a bit over two months. I will be looking to see if bookings can achieve expectations and if the rapid growth in stock-based comp. has begun to subside. I think there are just too many bets that have to be realized to make investors comfortable in owning this name."

ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) was one of the cloud stocks to undergo a steep price decline of almost 40%. It lost almost $4 billion in value even after beating analysts' revenue and earnings estimates and becoming the second cloud company to cross $1 billion in revenue.ServiceNow's FinancialsFiscal 2015 revenue grew 47% to reach $1 billion. Net loss was $198.4 million, or $1.27 per share. Non-GAAP net income was $67.4 million, or $0.43 per share. Billings grew 41% to $1.2 billion.Fourth-quarter revenues increased 44% over the year to $285.7 million, ahead of the market's expectations of $281 million. Net loss was $37.4 million, or $0.23 per share. Non-GAAP net income was $32.6 million, or $0.20 per share, beating the Street estimate of $0.09 per share.By segment, fourth-quarter revenues from subscriptions grew 47% over the year to $244.7 million, and professional services revenues increased 32% to $41 million. The company now has 230 customers with Average Contract Value over $1 million, a net increase of 24.Expenses continued to increase, albeit at a slower rate and showed a marginal decline sequentially. Sales and marketing expenses increased 39.5% to $134 million, and R&D spend increased 39% to $58.4 million.Fourth-quarter billings grew 33% to $365.7 million, missing the analyst estimate of $375 million, mainly due to a forecasting error made by the company. The error occurred when a large customer switched from making payments once per year to once every six months. The error, which has affected the outlook for fiscal 2016, wasn't detected till December 15.For the first quarter, ServiceNow expects revenues between $298 million and $303 million or a growth of 41% to 43%. Analysts expect revenue of $297.8 million. Billings are expected between $360 million and $365 million.ServiceNow expects to end 2016 with revenues between $1.34 billion and $1.37 billion or a growth of 33% to 36%, and billings to grow around 33% to $1.6 billion, just in line with analyst estimates. Analysts expect the company to end 2016 with an EPS of $0.63 on revenue of $1.36 billion.In December, ServiceNow launched the ServiceWatch Suite to reduce the cost, impact and occurrence of service outages. It connects information about services across the enterprise to what may be causing outages and automatically addresses the issues.The company also made available a new software release in December. Called Geneva, it offers a simplified developer environment and enables operating IT as a business. It extends service management further across the enterprise with applications for customer service, security operations, HR service management, and facilities service management.With this release, the company expects its total addressable market to have increased by $60 billion. From a business that was driven primarily on the replacement of legacy, ServiceNow is looking at becoming a strategic platform for its customers. But increasing its addressable market also means that ServiceNow will have more competition from the likes of Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY).During the earnings call, CEO Frank Slootman said the company has already won five or six major customer service projects, mostly against Salesforce, and that competition is going to become more intense further into 2016.Why Did its Stock Plunge?Although ServiceNow beat analyst expectations, it missed the billings estimate by a wide margin, primarily due to its forecasting error. The market didn't react kindly to this error, and is perhaps concerned that the modest growth in billings could indicate a slowing down of top-line growth. The stock plunged 20% after the results.Several analysts have cut their target price: Credit Suisse from $70 to $60, Goldman Sachs from $87 to $68, Raymond James from $90 to $80, and Robert W. Baird from $85 to $75. Mizuho downgraded ServiceNow to Neutral from Buy and cut its target to $65 from $90. RBC Capital Markets cut the target price from $90 to $85, but retained it as a Top Pick. Canaccord Genuity has a Buy rating and kept its $90 target.The Tableau carnage further fueled NOW's price decline. It is currently trading at $52.04 with a market cap of $8.27 billion. It hit a 52-week low of $46 in early February and a 52-week high of $91.28 in December."
3780906,52012,2015-12-29T11:09:40-05:00,I update the profitability numbers from ServiceNow’s most recent quarter.I provide additional context as to why I believe profitability matters even for high-growth companies.I highlight a third party article discussing ServiceNow’s ongoing patent infringement lawsuits.,"As some readers may know, I've been bearish on ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) for over a year now, based on its core unprofitability and rampant use of stock-based compensation. In this article I provide additional color by quickly examining the company's most recent profitability numbers, offering extra context as to why I believe profitability matters and highlighting an interesting opinion piece commenting on NOW's patent infringement lawsuits.Core ProfitabilityIn a previous article I introduced a calculation intended to get a sense of what the company's ""core profitability"" would be if it weren't so aggressively expanding. The metric basically assumes that the company spends $1.25 for every new dollar of revenue (with the hope that it will make up the loss in future years of the customer relationship). Subtracting out the cost for the acquisition of new revenue leaves a proxy for the company's core profitability. The good news for the company is that core profitability so-defined has steadily increased during the year, going from -29% in the first quarter, to -25% in the second quarter, to -11% in the third quarter. The bad news is that the number is still in the negative double digits and that overall profitability is still -16%.Do High Growth Rates Render Profitability Impossible?On the face of it, perennial losses would seem to be very negative for a company's outlook, but some argue that companies should chase growth at any cost, in what today is termed a ""land and expand"" strategy.One way to help evaluate the claim that losses are therefore concomitant with growth is to look at several successful companies and compare their early stats to those of NOW. For this exercise, I've chosen two historically successful software companies: Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) which both went public almost 30 years ago (i.e. in 1986).The first figure compares revenue growth rates among the three companies:The chart establishes that at their outsets MSFT and ORCL both had comparable growth rates to that currently exhibited by NOW. Moreover, both MSFT and ORCL managed to maintain >25% growth rates for almost a decade and a half (ORCL had a few quarters that were less than 25%, but its average was even higher than MSFT's).In today's world, this implies that the companies must have been operating substantially in the red - since the only way to get customers is to buy them. Yet here are the quarterly profit margins achieved by the three companies.MSFT and ORCL both managed to generate close to 10% profit margins during their entire high growth rate periods! Not only does this dispel the idea that growth has to come at the cost of profits, it also shows that customers will pay for value, assuming a product truly has economic value. That NOW is mired in double digit negative margins - despite being on a billion dollar revenue run rate - speaks to its core unprofitability.I would also add that in my opinion, running a company to make profits is a difficult task, one that requires making many difficult decisions. MSFT and ORCL both were able to make these decisions from their inception, and thus one could say that running profitably was part of their corporate culture or DNA. Hence their historically-sustained profitability. Conversely, fooling oneself with ""pro-forma"", non-GAAP, accounting to discount real costs only builds a company unable to make hard decisions. It's why I'm very negative on NOW over the longer term.As a final comparison point, perhaps the market rewarded MSFT and ORCL with astronomically high price to sales ratios to account for the high growth rates AND high profitability? Again the chart below shows that that's not the case - NOW with its very negative profitability garners much higher price to sales ratios than did MSFT and ORCL even in their heydays! (Even the bubble years of 1999 and 2000 aren't much different than NOW's typical ratio.) NOW is simply being over-priced by the market.Some Color on NOW's Patent Infringement LawsuitsIn a previous article I mentioned two patent infringement lawsuits against NOW that could be quite costly to the company; one filed by HP (NYSE:HPQ) (NYSE:HPE), the other by BMC. In particular, in discussing the BMC suit, I mentioned that:Following up on this idea, I recently ran into an article which commented on these two cases, in particular the Markman hearings. The entire article is worth reading, but here I'd like to highlight several excerpts (with my emphasis).First is a comment on what the suits might mean to NOW's customers (and by extension to NOW itself):Next comes a comment which supports the idea that not only is BMC taking this ""personally"" but that BMC is not generally a litigious company, it's only NOW's egregious behavior that has forced BMC to file suit:And finally here's the article's take on the results of the initial Markman hearing in the BMC case:ConclusionServiceNow, despite some improvements, is still operating with substantial ongoing losses. And as much as bulls spin the story otherwise, not only are losses not necessary to generate high growth rates, they also build the type of corporate culture that can't make hard decisions. NOW's legal woes only add to its negative outlook. As a result I remain short the stock."
3646806,93646,2015-11-04T17:18:02-05:00,"Increasing net losses accompanied by rising costs make the revenue growth unsustainable without further CAPEX, acquisition and investment purchase increases.With not a single insider buy transaction, total insider selling since May 2015 accounts for $224.6 million.It is questionable how ServiceNow would perform without an increasing amount of additional paid-in capital. Operating in a competitive area, the company might underperform if forced to lower costs.There is no justification to the extreme stock valuation other than optimistic future expectations.Due to a long expectation horizon for profits, it is uncertain whether ServiceNow will continue experiencing strong revenue growth until the projected breakeven.","IntroductionMy opinion on the markets remains very cautious, as I am continuing my search for undervalued stocks in a period of certain overvaluation of stocks almost all around the world. Even though value stocks have become scarcer in the recent years, there is still a significant number of well-managed companies trading at a reasonable valuation. Nevertheless, value stocks tend to perform better in periods of increasing earnings, while the current conditions are more beneficial for momentum stocks, as we have been observing a slowing pace of earnings growth since 2014. With company profits decreasing, stocks that sustain a strong earnings record will be rewarded. Also, most value stocks are distressed at the moment, which spells no strong outperformance in the short term. Even though most of them are experiencing a turnaround, the majority might need more time to find the bottom. I continue my research with the purpose of having investing ideas for the future, assessing both the strongest and weakest stocks of today's market.There are certain stocks that might be good shorting candidates right now, and we can be reasonably sure of that if we strike the market in its weakest point.The CompanyServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a cloud-based service company that offers programs for business process optimization and consolidation of data.It is a good example of a stock that analysts fall in love with from the first sight. Its strong revenue growth and optimistic expectations regarding the future have made the stock outperform strongly, with a more than 230% share price increase since its IPO in 2012. The focus has been mainly put on the company's client base and revenue growth, while less attention has been paid to profitability and fundamentals of the rapidly-growing company. I do not question the optimistic future prospects of the company, as it is hard to deny the potential demonstrated by ServiceNow.Nevertheless, in case the company does not turn profitable tomorrow, the weight of its balance sheet and the wide presence of red color in its statements might drown the stock in case the bear market starts soon. Investors searching for safety might not find this company's shares a safe asset to hold should the market reverse the upward trend.The analysis will state the major fundamental issues I believe to be a turning point for the ServiceNow shares' performance in the case of a correction. The potential locked in the company is hard to assess at the moment, and by no means will I try to understate it. Nevertheless, I believe the company to be an outstanding short candidate should the markets reverse the upward trend in the future.Profitability and ExpensesThere is a lot of uncertainty regarding the future performance of the company. It is reasonable to expect continuing revenue growth in the future. It is less probable, however, that ServiceNow will turn profitable before the next bear market comes.With the company's revenue experiencing an impressive expansion over the last 3 years, the company did not have any substantial profits that would justify the share price dynamics.Source: Morningstar (2015). All numbers are in $ millions. The data for the latest quarter is unaudited.The company's costs did not hesitate to follow the pace of its revenue. Rising total operating costs have resulted in operating losses since the IPO in 2012.Source: Morningstar (2015). All numbers are in $ millions. The data for the latest quarter is unaudited.Even though gross margins have been nearly unchanged since 2010, net margins were driven down by large selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) and research and development (R&D) expenses. Even though the latter might be an argument in favor of strong future potential of ServiceNow, it currently makes the company's net margins underperform significantly.Source: Morningstar, (2015). All numbers are in $ millions. The data for the latest quarter is unaudited.Even though the company is expected to slowly crave towards profitability in the near future, meeting the expectations might not save the stock from underperforming during the market correction. Also, the longer the profit expectation horizon is, the more uncertain it is whether ServiceNow will continue experiencing high revenue growth until the projected breakeven. And in case it doesn't, it will be difficult for the company to face the competition while decreasing its costs given its strong reliance on aggressive pricing (which I assume to be the case due to high SG&A expenses).Source: Nasdaq, (2015).It also seems that the above-mentioned revenue growth would not be sustainable without strong spending on CAPEX, investment purchases and acquisitions over the last years. In fact, I believe the stock would not become as inflated as it is at the moment if the spending pace had experienced a slowdown in the recent years.Source: Morningstar (2015). All numbers are in $ millions. The data for the latest quarter is unaudited.Cash, Additional Paid-In Capital and Sale of InvestmentsThe company's cash position has been on a rise since 2010. It can be argued, however, how healthy would the fundamentals look like without a strongly rising amount of additional paid-in capital over 2011-2014.Source: GuruFocus (2015). All numbers are in $ millions. The data for the latest quarter is unaudited.Since 2012, ServiceNow has been ramping up investment selling each year. Even though it has been accompanied by strong growth of the company, both the company's free cash flow and net change in cash for the last quarter would be negative without the proceedings from that quarter's investment sale accounting for $572.6 million (unaudited data).Source: GuruFocus (2015). All numbers are in $ millions. The data for the latest quarter is unaudited.LiabilitiesBoth accounts and tax payable of ServiceNow have nearly tripled since 2012, increasing from $9.6 to $30.7 and from $1.9 to 6.5 million, respectively. Current deferred revenue has increased more than 16 times since 2010, accounting for $519.5 million at the end of the last quarter (unaudited).Long-term debt, which has not been present in the company's balance sheet previously, appeared in 2014. It accounted for $466.8 million at the end of last quarter (unaudited), which I believe is a significant barrier on the company's way to future outperformance.Source: Finviz (2015). All numbers are in $ millions. The data for the latest quarter is unaudited.With operating loss of $172.2 million for the last quarter, interest expense accounting for $7.7 million looks significant enough to have some worries regarding the future, taking into account the amount of debt the company has at the moment.What is particularly interesting here is the recent castling (a defensive chess term when both king and one of the rooks change places simultaneously) of long-term debt with other long-term liabilities on the quarterly basis. It seems that the long-term debt has been trading places with other long-term liabilities for some time. At the time being, I see no logical explanation for that.Source: Finviz (2015). All numbers are in $ millions. The data for the latest quarter is unaudited.Book Value per Share, Insider TransactionsIntangible assets rose from $0.6 to $109.5 million in 2012-2014, increasing the intangible part of the company's total book value per share to more than 25%, which concerns me. Closing price to tangible book value per share stood at 27.70 on September 15, the date the last quarter report was published. Price to total book value per share accounted for 22.30 that day. An outrageous price tag for what is offered by the company's fundamentals in exchange for investors' money.It also seems that the management agrees upon that statement, with insider trading volume following the rise of the stock price. I cannot type ""net profits"" for the name of the graph below, unfortunately. Nevertheless, we have finally found where the real profits are being made within ServiceNow. With not a single purchase transaction, total insider selling since May 2015 accounts for more than $224 million.Source: Finviz (2015). All numbers are in $ millions. The data for the latest quarter is unaudited.And of course, August's increase in insider selling volume has been accompanied by a significant decline in the stock price that started in the middle of that month. As insiders (including the company's CEO, CFO, CRO and CPO) were not so eager to hold the company's shares during the share price decline and are also not expressing too much interest in the company's stock during the upward trend, one might wonder why anyone should consider investing in this stock.Source: Yahoo Finance (2015).The company was also generous in option exercising, with the total value of the options granted to the management totaling more than $10 million over the same time period. With an average exercise price of $6.55 (I don't take into account ""gift"" options with an exercise price of 0 for 29,238 shares) and most option exercise prices accounting for $3 or less, it is more or less clear how free might the management feel in the decision-making process, again recalling that the stock has been on a rise.Some particular transactions are worth paying even more attention. Rows of identical color show transactions that happened during the same day.Source: Finviz (2015).This is $9,191,658 in profits for the company's Chief Revenue Officer alone since the beginning of May. I strongly suggest spending some time studying the insider transactions of ServiceNow to every investor holding or considering an investment in the company's stock.With most of the transactions resulting in an immediate disposal of the company's shares, the outlook for the stock's performance becomes more uncertain, as a lot of the company's money is being spent on management's trading activities.Source: Finviz (2015). All numbers are in $ millions. The data for the latest quarter is unaudited.ConclusionWith earnings season proving a certain decline in the company' earnings, ServiceNow's increasing net losses will become a major negative catalyst at some point in the future. Strong future revenue growth cannot be relied on as well, as we might face worsening economic conditions in the future. With customer base expansion benefiting from the current aggressive pricing and acquisitions, I strongly doubt the company's ability to appear as a good investment should the correction or a bear market start. With institutional ownership standing at 91% and 16 Strong Buy analyst ratings at the moment, the shares have a lot of room for falling. The stock has been pretty volatile during the market declines in October, September and August. With extreme valuation and questionable prospects for the future profitability, the stock will be the first ballast to get rid of when the stocks dive.To investors holding the stock, I strongly recommend reassessing the investment quality of ServiceNow. To those expecting a market downturn at some point in the future just like me, I suggest keeping an eye on this fundamentally weak, volatile stock. It might become a decent short candidate in case the market conditions change to the less risky securities' advantage."
3737706,24157,2015-12-07T09:39:36-05:00,"ServiceNow's business model has been built around revenue growth.Unfortunately this revenue growth has not turned into profits.Despite this fact, shares have risen to unrealistic levels and are significantly overvalued.","Just when we think the market is becoming more rational and beginning to focus on fundamentals again we find a stock that proves that idea wrong. Once again, we've identified a business that fails to generate profits, uses ""adjusted"" metrics as ""better representations of business"", and who's stock price is up over 200% since late 2012. ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is in the Danger Zone this week.Revenue Growth At The Expense Of ProfitServiceNow was founded in 2004 with the goal of managing and automating any number of information technology tasks in which enterprises may engage in day-to-day operations. As much as these services benefit clients, they do not serve the business or investors well. Figure 1 shows that despite strong revenue growth, ServiceNow's after-tax profits (NOPAT) have declined from -$30 million in 2012 to -$166 million on a trailing twelve-month (NYSE:TTM) basis.Figure 1: Revenues Fail To Be Converted Into ProfitsSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsCosts Growing Much Faster Than RevenuesWhile revenues have grown at 67% compounded annually since 2012, sales & marketing, research & development, and general & administrative costs have grown at 81%, 94%, and 68% compounded annually respectively since 2012.ServiceNow's return on invested capital (ROIC) has followed the downward trend in profits and has declined from -28% in 2012 to its current bottom quintile -74% on a TTM basis.We've seen this trend before in other cloud companies that we've also put in the Danger Zone: Marketo (NASDAQ:MKTO), Proofpoint (NASDAQ:PFPT), and Demandware (NYSE:DWRE). Collectively, those three stocks are down an average -2% versus the S&P at +3% since they were put in the Danger Zone.Adjusted Performance Metrics Help Execs At Expense of InvestorsBut wait how can this be? ServiceNow's management directs attention to metrics that look good, for example: increasing annual contract values, growing billings, and excellent gross margins. What investors have failed to recognize, or chosen to ignore, is that these metrics divert focus off of the business' increased losses. Even worse, the gross margin that ServiceNow highlights is calculated on a non-GAAP basis, a big red flag. What is the biggest adjustment made to arrive at NOW's non-GAAP metrics? Removing stock based compensation (23% of revenue in the last fiscal year). Figure 2 shows the magnitude of this ""adjustment"".Figure 2: ServiceNow's Stock Based CompensationSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsSince 2012, ServiceNow's stock based compensation has grown from $27.9 million to $154.3 million in 2014. These costs represented 11% of revenue in 2012 and 23% of revenue in 2014. Don't rely on adjusted numbers as they fail to present the true picture.IT Automation Is a Crowded MarketFigure 3 shows that ServiceNow's -74% ROIC is much lower than competition which gives it no pricing power and a weaker competitive position.Figure 3: ServiceNow Doesn't Match Up With Competition* Specifically identified as competitors in ServiceNow's 2014 10-K filingSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsBull Case Assumes Past Growth Continues UnabatedThe bull case for ServiceNow rests on the belief that the company will achieve a large enough customer base that it can reduce customer acquisition costs and (profitably) serve that customer base for the foreseeable future. Much of the past customer growth ServiceNow achieved was due to being first to market with SaaS IT products while large competitors were content with deploying their legacy on-site solutions. The landscape has since changed, and ServiceNow has many direct competitors in the SaaS IT space. Those competitors, with their much larger resources, stand to make further growth for ServiceNow more difficult in the future than it was in the past.For example, Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) only released their IT cloud solutions in 2012 and CA Inc. released the same service in 2014. Instead of against more cumbersome, on-site, and expensive offerings, ServiceNow is going head-to-head with some of the biggest and best in software sales. These large competitors possess vast resources and operating advantages (larger scalable sales forces) that allow them to compete more aggressively on price, and, potentially turn the service into a commodity. ServiceNow can ill afford to enter a pricing war and win with its already severe lack of profitability.Making matters worse, the current expectations baked into the stock price imply that ServiceNow not only continues the rapid growth (amidst increased competition) it has achieved in the past, but also takes majority market share from its entire potential market, which Morgan Stanley estimates to be ~$45 billion.Valuation Has Nothing But Downside RiskAs noted earlier, NOW is up over 200% since going public and shares are greatly overvalued. To justify its current price of $88/share, ServiceNow must raise its pre-tax margin from -20% to 10% and continue growing revenue by 31% compounded annually for the next 16 years. Put another way, the current market price implies that within 15 years ServiceNow would be generating $40 billion in revenue, which is the same level Oracle generated in 2014 and only $5 billion below its entire addressable market as noted above.If we believe ServiceNow's bulls are right and the company is able to increase margins upon reaching scale, shares are still overvalued. If ServiceNow achieves pretax margins of 15% (average of competition in Figure 2) and grows revenue by 24% compounded annually for the next decade, the stock is only worth $24/share today - a 73% downside.As should be clear, the expectations baked into ServiceNow's stock price are simply not rooted in reality.Hidden Liabilities Make a Buyout UnlikelyWith such a premium baked into NOW, it could be argued that investors expect the firm to be acquired. Apart from the issues above, ServiceNow has some hidden liabilities that make the company more expensive than the standard accounting numbers suggest:In addition to these hidden liabilities, ServiceNow has $680 million in debt on a TTM basis, which represents 5% of market cap.To determine a reasonable price that a suitor might pay for NOW, we analyzed a few of the most optimistic acquisition scenarios:Momentum Will Wear Off and Shares Will SinkThe momentum behind NOW since it went public in 2012 has been pretty impressive. Investors have continually ignored growing losses on the hopes that the company will someday ""figure it out."" Over the next year, as revenue growth slows and profits remain elusive, we expect this trend to change. Businesses that don't create profit aren't long for the market, as eventually rationality wins out. We've have seen this story play out numerous times before with DWRE, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), and even Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), all three were big momentum stocks that are now down 31%, 57%, and 30% respectively since we placed them in the Danger Zone. While the market's irrationality can seem unlimited at times, investor appetite for risk tends not to be as large. While we cannot predict exactly when this stock will face reality, ServiceNow's business model is clearly disconnected from its stock's valuation, and we see no reason to believe it fare any better than the numerous other cloud service providers who also fail to make any profits.Insider Sales/Short Interest Raise Red FlagsOver the past 12 months 157,000 shares have been purchased and 6.9 million shares have been sold for a net effect of 6.7 million insider shares sold. These sales represent 4% of shares outstanding. Additionally, there are 8 million shares sold short, or 5% of shares outstanding. It looks like insiders and some short sellers already see the writing on the wall.Executive Compensation Is Misaligned With Shareholder Value CreationServiceNow's executive compensation system rewards cash bonuses and equity awards for meeting target annual contract values. Despite growing losses, executives' salary and bonuses have only increased in recent years. Herein lies the problem with executives basing their pay on metrics that don't truly measure business success, a red flag we've raised again in a recent report. We would much rather see executive compensation tied to ROIC rather than a company-created metric that can look good even while the company is destroying shareholder value.Impact of Footnotes Adjustments and Forensic AccountingWe have made several adjustments to ServiceNow's 2014 10-K. The adjustments are:Income Statement: we made seven adjustments with a net effect of removing $38 million of non-operating expenses (6% of revenue). We removed $5 million in non-operating income and $44 million in non-operating expenses.Balance Sheet: we made $1.1 billion of balance sheet adjustments to calculated invested capital with a net decrease of $635 million. The largest adjustment was the inclusion of $225 million due to off balance sheet operating leases. This adjustment represented 25% of reported net assets.Valuation: we made $2.6 billion of shareholder value adjustments with a net decrease of $877 million. The largest adjustment to shareholder value was the removal of $1 billion in outstanding employee stock options. This adjustment represented 8% of ServiceNow's market cap.Dangerous Funds That Hold NOWThe following fund receives our Dangerous rating and allocates significantly to ServiceNow.Disclosure: David Trainer and Kyle Guske II receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, style, or theme."
3431926,52012,2015-08-13T09:38:36-04:00,"I am short NOW for two primary, inter-connected reasons:1. the company issues stock as though this practice has no cost or involves no negative dilution to existing shareholders, and.2. because the company's core operations appear to be solidly unprofitable.In this article I show how recent developments serve only to reinforce this basic thesis.","In previous articles, I've disclosed my short position in ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW). The basic rationale for my trade can be summarized in two inter-related points:Now, many bulls disagree with both points, primarily because:In this article, I address some of the bulls' objections by offering additional evidence for my short thesis.Stock-Based Compensation and DilutionOne argument that bulls have is that employees don't view stock-based compensation as essential, recurring income; and hence any benefits from SBC are just a ""bonus"" - they don't really factor into either an employee's decision to work at the company or in setting compensation costs.This argument has never sounded plausible to me, but up until now I hadn't found objective (third party) evidence disputing this bullish interpretation. That changed when I went to the anonymous employee review site ""Glassdoor"". Here's a summary snapshot of the current employment rating of NOW from that site (with my emphasis):That the number one positive factors cited for working at NOW is stock-based compensation via options, and that stock options are considered a ""jackpot"" puts an end to the idea that stock options are simply a nice ""bonus"" to working at NOW - but not a real cost that employees consider in accepting (or rejecting) employment.Another way to see the impact of this compensation on the company's current and future financials is to consider how much stock compensation is outstanding (source 10-Q):At today's price of ~$76.50 per share, stock sales from option exercises and RSUs could result in selling pressure of ~$1.8B if all instruments expected to vest are sold.Alternatively, Yahoo! lists the 3-month average daily trading volume at 1.243M shares, so potential options and RSU sales could account for about 19 trading days of selling pressure, or about a month's worth of trading. This may seem like a very large amount, but it's not inconceivable, as reporting insiders have been engaged in staggering stock sales for years now. As a small sample, consider only the recent sales in this quarter:That's almost $94M in sales by reporting sellers in this quarter. It doesn't include any sales by non-reporting, ""jackpot""-winning, lower-level employees. So the idea that future sales could be substantial is not only plausible - it's borne out by historical precedence.Built for UnprofitabilityTo separate the impact of the costs of acquiring new customers from the ""core"" profitability of the company's continuing operations -- and thereby address the bulls' contention -- I'd previously proposed several metrics, all of which showed the company's ongoing operations to be deeply unprofitable. See this article for the details. Running the numbers for the latest quarter confirms that conclusion despite a slight uptick from the previous quarter. See the table below.Consistently running at negative 25% profit margins is a very deep hole to have to dig out of, especially for a mature company with a $1 billion revenue run rate. From my perspective, there's simply no reason to think NOW will ever be profitable.The connection between the company's (and analysts') disregard for the real cost of stock-based compensation and the company's ongoing unprofitability is revealed in an exchange from the Q&A portion of the recent earnings conference call (my emphasis):To interpret the claim of increased leverage and year-over-year revenues growing faster than costs, I've plotted the company's net margins and quarterly SBC costs. Though the net margins are slightly better this quarter than they were a year ago, the overall long-term trend isn't positive. In fact it's part of the evidence showing that the company isn't built to generate profits. But if SBC is not a cost, then you can subtract it via ""pro-forma"", ""non-GAAP"" alchemy after which the CFO's comments make perfect sense (in an Alice-in-Wonderland world).NOW Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsNOW Stock Based Compensation (Quarterly) data by YChartsConclusionDespite the company's and analysts' disregard for stock-based compensation costs, employees do consider SBC a major reason to work for the company, as evidenced by employee review sites -- and thus it's unreasonable to think the company could operate without such costs. Moreover, because even the CFO of the company doesn't include SBC in his interpretation of profitability and leverage, the company is likely to operate unprofitably until shareholders object. I believe that that time is forthcoming, and remain short the stock in anticipation."

The ITOM landscape is undergoing transformation as legacy multi-segment players give way to a new generation of suppliers that are growing more rapidly than the market average. Billion Dollar Unicorn club member ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is one such new player in the IT Services Management (ITSM) segment of the ITOM market.ServiceNow's FinancialsTheir second quarter revenues increased 48% over the year to $246.7 million, ahead of the market's expectations of $241.04 million. Net loss was $61.9 million or $0.40 per share. Non-GAAP profit was $0.04 per share, beating the Street estimate of $0.02 per share.By segment, revenues from subscriptions grew 51% over the year to $200.5 million and professional services revenues increased 36% to $46.3 million. During the quarter, ServiceNow added 21 new Global 2000 customers including Caterpiller, Novo Nordisk, and Alliant Energy. During the quarter, they added nine new customers with annualized contract value (ACV) over $1 million, and now have a total of 186 customers with ACV over $1 million, a 68% y-o-y increase. Their average contract terms for new customers, upsells, and renewals were 31.1, 26, and 22.6 months, respectively. ACV for global 2000 customers was $804,000, up 34% over the year.Region-wise, revenues were $174 million in North America, $56 million in EMEA, and $17 million in Asia-Pacific.Calculated billings were $281.4 million, increasing 50% year-over-year. Their expenses continued to increase, albeit at a slower rate. Sales and marketing expenses increased 48.5% to $136 million and R&D spend increased 50% to $53.3 million.For the third quarter, ServiceNow projected revenues between $252 million and $257 million and billings between $280 and $285 million. They expect to end the year with revenues of $985 million to $1 billion and billings to grow around 41% to $1.2 billion. The Street was forecasting revenues of $990 million for the year.Performing Beyond ITFounded in 2004, ServiceNow had initially focused on the IT segment. But now it is ensuring its continued success by expanding beyond ITSM into other areas like human resources, operations and legal departments. And this strategy is paying off.Following their acquisition of Intreis to expand their governance, risk and compliance (GRC) solutions, they have recorded their largest transaction of nearly $2 million during the quarter.ServiceNow Express, a simpler cloud-based ITSM solution for small and medium businesses, landed 74 new customers and seven of the existing customers upgraded to the enterprise version in Q2. The average ACV for Express is between $10,000 and $15,000 while the minimum ACV for Enterprise is $42,000.Their recently released financial management application has landed six customers and a robust pipeline of pilots and prospects.The quarter also saw strong performance of emerging products like ServiceWatch and performance analytics solutions. The ACV for their IT operations management portfolio nearly doubled year-over-year, driven by 21 deals larger than $100,000.By expanding into adjacent areas, ServiceNow has expanded its market opportunity from $6 billion to $45 billion. However, as it expands into these new areas, it is likely to run into more high-profile cloud vendors like Salesforce. In response to a question regarding competition during the earnings call, CEO Frank Slootman said,The competition will definitely heat up and it will be interesting to see how ServiceNow keeps up its performance. Their stock is currently trading at $75.99 with a market capitalization of $11.67 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $83.52 in April. I predict more acquisitions as well, to broaden the product portfolio."
3275325,52012,2015-06-22T15:25:30-04:00,"NOW has been perennially unprofitable but bulls suggest that this is due solely to the costs of acquiring new customers.In response I attempt to compute ""core"" profitability from existing customers.The results show not just losses from existing customers, but a disturbing trend of increased core unprofitability.There are several contributors to this trend and all are shareholder unfriendly.As a result I remain short the stock and may add to my position at current prices.","In November 2014, I initially tagged ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) as prospective short play, arguing that its rampant use of stock-based compensation (SBC) led it to completely abandon any fiscal responsibility. I then followed up my initial article with a second one highlighting the ongoing stock dilution and risks related to potentially serious legal challenges from HP and BMC. Since the time of the original article, the stock has risen 20%.I'd now like to revisit the original idea, to see whether other valuation arguments might sustain today's valuation (which, as a reminder, is summarized below).Current Expenditures vs. Future ProfitabilityWe know from the company's 10-K and 10-Q that it has no expectations of being profitable in the near future. Here's the most recent language to that effect:However the bullish assumption has been that current period unprofitability is due solely to spending heavily to obtain new customers, but once a customer has been acquired - thanks to very high renewal rates and upsells - going forward that customer will be (substantially) profitable. Given the company's very large losses and heady multiples, I wondered how this case could be true. Since (as far as I'm aware) the company doesn't break out ""core"" profitability from ongoing business vs. new customer acquisition profitability, I decided to run some ""what-if"" scenarios to try to gauge this. The figures below are the results of my analysis.The first table shows a selection of NOW's annual financials from 2008 through 2014. The dashed line indicates a change in year-end which creates a 6 month gap in the table (the result in the red box is therefore an artifact of the gap). As can be seen, the company has been perennially unprofitable with the latest year coming in at a -27% net margin. The lower 5 rows of the table attempt to estimate core business profitability by assuming that the company aggressively spends $1.25 for each $1 in incremental sales. The remaining revenues and costs are then considered ""core"" or ""on-going"" values which in turn allow the calculation of a core profitability. Surprisingly, not only is the ongoing business unprofitable, it's becoming more so every year.But perhaps bulls would argue that even at $1.25 spent per $ of revenue, I'm underestimating the new customer acquisition costs. So here are the same numbers but calculated assuming NOW crazily spends $1.50 per $ of incremental revenue:Even under those assumptions the company's core profitability is decreasing at a prodigal rate, and the most recent year was still run at a negative 12% core net margin!Unfortunately for the company's shareholders, the latest quarter continued this trend, as can be seen in the following table (which uses the original $1.25 per $ of incremental revenue value):We can perform the same time of analysis in relation to billings (which include changes in deferred revenue) rather than revenues, and even if we take the extreme approach of assuming that the company spends $0.9 for every $1 in increased billings, the same trend and on-going losses are evident:These scenarios help show that NOW is engaged in a very aggressive strategy of growing revenues at any cost. Not only are new sales bought at a substantial loss, but existing customers also generate on-going losses. Even more concerning is that rather than benefiting from any economies of scale as the company grows, the core losses have actually been increasing on a percentage basis!Several reasons likely explain this outcome. First and foremost - as I've argued from the outset - I think the company considers stock based compensation as essentially ""free money"" and hence it shows no discipline in growing head count (see next section). But there are also other concerns, such as litigation and competition.Employee MetricsOne way to see the leverage (or economies of scale) the company gains by growing is to look at per employee metrics. The chart below shows the company's historical net income per employee. Once again the trend is to substantially grow losses - both on an absolute and on a percentage basis - with the addition of every employee.That stock based compensation is largely to blame becomes clear from the next chart.SBC and Insider SalesPerhaps the best (and most shocking) way to see the effect of SBC is to look at the number and value of insider sales. In the following graphic (which I realize is large, but blame NOW insiders, not me) I've compiled YTD insider sales (source). For the one row highlighted in green, I fixed an obvious error from the form 4 filing in the average price of the shares sold.What the table reveals is that, amazingly, insiders have sold in excess of $223M worth of stock in 2015 alone. To put this number into perspective, last quarter's revenues were $212M!!! No wonder the company always pushes to exclude SBC from any evaluation of its operations!Losses and LitigationAnother source of increasing losses are the two lawsuits that the company is now defending against well-heeled competitors. For reference, HP & BMC haves annual sales of $111B and $2.2B respectively, and both are profitable, so they're much more likely to escalate legal costs where possible, realizing that NOW is at a strict disadvantage in terms of both sales and profits. For details of the original complaints see my article referenced above, for the latest updates on publicly available documents see these two links: HP BMC.CompetitionA final contributor to NOW's increasing unprofitability is the emergence of more price competition in the space. Here's how NOW puts it in the 10-Q (my emphasis):ConclusionDespite being a Wall St. darling, NOW is exhibiting alarming rates of increasing ""core"" losses. Indeed, because it ignores any costs borne in the form of stock-based compensation, the company appears to be on a reckless ""growth at any price"" trajectory. Not only do insiders appear to realize this - as evidenced by YTD insider stock sales exceeding quarterly revenues - but other facts like litigation and competition are also contributing to these ongoing and increasing operating losses. As a result I'm still short the company and will likely add to my position at current prices."
3058576,76475,2015-04-09T23:39:46-04:00,Investors have tended to overlook ServiceNow when investing in the pure-cloud industry.This despite that ServiceNow has shown consistent growth and improved operational efficiency.ServiceNow is set to break even in the current year and could become consistently profitable going forward.This will give significant upside to its shares.,"The pure-cloud space is one of the most competitive in the IT arena. SaaS companies such as Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM), Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) and NetSuite (NYSE:N) are well-known to many investors due to their blistering growth that doesn't seem to let up by a big margin even as the years roll on. For many investors, however, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has tended to flow under their radars, which is something of an anomaly given the outstanding financial and share performance by the company. Wall Street in particular seems to be held in thrall by Workday, yet ServiceNow delivers comparable growth at a much cheaper price.Meanwhile, ServiceNow shares have handily outperformed those of Workday and the Technology Services Industry over the past one-year and five-year periods. ServiceNow shares have tucked on gains of 49.54% vs. 9.69% for Workday.ServiceNow vs. Workday and Technology Services Industry 1-Year Share ReturnsBold Line = ServiceNow; Green Line = Workday; Blue Line= Technology Services IndustrySource: CNN MoneyServiceNow shares have also outperformed Workday shares over the past 5-year period, gaining 218% vs. 82.47% for Workday.ServiceNow vs. Workday and Technology Services Industry 5-Year Share ReturnsSource: CNN MoneyBackgroundServiceNow is cloud-based service provider that helps to maximize the efficiency of IT operations. By using the cloud, ServiceNow is able to save customers money by rolling a number of IT-related services into a single platform.Workday, on the other hand, is company that provides HR services delivered though the cloud. In this regard, Workday is quite similar to NetSuite, though it's services are considered higher-end and, therefore, more costly than NetSuite's.Workday and ServiceNow are both growing very fast.*NA--The Company did Not Provide Projections for 2015 Operating MarginSources: ServiceNow 2014 Results; Workday 2014 ResultsWhile I was comparing the financial performance of the two companies and their projections for the current financial year, what caught my attention the most is the fact that ServiceNow expects to breakeven in the current year. This is certainly great news for the company and its investors. SaaS companies in general tend to sport very high sales and marketing costs, and many are also generous with their stock-based compensation. SaaS companies spend very heavily on sales and marketing expenses in order to quickly grow their revenue bases as wide and possible, and also to reduce churn. This is actually borne out of necessity from the way these companies operate. Both ServiceNow and Workday spend more than 40% of their respective revenues on sales and marketing expenses.Unlike old-line software companies like SAP (NYSE:SAP), SaaS companies build their software and then rent it out to other companies which use it and pay on a monthly basis. Traditional software companies, however, build their products, ship them, install them, charge a large licensing fee, and forget them. Well, they don't exactly forget about them but continue to collect about 15% or so of the license fee as product support as well as maintenance fee. For a SaaS company to generate constant cash flow at a fast-enough rate to meet their operational expenses, they have to sign up as many customers as possible. Moreover, the average SaaS company has a 75% customer retention rate meaning it turns over its entire customer base once every four years. To grow their customer bases and minimize churn, these companies are, therefore, left with little choice than to spend tons of cash on sales and marketing expenses.But, a maturing SaaS company is finally able to get to a point where its existing customer base is large enough and generates enough cash flow to sustain the company's operational expenses. Once the company reaches this point, it is now able to harvest any incoming cash flow as profits. It's highly likely that ServiceNow has reached this tipping point.Another big downside of the SaaS model is that it places a lot of pressure on these companies free cash flow. For instance, Workday finished fiscal 2014 with free cash flow of -$29.6 million. ServiceNow, however, finished the year with positive free cash flow of $38.7 million. So these companies are not cash cows exactly, but that's the price to pay for growing so fast.ServiceNow did not provide detailed projections of its financial performance in 2015, so it's a bit difficult to say if the company will become consistently profitable. The company, however, grew its ServiceNow Community membership base by 65% last year to reach 30,000 registered members. It's possible that the company netted some particularly lucrative customers hence the dramatic improvement in its balance sheet. Judging by its good free cash flow trends, I'm willing to bet that ServiceNow is now on the cusp of becoming consistently profitable, something that even Salesforce, a more mature company, has been unable to do.ServiceNow UpgradedPerhaps it's the company's improved operational efficiency that prompted Morgan Stanley to raise its ServiceNow PT from $80-$94 while maintaining an Overweight rating. The analysts cited ServiceNow's continued push from its former narrow $6 billion ITSM market to a broader $45 billion IT Operations Management and PaaS markets. The analysts also mentioned that despite the impressive share gains by the company, it's valuation metrics remained attractive, with its EV/Sales/Growth multiple of 0.23x around the industry average. Comparable TAM stocks that are larger than ServiceNow trade at a huge 40% premium to the industry average.I certainly think that ServiceNow should be in the portfolios of long-term investors. If the company is able to become consistently profitable, you can expect its shares to shoot to new highs."

In the article I also mentioned that though NOW had published its Q3 earnings report as a press release, it hadn't yet filed the associated 10-Q.Subsequently, on Nov 5, it did so. Two major points stand out.Item 1: Dilution Continues Unabated with No End in SightAt the end of the quarter the share count increased to 148.3M shares from 145.7M the previous quarter. That's a 1.78% increase on the quarter or a 7.3% increase annualized. The trend of shares outstanding now looks like:NOW Shares Outstanding data by YChartsMoreover insider selling (which is but a fraction of all employee selling, see previous article), picked up where it left off:Yet despite the large issuances of shares, the outstanding options and RSU's declined only slightly over the quarter due to new RSU issuance. As of Sep 30, options vested and expected to vest were reduced by 1.5M shares, but non-vested and outstanding RSU's increased by 1.06M shares. Thus there's no reason to think employee selling will decrease going forward.Item 2: ServiceNow Discloses Second Patent Infringement CasePreviously NOW had been named as a defendant in a patent infringement case filed by plaintiff Hewlett-Packard. The 10-Q updated the progress of that lawsuit as follows:NOW then disclosed that:It cites the risks of these lawsuits as follows (emphasis added):Of course some of this is boilerplate, so it's worthwhile looking at the actual complaint documents in each case. The HP one can be downloaded here. It's relatively matter of fact, such that until further discovery and developments it's hard to get any idea of how much traction HP will have. BMC's is also early in the process, so it's also impossible to tell how it will play out, but as opposed to HP, BMC definitely lays some of its cards on the table even in the initial complaint. To wit (paragraph numbering is retained from the original and emphasis is added):This first point strikes me as quite interesting. NOW, a $10B, allegedly innovative, technology company has no patents, not a single one (though it has recently begun applying for patents according to its 10-Q). HP makes the same point in its complaint but with fewer details, saying only: "" In the last decade alone, HP has invested more than 20 billion dollars in research and development, and has been awarded thousands of patents for its innovations by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.""Given that NOW moved into a space previously dominated by BMC and HP, it's hard to believe it could do so without either patenting innovations of its own, or licensing the patents of others.Which brings us to the next point in the BMC complaint:(See ~ min 5:35 and following of this video.) Personally, I think the context of the video seems much less damning than the excerpt presented in the complaint, but given that NOW hasn't developed any patented IP of its own and some of the other allegations in the BMC complaint (see below) I have to wonder if BMC isn't going to be able to establish NOW's willful disregard of BMC's IP, with all that that implies legally.As support for its allegation that NOW stole its IP, BMC cites the hiring of BMC employees with the express purpose of infringing on BMC's patented innovations.All of this could be put down to normal legal posturing, but what leads me to believe that this case is ""personal"" is the contrast between the tone of BMC's complaint and that of HP's. In particular this paragraph caught my eye:If nothing else, this kind of language makes me think that BMC is not treating the case as a just another legal battle, rather it's determined that it has a mortal enemy and will take all steps to fight it. Whatever the outcome, I have to think the process will be very expensive and time-consuming (particularly since BMC is a company with much larger resources than NOW). For a company as egregiously over-valued as NOW, such a risk is another potential area which could lead analysts and the investment community to revisit their projections and valuations. And it's therefore another reason why I remain short the company."
3076796,24663,2015-04-17T23:39:07-04:00,"NOW's guidance was what investors chose to prioritize in an otherwise strong first quarter.NOW is a momentum stock, but a company that's been very disruptive to the enormous IT market for the last couple of years.With the IT market expected to grow in excess of $1 trillion, the company has a large market opportunity.","Investors aren't responding well to ServiceNow's (NYSE:NOW) second-quarter guidance. While the company easily topped expectations for the first quarter, and issued bullish full-year guidance, ServiceNow's near 10% after-hours stock losses essentially highlight the problem of investing in pricey momentum stocks. That problem is that everything has to be perfect when the company reports earnings, or the stock will fall. Nonetheless, I think the quarter was solid, and while pricey, ServiceNow might be worth a buy on any weakness.International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) built a $100-billion-a-year business with on-premise information technology, IT. Back in 2013, when IBM had annual revenue right around $100 billion, famed hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller told investors to short IBM. He said that for every dollar earned by IT companies that operate via the cloud, it removes several dollars from on-premise juggernauts like IBM. For this coming year, the company is expected to produce annual revenue of less than $85 billion, implying that Druckenmiller's theory is playing out correctly.What does this have to do with ServiceNow? The answer lies in ServiceNow's business model, providing a single cloud platform to its enterprise customers, where many IT functions can be carried out. In other words, it is one of those companies that's causing headaches for IBM, allowing enterprise customers to obtain several IT services on the cloud at a cheaper price than on-premise providers like IBM can offer.That said, the IT services market is enormous! According to Gartner, it'll grow 3.7% this year in constant currency to nearly $942 billion, and will reach $1.1 trillion by 2019. Therefore, ServiceNow is perfectly positioned to both take advantage of a growing industry, while also providing services in a cloud format that its customers desire.For 2015, ServiceNow is guiding for revenue to be as high as $1 billion. That would be good for growth of nearly 47%. While very impressive, even with growth of 47%, the company owns nothing more than a fraction of this enormous market, and has nothing but increased market share opportunities in front of it.Furthermore, ServiceNow also already has 545 of the Global 2,000 companies as customers, meaning the opportunity for expanded service relationships is robust. After all, this is a company that grew revenue 52% in the first quarter, despite a 10% negative impact of forex. Also, ServiceNow may not have net income, but creates substantial free cash flow, which is more important than net income.After creating $40.7 million in free cash flow during the first quarter, ServiceNow has created over $110 million in FCF over the last four quarters. Yes, that means ServiceNow trades at 100x FCF, but with it expecting another quarter of $40 million in FCF during this upcoming period, the company is seeing vast improvements to profitability.Given the size of ServiceNow's market opportunity, its ongoing explosive top line growth, and its strong generation of FCF, I think any pullback should be seen as a great investment opportunity. With a market capitalization of $11.4 billion, ServiceNow looks expensive, but at 11.4x this year's expected sales, it's actually a pretty good long-term investment opportunity."
2643085,52012,2014-11-06T11:54:54-05:00,"ServiceNow has huge and growing stock-based compensation.Insiders and employees treat SBC as cash payments, but Wall St. doesn't.NOW's valuation is absurd considering its actual accomplishments.","At times there are themes in the market. I've recently written on two companies, LinkedIn (LNKD) and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), which seem to have lost all financial discipline because Wall St. has decided that - at least for the time being - stock-based compensation is not a real cost. (And though I haven't written on it, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), whose stock price recently imploded, has also been playing these games.)Today I'd like to look at another company, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), which appears to be operating under the same paradigm. All the general commentary in my two previous articles are applicable here too, so rather than repeat myself, I thought I'd illustrate the mechanics of how Wall Street's free pass is (ab)used by these companies. I'd also like to highlight the absurd market valuation by scaling NOW's accomplishments to company sizes more directly familiar to most investors.NOW's Valuation and Recent EarningsAs a quick snapshot of NOW's valuation, here are the Yahoo summary stats. But note that while the company reported earnings on Oct 22, it still hasn't filed its 10-Q, so the stats are based on data through the June quarter (and as I discuss below, given the company's proclivity to dilute, the company's actual market cap is likely greater than shown in these summary stats).Here are the top four bullet highlights from the Q3 earnings PR. Note how the GAAP earnings are sandwiched between ""Non-GAAP operating income"" and ""Non-GAAP net income"". Moreover, the ""Non-GAAP"" operating income is positive (Hallelujah!).Indeed even in presenting the GAAP income statement, prominently displayed are the ""artificial"" or ""get out of jail free"" stock-based compensation expenses:Adding up the SBC, we see that in the latest quarter, stock-based compensation amounted to $41.49M, or 23.2% of quarterly revenue. This trend of increasing absolute and relative ""free"" compensation has been an ongoing trend at NOW:NOW Stock-Based Compensation (Quarterly) data by YChartsNOW Stock-Based Compensation (% of Quarterly Revenues) data by YChartsInsider Selling as a Proxy for Redeemed Stock-Based CompensationWall St. bulls maintain that SBC isn't an expense because no cash leaves the company. Yet shareholders are diluted with every extra share that's issued. Looking at insider trading shows how insiders treat SBC as de facto cash payments, all they have to do is regularly sell their newly issued shares, whether they come from options or restricted stock units. For brevity, here's data for NOW's September and October insider transactions, but this is an ongoing pattern, as can be seen from this source link.It's important to realize that SBC is much wider than just shown by insider trading, most employees aren't considered insiders and thus don't have to report sales to the SEC. (Here's the SEC's definition for anyone interested.) Thus the pattern shown above should be thought of as applying to most employees who are being paid via shares.To get sense of the potential dilution, consider that at the end of the June quarter, NOW had outstanding (I'm not including warrants because at today's prices they're not dilutive):So expect to see much more dilution as employees cash out.Valuation re-VisitedFinally, I'd like to look at a typical comment the company made in its recent earnings press release and then emphasized in the earnings call. Before doing so I'd like to stress that I'm not disparaging the company's accomplishments, I'm simply disputing the valuation that Wall St. is awarding these accomplishments.Let's consider this accomplishment by scaling the market cap. Most of us are familiar with smaller private companies worth on the order of $10M. Imagine if the owner of one of those came to you and touted 11 new deals each for $1,000, or told you his average revenue per account was $275. Most likely you'd be extremely underwhelmed. But that's the equivalent of a $10B company talking about $1M deals! It's just another way to see how crazy the current price to sales ratio is.Note too that the prospects for increased profits aren't assured, as the company has already experienced pricing pressure. See for example this risk disclosure in the latest 10-Q:Given all this, I'm short the stock."
3247396,73565,2015-06-09T15:24:10-04:00,,"Worth $11.5B, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is the third public SaaS company, after Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and LinkedIn (LNKD). Based in San Diego, ServiceNow employs roughly 3,000 people and sells a system of record for IT operations teams to manage IT assets, facilities and human resources. ServiceNow's software allows clients to develop custom applications for their own needs, often with the help of the company's professional services team.The business was founded in 2004, but hit its stride 2009 and went public in 2012. ServiceNow grew from $19M in revenue to $178M in four years, sustaining a 75% CAGR during that period.Compared to other SaaS companies, ServiceNow is among the top three fastest growing, and isn't showing any signs of slowing.At IPO, ServiceNow recorded a $95,000 average revenue per customer, placing in the top third of SaaS companies in terms of average revenue per customer. But that figure has increased dramatically over the past four years.Since 2011, the average revenue of a ServiceNow customer has expanded to $250,000 on average. This figure has grown by 27% per year. ServiceNow has moved up-market aggressively, nearly tripling the number of million-dollar-plus customers from 37 to 129 in the last three years.In addition, the company has grown its base of customers substantially. ServiceNow reports its upsell rate, which is equivalent to a negative net churn. ServiceNow commands 30% annual price increases from its customers, an impressive figure.This ability to upsell and cross sell customers has benefited the company tremendously. ServiceNow has recorded a better than 1.0 sales efficiency for every year on record but 2014. Amazingly, the company was able to achieve an estimated sales efficiency of 1.8 at $93M in revenue.Impressively, the company is investing more and more into engineering - exceeding 20% of revenues last year - likely developing a broader feature set to enable additional up and cross sells.Gross margins hover in the 60s which is about 10 percentage points lower than the median. Software margins are roughly 80%, while the professional services team, which comprises about 14% of revenue operates at negative -17% gross margin.ServiceNow has mostly operated unprofitably, investing as much capital as it can into growth. But that's not to say the business isn't very capital efficient. The company raised less than $90 million before IPO.And in fact, ServiceNow has generated positive operating cash flow for every year but 2010.Although not that well known, ServiceNow is a business to be studied. The company has grown exceptionally quickly, using the median amount of capital, developed a superbly efficient sales and up selling playbook, all while being cash flow breakeven."

The growth is driven by the increasing adoption of the services by SMEs and due to implementation of policies like bring-your-own-device in most organizations.ServiceNow's Financials Cloud-based IT services provider ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) recently announced first quarter results that surpassed market expectations. Revenues grew 62% over the year to $139.1 million compared with the Street's projections of $134.6 million. Loss per share of $0.08 was in line with the market's expectations.By segment, subscription revenues grew 64% over the year to $117.38 million and professional services revenues grew 51% to $21.72 million.For the current quarter, ServiceNow projected revenues of $160 million-$162 million, significantly ahead of the Street's models of $156.6 million. They also increased the year's revenue outlook to $652 million-$657 million, compared with earlier provided estimates of $640 million-$645 million. The Street had projected revenues of $644.2 million for the year.ServiceNow's International Expansion Over the last year, ServiceNow has focused on expanding their markets internationally. During the quarter, North America accounted for 68% of the quarter's revenue share compared with 70% a year ago. The contribution of EMEA revenues increased to 26% from 24% a year ago and the rest of the world continued to bring in 6% of the quarter's share. During the previous year, ServiceNow has set up operations in 10 new countries.ServiceNow's New Offerings ServiceNow continues to expand their product offerings to make a bigger impact on cloud-based services for an organization. They recently introduced a service called ServiceNow Share which is an online marketplace that lets their customers and partners exchange applications and development content. Through the exchange, ServiceNow's customers will be able to use apps, content, and ideas from other members of ServiceNow's community and thus avoid building on their requirement from scratch. The portal includes apps that help solving problems like facilities workspace management and asset management to name a few. This feature is available to subscribers of ServiceNow App Creator, the tool that helps simplify creation of apps for PCs and mobile devices.Last year, ServiceNow also expanded their offerings beyond IT support. They released a HR-focused offering, HR Service Automation, that simplifies and automates HR case management for organizations. The application features an online storefront that is used to manage relationships between HR and the employees. It helps eliminate the need for phone calls and email exchanges by providing a self-service capability for employees to make requests to HR. Additionally, the application automates fulfillment and workflow management of requests for the HR team and also publishes dashboards and reports to show the nature of tasks performed by HR teams for better resource management.ServiceNow's Continuing Losses ServiceNow continues to invest heavily in research and development and sales and marketing efforts, thus continuing to suffer losses. During the previous quarter, sales and marketing expenses grew to 43% of revenues, compared with 40% of revenues a year ago. Research and development expenses also grew to 17% of revenues from 15% of revenues a year ago.

1961381,24317,2014-01-23T08:30:00-05:00,,"ServiceNow's (NYSE:NOW) bread and butter service is IT Service Management (ITSM). Its ITSM product is so much better than the competition that NOW is acquiring new customers rapidly all over the world, many in the Global 2000 (Enterprises with over 5000 employees). However, ITSM is a relatively small industry. NOW's monster market cap of around $10 billion developed from the expectation that its platform will become a one-stop shop for all IT and non-IT service automation.What investors need to ask themselves is, do the majority of ServiceNow's customers want to pay for other services besides ITSM, and how much, on average, would they be willing to pay?Many ServiceNow Clients Don't Want To Pay For Platform AppsAs ServiceNow mentioned often in its 2013 conference calls, many of its customers upgraded their ServiceNow usage to beyond traditional ITSM.In the Q213 conference call, ServiceNow's CEO, Frank Slootman, sums up the strategy:Orchestration and Discovery are upsells that ServiceNow has been selling for several years. However, these upsells have generated little revenue for ServiceNow, which is why the company still won't even report how much revenue it makes from them.In October of 2013, ServiceNow made the leap to start charging its customers to make applications on its platform. This is called ""Createnow"", which provides tools to make it easier to make applications. Before, ServiceNow allowed the use of the platform and Createnow for free. How will ServiceNow's customers react to being charged for a service that was free before?To get some color on how well ServiceNow is selling ""Createnow"", I interviewed Jeff Brooks, a Research Director in IT Operations Management at Gartner (NYSE:IT). Gartner is arguably the most respected objective research and analysis company on technology today. If stock price is any indication of a company's success, check out Gartner's stock. It rose a whopping 40% in 2013. On ""Createnow"" Mr. Brooks said:The following is Gartner's latest Platform as a Service (PAAS) magic quadrant:Salesforce and Microsoft's Azure are the leaders, with Google as a challenger. Notice that ServiceNow didn't even get on this quadrant. I asked Mr. Brooks, shouldn't ServiceNow at least be considered a ""niche player""?""Nope,"" answered Mr. Brooks, ""ServiceNow doesn't belong on that quadrant. That wasn't my notes, that was my colleague Yefim's (Natis) work. Yefim is our PAAS guru. Other researchers at Gartner have found similar data that I have on ServiceNow.""Darroll Buytenuys, the President of SAManage, who is impressed by ServiceNow's ability to disrupt the ITSM market, doesn't think ServiceNow would belong on the PAAS magic quadrant. He said:Mr. Buytenuys also stated that ""I'm excited about ServiceNow's success and we're following its lead. But if I was an investor, I'd probably short the stock.""The Evolution Of ITSM TodayThe Big 4 Legacy vendors, HP, IBM, BMC, and CA, are still rapidly losing their ITSM business. Their clunky on-premise solutions that are 20 years-old technology are hard to use. ServiceNow has had so much success because its ITSM product is very easy to use and has great solutions. There are other innovative ITSM cloud companies like Frontrange, Cherwell, and SAManage, but they don't target Global 2000 companies like ServiceNow does. ServiceNow rapidly gained many customers in the Global 2000 in 2013, and will no doubt acquire many more deals in 2014.I interviewed various people involved with IT Operations to get a sense of what is going on in the industry.Said an IT Manager at a bank in the Global 2000:Said Jon Temple, the CEO of Frontrange:Mr. Brooks stated:ServiceNow's Total ITSM MarketJeff Brooks says that the ITSM industry is $1.5 billion. But he did give leeway to that number due to unknown growth in IT in emerging countries like China, so we'll say that the ITSM industry is about $2 billion.Many experts say that half of the ITSM market is on-premise hosting, and it will stay that way for many years.Mr. Temple asserts:Since ServiceNow isn't on-premise, that cuts out half the ITSM market to put ServiceNow's total market at about $1 billion. Since ServiceNow's customers range from the mid-market to Fortune 500 companies, that means its maximum market is about 80% of that, or $800 million.ServiceNow is estimated to finish 2013 with about $410 million in revenues. The vast majority of that is from ITSM, so ServiceNow can probably squeeze another $200M out of that market, but that's probably about it. Since it's a single-tenant platform, each one of ServiceNow's customers has its own instance in its data-centers. A single tenant platform structure requires a lot more maintenance and personal attention from the vendor, which is why ServiceNow has small margins. Its Q413 gross margins are about 65% and operating margins are about break even.Some ServiceNow Customers Are Shopping AroundThree different people whose business it is to find out what's going on in the IT industry: Jon Temple of Frontrange, Jeff Brooks of Gartner, and Matt Selheimer of ITinvolve, all told me that they have come across several ServiceNow customers that are up for renewal and decided to sign up only for ServiceNow's one-year subscription, rather than its three-year subscription. Since all three came upon this information, it's very likely to be true.Mr. Temple said:Here is a case study of a company that went from Frontrange, tried ServiceNow, and then returned to Frontrange again. The study says the Australian company, Sedgman, switched back to Frontrange because:It seems as though Sedgman didn't need all the extra apps that ServiceNow offered. It just wanted a solid, cloud-based IT service desk for a better price than ServiceNow, and it found that with Frontrange.Are ServiceNow's Workload Automation Tools Unique?Mr. Brooks doesn't think so. He says:ConclusionWill ServiceNow eventually grow into its valuation? I think it's possible if it can get a lot of Global 2000 companies to heavily use its platform outside of ITSM and outside of IT in general. But it is too soon to tell how well it will be able to monetize its platform. ServiceNow's management tell a very compelling story and clearly some of its customers are responding well to the platform, as Frank Slootman describes in the conference calls. But investors are not going to have much visibility until ServiceNow actually reports numbers on platform upsells. Now that ServiceNow is specifically pricing ITSM and the platform separately, it will have to reveal some hard numbers later this year, most likely in Q214. Until then, the market cap has gotten ahead of itself, because we don't know for sure if ServiceNow really will get the results it says it will or if it's just telling a story of how it wants things to be.Disclosure: I am short NOW.

        The company has significantly outpaced the ITSM industry's growth and should continue to perform well. Yet, ServiceNow won't be able to significantly outpace the industry due to their recent success.
        One of the major issues with ServiceNow's current valuation has been the company's limited addressable market. However, management has been expanding into new markets.
        The company's recent expansion efforts have shown early signs of success. Additionally, the expansion should help maintain a high level of growth.
        However, investors have priced in a significant amount of growth. Investors' high expectations have limited the potential upside but the stock isn't a good short due to no near-term catalyst.","ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a provider of service management solutions mainly for IT departments. A service management solution helps departments like IT manage inquires, request for services, and fix recurring problems. The IT service management or ITSM market is mature and slow growing. Although in a mature market, ServiceNow has been able to grow rapidly and gain significant market share. From 2009-2013, revenue grew at a CAGR of 116.5%. The company's rapid growth has coincided with an increase in gross margin. In 2013, gross margin was 63.4% which is a slight improvement over 2009's 59.3%. ServiceNow's strong financial performance has continued into 2014. Revenue grew 61.8% in Q2 and 62.5% in the first half. Gross margin remained essentially flat at 63.7%. The company's recent financial performance has resulted in a rapid rise of their stock. In June 2012, ServiceNow had an IPO which was priced at $18 a share. Since the IPO, the stock has risen 228.7% which has increased the company's market cap to nearly $9 billion. Can ServiceNow continue their strong financial performance?ServiceNow's growth has been driven by a combination of industry growth and market share gain. The overall ITSM market was expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.3% from 2012-2016, according to TechNavio. Yet, cloud based ITSM has grown much faster and is estimated to continue to outpace traditional on premise solutions. The cloud based ITSM market is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 16.82% until 2018, according to TechNavio. As shown above, ServiceNow's revenue growth was significantly higher than the cloud based market's low double digit growth. In order to maintain their rapid growth, ServiceNow will need to outpace the expected market growth rate. To produce a growth rate higher than the industry, the company needs to gain a significant amount of market share. Due to their recent success, ServiceNow will have a difficult time significantly outpacing the ITSM industry's growth rate. This is why management has been expanding into new markets. In 2014, there has been significant progress in diversifying revenue. The company's market expansion efforts will help ServiceNow continue to grow rapidly. However, investors are expecting a significant amount of future growth. Investors high expectations have increased the risk of stockownership. Although the stock's valuation is high, it isn't an ideal candidate for shorting due to no near-term catalyst.Great PerformanceServiceNow's business strategy is to specifically target enterprise organizations. These organizations make very large purchases which has contributed to the company's rapid growth. The company's sales team has been able to acquire a significant amount of large and midsized customers. On the Q2 conference call, Frank Slootman CEO talked about their customer base ""Our installed base is now 2,364 accounts with 455 Global 2000 customers."" In Q2, the entire customer base increased 7.7% sequentially while global 200 customers increased 6.8% sequentially. The customer base is large and very diverse with no customer accounting for more than 10% of revenue. Customer growth is being driven by the company's ability to compete and win at a very high level. On the Q2 conference call, Frank Slootman talked about the competitive environment ""I mean a little bit of competition coming up from the bottom. That's truly the end of it. Our win rate is exceedingly high. I mean if we have any losses, it tends to be in the context of postponements or doing nothing for the time being."" The sales team has been able to rapidly acquire new customers but the company's products are keeping them.Gartner ranks ServiceNow as the leader in the IT service support management or ITSSM market. ServiceNow is significantly ahead of the nearest competitor. Due to their quality products, ServiceNow has a very high renewal rate. On the Q2 conference call, Frank Slootman discussed their renewal rate ""This quarter was marked by strong demand from the customer base, with renewals at 98% and upsells at 33% of annual contract values signed in the quarter as well as strong new account contributions."" These customers are renewing at a high level, purchasing more products, and still committing to long contracts. On the Q1 conference call, Michael Scarpelli CFO discussed customer contract length ""Our average contract terms for new customer upsells and renewals were 36, 23.2 and 24.2 months respectively, compared to an average of 34.3, 24 and 25.6 months on a trailing four quarters basis, respectively."" In Q1, the duration for renewal and upsell contracts decreased but the decline was very minimal. Additionally, the average new contract length increased to 36 months. Management has done an exceptional job growing the company's revenue, customer base, and brand. The company's growth should continue to remain strong. On the Q2 conference call, Frank Slootman talked about a recent market study ""A recent CIO survey by Morgan Stanley further illustrates our platform momentum as approximately 30% of the CIOs polled plan to use ServiceNow as a platform by the end of 2015, a nearly 50% increase from their previous survey in January 2014."" Yet, the company is facing a significant issue.The majority of the company's revenue has been generated from the ITSM market. Yet, this market is estimated to be only a few billion dollars. The market's small size is why management has been expanding into new markets. The company's business strategy has always been to gain acceptance in the IT department and move into other business segments. On the Q2 conference call, Frank Slootman talked about their business strategy ""I mean our go to market, if you may recall from prior calls, we always seek to land an IT organization, occupy that space, then use the advocacy of the IT organization to start invading adjacent service domains."" The company has recently expanded into other operating segments and is showing early signs of success.Expanding Into New Market SegmentsOne of the major arguments for shorting the company's stock has been their limited total addressable market. Gartner estimates ServiceNow's total addressable market is $1.5 billion. However, management believes they have a much larger potential market. At the Citi Global Technology conference, Mike Scarpelli stated ""We think overall it's at least a $12 billion plus market opportunity in front of us."" The $12 billion market opportunity doesn't even include the $19 billion IT operations management or ITOM market. These two markets would make ServiceNow's total addressable market $31 billion. Yet, ServiceNow doesn't currently cater to the entire market and only serves a small segment. Although, the company is making progress in their expansion efforts. On the Q2 conference call, Frank Slootman talked about the percentage of non-ITSM revenue from new customers ""yes, I think the figure is 32% this quarter. So it's substantially in the same area as it was last quarter...We believe it's an understated metric."" The metric is understated due to the exclusion of up-selling. Yet, the metric demonstrates significant market expansion. Additionally, the Q2 percentage remained relatively flat only dropping slightly from 34% in Q1.The company's new product offerings have helped land several large deals. On the Q2 conference call, Frank Slootman discussed the impact of HR service management ""...Starting with IT and HR the company as a global deployment across other service domains. The usability and agility of our platform was decisive in winning the contract with an annualized value of approximately $4 million."" Additionally, the new products are leading to more purchases from the customer base. On the Q2 conference call, Frank Slootman stated ""One of these was an upsell to a North American insurance fund. Their lack of a centralized HR service model inundated the group with questions and requests by phone and email."" The company's HR service automation solution was released last year but is showing early success. On the Q2 conference call, Frank Slootman talked about their HR solution ""Our HR service automation application has seen good uptick since we released the product last year, totaling 23 transactions in the second quarter alone."" The company's expansion beyond the ITSM market has only begun. The expansion should help keep revenue growth high. However, investors have priced in a significant amount of future growth.High Valuation Doesn't Mean ShortServiceNow is positioned to continue to perform well. Management is expanding outside of their traditional ITSM market. The expansion effort has show early success. Yet, ServiceNow's stock is overvalued. The above group is comprised of several high growth stocks. Despite the comparison group's elevated valuations, ServiceNow is still trading at a high valuation compared to the group. They are trading at a premium to the faster growing Tableau based on P/S and EV/Revenue. ServiceNow isn't growing anywhere near as fast as FireEye but is trading at a close valuation. ServiceNow's stock is only trading as expected compared to NetSuite. ServiceNow is overvalued based on Tableau and slightly overvalued compared to FireEye. Another sign the stock is overvalued, the company's revenue growth has been trending downward over the last several years. However, the company's slower growth hasn't resulted in a massive stock decline.The reason the stock hasn't significantly declined is due to ServiceNow's growth gradually slowing. Revenue growth was 90.3% in 2012 and 74.2% in 2013. In 2014, revenue grew 63.1% in Q2 and 61.8% in Q1. Although growth has slowed, it hasn't drastically declined. Additionally, management doesn't seen any near-term issues with growth. Management's Q3 revenue guidance was higher than analyst expectations. Q3 revenue guidance was $173-$175 million which was higher than analyst estimates of $169.5 million, according to Investor's Business Daily. Management is also aggressively hiring sales staff. As of June 30th 2014, employee head count was 2,328. On the Q2 conference call, Michael Scarpelli talked about adding sales personal ""... we're going to add roughly another 170 to 180 in the second half of this year..."" Management isn't forecasting or managing for any near-term issues. As a result, the company's strong growth should continue but will gradually slowdown. The gradual slowdown in growth shouldn't result in a significant stock decline but will limit an investor's potential upside. Despite no signs of near-term growth issues, the company's slowing growth and high valuation has decreased the risk reward.Limited Upside PotentialServiceNow has been able to disrupt the ITSM market with their cloud based solution. They have significantly outpaced the market's growth rate. Yet, the ITSM market is a relatively small market. Due to their recent success, ServiceNow will have a difficult time significantly outpacing the industry's expected growth. As a result, management has been expanding into new market segments which has increased their total addressable market. ServiceNow's market expansion efforts have shown early signs of success. Their HR automation solution has helped land several large new contracts and is selling well to current customers. ServiceNow should be able to continue to grow rapidly due to their expansion efforts. Yet, investors have priced in a significant amount of future growth.ServiceNow's stock is trading at a significantly high valuation even compared to other high growth stocks. This combined with the company's rapid but slowing growth will limit an investor's potential gain. Yet, the high valuation and slowing growth hasn't resulted in a rapid decline in the stock. The stock hasn't rapidly declined because growth has gradually slowed. Additionally at least in the near-term, management believes revenue growth should remain strong. The company's stock isn't a good short due to the lack of near-term catalyst. However, the high valuation and slowing growth has reduced the risk reward."

Basically, the organization makes enterprise IT more efficient and effective. These solutions are gaining traction in the market. But I would like to see more uptake from large enterprise customers.Looking forward, management is forecasting revenue growth of about 60% in the fourth quarter. This is down from the annual growth rate. That could mean there is room for the company to outperform in the current quarter, or it could mean that the increase in the customer base is slowing. Additionally, management is predicting a breakeven operating margin.The company is introducing new product offerings and making strategic acquisitions. This comes with solid liquidity, solvency and profitability (based on CFO/Revenues). Overall, the business looks like it has potential, but the valuation is too expensive for my taste. I would like to accumulate shares if I can get them at a better price.NOW data by YCharts(The share price is roughly flat since my last report, but is coming off of a moderate intermediate-term correction and could be heading for a new high.)Recent DevelopmentsBusiness SummaryServiceNow is a leading provider of cloud-based services to automate enterprise IT operations. The company focuses on transforming enterprise IT by automating and standardizing service relationships and consolidating IT across the global enterprise. Organizations deploy its service to create a single system of record for enterprise IT, lower operational costs and enhance efficiency.The company helps make enterprise IT more efficient. The customer base is primarily large enterprises, which provide sticky, lucrative contracts. There are a few recognizable names on the list of disclosed customers.At the end of the quarter ending September 30, 2013, the cash ratio was 0.82 as the cash balance stood at $220M. Liquidity declined since the end of calendar 2012. But the financial leverage ratio was 2.01 at the end of the September quarter, and the company didn't have any debt reported on its balance sheet.The gross profit margin increased from 57% to 62.6% on a y/y basis (comparing the September quarters). This came as total revenues increased 73%. The company generated a GAAP operating loss. But cash flow from operations was positive and enough to cover capital expenditures. CFO was 15.2% of total revenues.ServiceNow generates revenues from subscriptions. Thus, the revenue stream should be relatively stable. In other words, as a mature company, the variance of revenues would be lower than a manufacturer's revenues. This means the results of operations should be more predictable.For the fourth quarter, management is expecting revenues between $119M and $121M, representing y/y growth between 58% and 61%. The gross margin could be 65% with a break-even operating margin. The revenues growth rate is expected to slow in the fourth quarter.RisksValuationAt 26.5 times book and almost 20 times sales, ServiceNow is overvalued. If you assume 100% sales growth the next two years, you get to 5 times sales. And that is without upside to the share price. In this situation, the growth rate is above the cost of equity; consequently, the valuation is infinite, which doesn't make economic sense.Morningstar says the intrinsic value is $37 per share. This is still a bit pricey in my opinion. I would prefer $33 per share or below, which is 12x sales or lower.There is uptake of the solutions by large enterprises and the renewal rate is encouraging. Making IT more efficient is an idea that should gain traction. I would like to see more uptake by large enterprises and a lower valuation before I ""buy"" the story.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1709522,40031,2013-09-23T18:59:13-04:00,,"ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is delivering exceptional top line growth, while the bottom line is still negative. The company is in the early innings of its growth phase, as it needs to ramp up spending in order to maintain its high revenue growth. As its business matures, it will reap the benefits of its past, present, and future investments, as they translate into profits.NOW data by YChartsCompany overviewServiceNow is a leading provider of cloud-based services that automate enterprise IT operations. The company focuses on making it easier for customers to consolidate their IT needs into their global automated network. Customers can use these services to create a single system of record and as a result, lower their costs and increase efficiency.Superior products and executionThe company's revenue is growing so fast because of the rapid adoption of its products, and because its products are superior to competing products. This rapid adoption is due to ServiceNow's ability to integrate a large number of IT solutions into one, easily manageable system. Its main competitors are BMC (NASDAQ:BMC) with its Remedy ITSM (IT Service Management) solutions, and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) with its Peregrine Systems. According to ServiceNow's management, 40% to 60% of ServiceNow's new customers are from BMC and HP.The issue with BMC's and HP's solutions is that customers fail to upgrade to Remedy and Peregrine products, and this drove them to consider ServiceNow. BMC has roughly 8,000 customers right now, and ServiceNow about 1,700, so there is still ample room to grow through the BMC's installed base. The total addressable market is around 12,000 organizations worldwide, based on the Capital IQ company screen. This screen represents organizations worldwide with more than 1,000 employees and with annual revenue above $500 million.Another issue favoring ServiceNow's services is consolidation. A lot of BMC's and HP's customers have tried to consolidate all of their IT service management systems into one, and faced problems. ServiceNow does that very well. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), one of its clients took 157 systems into one, and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) consolidated 143 systems into one. ServiceNow services were made to take this consolidation into account, while the competing solutions are outdated and were never designed to operate in a modern Internet world.Improving fundamentalsIn the six quarters since the company went public, quarterly revenue growth was above 80%. The company has come a long way from 2008, when it reported just $8 million in revenue, to $243 million in 2012. The company is on track to surpass $400 million in revenue in 2013.ServiceNow is on its way to its long-term operational goals. Those goals include:- Gross margin at 68% to 70%, which will be accomplished by the improved economies of scale (current gross margin is in 60% to 65% range);- Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue are expected in 29% to 31% range. The current rate is around 46% in the latest quarter.- Research and development as a percentage of revenue in 11% to 13% range, which would be a bit lower than the current 13% to 14% range.- Operating margin around 20%, which is currently negative.Those goals will primarily be achieved through improved economies of scale, slower pace of R&D spending (when compared to overall revenue growth) and reduced selling, general and administrative expenses. This will enable the company to become profitable after the rapid revenue growth phase is over, and reward the patient shareholders.ConclusionServiceNow is expected to continue to reap benefits from the further advances in cloud-computing, and a general shift from outdated services. The competing products are currently weak and the competition needs to work hard to become a dangerous adversary to ServiceNow. As the situation stands now, the majority of new customers are coming from two top competitors: BMC and HP. So, the lack of earnings is not a cause of concern, since the company is investing heavily into expansion. A few quarters down the road we should see an improvement in operational efficiency as the revenue growth slows, and the company focuses more on profitability.Additional sources: ServiceNow investor presentation, ServiceNow SEC filingsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1935851,23563,2014-01-09T09:00:00-05:00,,"It's certainly been a year to remember for investors, with the benchmark S&P 500 up 30%, the tech-heavy NASDAQ-100 up 37%, and many sectors, including cloud computing, rising further yet. Last year provided great opportunities to make money, as every dip in the market has been an excellent buying opportunity.But the tech euphoria has gotten out of hand in certain sectors. In many ways, the investing community seems to be repeating its mistakes from the irrational exuberance of the late 1990s. Many investors are buying stocks not due to fundamentals, but rather due to sexy-sounding stories of future growth combined with momentum: as in that previous internet tech era, people are again buying stocks principally because the stocks are already rising and have garnered investor enthusiasm.In the case of ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), we've already discussed the very low likelihood that the company can grow into its valuation. Longs are overestimating ServiceNow's addressable markets and software capabilities. Investors were shown another red flag last Thursday when NOW's Chief Technology Officer, Arne Josefsberg, who joined the business in October 2011 after 25 years with Microsoft, unexpectedly resigned from his position.But enough has been said about ServiceNow's business prospects. We'd rather focus on the more basic similarities between the current environment and 1999. One of the most jarring flashbacks has been the return of extremely sloppy and dubious sell-side research. While we have not quite hit the excesses of the tech bubble yet, we're seeing disturbing reminders of that past mania.During the 1990's tech boom, abuses within equity research led to SEC enforcement actions, industry bans and a litany of new regulations to curtail the regular exchange of stock promotion for investment banking business. Reg FD was enacted in 2000, Henry Blodget was banned from the industry and ""Chinese Walls"" sprang up all over the industry.Ten years later, it appears that history is repeating itself. With the IPO and secondary offering markets as hot as they've been in ages, it seems that banks may again be putting deal-making ahead of quality research.In the specific case of ServiceNow, analysts have gotten sloppy on one of the most basic inputs of equity valuation: the number of fully diluted shares of common stock. Visit a basic finance website such as Yahoo Finance or Google and you'll see 138.7 million shares for ServiceNow, leading to a market cap of about $8.1bn at the current $58 share price. You could forgive an ordinary retail investor for assuming that this information is accurate.However, professional investors should always be aware of the total capital structure, rather than just the number of current outstanding shares, which is one of many inputs to determine valuation. In the case of young companies, particularly in technology, analysts can't overlook stock option grants to employees. Since tech startups tend to be short on cash and long on blue sky potential, they forgo paying higher compensation in the short-run and defer it via options. Usually this doesn't make too much of a difference in the long run, but if a company is particularly successful, and/or its shares perform exceedingly well, the impact of options grants given to executives and early-hire employees can be dramatic.ServiceNow has more than 25 million outstanding in-the-money stock options, in addition to almost 5 million restricted stock units (""RSUs"") (2013 10-Q3). With the options having an average strike price of $8.12 and RSUs providing no future cash to ServiceNow's treasury at all, these 30 million issued shares represent a tremendous dilutive overhang to the company's share count. When these 30 million shares convert into common stock, the company will raise only ~$200 million in proceeds but be burdened with $1.75bn of newly traded common stock.In reality there are 169 million shares of ServiceNow, or 165.4 million using the treasury stock method, rather than the 139 million you see reported at sites such as Yahoo or Google. And it's excusable that these free finance sites are wrong; you get what you pay for. This is why an investor should always check a company's filings rather than simply trusting a free website's computer-generated financial information.It's less excusable when professional equity research analysts, trained at top business schools and working at prestigious investment banks, are no more reliable than Yahoo Finance. We first noted a year ago that several bulge bracket analysts were overlooking the option pool. We figured that analysts would quickly correct what we figured was merely a simple oversight.But it's now been more than a year, and analysts are still willingly sticking with their clearly inaccurate numbers. Numerous banks continue to mislead clients with wildly inaccurate share counts and market capitalizations for ServiceNow.Data to calculate the correct share count is easily found in ServiceNow's latest 10Q-3 2013:Here, we see 138.7 million shares of common stock, 4.8 million Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), and 25.5 million outstanding stock options. RSUs cost employees nothing to exercise, so those are virtually assured to turn into common stock as they vest. Now let's check the outstanding options to see where their strike price is on average:Given that the average exercise price for the options is $8, compared to a current share price of $58, and even the most recently granted round of options are still well in the money, it should be assumed that the vast majority of these options will turn into common stock as well. Thus, adding together the 138.7 million common shares, the 4.8 million RSUs, and 21.9 million dilutive impact from the options (using the treasury method), we arrive at 165.4 million fully diluted outstanding shares, which results in a market cap of $9.6bn. Not so difficult.By comparison, below is a quick tour around various investment banks' reports for the company. These figures were pulled from the batch of October 23-24th reports following NOW's Q3 2013 results.Wells Fargo:Wells Fargo claims 137.5 million shares. Did they simply lift this figure from Reuters?Barclays:Barclays claims 136.8 million shares. At least Barclays can blame FactSet Fundamentals for getting it wrong, perhaps?Credit Suisse:Credit Suisse follows Barclays' lead with a similarly erroneous 136.8 million figure.Deutsche Bank:Deutsche Bank diverges from the others using a share count of 147 million (still well off the correct figure) to arrive at its mistaken market cap, which they make sure to provide in both dollars and Euros.Susquehanna:Susquehanna follows the example of several other firms that really like that 136.8 million share count figure.Stephens:Notice that Stephens specifically characterizes its share count as ""fully diluted."" Not only does Stephens attach itself to the inaccurate 136.8 million figure, but by including the words ""fully diluted,"" Stephens earns itself a special spot within the ServiceNow equity research hall of shame.Janney:Janney, not bucking consensus, uses the faulty 136.8 million figure as well.The preceding reports were prepared before the release of NOW's 10-Q3 2013 on November 4th. Yet this does not excuse the oversight of the option pool. As of 10-Q2, NOW still had 136.8 million common shares, 27.5 million options with an average strike price of $7.16, and 3.9 million RSUs. At a $52.96 share price, this would equate to 164.5 fully diluted million shares, still nowhere near the figures cited in the brokerage reports.Furthermore, the justification that options are ""anti-dilutive"" given NOW's ongoing net income losses is ridiculous. Option grants are not free, nor does the conversion right disappear, just because a business isn't profitable.We also want to be clear that there are a handful of firms that do list the correct share count for ServiceNow. In contrast with all the erroneous tables above, here is a table from JMP Securities, for example, whose analysts actually did their math properly and account for the upcoming new shares:Bravo JMP! For correctly calculating something as basic as shares outstanding!It is important to note that investment banking analysts normally are capable of determining the correct number of shares outstanding in a company's stock. It's perplexing that the majority of the Street won't or can't get the number right here. It truly is unusual to see so many firms be this wrong about something this basic and remain mistaken for such a long period of time. By contrast, check out the below November 19th, 2013 price target upgrade from Citigroup's Yaron Werber:Werber digs far enough into the weeds to calculate that a previously dilutive convertible note/warrant package is being retired prematurely, and as such, the consensus view of the outstanding share count is too high. Not only had the Street (correctly) factored in a previously announced potential dilutive overhang, but now an analyst realized the overhang will have been cleared and in turn adjusted the price target accordingly. This is the sort of analysis we expect from professional investment analysts, which makes the grossly misleading ServiceNow coverage all the more ludicrous.Why are the Analysts so Wrong?The bigger question may indeed be why analysts are unable or unwilling to factor in 27 million shares, or $1.55bn worth of capitalization, of way-in-the-money soon-to-be common stock. Previously, you could have ascribed the error to mere sloppiness. Perhaps everyone was pulling their numbers from Yahoo Finance or otherwise not digging into the SEC filings enough to pull out the real number of outstanding shares.But since we launched our coverage on ServiceNow more than a year ago and highlighted the fact that the majority of analysts were using grossly inaccurate share counts, it seems harder to attribute the misstatement to mere sloppiness at this late date. A simple oversight like that, once pointed out, is easy to correct.In theory, there is a so-called ""Chinese wall"" between the parts of investment banks that analyze companies and the parts of investment banks that earn fees from companies by providing them services such as IPO and secondary underwriting advisory. In practice, however, it is often questionable whether or not there is much separation between the research and banking arms of financial firms.Take, for example, the recent Evoke Pharma IPO (NASDAQ:EVOK). Aegis Capital was the sole bookrunner for the Evoke IPO, no doubt earning a healthy fee for its services. Earlier this month, following the IPO, Aegis' biotech analyst launched coverage for Evoke, then trading at $8, with a jaw-dropping $60 price target. Needless to say, a 650% upside target raises eyebrows, and the more conspiratorially-minded person might draw a connection between Aegis' ambitious price target and Aegis' earning of Evoke's IPO fees. Any company considering Aegis' IPO services in the future will likely recall the underwriter's most favorable research opinions for IPOs it has recently underwritten. If you were seeking to define the phrases ""perverse incentive"" or ""moral hazard"" in a business textbook, this sort of example would come to mind.Historically, the ""wall"" between investment research and banking has often resembled clear cellophane as opposed to anything reliably separating the two divisions. During the last tech boom, CEOs were openly telling analysts to raise their investment ratings before they'd consider doing banking business with the analyst's firm. For example, Bernie Ebbers, former CEO of MCI WorldCom, was asked if he'd do a banking deal with Merrill Lynch. Ebbers replied, ""No. We have to have a better rating before Merrill Lynch would do the investment banking."" This doling out of banking fees based on investment research ratings was common practice, as former telecoms analyst Dan Reingold, in his book, recounted: ""Bernie [Ebbers] wasn't one to mince words. He simply said aloud what others thought to themselves.""Later on during the cycle, Jack Grubman, Salomon Smith Barney's former rock star telecom analyst, was asked by Salomon's president to ""take a fresh look"" at his long-standing negative opinion on AT&T. Grubman soon upgraded AT&T shares. Seemingly as a result, Salomon reaped lucrative fees from a deal involving an AT&T wireless subsidiary spin-off. Grubman, for doing his part to generate banking business, was able to leverage his upgrade to get his employer to donate $1 million to the 92nd Street Y so that Grubman could get his children accepted into an exclusive Manhattan nursery school.After examples like this, it's no wonder that market participants began to have doubts about the independence of Wall Street research. Former New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer confirmed people's worst fears when his investigation hit the mother lode of wrongdoing at Merrill. Among internal emails at Merrill relating to Goto.com, a stock they had a ""buy"" rating on, Spitzer found one where an investor emailed Merrill about the company: ""What's so interesting about GOTO except banking fees????"" A Merrill research analyst replied: ""nothin."" Or from one Merrill analyst to another: ""I don't want to be a whore for f-ing management. We are losing people money and I don't like it. john and mary smith are losing their retirement because we don't want [the CEO of Goto.com] to be mad at us."" In another example, former Merrill analyst Henry Blodget referred to a stock he had a buy rating on as a ""piece of s--t"" in an internal e-mail.Despite all the talk of a wall between investment research and banking fees, it's clear where Wall Street's biases lie. Which brings us back to ServiceNow, as NOW has been a most prodigious generator of banking fees itself. A cynical person might suspect that ServiceNow's propensity to unceasingly emit new stock and debt, and in the process offer lucrative fees to investment bankers, is in some way tempting analysts to look for the bright side of ServiceNow's rather cloudy forward business prospects.Hypothetically, one great way for analysts to juice up their analysis and be able to have their models spit out more optimistic price targets would be to undercount, inadvertently or intentionally, the number of outstanding shares. For ServiceNow, by ignoring the existence of 27 million fully diluted shares, analysts have an extra $1.55bn of breathing room to use when constructing their valuation estimates.For a look at this in action, consider Janney's valuation model from its October 7th Initiating Coverage report for ServiceNow:Janney employs a discounted cash flow analysis model. Their model assumes optimistic growth rates of free cash flow, rising from $8 million this year to $74 million by 2015, $339 million in 2017, and all the way up to more than $1.6 billion by 2022. Obviously, it seems a little ridiculous to forecast a 132% compound growth rate of cash generation over the next five years when in fact ServiceNow's free cash flow generation has been virtually nil over the past several years and has shown little sign of turning the corner in recent quarters.But even granting this most optimistic of forecasts, Janney's model still only deduces a net present value of $53.11 per share ($6.8bn of net present value plus cash). This doesn't seem bad (or particularly good) given that the stock is trading at $58. But when you realize that Janney only accounted for 134 million shares, contrasted with the 165.4 million actual fully diluted shares of ServiceNow, you have to re-run the math. Dividing that $6.8bn of net present value plus the cash balance of $347m by 165.4 million fully diluted shares, you see that Janney's real price target is near $43! Even if ServiceNow manages to meet Janney's lofty operating growth targets, the stock is still overvalued by 25% at present levels!And Janney is far from the most optimistic of analysts on the street. Other more bullish firms have much more outlandish price targets. For ServiceNow, which generates almost no cash and loses money on a net income basis despite having conquered close to a quarter of the market share in its rather limited addressable market (particularly since peak penetration is likely only around 50% given security concerns around using a cloud-based service for sensitive data), it's hard to fathom what sort of upside analysts are fantasizing about.How It's All Going To EndServiceNow has a reasonably good ITSM product, and it will likely continue gaining share in that market. From its current 30% market share (Gartner estimates market size near $1.5bn), NOW could, with good operating performance, get to maybe 50% market share as more clients move from BMC's legacy solutions to ServiceNow's cloud offering.The touted great upside of the IT operations and PaaS is simply unlikely to occur. Analysts are hyper-focused on the platform area because ServiceNow's current operations cannot come close to justifying the company's daunting $9.6bn market cap. We don't believe the platform business is sufficiently promising to justify the sky-high valuation multiples.ServiceNow insiders have been dumping shares, issuing dilutive financings, and waiving lock-up commitments for IPO shares in order to, it seems, squeeze as much cash as possible out of its overinflated share price. Wall Street analysts complacently keep offering up fanciful research opinions including a basic $1.6bn misstatement of ServiceNow's market cap, while the banking teams keep collecting fees off ServiceNow's latest public offerings. Needless to say, this probably won't end well for investors late to the party.Disclosure: The author is short NOW. The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.

North America is expected to put forth a total of $250 billion in cloud spending and would achieve a CAGR in spending of 20.3 percent.

These revenues saw a growth rate of around 16 percent over the past few years.The company's gross profit margin has been somewhat stable over the periods, around the 60 percent mark, with the highest percentage achieved in the second quarter of 2011. This suggests that the company's cost of services has been increasing proportionally with sales.After the first few quarters of positive margins, the company's operating margin has declined sharply. After the decline, the operating margin has persisted at around the -15 percentage mark. This is suggestive of the fact that the company's operating cost has been highly volatile over the period and increasing substantially throughout the periods.The largest costs for the company are its sales and marketing costs. Because the company is generally involved in direct selling, this portion is bound to be high. Another cause of high percentage of costs for sales and marketing, as stated by the management, is that the company has continued to expand its operations in existing markets as well as in new markets. Thus, the company has substantially increased its headcount in sales and marketing personnel in order to grasp a higher market share. Although it seems imprudent, it is vital for a growing company to invest highly in sales and marketing in order to establish itself in the market, especially in a market where big-name players such as International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) already exist. The second-largest cost for the company is the cost associated with R&D. These expenditures are also vital for the company in order to enhance and improve its services so as to capture new customers and retain already existing customers. General and administrative costs have remained low throughout the periods, coming in at an average of 15 percent of total revenues.The net margin has also followed the trends in the operating margins, as the company has significantly low interest expense and other incomes. This means that controlling operating costs is very important for the company to return to profitability.DuPont AnalysisDue to negative shareholders' equity prior to Q3 2012, it was not possible to conduct a DuPont analysis for prior periods. As can be seen from the table above, the company has been generating negative returns for its shareholders. This is due to the fact that company margins have been negative for several periods. Although the company has improved its performance, the primary reason for this improvement is the decline in its financial leverage. The leverage has declined significantly, but this is because the company has seen its shareholders' equity move from a negative figure to a positive one. This resulted in a low shareholders' equity in the early periods, which gradually increased to lower the financial leverage for the company. The reason for the increase in shareholders' equity is that the company has been issuing new stocks in order to finance the growth of the company. Another reason for the company's negative ROE is the gradual reduction in the company's utilization of its assets. The asset turnover of the company declined to 0.17 from 0.22 in Q3 of 2012.Major SegmentsDespite the fact that the company has enhanced its operations in the international market, it is still heavily dependent on the US market. This is also because of the fact that the US cloud market is the largest and is also expected to be the highest-growing in the future. However, the US market is also the most competitive of all the regions. The second most significant geographic area for the company is Europe, which is also the second-largest cloud market in the world.Competition and Future OutlookThe public cloud is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years, reaching up to $144.7 billion by 2016 from the 2012 figure of $84.1 billion. The new cloud has generated extensive interest from various regions of the world. The largest market for the industry is still North America, and it is also expected to remain the largest for the foreseeable future. The market has seen a huge influx of vendors in the market, creating intense competition despite high growth. Although there are several small and new players in the industry, it continues to be dominated by large players such as IBM, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), and SAP (NYSE:SAP).The ERP segment of the cloud market in which NOW operates has also seen a large amount of competition. The industry is highly fragmented with numerous companies holding less than 5 percent share. As can be seen from the chart below, the largest company is SAP, which holds approximately one-fourth of the industry's share. The graph clearly indicates the high level of competition in the market, and it is also evident that NOW holds a very small proportion of the market.The company has significantly underperformed its competitors in terms of all the indicators. The company is expected to continue to perform at the given rate because of the fact that it would have to heavily invest in marketing and sales as well as R&D in order to increase its market share, which is going to be extremely difficult.ConclusionThis new company has a long way to go before it can start generating profits. The high level of competition in the core market of the company indicates that it would have to find new regions in order to increase its sales rapidly; however, such a step would put additional strain on the company's margins. The control of large companies with better financial positions is another problem for the company, as it would be extremely difficult for the company to cut the market share of its competitors. All these reasons indicate a negative future outlook for NOW; thus I would give a sell recommendation for the company.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1688422,24466,2013-09-11T16:06:02-04:00,,"Mid-tier IT companies have struggled to compete with the top tier IT companies in the recent past. Projects were hard to come by because they mostly were grabbed by the big companies. But, as the macro-economic environment and customer sentiments are improving, IT spending again has taken a leap. This has reduced the competition and pricing pressure for the mid-tier IT companies. Also, with a better learning curve and economies of scale, these companies have improved on their margins. In this article, I am analyzing three high-growth, mid-tier IT companies that have posted strong quarterly results and have strong a projects pipeline, making me optimistic about their future growth prospects.Strong core offering coupled with product and geographic diversificationServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) recently reported a strong second quarter, with Y/Y billing growth of 63% beating the consensus estimate of 57%. Its revenue increased by 80% to $102 million. The company has raised its guidance for the third quarter. The platform usage of the company is strong and its deal size is increasing. The company's renewal rate is still strong, with 94% of its clients renewing their usage of its platforms. Watch out for this stock because upward rally will continue.The company has had a good growth even beyond its core ITSM (IT Service Management) market. The company has announced its intention to launch its analytical services this August, based on its Mirror42 acquisition. I believe these initiatives will drive future growth.The company also has significant opportunity to expand globally. Currently the company is building data centers in Mexico, Hong Kong, and Singapore. The company is expanding in Asia, also, where it's current revenue is only 6%. Asia provides an opportunity for the company to increase its revenue. Overall, I believe the company will grow faster in the coming year.Although the company is trading at a high P/E, I believe it is still in nascent stages of its growth and has good future growth prospects.Strong pipeline and recovering end marketsVirtusa Corp (NASDAQ:VRTU) shares have given a return of 62% year to date against NASDAQ's 23% return. The company reported strong first quarter results. As the company's pipeline is strong and its deal conversion has reached its normal level, I expect the future quarters also will be strong. The stock looks attractive at its current market price.Although, the company's margins this quarter were hurt by its hedging of rupee [INR] against dollar [USD], the business fundamentals remain strong. The company has strong pipeline growth with some large deals which I expect will materialize in the next quarter. This will drive revenue and profit.During the recent quarter, the European market and the vertical communications and telecommunications have declined. Recent data in the European region has shown major signs of recovery in the economy. So, I believe that more projects will come to the company. Also, the change in the financial sector regulations will lead to more outsourcing demand that will be a catalyst for growth. The communications and telecom sector also has bottomed out and is showing signs of recovery. So I am bullish on the company's prospects.The company's forward P/E of 15.32 and PEG ratio of 0.99 indicate that the company is undervalued and therefore is good to have in one's portfolio.Big deals and improved sales executioniGate Corporation (NASDAQ:IGTE) stock has given a year to date return of 53.60% against NASDAQ's 23%. The recent quarterly results and large deals' win put at rest speculations that the recent CEO departure negatively affected the company. The strong dollar against rupee and better utilization helped the company post impressive second quarter results. I believe the stock is a good bet based on its strong project pipeline and stabilizing pricing.In the recent quarterly result the company has talked about big deals and the macro environment that appears positive. The company highlighted the three big $100+ million dollar, multi-year deals. In total, the company signed 11 deals this quarter, which is a record for the company. Although the management has not given any guidance for the third quarter, I believe its margin should improve because the rupee is expected to further depreciate against the U.S. dollar.We believe that the company's sales transition is over and now has started delivering dividends. The company has invested in an effective sales team, the result of which is visible in North America sales as the sales focus and execution improved. Also, the improving investment by clients in IT will serve as a catalyst for the company.The forward P/E of 11.68 and PEG ratio of 0.88 indicates that analysts are undervaluing this company's stock. I recommend taking a long position in this company.Conclusion: The above three companies have shown outstanding returns year to date as compared to the Index. The quarterly results were above the consensus estimates. I believe these companies possess tremendous growth potential. The project pipeline remains strong for these companies and I expect they will improve on margin in the coming quarter as more projects spread over the operating expense. I am bullish on these stocks.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1311131,23421,2013-04-01T07:37:36-04:00,,"Investment ThesisServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) insiders have now sold over $400 million of stock even after its IPO, disregarding bullish calls from research firms (who happen to also be its bankers). On February 1st - the first day of the February lockup expiration - the CEO and the company founder began selling large amounts of stock at below $28.00. In the past 8 weeks, a wide range of insiders have now sold over $80 million of stock with no sensitivity to price.In November, ServiceNow broke its lockup period early and made use of a JOBS Act exemption to further eliminate subsequent selling restrictions. ServiceNow offered 16.1 million shares at $28.00. The exemption was designed to provide small cap ""emerging growth companies"" with greater access to financing. There are two problems with this. First, $5 billion ServiceNow is not a small-cap company. Second, 88% of the proceeds went to selling insiders and did not provide money to ServiceNow.Such provisions under the JOBS Act have been controversial. A Bloomberg article entitled ""Job-Creation Bill Seen Eviscerating U.S. Shareholder Protections"" quoted the former chief accountant from the SEC as saying:By applying for ""emerging growth company"" status, ServiceNow can opt to disclose fewer years of financial statements. It is exempt from certain disclosures regarding executive compensation. Investment banks love the provision that allows them to publish research prior to their IPOs - a practice which was banned following the dot.com boom and bust.Perhaps of greatest concern is that these ""emerging growth companies"" do not need to have an auditor attest to their internal controls as required by post-Enron Sarbanes-Oxley.For ServiceNow, the recent 10-K discloses that in the 6-month period before the IPO, the auditor found ""material weaknesses"" in internal controls.For the period after the IPO, it also discloses that:So before ServiceNow was a public company, we learned from its auditor that internal controls were ineffective. Now that it is a publicly traded company, the company gets to claim an exemption such that no auditor report on internal controls is necessary.Clearly this is what was meant by ""eviscerating"" shareholder protections.Despite the bullish upgrades from analysts, those who know the company best are selling the most and at every opportunity. At a minimum, these large ongoing insider sales will certainly cap the share price. And with roughly 90 million more shares now sellable, there is significant potential for substantial price declines in ServiceNow.In the past, ServiceNow directors and management including founder Frederic Luddy and directors John Moores and Charles Noell, were big early sellers of the their previous venture Peregrine Systems.They pulled in over half a billion dollars from sales of stock - even though these sales had occurred during restricted periods designed to prevent selling by insiders.Selling as early as possible was very fortuitous for these insiders because when Peregrine collapsed due to findings of massive fraud, there wasn't much left for those who hadn't sold early.ServiceNow CFO Michael Scarpelli was less fortunate. When his HPL Technologies collapsed due to fraud, he hadn't sold and the company ended up at 8 cents on the pink sheets. But now it is 2013, and in the past few weeks alone he has sold nearly $5 million of ServiceNow stock.Analysts say BUY while insiders say SELLShares of ServiceNow have rallied by more than 40% since their January lows of $26.00. On January 30th, the company announced a small beat on revenues by $4 million but the net loss was still running at $10 million. Clearly this was not what drove the rally in the share price.Instead the stock has been propelled by a wave of analyst upgrades to prices in the $40-43 range. Coverage is currently provided by banks including Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, UBS, Citi and Wells Fargo. Most investors will be aware that these are the banks involved in ServiceNow's recent IPO and equity offering.Clearly, insiders are unwilling to wait for the stock to rise the extra 14% to its ""full value."" In fact, on the first day of the February lockup expiration, CEO Frank Slootman sold $558,000 of stock, while ""Chief Product Officer"" and founder Frederic Luddy sold a much larger $12.4 million in stock.That was on the first day alone, and these transactions both occurred at prices of $27-28. These were the beginning, not the end, of the most recent wave of insider selling that is still going on.Over the past 8 weeks alone, insiders have now sold over $80 million of stock in a steady stream from week to week.The list of selling insiders is not short, and includes the president and CEO, the CFO, the founder and ""chief product officer,"" the chief technology officer, the SVP of Engineering, the SVP of Worldwide Sales and Service and three different directors - who happen to represent the largest institutions that own the stock.Their sales across various transactions since February 1st can be summarized from Form 4s as follows:Hopefully several things are readily apparent from the table above.- The transactions involve basically every senior member of management along with directors.- In each case, the individuals are selling large amounts of stock, netting well into seven figures each.- The average sale price is just $31.74.- The largest block was sold by ServiceNow founder Frederic Luddy at a price of just $27.40 - 25% below the current share price and 33% below analyst targets.- There have been no insider buys in 2013.Clearly, given the large size of the transactions involved, these selling members of management could pull in further gains of millions of dollars each if they were willing to simply hold their shares until they hit analysts' targets of $41.00.Yet clearly the ones who know the company best are the ones selling the most, regardless of what the price does.In actuality, this current wave of insider selling is not the first wave. Back in November, ServiceNow made the following announcement:When ServiceNow became public in July, its IPO prospectus contained the standard 180-day lockup provision which prevents insiders from selling for 6 months. This provision is added to IPOs in order to spur market confidence so that people will buy into the offering without fear of a wave of insider selling.Yet in this case, the company and its underwriters agreed to break the lockup. ServiceNow made use of a provision in the newly enacted JOBS Act which can be taken by ""emerging growth companies"" to get around the lockup and sell early. Clearly, such a provision defeats the entire purpose of having a lockup in the first place.In addition, with a market cap of $4-5 billion it is hard to consider ServiceNow an ""emerging growth company."" ServiceNow itself notes that the cutoff level to continue being an ""emerging growth company"" is just $700 million. From the most recent 10-K notes:Shortly after successfully breaking the lockup agreement, ServiceNow completed an equity offering of 16.1 million shares at $28.00 per share.The investment banks involved were familiar, as expected: Morgan Stanley, Citi, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, Barclays, UBS and Wells Fargo. Also as expected, these are the banks which continue to cover the stock with bullish research.The primary purpose of this transaction was not to provide new money for ServiceNow. As noted,So in this case, the urge for insiders to sell was so urgent that the then $4 billion company took an exemption for ""emerging growth companies"" so that insiders could sell 14.2 million shares at $28.00. The selling insider was the JMI Funds and El Caminio Advisors. ServiceNow board members Charles Noell and Paul Barber serve as managing directors at these funds, so the insider selling is about as ""inside"" as one can get.As per the original Underwriting Agreement, ServiceNow's lockup should have been extended for 34 days past the original February date due to earnings / material news being announced in January. But as early as November, the company was eager to use the provision to have this waived, so the insiders could begin selling as soon as possible. As should be expected, they have begun making good use of their freedom to sell.So why do analysts keep saying BUY?If insiders keep selling as early as they can, then why do sell side analysts keep telling us to buy the stock?Hopefully it did not escape the attention of readers that in the November equity offering, 88% of the $450 million in proceeds raised went to the selling shareholders who wanted to violate the 180-day lockup. Only 12% of the proceeds went to ServiceNow.ServiceNow is currently a $5 billion company with a cash balance of $313 million, which is by no means an excessive cash balance. In addition, the company continues to operate at a loss and its current ramp up and hiring spree will no doubt prove to be expensive.Given that the company realized minimal proceeds from the November offering, it is certainly likely that the $5 billion company makes a very good candidate for an equity or convertible (equity-linked) financing.In any event, anyone who has ever worked on Wall Street can be certain that the pitch books from Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Credit Suisse and UBS are all flying furiously across the desks of ServiceNow management, encouraging the company to ""take advantage of current strong market conditions"" by selling equity soon.Given that all members of management have demonstrated their eagerness to sell large volumes of stock at current prices (and well below), it also stands to reason that they would be eager for ServiceNow, the company, to raise equity financing at current prices.In the November equity offering (i.e., the large insider sale) the offering price was just $28.00. On the first day of the lockup expiration, both Mr. Luddy and Mr. Slootman sold at below $28.00.As a result, we now have a pretty good idea of where management feels the stock needs to be in order to hit the sell button.But are the analysts wrong about the price targets?Yes, the analysts are wrong about the targets and this can be demonstrated by looking at their own reports which contain a number of false assumptions and numerical errors.The specific flaws are consistent across many of the analyst reports. Analysts have justified their upgraded target prices for ServiceNow simply due to the recent rise in comps such as WorkDay (NASDAQ:WDAY) and Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM).They have also chosen to dismiss the impact of the expiring lockup even as insider sales accelerate.In addition, despite the near unanimity of share price targets, there has been a fairly wide divergence in the share count used for calculating it. ServiceNow addressed this confusion on its last conference call, clarifying that it has 164 million diluted shares outstanding. Some analysts have been wrong by as much as 30% on this number.The contents of the recent research reports by Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley, UBS, Barclays and others have been highly consistent in their findings and share price targets. But the recent UBS report provides the clearest example due to the fact that the firm switched from a SELL to a BUY within just a few weeks, and right as the lockup shares became free.On December 19th, UBS placed ServiceNow on its ""Least Preferred"" list giving it a $30.00 price target with a $24.00 downside target. The report contained the following justifications:Yet within 8 weeks, UBS had flipped from a SELL to a BUY recommendation, giving the stock a $36.00 target. The new justifications cited for the upgrade are as follows:Hopefully most readers will see the two largest problems immediately. The ""multiple compression"" which UBS refers to simply means that other stocks such as Workday, Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), SolarWinds (NYSE:SWI) and Salesforce.com have rallied even more than ServiceNow. The $36.00 target is therefore justified by the fact that other money-losing, high P/S multiple stocks are now just as overvalued. Obviously this type of valuation methodology does nothing to tell us whether or not ServiceNow is overvalued relative to its own fundamentals and prospects.And incidentally, these comparable stocks such as Workday are now seeing nearly identical concerns from critics, as shown in this recent article entitled: Workday: Overvaluation And Lock-Up Expiration Will Cause Shares To Crash.The analysts' rationale for buying these stocks is no different than what we saw in the Great Internet Bubble which imploded in the year 2000. By upgrading a Pets.com just because a Stamps.com had traded higher, what analysts were really doing was simply pushing the whole space higher. When the stocks trade down substantially, the analysts will then tell us (after the fact) that they are downgrading the stocks due to ""multiple contraction.""The second major flaw (which is shared across most of these reports) is that analysts are upgrading the stock because the lockup has now expired.It is now the case that there are roughly 90 million shares which have become free for insiders to sell at any time or price they please. In the past 8 weeks, we have seen insiders steadily unloaded over $80 million in stock regardless of the price. The time for investors to take relief regarding the lockup will be once the overhang is removed due to completed sales by insiders, not due to the fact that these insiders are able to begin selling.With ServiceNow, the selling is just beginning and it is beginning with a very strong start. If anything, now would be a time for analysts to maintain caution regarding the overhang.Why do insiders sell?By making use of a JOBS Act exemption intended for small-cap companies to raise additional operating funds, ServiceNow insiders stuck to the letter of the law but certainly bent the intentions of the act by a wide degree.By selling $13 million of stock on the first day of the February lockup expiration, they further communicated their eagerness to get out of the stock regardless of price. As we can see, the $13 million was just the beginning.Many of these sellers undoubtedly learned the value of ""sell early, sell big"" as a result of the massive gains they realized shortly before their previous company imploded due to findings of fraud. Had they not made use of similar creative maneuvers to sell early, they would have been stuck sitting on worthless shares along with the rest of the investors in those stocks.Now that they are substantial insiders at ServiceNow, they appear to be replicating this philosophy of ""sell early, sell big.""At Peregrine Systems, many of the early sales by these insiders were completed during a ""no sale"" blackout period imposed by the company which had already been communicated to the market. Their defense for doing so would likely be that they were not (in theory) ""insiders"" because they knew nothing about the company's inner workings when they unloaded over half a billion dollars worth of stock.ServiceNow Director John Moores had previously been Chairman of Peregrine Systems and his VC firm JMI Capital held a substantial stake. He had recruited Fred Luddy to assume the eventual role of Chief Technology Officer. ServiceNow Director Charles Noell served as a Peregrine Director and as the Audit Committee Chairman.The SEC complaint describing the fraud at Peregrine systems can be found here. Like ServiceNow, Peregrine was based in San Diego. The San Diego Union Tribune provided significant detail on the $4 billion fraud implosion, including the following:Like ServiceNow, Peregrine had a habit of beating expectations, even as insiders continued selling into the successful results. The similarities between the two San Diego companies are noteworthy.As the fraud findings shook out, John Moores and his JMI Capital certainly received some unwanted attention due to the size of his early cash-outs which occurred in the middle of the period where the fraud was at its peak:Moores and other outside directors (including ServiceNow director Charles Noell) were found liable for $56 million in settlements, as noted:By the time the dust had settled, 18 members of Peregrine management had been charged with fraud and 14 were ultimately sentenced.Frederic Luddy eventually settled for $100,000. It was his second tough break with a promising software startup. When discussing his previous failed attempt with Enterprise Software Associates, he stated:But things finally turned for Mr. Luddy and Forbes now estimates his net worth at $400 million.ServiceNow's current CFO, Michael Scarpelli, was less fortunate. When his former software venture imploded due to fraud, he had not sold and the company ended up at just 8 cents on the pink sheets once the fraud was uncovered, down from over $14.00.However with ServiceNow, Mr. Scarpelli has been much quicker to sell, already pulling in nearly $5 million in the past few weeks.Scarpelli had originally been a partner at PWC in the 1990's at a time when PWC was auditing a software company called HPL Technologies. Scarpelli eventually moved from his role as auditor at PWC over to a management role with HPL Technologies, ultimately becoming CFO.During his tenure at HPL it was uncovered that as much as 80% of revenue had been improperly recognized and that the CEO had used a subsidiary to funnel cash into his personal account. PWC and UBS were then named in a $100 million lawsuit, with the lead plaintiff attorney stating that ""It's inexcusable that an audit could have been done and not detected these irregularities."" The biggest issue was that the audit failed to uncover $10 million of missing cash, which should normally be very easy to detect.ConclusionNo one, myself included, is presently accusing ServiceNow of committing fraud.The current observation is simply that the only thing more blistering than the pace of ServiceNow revenue growth has been the blistering pace of insider selling.ServiceNow became public in July of 2012. In the 8 months since, insiders have already cashed out over $400 million in stock. This is excluding the amounts sold in the IPO itself. And the pace of selling continues to be brisk nearly every week, regardless of the share price.Wall Street analysts (from the very banks who run ServiceNow's financings) are telling the rest of us to buy into the shares even at prices up to $43.00. Yet the insiders have demonstrated an eagerness to sell at prices of $28.00 and below. This has been the case even when these sales required a creative interpretation of the meaning of ""emerging growth company.""History has shown that insiders know their own companies far better than Wall Street analysts. History has also shown that Wall Street analysts can find many reasons to upgrade and recommend stocks, while sellers typically have only one reason to sell big and sell early.Post scriptThe details of the multi-billion dollar accounting fraud at Peregrine Systems are truly fascinating for those who are interested in such things.According to this Complaint:The complaint contains multiple references to quotes by management speaking of starting a new company such as ""End-of-the-Quarter.com"" which would ""sign sham deals for a fee to help companies meet their quarterly forecasts.""At its peak, Peregrine reached $9 billion in market cap, making it somewhat smaller than the more notorious frauds such as Enron and Worldcom. But the details revealed in the filings are every bit as egregious and equally intriguing.Disclosure: I am short NOW. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1176441,43661,2013-02-12T17:48:22-05:00,,"ServiceNow Background - Remarkable TrajectoryServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has been recognized for achieving significant revenue growth in a challenging economy with a relatively small workforce that has recently expanded. ServiceNow is an Enterprise IT cloud company. Their solutions transform enterprise IT by standardizing and automating business process and consolidating IT across the global enterprise. Their solutions are considered business critical, meaning an enterprise IT department cannot properly function without solutions like these. For two years running (2010/2011), ServiceNow was one of the Top 50 Venture-Funded Companies on The Wall Street Journal's coveted ""Next Big Thing"" list, one of only 14 companies to have achieved this multi-year distinction. ServiceNow was also featured #5 and #33 on Deloitte's Technology Fast 500 Ranking in 2011 and 2012, respectively. In January of 2013, ServiceNow received a Hire Power Award from Inc. Magazine as the number one job creator in the software industry.In IT Service Automation, ServiceNow is unrivaled with more than 1,512 enterprise-level customers, nearly-doubling YoY revenues, and an exceptional 98% renewal rate. Since strong demand continues for ServiceNow solutions and services, the number of employees has also more than doubled in 2012, following an 880% increase from 2008-2011. It was announced in the Q4 earnings call that they are still capacity constrained in sales and plan for additional headcount to meet the added demand. With their recently added headcount ramping up and new headcount soon to be factored in, ServiceNow is uniquely positioned to continue their remarkable growth, innovation, and revenue trajectory as a publicly traded company serving many more accounts.ServiceNow remains one of the fastest growing companies in the technology sector.Recent Moves in the Stock PriceNOW has seen a 33% correction off its peak of $41.77 in September. With positive news and projections coming from the company, the stock is beginning to trend up from its lows. Quarterly earnings generously beat expectations at 75.2 million, a 92% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, and 2013 guidance topped estimates. For Q1, the company now sees revenue of $81.5 million to $82.5 million, which is above the old consensus of $78.1 million. ServiceNow sees revenue of $387 million to $392 million for the full year, well above the street estimate of $368.3 million.The stock has since traded lower as the overhang of the February lockups weighs on shares. Short sellers continued their smear campaign just ahead the first lockup expiry in attempt to create a stampede for the exit. Note the timing of the reports fall right between earnings on Jan 30 and the lockup expiry on Feb 1. The share price actually closed up 1.4% for the day. Recall that Facebook, which traded lower leading up to the lockup (much like ServiceNow has), saw the share price go up more than 12% on the lockup expiry.""While the lockup is expiring, there is nothing requiring anybody to sell,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. ""Given the low price, these long-term holders are deciding to hold the stock, and that is lifting it here as the fear of the expiration subsides."" Just a couple of weeks ago Splunk saw their shares rise on the day of the lockup expiration as well. The company's stock rose 6.9 percent to $33.46 at the close, its highest price at the time since Oct. 4. It's clear that the pending lockups in February are weighing on NOW's share price, which has created a buying opportunity. Once the fear of the last lockup in mid-February passes, the share price should begin to appreciate again, especially as the company expects to shift into profitability later this year.Valuation is WarrantedOf key importance is to note that high-growth companies with business critical Software as a Service/SaaS or cloud offerings typically have higher valuations compared to traditional software companies due to the associated high growth velocity and recurring revenue streams. Compare ServiceNow to its nearest competition; it's evident that dramatically higher YoY revenue growth warrants a higher valuation. Investors are willing to pay more for considerably faster growth, as those companies are capable of quickly growing into their valuations.The aim of the following table is to highlight ServiceNow's explosive growth trajectory especially when compared to its two closest competitors. Revenue growth is important in determining potential future stock price as the company and share price grows with increased revenue.Revenue Growth Compared to Competition Sources: most recent company filings (10-Q reports)Let's look at CA Technologies (NASDAQ:CA), a company that has seen its profits and earning per share consistently increase over the years. Yet, top line growth has been modest - it took 8 years for revenue to increase 45% from $3.3B in March '04 to $4.8B in 2012. The following chart shows a little growth or fluctuation in stock price. This example confirms that flat revenue growth equals a flat or negative stock price.CA Share Price 2004-2012 Source: Google FinanceMicrosoft is another example of a flat stock. It took 8 years for Microsoft revenue to double from $36.84B in June '04 to that of $73.72B in June of 2012. Profitability and earnings per share have steadily increased but the stock has remained essentially flat.Microsoft Share Price 2004-2012Source: Google FinanceNow let's take a look at Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), another cloud company like ServiceNow. This is a company that has also seen sustained top line growth. Its revenues went from $96.02M in January of '04 to more than $2.27B in January of '12, and the stock price has followed course. The real growth started taking place as the SaaS model started becoming more favorably viewed and adopted by IT departments. While there are some Salesforce critics, it's hard to argue with a 990% return on investment. People who sold CRM in its beginning days are probably kicking themselves for not holding. The price of CRM back then was right about where NOW is trading today, and revenues were in the same neighborhood as NOW's revenue is today. However, ServiceNow is experiencing a greater growth rate than Salesforce was at similar revenue amounts (90% vs. 60-75% in '05 / '06). ServiceNow sure looks positioned to follow a similar trajectory and selling this early would appear to immensely contradict the buy low sell high rule.Salesforce.com share price 2004-2012Source: Google FinanceExamine how ServiceNow's valuation compares to that of peer technology companies that offer business critical solutions and are also delivered via the cloud - NetSuite (NYSE:N), Salesforce, Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) - with a recurring revenue stream that compounds annually. There is a strong correlation between rapid revenue growth and higher valuation. The data further reinforces that investors place more value and are willing to pay in advance on companies with appreciably higher revenue growth rates.Revenue Growth vs Valuation of Cloud Technology CompaniesSources: Google and latest company filings. (10-Q's)If we value NOW on the current year expectations of $387 to $392 million representing 59% to 61% year over year growth and current $3.6B market cap; we arrive at a P/S ratio of approximately 9.2. Looking at their revenue growth of prior years, 59% to 61% revenue growth for 2013 may be a conservative estimate, especially taking into account the additional workforce that could ramp up quicker than anticipated. Like CRM, early investors of ServiceNow will undoubtedly see great returns in the years ahead as revenue continually increases due in part to the compounding effect of recurring revenue that the SaaS model brings.By modeling this compounding effect of ServiceNow's recurring revenue and factoring in new anticipated revenue growth, we can estimate they are on track to likely exceed $1 billion in revenue sometime in 2016. In building this chart, the YoY percentages were even decreased by 10% each year (from 60% in 2013 to 30% in 2016), yet the total revenue amount still grows considerably. CRM seems to have leveled off in the 30-35% range; we would expect ServiceNow to do the same or better in the out years. After all, they just nearly doubled their revenue for 2012. It becomes clear that ServiceNow will quickly grow into its valuation.Hypothetical Future Revenue EstimatesSources: for '12 & '13, company filings (10-Q). 2014+ estimates are hypothetical forecasts.The Financial Analysts Remain BullishServiceNow had its price target raised by Barclays Capital from $33.00 to $36.00 in a research note released on 1/7/13. They currently have an overweight rating on the stock. The analysts covering ServiceNow remain bullish on their growth and have price targets ranging from $30 (NYSE:UBS) to $44 (Wells Fargo).ServiceNow's Market Goes far Beyond IT Help DeskAccording to Gartner, the IT Service Desk market was $1.5B in 2010. That market only includes applications such as Incident, Problem, Change, Knowledge, Self-Service, SLA management. As we can see, ServiceNow's pool of offerings addresses a market considerably larger than just a service desk and is accessible from a variety of browsers and mobile devices. ServiceNow caters to a multi-billion dollar market that is likely more than 10X the IT Service Desk market.ServiceNow's Platform of OfferingsSource: ServiceNow wikiProspective customers that would like to access a live demo instance of ServiceNow without hassle are free to do so. ServiceNow keeps everything in the open and lets the product speak for itself…and it does so in grand fashion. There's nothing to hide here and no need to contact a sales rep or fill out a lengthy form to gain access, just simply log in.Upon accessing the ServiceNow system, we can see a full list of applications loaded on the left navigation menu. It's extremely intuitive and easy to customize through a simple point and click interface. Research analyst Gartner also reinforced this point as a key strength in their report.A Host of ChoicesSource: Screen-shot of ServiceNow's public demo instanceIn keeping with the theme of full transparency, ServiceNow also provides full access to their Wiki. It is neatly organized and provides screen-shots and videos along with step-by-step instructions that even a technology-challenged person could follow. All of the product documentation is readily accessible and customers are also offered a live forum to ask questions, post ideas, etc.ServiceNow Regarded as an Industry LeaderServiceNow has received numerous accolades from varying analysts and publications. A quick glance at their website will highlight some of these achievements. One of the most recognized analysts, Gartner, released a new research report and Magic Quadrant in August for ITSSM or IT Service Support Management. BMC barely edged ServiceNow for first place, but ServiceNow is positioned to quickly close up the small gap. The rest of the competition has a ways to go to catch up. In the report, Gartner concluded that ServiceNow is the fastest growing company among the vendors they evaluated.Loyal Customer FollowingServiceNow is a prime example of a company that listens to its customer base and actively embraces feedback to help drive future growth strategies (Gartner also called this out as a key strength). Customers value this ingenuity as evidenced by ServiceNow's 98%+ renewal rate and 55% YoY Q4 customer growth rate. Equally impressive is their long list of blue-chip customers who continue to make the switch from varying competitors to adopt ServiceNow's extensive platform of solutions. ServiceNow has swiftly built up a substantial list of success stories and case studies and I strongly encourage readers to give it a look. A considerable portion of these case studies discuss the many reasons for making the switch and some also feature unique ways in which they continually extract additional value out of the platform beyond IT Service Automation capabilities.With a loyal following comes ServiceNow's annual five day user conference called Knowledge held in May each year. It attracts thousands of users from around the globe and features more than 180 sessions - many of which are put on by the customers themselves. There is an Innovation of the Year award which highlights customers that have used the ServiceNow platform to deliver new breakthrough solutions in their line of business. It is this type of interaction that fuels innovation, new applications, and solution adoption rates which in turn drives new revenue streams.Creating Irreplaceable Value with their PlatformThe ServiceNow customer case studies are very telling in that the solutions ServiceNow brings to market are not only highly flexible and modern, but they play an integral part in helping IT transform from a cost center into a service provider by continually finding new ways to add value back to the business. Customers use their extensible platform to build custom applications for automating activities unique to their business requirements. Not only is ServiceNow separating itself from the competition by a hefty margin, but they are also making their footprint irreplaceable. Concurrently, ServiceNow is building markets outside of traditional ITSM with its platform, further contributing to the bottom line. Companies like ServiceNow are nearly impossible to duplicate or replace.ConclusionConsidering ServiceNow's explosive growth especially compared to the competition, financial analyst positioning, extensive product and service markets, recognized industry leadership, and extremely loyal customer base - questions on the company's valuation and future growth prospects quickly begin to fade. It becomes clearer that ServiceNow is uniquely positioned for sustainable long-term growth. This is not a company that is simply going to fade away or take a back seat on technology innovations.ServiceNow is a market leader and is proving they will continue to innovate to retain their leadership position into the foreseeable future. ServiceNow has a strong track record of execution that is well proven through its transformation from a hopeful startup into an industry leader. It is very likely that ServiceNow will continue to raise the bar by paving the way into new markets and tapping into new revenue sources that the competition will surely have a difficult, if not impossible, time following.Given the compounding effect of revenue the SaaS model brings and their 98% renewal rate, ServiceNow's revenue will only continue to grow as the quarters and years pass. In a few short years they should exceed $1 billion in revenue. Once the fear of the February share lockups have subsided and passed, we should see the share price begin to appreciate again, especially if ServiceNow expects to shift into profitability in the second half of the year. The share price at these levels represents a great buying opportunity in a company that has a very bright future. Taking into account all of the points raised herein, we can now see why ServiceNow is an excellent long-term investment.Disclosure: I am long NOW.

1833472,48501,2013-11-12T15:26:16-05:00,,"ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) is a provider of enterprise applications via the cloud. The company went public in 2012 and reported financial data going back to the first quarter of 2012.ServiceNow's valuations reflect its growth rate and industry; like most enterprise application providers that deliver via the cloud, ServiceNow is overvalued. But in this case, the valuations are not as extreme. There could be a chance to buy this growth stock at a decent valuation when there is a substantial decline in the share price.I'm not forecasting profitability for this firm in the coming years, but I think the financial performance will act as a tailwind. So, if the share price declines roughly 20% from the recent peak, I will accumulate shares.NOW data by YChartsIn the following sections, I provide forecasted financial performance, valuations, and technical analysis. I also conduct peer company comparisons.Fundamental AnalysisThe revenue recognition policies are standard for the industry; ServiceNow recognizes subscription revenue and professional services revenue on a time-and-materials basis.I think ServiceNow's total revenue will increase in the 50% to 70% range during calendar 2014 on increased customer count, upsells and renewals. My estimates assume ServiceNow grows above the industry rate because of it relatively small scale.As ServcieNow approaches $1 billion of annual revenue in calendar 2015, I am modeling revenue growth slowing to the 20% to 40% range, which would be inline with salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) growth rate; the midpoint of the forecast calls for $895 million of 2015 revenues.NOW Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsIn terms of the gross profit margin, I'm looking for 65% in calendar 2014 and 2015 on higher subscription revenue and margin expansion in professional services. I do not anticipate any major changes in the operating expenses over the next two years as the company will probably continue to invest gross profit in sales and marketing activities; consequently, I think we will see an operating margin of negative 15% over the next two years. I'm looking for a net profit margin of -16% in calendar 2014 and 2015.In terms of the outstanding shares, I am not forecasting major equity capital raising over the next two years. So, in terms of EPS, I am looking for (0.75) in 2014 and (0.90) in 2015.NOW EPS Diluted (TTM) data by YChartsTo put the profitability in perspective, salesforce.com has a higher gross margin and is spending more of its revenue on SG&A; also, salesforce.com reported smaller operating losses. A comparison of the operating histories of the two companies reveals that salesforce.com is the more profitable of the two firms.Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) is less profitable than ServiceNow and is reporting roughly twice as large of an operating loss. The companies are about the same size in terms of revenues.NetSuite (NYSE:N) is also about the same size by revenues and is about as profitable as ServiceNow.Overall, the fundamentals of ServiceNow are bullish; the company could generate revenues in excess of $1 billion in calendar 2016.ValuationsIn this section, I'm going to do some analysis of the multiplier model valuations. I'll examine both the trailing valuations and the forecasted valuations. Also, I include technical analysis in this section. I'm bullish on ServiceNow, but I need a substantial decline to accumulate shares.First I'll examine the multiplier model price/sales ratio. The twelve trailing months price/sales ratio is 18.2 which I think is expensive. ServiceNow is trading at 11.5 times my 2014 revenues forecast and 9.27 times my 2015 revenues forecast. The trailing and forward price/sales ratios are too high for me.Next I'll discuss the price/book value ratio. The current price/book ratio is 25. I forecast that coming down to about 21 in fiscal 2014 and 18.6 in fiscal 2015. I think ServiceNow is overvalued on a price/book value basis.NOW PS Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsThe multiplier model valuations suggest ServiceNow is overvalued, but if there is a throwback of 20+%, ServiceNow could be an excellent long candidate. It is a growth stock and I'm not going to be able to buy it at 1 times sales. Additionally, I will not buy shares when the price is near a recent high.That leads me into the technicals. ServiceNow is in a bull market of primary and intermediate degree. I would use an intermediate term decline, like the one at the end of 2012, to get long shares of ServiceNow.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1111961,24317,2013-01-15T06:37:44-05:00,,"In my previous article on ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), I described what I learned about the company and the IT Service Management (ITSM) industry. After interviewing industry insiders to write my first article, I interviewed more people to gain a deeper understanding of ServiceNow's situation. My latest interviews were with a former ServiceNow employee, a technology analyst for a hedge fund who says ServiceNow ""is his highest conviction short"", and Matt Selheimer, the VP of marketing for the innovative ITSM company ITinvolve. The hedge fund analyst is the only one out of the three who has a position in NOW. Thank you all for your help in giving me a better understanding of ServiceNow and the ITSM industry.Further evidence has confirmed that ServiceNow is on a downward trajectory. Its bread and butter ITSM business is falling behind in innovation and has much tougher competition than it used to, and its efforts to expand to other markets are not nearly as successful as was hoped. This should become apparent in the company's upcoming earnings call on January 30th, and in the proceeding two stock lockup period dates within the two weeks afterwards where I expect insiders to sell many shares. Savvy shareholders will not continue to hold this stock with a price/revenue multiple of 12+ and negative earnings once they realize that ServiceNow's growth is rapidly slowing down.Single Tenant Vs. Multi Tenant ArchitectureServiceNow has many problems, but the biggest one is its single tenant architecture. ServiceNow has had this same model since its beginning in 2004, and hasn't changed it. While other ITSM companies are innovating and changing their models to multi-tenant, ServiceNow is stuck in its old way of operation.""The fact is that ServiceNow has stopped innovating in the ITSM market,"" says Matt Selheimer, from ITinvolve.With the single tenant model, every customer gets its own data base and own version of the ITSM application. Compare that to multi-tenant, where every customer has the same coding for its application and is on the same database. The single tenant model is bad for the customers, the company, and especially bad for the shareholders. Most new and innovative ITSM companies are crossing over to the multi-tenant approach. All of the big four legacy vendors: IBM, CA technologies (NASDAQ:CA), Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ), and BMC, which are the biggest threats to ServiceNow's growth, have moved to a multi-tenant architecture.A good analogy would be to imagine if you were a landlord and had 100 tenants. Would you rather have them all live in separate homes, or all live in one high rise building? Obviously the high rise would be superior. You would only have to pay rent on one plot of land as opposed to 100, and you could have plenty of maintenance employees and mangers right there on site to fix any problems. There are many other advantages to having them all live under one roof rather than spread out all over in different homes. This also holds true in the cloud space with multi-tenancy compared to single-tenancy.The following are the disadvantages of a single tenant architecture, and the accompanying advantage with a multi-tenant architecture with an ITSM cloud application:1. With single-tenant, every new client scales out linearly. All of ServiceNow's costs are linear. ServiceNow leases third party data centers. These data centers charge per server and per virtual machine, so when adding customers, they're adding costs. ServiceNow also must pay for each individual upgrade for each customer, and this also is a linear cost. This extra cost is paid for by ServiceNow, and some of the extra cost is passed on to its customers.Multi-tenant is primarily an economy of scale business. Each new customer is put on the same database, so the company doesn't use as much data to lease more data machines. Upgrades are the same for every customer, and at the same time, so the company doesn't have to pay for individual upgrades for each customer, it's just a uniform, one-time process. Customers are getting offered a better price from ServiceNow's competitors since they don't have the same costs that ServiceNow has.2. With single-tenant, each customer has their own code. With so many different versions of an application, it's hard for ServiceNow to support each one. The former employee of ServiceNow said that its support department is a ""nightmare"". The following is his description from my interview with him:With a multi-tenant architecture, on the other hand, customer support goes more smoothly. Every customer has the same application and the same version of the software with the same upgrades. Problems and requests are often repeated, so a junior technician can easily learn and satisfy most issues. This means there are less instances of backlog. Since the technicians are very familiar with the software, problems can be solved quickly without escalating into emergencies. Instead of junior technicians having to always ask for help, the senior technicians can do what they do best: innovate. The sales reps can continue to focus on new sales, without having to get involved with the support process.3. With single-tenant, implementation takes a long time, and upgrades are few and far between, lengthy, and distruptive. Someone who recently made the decision for his company to purchase ServiceNow's ITSM product commented on my previous article. He said that it took a few weeks to implement ServiceNow's software package. He said ""a Remedyforce rep said that theirs could be all deployed in five days. Anyone that believes that doesn't live in reality or knows how ITSM works in an organization"". Well, I have to say that this is what innovation is. The ITSM industry has evolved and the software can do amazing things now that no one would have imagined even two years ago.Also in the comments section, Darroll Buytenhaus, President of SAManage, a multi-tenancy ITSM company, made this statement in regards to comparing ServiceNow's upgrade cycle compared to that of a multi-tenant architecture:Is ServiceNow going to change to multi-tenancy? Yes, it would be better for ServiceNow in the long run to switch to multi-tenancy. However, it would cause disruption to their clients as they transition to the new architecture and would also confirm to the world that it has lagged behind its competitors in this area. What's more, the effort would consume additional R&D dollars that could have been spent elsewhere on innovation.Is ServiceNow Expanding To New Markets, Or Just Spinning Its Wheels?In order to fit into its $4.5 billion market cap, ServiceNow must be successful in breaking out into other areas of IT. ITSM is only a $1.5-$2 billion industry, and in 2011, ServiceNow only had an 8% market share. In 2012, that percentage went up a bit, but even if ServiceNow acquires a 30% market share in ITSM, as many bulls claim, that still would only be about $600 million of annual revenue per year. However, to deserve its current market cap, it will need to get to $1 billion in revenues by 2016, and $4 billion by 2024.Below is the total percentage market share per company of IT Operations Management and Application Development in 2011 given by Citi Research and Gartner.As shown above, ServiceNow had a strong ITSM market share of 8% in 2011. However, its configuration management and workload automation market share of only 0.2% each shows that ServiceNow isn't making very good traction there. It started its configuration management business in 2007, and its workload automation department in 2010, so that's plenty of time to gain momentum, especially in configuration management.In my interviews with the industry insiders, the following is what they had to say about ServiceNow's push into other areas besides ITSM:""ServiceNow has really shifted who they are as a company over the last year or so,"" said Matt Selheimer from ITinvolve.""Workload automation is very complex and only a handful of people have the knowledge to expand that industry in house and make it better and support it,"" said the former employee of ServiceNow.""With its configuration management, there's a lack of resources in the company and that hinders it from growing and stabilizing"", he said. ""ServiceNow's asset management application is substandard. It is slow, and sometimes doesn't scan everything.""""ITSM is all that ServiceNow has,"" said the technology hedge fund analyst who is short NOW.""It's very labor intensive to create an application that works,"" said the former employee. ""The ServiceNow platform is tough because when a sofware developer makes an app, and then leaves, then the people who are left don't know how to work the app because the coding is a work of art.""""I would think an application development company would be reluctant to create apps for ServiceNow,"" said Mr. Selheimer,An Example Of ServiceNow's Unevolved TechnologyMatt Selheimer alerted me to a very inefficient example of ServiceNow's ITSM user interface. To see it, go to servicenow.com. Click on ""DEMO NOW"" on the bottom right hand corner. Login as an IT employee by entering ""itil"" in the user name and password. Now, on the left side of the screen, there's a scrolling bar. Scroll down to where it says ""social IT"". One would think that social collaboration would be part of it. But it's at the bottom because it's not a priority. When you click on ""live feed"", you can see it's like the news feed on Facebook. It's just a bunch of noise. Notice how there are a wide range of types of messages like ""Breaking ground on the new Chicago office complex!"" and ""Company barbecue is Friday!"" It also has a message that says: ""High priority incident opened"".Now if you're working in a company of 5,000+ employees, how are you going to notice that high priority incident if it applies to you, when every employee can just write anything they want in the feed? You would have to scroll through all the comments, or do a search. You aren't alerted if there's an important incident in your department.ITinvolve's ModelCompare ServiceNow to ITinvolve, which is a next generation ITSM product that is built from the ground up to be social and collaborative (and is also multi-tenant, by the way, running on the force.com platform). Social collaboration for ITSM is ITinvolve's specialty. ITinvolve was created because one of the biggest challenges that IT departments have, is that knowledge is scattered all over the place like in spreadsheets, in configuration management databases, Visio diagrams, word docs, PDFs, SharePoint sites, etc. But most of the time these silos of information are out of date because things are always changing in IT. The most up-to-date information is actually found in people's heads, and what ITinvolve does is leverage social collaboration to bring the system and human knowledge together, and make it easy to keep it current.In ITinvolve, you follow a certain server, a database, or anything IT manages, just like Twitter. Then when someone adds a new piece of knowledge about that item, you are alerted about it and can collaborate with the individuals(s) who made the update. In this manner, IT employees can add information or change it, to crowd-source the best, most accurate understanding of the IT environment just like how Wikipedia works. When there is an issue, most IT organizations spend 80% of the time figuring out what changed or broke, and only 20% of the time actually fixing it. ITinvolve's social media ITSM helps IT staff figure out what the underlying problem is quicker so that IT services can get back up and running.Similarly, when planning a change, ITinvolve creates a collaboration workflow to get everyone's opinion who is following the items affected by the change. This allows the organization to do much better and faster risk analysis before executing changes and that, in turn, means fewer changes go wrong or cause unintended consequences and disruptions. ITinvolve's innovation is an example of an ITSM company innovating while ServiceNow isn't.Disclosure: I am short NOW. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1145971,24317,2013-01-31T06:51:30-05:00,,"ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) reported an excellent Q412 on January 30th. It beat revenues and earnings estimates, as well as guiding higher for 2013. So in a way, I should eat crow given my previous bearish articles here and here.However, my bearish thesis is still intact, it was just too early. In some ways, one can compare ServiceNow to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). When Apple was the innovator and created new products that no one had seen before, the stock did very well and everyone was bullish. However, when other companies came out with similar products and Apple quit innovating, after a while Apple stock fell because it had lost its edge. I believe ServiceNow is going through a similar cycle. It's currently doing very well, like Apple at its peak. It created a great IT Service Management (ITSM) product in the 2000s, and then used its reliable reputation to help large companies make the transition into cloud ITSM. However, one could say that ServiceNow is now in much worse position than Apple. Not only has it stopped innovating, but its competitors are creating a model that is better than ServiceNow's older model.In the earnings call, ServiceNow's CEO, Frank Slootman, spoke about how many enterprise companies are still using the 1990s helpdesk on-premise solutions, and they will all inevitably move to the new SaaS (Software as a Service) ITSM technology when they are ready. What he didn't say is all those firms that currently provide that old school 1990s helpdesk: IBM, HPQ, CA, and BMC, are all well aware of this fact and have finally evolved to SaaS ITSM. ServiceNow may have been able to dominate in the last several years and the latest quarter, but I predict this year, 2013, will be the year that ServiceNow falls behind as those big technology firms become direct competitors.One could say ServiceNow is stuck in 2000s ITSM technology, which is the next generation above the 1990s helpdesk solutions. But it is behind the new, 2010s ITSM multi-tenant architecture. It's interesting that no analyst questioned ServiceNow's single-tenant architecture, even though that is a clear drawback for the company. I would've asked if ServiceNow is considering moving to multi-tenant.Multi-tenant Is Superior To Single-tenantA few days ago, I interviewed Kevin Smith, the VP of the Cloud Business Unit at Frontrange, another ITSM provider and one of ServiceNow's biggest competitors. Frontrange, a private company, has over 15,000 customers, compared to ServiceNow's reported 1,512. Frontrange was founded way back in 1989, when helpdesk was all anyone ever spoke about. Two years ago, Frontrange completed building a multi-tenant cloud platform. Frontrange was late to the cloud market, but finally bit the bullet and went multi-tenant.""Multi-tenant and single-tenant is becoming a big issue,"" said Mr. Smith. ""CIOs and CTOs weren't asking about this a couple years ago, but now they are asking about it. Single-tenant isn't authentic. SaaS and cloud were supposed to be multi-tenant. When ServiceNow was signing up a lot of customers in the beginning, Fred Luddy (the founder of ServiceNow) never intended to stay with single tenant for the long term. The problem with single tenant is it's so expensive to operate. ServiceNow is under more pressure to make money, and so they are charging their customers more, or charging for things that were free before.""Multi-tenant infrastructure is so much less expensive than single tenant. The cost per user for ServiceNow is a whopping 5x that of Frontrange! Cost pressures was apparent in ServiceNow's earnings call. ServiceNow didn't give any earnings or cash flow guidance for 2013. Frontrange, although a private company, has had positive cash flow and earnings every single quarter for the last nine years. With the cost pressures ServiceNow has and its striving for growth, it might never become profitable.What Frontrange does is use a hybrid of both cloud and on-premise applications. That way enterprises can have the best of both worlds. With the hybrid, companies who have the utmost need for security, and have reservations to moving fully to the cloud, can keep their data on premise and at the same time they have the cloud platform for configurability and flexibility.ServiceNow management said in the earnings call that the company is going to ramp up advertising and marketing in 2013. That is a sign that the company will need to try harder for sales, and can't just rely on its reputation anymore. I also noticed that it wasn't discussed on the call how much business ServiceNow has received in the other cloud sectors besides ITSM. Its revenue and upsell numbers weren't specific as to where exactly they came from. This tells me that the company is not successfully penetrating other markets like it needs to. Gartner predicts that the $1.5 billion ITSM market is growing at a modest 7% per year and 50% of IT organizations will move to SaaS by 2015. Even if ServiceNow secures 30% of that market, it won't be nearly enough to support its current valuation.In conclusion, ServiceNow's valuation is priced to expect huge increases in revenues and earnings many years in the future. Because of this, investors should think about where ServiceNow is going in the future, and not just its current performance. Even bears would say that ServiceNow is a dominant force today in the IT Service Management industry. However, the questions to ask are: 1) will that last, and 2) will ServiceNow be able to grab sizeable market share anywhere else? It's clear that the answers to both questions need to be a ""yes,"" or the stock is very overvalued.Disclosure: I am short NOW. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1145601,23563,2013-01-31T08:30:00-05:00,,"ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) announced fourth quarter 2012 results yesterday and we'll readily admit that the headline numbers appeared strong. NOW grew quarterly revenues by 17% sequentially and the company guided to revenue of $81.5m - $82.5m for Q1 2013 and gave full year revenue guidance of $387m - $389m. Billings, a measure indicative of sales momentum, grew to $97.6m from $81.2m in Q3 2012. We congratulate the NOW team on a good quarter (Q4 press release, 2012 Q3).But even at these growth rates, NOW's stock is absurdly overvalued. Beating revenues by $4m doesn't justify the company's 19x revenue multiple. The 60% YoY growth implied in 2013 is much lower than the 90% that NOW grew in 2012. And while NOW's Help Desk product appears to be selling well, investors still have little insight on how much revenue is generated from the Discovery and Runbook Automation tools. Since the market size of the Help Desk is only $1.5bn, according to Gartner, NOW must prove to investors that it can generate real revenue in other product segments. ServiceNow's Platform product, which many analysts think could provide the largest eventual end-market, is just now launching as a separately priced product. While this Platform product will be for sale for the vast majority of this year, NOW doesn't expect Platform sales to be consequential until 2014 onwards.Without meaningful revenue from Discovery, Runbook Automation, Platform, or other non-Help Desk products, NOW could quickly saturate its share of the 50% of the $1.5bn Help Desk market that Gartner expects to convert to SaaS. Future year-over-year revenue growth will be especially difficult since, due to legacy contracts and the enormous cost of switching vendors, only a small percentage of the market opportunity can be captured in any single year. At its current exorbitant price of 12x 2013E revenue, NOW investors are placing too much trust in unproven revenue streams and too little scrutiny in the challenge of future growth.NOW's market capitalization currently approaches $5bn, an absurdly high figure relative to the $400m of revenue that NOW hopes to collect in 2014. Besides, profitability continues to be nil. To hit its revenue figures, NOW may have to aggressively expand its headcount, adding costs to an already unprofitable business. On its fourth quarter call, NOW remarked that it doesn't expect to be profitable in the first half of 2013 and that it might reach profitability in the second half of 2013 on a non-GAAP basis (non-GAAP excludes stock-based compensation expense). While stock-based compensation isn't a cash expense, it does have an immediately dilutive effect on NOW's current shareholders. We applaud NOW's CFO, Michael Scarpelli, for taking time during the call to address the misunderstanding around ServiceNow's share count. Mr. Scarpelli stated that, ""At December 31st, we had approximately 164 million diluted shares outstanding, consisting of approximately 126.4 shares outstanding, 13.1m vested and 23.0 unvested options outstanding, and 1.5m RSUs"" (NOW Q4 2012 Call). Using the treasury method to net out the proceeds from future option exercises, this implies a diluted share count of 158.3 at NOW's current share price. As we've previously pointed out, numerous financial databases and many Wall Street analysts continue to overlook NOW's highly dilutive option pool for valuation purposes.Moving back to NOW's quarterly results, sequential Billings and Revenue growth increased to 20% and 17%, respectively, for the quarter. While we expect NOW to utilize an under-promise/over-deliver guidance cadence, the Q1 2013 revenue guidance of only $82m/9% sequential growth should be uninspiring to most.Looking more closely at NOW's financials, we noticed that Professional Services revenue increased by 35% in Q4 versus only 14% sequential growth in Subscription Revenue. ServiceNow expects 2013 revenue of $387m - $392m composed of $327m - $329m in Subscription revenue and $60m - $63m in Professional Services. Last year's Professional Services revenue was only $39.2m, implying 57% YoY growth from the midpoint of guidance. Since Professional Services revenue is relatively one-time in nature, it deserves a lower valuation multiple than the recurring Subscription revenue. As the Professional Services segment becomes a larger percentage of the overall revenue pie, we'd expect analysts to begin to notice and adjust their valuation techniques accordingly.NOW's largest competitor in the Help Desk vertical, BMC (NASDAQ:BMC), reported its own set of financial results on Monday, January 28th. Though BMC printed weak numbers overall, management commentary indicated that BMC sees increasing strength in its Remedy (On-premise) and RemedyForce (SAAS) products. BMC's SaaS customer base grew from 475 on September 31st to 550 at year-end (BMC FQ3 2012 Call). BMC's 16% sequential SaaS growth in the fourth quarter was higher than the 12% growth in NOW's customer base over the same period.Beyond these fundamental headwinds, lock-up expirations unfold over the next few weeks. This Friday (tomorrow), 42.7m shares will be available for sale by NOW's founders and venture capital investors. According to Bloomberg, NOW's current float (the shares traded on the public markets) is only 36.3m, meaning that the float could more than double as these shares are sold on the public markets. This lock-up expiration will be compounded by another one on February 13th. On that date, 47.5m shares will be available for sale, which cumulatively adds 90.2m shares into the potential float.ServiceNow is a stock where expectations have gotten ahead of reality. In order for any discounted cash flow or takeover analysis to justify NOW's current share price, NOW needs to continue its 2012 growth rate even as it saturates the Help Desk market. We just don't see this happening. Once sequential growth in NOW's Help Desk market begins to slow, which it invariably must given a limited market size and BMC's increased efforts, scrutiny of NOW's ancillary product lines will quickly take center stage. We remain confident that our short thesis will play out over time.Disclosure: The author is short NOW. The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.

1042731,23563,2012-12-04T08:00:00-05:00,,"As detailed in our previous article and full report, we believe that ServiceNow, Inc. (NOW or the ""Company"") is grossly overvalued. Our research indicates that growth will become incrementally more challenging, as much of the 'low-hanging fruit' (i.e. BMC's dissatisfied customers) has already been captured, the limited ITSM market size places a ceiling on the Company's revenue potential, and SaaS alternatives to NOW emerge in the ever-changing ITSM sector. Should revenue growth continue to slow, we think that investors will begin to recommit themselves to a more sober valuation, given ServiceNow's current $5bn market capitalization versus $239m of 2012E revenue. Our concern with NOW's stock price appears shared. Two weeks ago, ServiceNow's early investors began selling NOW shares well ahead of their original lock-up schedule. ServiceNow's June 2012 IPO Prospectus disclosed a lock-up agreement that prevented insider sales until December 26th. But on November 9th, six weeks ahead of the original lock-up expiration, ServiceNow waived these lock-up commitments and allowed insiders (primarily JMI Equity, a 50% shareholder) to sell 14.2m shares at $28.00 (Nov 15th Prospectus, Nov 20th Press Release). That equates to approximately $400 million worth of NOW shares that were dumped on the public markets by insiders.In addition to the large insider share sale, ServiceNow itself diluted existing shareholders with the issuance of 1.9m new shares (Nov 20th Press Release). We question the intentions of this dilutive offering since the Company already had $256.5m of cash as of Q3 (10-Q), seemingly more than enough to fund organic growth. We think the capital raise was a sign that management itself believed the stock was overvalued, and wanted to raise capital at inflated prices before the stock price declined to more rational levels.This combination of insider sales and fresh equity fundraising activity could encourage investors to shift their attention towards grounded fundamental analysis rather than the amorphous hype that currently envelops the stock.Growth has Slowed since NOW was Priced at $10.20 in February 2012Just nine months ago (February 21st), NOW sold 2.45m shares at $10.20/share to Greylock Partners, a venture capital firm (page 70 of Nov 15th Prospectus). Greylock's investment has appreciated from $10.20/share in February to $32/share today for an annualized return of over 200%. Yet, between February 2012 and today, NOW's revenue growth has declined materially. The Company was growing revenue at 21% sequentially when the $10.20/share investment was first made. Today, NOW is only growing revenue at 9% sequentially, based on guidance in the Q3 earnings report, yet the stock has appreciated to over $30/share. Sources: NOW's IPO Prospectus, Nov 15th Prospectus, Reuters, and Q3 earnings report.This trend is not sustainable. In fact, NOW shares fell 12% after its Q3 earnings report when it announced sequential Q3 growth slowed to 13%. Should the Company continue to decelerate in 2013, we expect NOW's valuation to quickly revert to a valuation multiple more in line with its peers.Precedent Transactions Show that a Buyout is Unrealistic at this Price LevelSome investors may disregard ServiceNow's nosebleed valuation multiples, arguing that the Company might one day be a takeover target. This thesis, while highly speculative, is probably the result of a few widely publicized SaaS deals such as SAP's $3.5bn acquisition of SuccessFactors, an HR management firm. Yet, SuccessFactors had LTM revenue of $292 million in the quarter prior to its buyout (see 10-K and 10-Q here), which infers an EV/LTM revenue multiple of 12x. This itself is extraordinarily rich acquisition price, and numerous analysts including S&P criticized SAP for overpaying, but that multiple is still nearly half of NOW's current 22x EV/LTM revenue valuation multiple. Prior to the acquisition, SuccessFactors had grown revenue by 55% over the last twelve months. Since the multiple paid should be related to growth, let's apply this relationship to NOW's growth to compute a theoretical buyout price. In the chart below, we provide valuation multiples of selected precedent transactions in the SaaS space. Other deals used in our analysis include Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) $1.9bn acquisition of Taleo, IBM's $440m acquisition of DemandTec, and Oracle's $1.6bn acquisition of RightNow. Sources: 10-K/10-Q filings (Taleo, DemandTec, SuccessFactors, RightNow) and Bloomberg consensus estimates.In the final column above, we've compared LTM revenue multiples vs. growth rates over the same period. Using the average of the two highest-growth deals (these are most comparable to NOW's growth), the figure of 4.98x tells us that for every 5% of growth, a SaaS buyout can be awarded one turn of revenue. Using this logic, then a growth rate of 30% would be worth a 6x LTM revenue multiple, 40% would translate to 8x, and so on.We can use the 5% rule-of-thumb to approximate ServiceNow's 'M&A' value under various growth scenarios. For the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company has guided to a revenue range of $69 - $71m. If we use the mid-point of that range ($70m), ServiceNow will grow by about 8.8% QoQ or 45% on an annualized basis. If we charitably assume that NOW beats this guidance and grows at 50% through 2013, this translates to an LTM revenue multiple of 10x. As shown below, this equates to a NOW 'M&A' price of only $17.50/share.In our opinion, the M&A upside scenario does not exist for ServiceNow at its current price level.As a final point, we do not believe that ServiceNow is an attractive acquisition target at its current share price due to the limited market size of the ITSM sector. Whereas SuccessFactors, Taleo and RightNow addressed large market opportunities, NOW's end market is more restricted in comparison.NOW Insiders Sold Shares Ahead of Original Lock-up ExpirationBeyond our very genuine valuation concerns, we think that the hasty sale of 14.2m shares by insiders ahead of an originally disclosed lock-up date betrays a lack of confidence in the stock. According to ServiceNow's IPO prospectus, the vast majority of its shareholders were originally subject to a 180-day lock-up. As a group, these holders represented 106.2 million common shares, or roughly 87% of the outstanding common stock as of the IPO. A remaining 2.5m shares were subject to a lock-up until February 21, 2013. But just as investors were leaving their desks for the weekend on November 9th, ServiceNow filed an amended S-1 to push forward their first share sale by over a month. Sources: NOW's IPO and Nov 15th Prospectuses.This sudden modification of the lock-up structure does not inspire investor confidence. Investors should ask themselves: why were insiders so eager to sell $400 million of NOW shares that they could not wait another month for their lockup to expire. After all, JMI first invested in ServiceNow in 2005 - after 7 years of backing NOW, what's the big deal about waiting another 40 days? Our interpretation is that JMI and other insiders know full well that NOW is wildly overvalued and its shares are unlikely to remain at current prices much longer. As such, we believe these insiders were so eager to cash out that they could not even wait until December 26th to sell down their stakes.NOW Continues to Dilute its Existing ShareholdersWhile the secondary offering that closed on November 20th was predominantly used as a conduit to allow insiders to sell their shares before the lockup expiration, the equity offering also raised new capital for ServiceNow. Specifically, NOW sold 1.9m newly issued stock at $28/share, or more precisely, $26.88 after the underwriting discount, which equates to about $49.9m in proceeds (pg 30 of Nov 15th prospectus).We believe that this freshly dilutive equity issuance is yet more evidence that ServiceNow is highly overvalued. ServiceNow hardly needs the newly raised capital. As of its Q3 quarter-end, the Company had $256.5m of cash and equivalents on its balance sheet. Over the last nine months, the Company's cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures has been roughly breakeven (10-Q Q3 2012). Given the large cash balance and the fact that NOW is not burning cash at a material level, it seems that the cash was not raised for any near-term business purpose. Rather, we believe that management viewed NOW's stock as overvalued and wished to raise capital at an inflated valuation before the share price declined to a more realistic level. The offering suggests that management believes that NOW stock is rich even at $26.88.A Final Way to Examine ValuationWhen we compare NOW's valuation multiple to other disruptive SaaS providers, many of which we believe are highly overvalued themselves, it sticks out as an outlier. For instance, NOW's CY12E and CY13E revenue multiples are double those of RP, ET or CRM.Yet, long holders may argue that NOW has brighter growth prospects, so as a final analysis, let's examine NOW's expected growth from now to 2015, and consider the company's valuation multiple based on those 2015 figures.Analysts currently estimate 2014E and 2015E revenue for NOW to be $525m and $662m. We find this hard to believe given the recent revenue growth deceleration trends. In Q4 2012, the company forecasts sequential revenue growth to be 9%. If we assume 9% sequential revenue growth in 2013, 7.5% sequential growth in 2014 and 6% sequential growth in 2015, which equate to 47%, 36% and 29% overall annual sales growth rates in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, we only get to $615m of 2015 revenue, not $660m.Of course, this assumes that NOW executes on its growth targets. We believe this is a tall order, given the material revenue growth deceleration experienced in the past few quarters. Given its limited market opportunity, the high switching costs between product offerings, and the regular entry of competing products, we believe that ServiceNow's 7% - 10% sequential quarterly growth is unsustainable. Also, as we discussed in our previous report, we believe that NOW's addressable IT Help Desk market is only $1.5bn - $2bn. Going further, Gartner predicts that only 50% of IT companies will move to a SaaS model by 2015. This cuts NOW's addressable market in half. Should we accept the consensus scenario that NOW captures over half of this $1bn addressable SaaS IT Help Desk market in just two years, we believe that at that point, NOW would have significantly limited additional growth opportunities.Yet even if NOW does achieve analyst targets, the stock still trades at 7.5x 2015E revenue. In comparison, salesforce.com is projected to grow 34% in the twelve months ending January 31, 2013, and yet it only trades at 7.5x revenue today. So if we assume NOW should trade at 7.5x revenue in 2015, which equates to the current ~$32 stock price, and discount that back by a 15% discount rate to today, we get to a stock price of only $21.ConclusionNo matter how much one believes in ServiceNow's product and management's ability to execute, the stock itself appears highly overvalued by almost any metric. Revenue growth has slowed sequentially in each of the first three quarters in 2012, yet NOW's stock price has risen from $10.20 in February (Greylock transaction) to $32.63 today. This inversely proportionate relationship between growth and value is simply unsustainable. Once investors come to terms with NOW's limited growth prospects, NOW shares could quickly fall from their stratospheric 20x 2012E revenue multiple to one more in-line with their ITSM and SaaS peers. Investors seeking a buyout similar to SuccessFactors or Taleo will also most likely be disappointed. The revenue multiples of these deals suggest that NOW would be lucky to earn a 10x LTM revenue price, implying a ~50% drop from the current share price.This value discrepancy hasn't escaped the attention of insiders. These shareholders appear to have circumvented NOW's original December 26th lock-up date by six weeks to unload 14.2m shares at a post-fee price of $26.88/share (Nov 15th prospectus). We wouldn't be surprised to see even more discounted share offerings hit the market in the coming months.Disclosure: I am short NOW. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1082571,24317,2012-12-26T11:29:18-05:00,,"After much research in the SaaS ITSM (IT Service Management) industry, I have made a shocking discovery. ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), one of the most highly valued cloud companies (its Price/Sales is around 20), is not only having a hard time attaining new customers, but also uses an outdated technology which is falling behind its competitors.I agree with UBS which put out a research report on 12/19, rating NOW as a Sell and stating that it is the least preferred stock in the software space for 2013. UBS cited its steep valuation, declining growth, aggressive competition, and lock-up risk. But I believe things can potentially be worse for ServiceNow than even UBS says it is.ServiceNow is the leading SaaS (Software as a Service) ITSM (IT Service Management) company in the industry today. It was started in 2004 with the following vision: to steal the unhappy customers from the big four ITSM legacy vendors: BMC (NASDAQ:BMC), Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ), IBM, and CA Technologies (NASDAQ:CA).Now, eight years later, ServiceNow has successfully accomplished its goal. However, where is it going to get its growth now? All the very unhappy clients of the big four have already left and gone to ServiceNow. The ones that are still with those firms are mostly content and very reluctant to leave.A colleague who is researching ServiceNow spoke with a relatively new salesperson in the company. This guy joined ServiceNow about a year and a half ago, and it took him over a year to get his very first sale. He left another software company to work with ServiceNow, because he thought it was ""the next big thing"". He thought that there would be plenty of easy prospects in his territory, the mid-Atlantic region. However, he learned the hard way that the low hanging fruit had already been picked, and the ServiceNow software is actually a very tough sell.ServiceNow Can Only Sell To Big EnterprisesServiceNow only works directly with companies and enterprises that have 7000 or more employees. A smaller company that is intereted in ServiceNow's SaaS is referred to ServiceNow's partners. ServiceNow specifically targets the largest legacy vendor customers, because that's how the company was built.From NOW's Q312 earnings call, Frank Slootman, NOW's CEO said:""We are moving into larger customers, we have a focus on global 2000 Enterprises, we explicitly target them.""Darroll Buytenhuys, President of SAManage, another SaaS ITSM company, said: ""From an organizational standpoint, it's easier to scale up than scale down. With scaling up you want to get bigger and are dealing with big companies. But it's hard to then deal with smaller companies""SAManage is a SaaS ITSM vendor that only targets companies with under 10,000 employees. There are also many other SaaS ITSM vendors that dominate the small to middle market companies and ServiceNow can't compete with them.""We are not a competitor to ServiceNow,"" said Mr. Buytenhuys. ""ServiceNow is a one of a kind SaaS ITSM vendor in that it has the capacity to target big companies. Its only competitors are those large legacy firms that are looking to hold on to their customers.""The fact that ServiceNow can only sell to big firms is one of the reasons why it is a tough sell. ServiceNow salesmen have to talk to numerous executives and committees of the prospective enterprise customer before a sale is made. Then the company has to consult analysts to see if switching to ServiceNow is a wise choice, and the whole sales process can take months.Big companies are reluctant to change their service help desk because of the costs and inconvenience. They would need to retrain all their technicians and reprogram their computers. It's much easier to stay with who they have been using for many years, unless they are very annoyed with the old system.Listening to NOW's 3Q12 earnings call, Mr. Slootman says that ServiceNow's accelerated growth is over. Some things he said were:""We are where we think we need to be at the current time, and we think we will continue to do that going forward. The growth won't accelerate because the numbers are getting bigger every quarter.""""We've hit our headcount hiring target in our marketing/sales. In terms of productivity, we've hired so many new reps that it is taking longer in terms of getting people ramped up, but we are pleased with the quarter overall.""""We see the legacy vendors fighting hard with price and looking to slow down the attrition.""ServiceNow Discounted Cash Flow ValuationTo figure out NOW's value today, it's useful to predict its future cashflows and discount them back today. For this valuation, I used a discount rate of 10%. I came to 10%, because for a company that has fairly predictable cash flows and low risk, like Walmart, a 6% rate is appropriate. For a company that has future cash flows that aren't certain, like ServiceNow, and therefore has more risk, an increased discount rate is necessary. 10% seems about right.The following models are using ServiceNow's long-term financial targets as stated in its Q212 earnings call. In the call, Michael Scarpelli, ServiceNow's CFO, said:""We ultimately aim to reach a non-GAAP gross margin between 68% and 70%, sales and marketing of 29% and 31% as a percent of revenues, research and development of 11% to 13% as a percent of revenues, general and administrative of 4% to 6% as a percentage of revenues, and an operating margin of approximately 20%.""The above model calculates an enterprise value of $13.59 per share for NOW. Add the roughly $300 million in net cash the company currently has, and its net present value is $2.447 billion, or about $15.50 per share. This model generously assumes that ServiceNow will average 10% quarter on quarter revenue growth for 2013 and 2014, for a total annual growth of 46.4%. 10% revenue growth is the company's guidance for Q412. It only had 12.2% revenue growth in Q312 from 21.2% in Q212. So to assume that it's growth will continue at 10% even though it declined in Q312 and is expected to decline in Q412 is a little bit optimistic, but it is OK for this model and realistic in my opinion.This model predicts a 46.4% annual growth in 2013 and 2014, 26.2% annual growth from 2015-2017, 12.5% growth from 2018 to 2022, 5% growth from 2023 to 2025 and a perpetual 3% annual growth rate thereafter. If the company slips on growth in the next couple years, then a more appropriate share value would be between $8-$15 per share. The worst case scenario for ServiceNow would be if one of the big four legacy vendors comes out with a multi-tenant ITSM solution in the next 2-3 years that appeals to big enterprises and steals customers back from ServiceNow. Then NOW shares should have a value today of under $8.Next, lets look at a discounted cash flow model that represents how much the market expects ServiceNow to grow based on its current enterprise value of about $29 per share. Adding the $300 million cash balance, the net present value comes to $4.872 billion, or $30.8 per share, which is roughly where the stock is trading now.As shown in the above model, for NOW to be worth $30.80 per share, it would have to average 12% quarter on quarter revenue growth for 2013, to total 57% annual growth. Then, it must average 10% quarterly revenue growth for years 2014, 2015, and 2016, to total 46.4% annual growth for each of those years. Unless ServiceNow has an ace in the hole, I believe investors are overly optimistic to think that the company will now average 12% qoq growth in 2012, and continue with a 10% qoq growth for the following three years. Remember, this isn't just getting 10% growth for one quarter, but the company has to reach it or average it every single quarter for the next four years. This model also requires that ServiceNow will have annual revenue growth of 31% in the years 2017, 2018, and 2019, 12.5% growth from 2020 to 2022, 5% in 2023 to 2025, and have a perpetual annual growth rate of 3% each year thereafter, which will enable it to grow to over $5 billion in revenues by 2030. These are big expectations for a company which I believe already has outdated technology.ServiceNow Uses An Outdated, Labor Intensive, Single Tenant Solution""The key element of SaaS is its subscription base. So the big argument is: is single tenant SaaS truly SaaS?"" asks Mr. Buytenhuys.While more nimble and easier to use SaaS ITSM software from companies like Cherwell, SAManage, and EasyVista use a multi-tenant solution, ServiceNow still uses a single tenant solution. This requires ServiceNow to have a lengthy implementation period which, per a report from Kerrisdale Capital, can take 6-8 months and tens of thousands of dollars in implementation costs to get the system up and running. Necessary periodic upgrades required by ServiceNow are also inconvenient for the customer and can take a long time. This usually requires a programmer to go on premise and manually update the company's computers.Compare ServiceNow's single-tenant implementation period with SAManage's multi-tenant solution. With SAManage, clients use it first, and then customize it later. ""Customers that use our two week free trial are often fully customized before they even become a paying customer,"" said Mr. Buytenhuys. SAManage updates its software every Sunday, and this only requires a few minutes of downtime at the most.Mr. Buytenhuys states in a blogpost on ServiceNow: ""the ""multi-instance"" model and the fact that ServiceNow has some on-premise customers (the architecture allowed them to do this), has lead to ServiceNow having all of the challenges that the replaced vendors have struggled with. The basic fact that ServiceNow has hundreds of instances makes them look and act more like an older legacy vendor than a modern SaaS vendor.""If you, as an investor, want to invest in a high price/revenue valued SaaS company that enables an enterprise to work more efficiently, then I would take a look at Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY). Unlike ServiceNow, Workday embraces the multi-tenancy concept, and is the true SaaS leader and innovator. Here, Workday describes the importance of multi-tenant software and the difference from traditional software companies.ServiceNow's Service Is Not ""Now""EasyVista is another example of a SaaS ITSM vendor that is very easy and intuitive to customize. It is codeless, which means a non-programmer can easily learn to customize it to the firm. Although EasyVista is a publicly traded French company and most of its clients are in France, it is aggressively moving to the United States.""We recently replaced an unhappy ServiceNow customer,"" said an EasyVista product specialist who asked to remain nameless. ""The customer was unhappy with ServiceNow's lack of commitment with an installation, and wasn't thorough with its program work. I've heard that a few times before, that ServiceNow isn't committed to the client after getting the sale,"" she said.A couple days ago I experienced a demo of SAManage's ITSM and ITAM (IT Asset Management) software programs. I was amazed at the width of things that SAManage's programs cover. Its service desk product covers all forms of employee communication and monitoring, including incidences, risks, requests, and support tools.I was amazed at how easy it is for anyone to customize the controls. For example, in the requests section, you can add more modules (for example if an employee wants a new phone), you can configure the screen to add more requirements (like the color of the phone), you can make it a free text or dropdown menu, and you can change the order of requirements in the menu. All this by simply dragging and dropping or clicking the plus and minus signs. It's very intuitive and easy to figure out.I asked the SAManage demo specialist if a ServiceNow user could do any of this on his own? ""Nope"", he said. ""With ServiceNow, even the simplest of modifications would require a programmer to change the code.""This surprised me. I asked him: ""Why would a large company want to deal with all the complexity of ServiceNow's single-tenant model and spend more money too, when it could just simplify things and do 95% of what is needed with a multi-tenant, intuitively simple,self-customizable model like yours?""""You're preaching to a converter"", he said.Disclosure: I am short NOW.

703901,25258,2012-07-05T14:41:10-04:00,,"Stemming from the latest stream of Internet-based companies to host an initial public offering, ServiceNow Inc. (NYSE:NOW) raised $210 million as its shares priced above the planned range of $15-17. The company's offering of 11.7 million shares at $18/share was trumped by a closing price of $24.60 at the end of the first day's trading. The IPO was the most successful to date following the poor reception of Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) May offering. The amount of positive interest was also perceived as a breath of fresh air for an IPO market that has been placed on hold since Facebook's IPO fiasco.In light of its IPO, ServiceNow joins a growing list of companies with business models that have come to incorporate the cloud. Tech giants like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and IBM (NYSE:IBM) all offer cloud-based services. Google has its Google Cloud Platform, Amazon has Amazon Web Services, and IBM has the IBM SmartCloud. Like most tech giants, each of these companies have come to adapt into some version of a broad spectrum of cloud-based services available to businesses.Yet as businesses turn increasingly to the cloud in search for niche service solutions, stand-alone companies who have built their business models around a single area of expertise are becoming more prevalent. Whereas Google and Amazon have become best associated with ""internet search"" and ""online shopping,"" companies like Salesforce.com, inc (NYSE:CRM) and NetSuite Inc. (NYSE:N) have become synonymous with customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning, respectively. Companies like Salesforce.com and Netsuite have niche proprietary software and operate under the model of software-as-a-service providers.ServiceNow follows the footsteps of these latter companies and introduces itself as a very early-stage company and technology whose products can automate and integrate the Information Technology departments of their customers. From the company's S-1 filing, ServiceNow believes that it offers businesses three primary benefits when it comes to its cloud-based service:To date, the company has performed exceedingly well which accounts for its impressive reception. Since its IPO, the company's stock has increased over 40% as of July 4. From December 2010 to December 2011, the company's revenues grew 93% from $37.9 million to $73.4 million. In terms of customer base, the company went from 602 clients in December 2010 to 974 in December 2011, an increase of 62%. With such rapid growth along with a comfortable gross profit margin range in the realm of 60-70%, ServiceNow appears poised for sequential years of corporate growth as businesses continue to pursue cloud-based solutions.Yet seemingly with all internet-based technology companies, investors may want to exercise some cautious awareness to the premiums often placed on these cloud-based providers. With Salesforce.com trading at price-to-earnings ratio of 71 and NetSuite at 162, it's clear that the market has a strong appetite for unknown growth potential. ServiceNow appears ready to follow in these steps. But one does have to wonder how long the party can continue or when these companies may find themselves face-to-face with a more quantifiable growth expectation.Disclaimer: Please refer to my standard disclaimer found here.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
1101901,23563,2013-01-09T08:30:00-05:00,,"In our first two reports, we argued that ServiceNow, Inc. (NOW or the ""Company"") is extremely overvalued. We offered a wide range of data points that helped us arrive at that conclusion, including revenue growth deceleration, market size limitations, and accelerated insider selling, amongst others. In this article, we'll provide additional granularity on the wave of headwinds faced by the stock, including unrealistically high Q4 expectations, a tripling of the float in February, and valuation errors made by parts of the sell-side analyst community. Additionally, we've included quotations from the ITSM peer review website (helpdeskreport.com) and third-party independent experts that show that ServiceNow has its fair share of dissatisfied customers. Once these customers begin to voice their frustrations, this discontent could reverberate through the industry, making new account wins become increasingly challenging.We believe that ServiceNow's current valuation is reflective of a temporary frenzy rather than fundamental risk-adjusted, discounted cash flow analysis. Regardless of NOW's technology profile, the stock trades at a price that makes it an exceedingly risky investment. We believe that a combination of overlooked option dilution, unrealistically high earnings expectations, and lockup expirations could cause the investment community to reconsider the medley of risks inherent in this momentum stock.Many Wall Street Analysts Neglect Option Dilution in their Share Price TargetsAs we first mentioned in our November 15th report, financial databases such as Capital IQ and Bloomberg have neglected to include NOW's highly dilutive option pool in their market capitalization figures. This has led some investors to mistakenly source incorrect valuation figures when defending NOW's stock price. According to NOW's November 15th prospectus, the Company has a 37.3m share option pool with a weighted-average exercise price of $4.48 (page 7 of the prospectus). These options must be considered in addition to 1.1m restricted stock units. At NOW's current price of $26.20 per share, the Treasury Stock Method allows us to calculate a 30.9m share dilutive effect from the option and restricted stock pools. These issuable shares must be counted alongside NOW's 125.3m (includes 0.2475m greenshoe) common shares, leading to a true share count of 157.3m and a current market capitalization of $4.1bn.While we weren't completely surprised that some financial databases overlooked the option pool, we're astounded to learn that numerous bulge bracket equity research analysts appear to have made the same mistake. One of the most heavily cited figures in the typical analyst report is the price target. In order to properly calculate a price target, the analyst must first determine the proper diluted share count. After reading through the sell-side reports on NOW, we noticed that about half of the analysts calculated their price targets using only the common shares. As should be expected, this mistake has a material impact on the price target. We've found that analysts using an incorrect share count have an average price target of ~$40 while those that utilize a fully diluted share count have an average price target of about $32.Below is a summary of the seven bulge bracket equity research analysts, broken down into the banks who included and excluded the significantly dilutive impact of options.It is shocking that the analysts from Wells Fargo, Deutsche Bank and Citigroup do not appear to include the 30m+ additional shares from dilutive options in their market capitalization calculations. Their share count calculations are off by nearly 25%. This is inexcusable.We have set up a website at www.facts-about-servicenows-total-share-count.com to express our dismay. The current site is sparse, but we have high hopes for it. Inspired by Bill Ackman, we hope to launch an activist campaign to get the equity research community to properly calculate ServiceNow's total share count.Considering that the 30.9m share effect from the options increases the market capitalization by about 25% (30.9/125.3), it's logical that the difference in average share price between the groups ($40 and $32) works out to about the same amount. As management continues to dole out even more stock-based compensation to attract talent, the option pool should only get larger. The Company has reserved an additional 11.6m shares for future issuance under the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan and 5m shares under the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (page F-26 of the Nov 15th prospectus). In the real world, as opposed to ServiceNow equity research fantasyland, these additional options will further dilute common shareholders.Highly-Priced SaaS Names have Unrealistically High ExpectationsDuring each quarterly earnings season, Wall Street and cloud software management teams typically undergo a well-rehearsed dance routine. In the first act, management sets financial expectations unduly low. Then, to everyone's apparent surprise, the company serendipitously beats those original estimates. This carefully orchestrated performance is meant to trigger a rowdy applause from the investor audience, presumably so that the show's front row viewers, the venture capital firms, can quietly sneak out the door to escape the long queues for the exits when the tragicomedy is over.But, alas, the market isn't that naive. Increasingly, overhyped cloud IPOs are suffering dramatic price declines even when earnings releases beat analyst estimates. NOW's most recent quarterly report was a perfect example. NOW beat the consensus Q3 2012 earnings estimates by almost 4%, yet the stock fell over 10% the day after the October 24th release. The clearest explanation for this is that NOW's 16x 2012E revenue multiple comes with a price: incredibly high expectations. Not only must NOW beat its guidance, it must do so very convincingly. NOW reports its Q4 earnings on January 30th, 2013 and the consensus revenue estimate is $70.6m (CapIQ). Failure to surpass these expectations by a double-digit percentage could lead to another sharp price correction.Source: CapitalIQDeeper examination of this trend reveals a widespread disaffection for high-multiple SaaS companies that only modestly beat Wall Street's revenue targets. Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), a 'Big Data' SaaS software provider with a $3.4bn fully diluted market capitalization (10-Q Q3 2012) and a 16x 2012 revenue multiple (Jan 31 year-end), beat its third quarter revenue guidance by over 11%. That still wasn't enough for most investors; the stock fell 6% over the two-day period after the earnings release.Source: CapitalIQPalo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) is network security firm that also utilizes a subscription-based revenue model. PANW boasts a $3.8bn market capitalization (10-Q, Oct 17th prospectus) and a similarly rich valuation of 11x 2012E revenue (Jan 31st period end). PANW's Q1 revenue results exceeded the consensus target, yet the stock still fell 5%.A final example, though we've found more, is Bazaarvoice (NASDAQ:BV-OLD), a SaaS business that provides an online analytics tool to examine online reviews, ratings, and social commentary about a customer's brand. Before the earnings results, BV's share price had already taken a beating as lock-up expirations, mounting earnings losses, and overpriced acquisitions quickly led to a re-rating of BV's valuation multiples. But even after a more than 50% price correction between October and late November, BV shares fell an additional 5% after it reported in-line revenue results. After this 55%+ correction, BV now trades at a more realistic revenue multiple of about 3.5x 2012E revenue (10-Q, Jul 17th prospectus, CapIQ).Sources: Capital IQ, November 5th Press ReleaseMomentum investors should take heed of these case studies and the unrealistically high expectations embedded in NOW's current valuation. Combine this with a nearly unprecedented near-term share lockup waterfall and even the most optimistic NOW bulls could begin to have reservations.An Avalanche of Share Lock-up Expirations could Nearly Triple the Public Float in FebruaryAs if unrealistically high growth expectations aren't enough to warrant caution, NOW will also experience headwinds from outsized lock-up expirations that begin just two days after the January 30th earnings announcement. According to the schedule in the November 15th prospectus, 42.7m shares will be released just two days after the Q4 earnings release (January 30th). This would more than double the public float. Just two weeks thereafter, the lockup on another 47.5m shares expires. Even in the most bullish scenario in which these shares are sold rationally over time, insider sales could create a long-term headwind for the stock. In a more bearish scenario, any sign of panic can cause a stampede for the exits as venture capital insiders rush to crystallize their already astronomical gains, or as the market anticipates them to do so.After the post-Christmas lockup expiration on December 26th, over 3.4m NOW shares traded hands in a single day. Compare that figure to NOW's typical daily volume of 850k and one can see how active lock-up days are for a stock. The selling pressure clearly had an impact on the stock as NOW shares fell 5.4% on December 26th.As we discussed in our previous reports, the venture capital firms Sequoia and JMI Equity are the principal shareholders of the 90m shares set to free up in February. Instead of selling shares directly and returning cash to the LPs, these VC firms could choose to instead distribute their shares directly to the LPs. This was the tact taken by many of Facebook's VC investors. However, a distribution could lead to rushed share sales as the LPs unload the stock. This article from Fortune states the problem plainly, ""Remember, many LPs don't have in-house equity trading desks. That means that they are effectively forced to liquidate shares immediately via a third-party broker."" Such immediate selling could have a much more negative impact on the stock than if JMI or Sequoia sold the shares directly over an extended period.The Market is Overlooking a Growing Collection of Customer ComplaintsBeyond the financial headwinds and the potential mass exodus that may be triggered by the lockup expirations, our diligence continues to confirm that ServiceNow's core Help Desk product isn't as infallible as many long investors believe. The most bullish Wall Street analysts would have investors believe that ServiceNow is head and shoulders above the competition. But in reality, the NOW product has its difficulties just like the other ITSM providers on the market.We did not have to look far to find negative opinions of the NOW Help Desk software. If one queries ""ServiceNow review"" on Google, the fourth result (after employee reviews and a pair of generic spec sheets) leads to the website helpdeskreport.com. Based on the below comments, selected for their high peer ratings, many NOW customers are unsatisfied. Some have even nicknamed the company Service-Impossible or Service-Later.Selected HelpDeskReport.com ReviewsSelected Quotations from Kerrisdale's Independent CallsWe also did our own diligence calls. These calls confirmed our belief that NOW's growth has likely been the result of an aggressive marketing machine rather than a world-beating product.The opinions of these industry experts converge on a few central themes, all of which poke holes in NOW's seemingly impermeable valuation. Many customers prefer NOW since it's a fully-customizable SaaS solution. But customization leads to more cumbersome upfront implementation (both time and costs). Before the IPO, NOW would shift this cost burden onto third-party partners, who helped absorb the workload. But now, in order to fulfill Wall Street's sky-high growth expectations, NOW will increasingly bring this work in-house. As NOW takes ownership of the implementation responsibilities, the services should become more expensive for end-users, who have come to expect robust coding assistance at a low price. These issues provide room for smaller, more nimble SaaS competitors to encroach into NOW's customer accounts and intercept new contract wins.The Technology Hype Cycle Forebodes a Waning Interest in NOWIn our opinion, ServiceNow's Help Desk software is a perfect example of a product at the peak of its hype cycle. Gartner, the well-regarded research firm, has an excellent chart depicting a typical technology hype cycle. A typical technology launch can trigger widespread publicity and investor excitement, leading to a 'peak of inflated expectations.' Next, as forward-thinking industry participants realize that the technology isn't foolproof nor are competitors wholly obtuse to change, the peak precipitously falls into a 'trough of disillusionment.' Eventually, if the technology is proven out, it will plateau at a modest level of productivity.Gartner's Hype Cycle:Source: Gartner.By proving that demand for SaaS Help Desk software exists, NOW has inadvertently encouraged BMC, HP, and CA to invest in SaaS products and incentivized capital inflows to smaller ITSM peers. Cherwell Software, a well-regarded NOW competitor, received a $25m growth equity investment from Insight Venture Partners in late November 2012. An increasingly crowded marketplace will negate NOW's first-mover advantage and lead to a lower visibility profile over time.Google Trends provides anecdotal evidence that NOW's prominence in the marketplace peaked with its heavily promoted IPO but has since diminished.Source: Google Trends, keyword: ""ServiceNow"", January 2010 - January 2013ConclusionIf we wish to impart one takeaway, it's that even good businesses can be terrible investments at the wrong price. Based on the headwinds mentioned in this report, as well as our two previous NOW articles, we continue to believe that ServiceNow's stock is dangerously mispriced at 65x 2014 EBITDA. In our mind, the clearest explanation is that Wall Street believes NOW has a near-guaranteed monopoly on the $1.5bn Help Desk market. But the diligence that we've cited leads us to believe in an alternate scenario. Disillusioned customers will continue to voice their discontent while newly energized SaaS competitors push to steal new business from NOW. These competitive headwinds combined with an avalanche of lock-up expirations, option dilution, and impractically high expectations could cause investors to question the risk profile of this richly-priced stock.Disclosure: I am short NOW, SPLK, BV-OLD.

1006341,23563,2012-11-15T08:00:00-05:00,,"We believe that ServiceNow, Inc. (NOW or the ""Company"") is highly overvalued. The Company was taken public earlier this year at $18/share and has since ridden the cloud computing wave to a price of $30/share, implying an eye-popping 18.3x 2012E revenue multiple. Even if ServiceNow becomes the market leader and grows its share of the $1.5 billion IT Help Desk market from the current 10%-15% to 30%, we believe the stock is still worth less than half of its current trading price.Our full report is available here.We have spoken to numerous industry professionals about ServiceNow and the IT Service Management (""ITSM"") sector, and our research indicates that ServiceNow does not have a sustainable competitive advantage over its numerous public and private peers. The Company has become a victim of its own success by helping to galvanize a previously dormant industry to rapid innovation. NOW does not offer a unique technology; rather, it merely introduced the SaaS business model to a sector where slow-moving incumbents had frustrated certain segments of their customer base through cumbersome upgrades and lumpy up-front costs. Its adoption of a SaaS solution, combined with an aggressive salesforce, helped NOW gain market share at the expense of larger players.Today, however, the competitive landscape has changed, with both incumbents and a slew of new upstarts featuring SaaS offerings similar to NOW's products, and many at lower price points. The result has been predictable: NOW's once enviable growth is rapidly decelerating. The first signs of this became apparent when the company reported its third quarter earnings, when NOW declined 12% after reporting slowing growth in the third quarter and projecting further decelerating growth in the upcoming quarter.Given ServiceNow's absurd $4.7 billion market capitalization, when compared to $239m of projected 2012 revenue, we think NOW's share price is positioned to collapse. The market is gradually digesting the company's decelerating growth trends, and as NOW's December lockup expiration approaches, we believe the market will send the stock materially lower.Below are key reasons why NOW's share price should plummet:In this article, we will address the above concerns in detail and their implications to value.I. Company OverviewServiceNow is a niche business software developer that markets IT Service Management products under a software-as-a-service (""SaaS"") subscription model. The Company's lead product is an IT Help Desk program that has been the most heavily marketed SaaS product to emerge in a space largely dominated by hosted software. With any IT Help Desk software, instead of picking a phone to call the help desk, an employee can log into an online system to report their IT issue and receive rapid feedback. The IT manager on the other end receives the query, makes the required changes and solves the issue as part of his or her workflow queue. The Company calls this an ""incident, problem, and change"" process (NOW Q2 Call). Our more than dozen calls with experts have indicated that the Help Desk software space is largely commoditized with a litany of vendors offering similar products. However, incumbents were initially slow to move to a SaaS model, which has several advantages over hosted software. This created an opportunity for the completely SaaS-based NOW. The advantages of SaaS include automated software updates, remote access through the cloud and off-premise database redundancies, amongst others. With that said, hosted software remains the most sensible choice versus SaaS for the many enterprise-scale businesses that require the greatest functionality and wish to maintain their software systems on more secure, in-house networks. In the case of ServiceNow, customization comes with a price since customers must retain JavaScript programmers on their staff or hire outside consultants to maintain the NOW code database. More recently introduced competitive SaaS offerings have migrated from complex coding requirements to out-of-the-box, multi-tenant SaaS solutions that offer simpler upfront implementation.For an overview of the ServiceNow software, we suggest that investors view the Company's demo site and decide for themselves whether this really looks like a ~$4.5 billion piece of software. The screenshot below is the employee login dashboard from the Company's demo site.The leader in the IT service management software business is currently BMC Software, a profitable company with a 20+ year track record and a client base of over 50,000. While BMC's Remedy software has historically been sold as hosted software under a license, BMC has aggressively invested in its SaaS solutions and now has about 475 SaaS customers. In the third quarter, BMC added 90 SaaS customers, giving it 23% sequential quarter-on-quarter growth and demonstrating the customer buy-in of its SaaS solutions. This growth rate was almost twice that of ServiceNow's customer growth over the same period (126%). On its most recent earnings call, BMC discussed that when it bids for ""a competitive deal with one of our biggest SaaS competitor[s],"" likely a reference to ServiceNow, that ""this last quarter we were at about a 60% win rate"" (BMC Q2 F2013 Call).In order to gain market share in the extremely competitive IT Help Desk market, NOW has aggressively expanded its headcount and hired expensive sales staff. Compare NOW's R&D investments with its sales and marketing annual spend. In the last three fiscal years (year-end June 30th), ServiceNow reported $2.4m, $7.2m and $7.0m in research and development costs (the product was first created in 2005). Compare this to $8.5m, $19.3m and $34.1m of sales and marketing expense over the same periods. It's apparent that ServiceNow has become a sales company, not a high-tech research business with a deep technological advantage.Contrary to what glowing analyst reports might lead investors to believe, ServiceNow's software is not beyond critique. The Company's online service forum is full of complaints. Even the trusted research group Gartner states that ServiceNow's ""reporting, analytics, and dashboarding capabilities are average"" and that ""the vendor struggles to balance messaging of IT service management offerings versus platform-as-a-service capabilities."" As ServiceNow aggressively expands its headcount, it is also beginning to lose creative employees. In August 2012, Chris Dancy decided to quit ServiceNow to join BMC as the Director in the Office of the CTO. Mr. Dancy runs a heavily followed twitter account (@ServiceSphere) and is widely considered to be at the forefront of social media in the IT Help Desk space. Mr. Dancy joined BMC after seeing Remedy's MyIT product for the first time.II. An Absurd Valuation at 20x RevenueMomentum shifts are not baked into ServiceNow's current valuation, as the Company is effectively priced for perfection and the stock should waver at the slightest hiccup. Even with a hoard of well-capitalized competitors, very serious product risks and material growth hurdles, NOW trades at 21x LTM revenue. This multiple is higher than even Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) at its IPO price. But more importantly, the Company is EBITDA negative yet trades at offensively high 2013E and 2014 EBITDA multiples of 196x and 74x, respectively. At the current price, we believe that investors are accepting inordinate amounts of risk for a mere 1.4% 2014 EBITDA yield (if NOW meets consensus estimates).By comparison, BMC trades at 2.4x 2012E revenue and 6.6x 2012E EBITDA. BMC is actually growing its SaaS customer base more quickly than ServiceNow.(1) BMC stated on its FQ2 (Sept 30th period end) call that it added ""90 new SaaS customers... [we] currently have approximately 475 SaaS customers""Source: Company filings and earnings calls.ServiceNow's recent third quarter earnings report proves that NOW is actually a slowing business.In the SaaS software sector, many analysts believe that billings is a better indicator of growth than revenue. Billings, as reported by NOW and others, more accurately reflects total upfront sales by including the deferred revenue of a subscription contract over its life. ServiceNow's billings have slowed sharply from 23% sequential growth in the second quarter to 13% in the third. The Company has not given billings guidance for the fourth quarter, but has guided to revenue growth of ~10%. Even if NOW modestly beats its fourth quarter estimates, any growth in billings lower than 13% would indicate that NOW's revenue growth should soon drop below 10% sequentially, which is simply too low for a 20x+ LTM revenue multiple.The IT Help Desk sector is one of the most competitive sub-segments of the IT Service Management business. ServiceNow competes in a market still largely dominated by industry stalwarts like BMC, HP, CA, and IBM. These market giants offer bundled product offerings across all ITSM and ITOM product verticals, giving them a strong edge on smaller peers, including NOW, who have more limited product offerings. The market is also populated by smaller, private SaaS competitors such as Cherwell Software, EasyVista, and Hornbill. According to a report from Gartner/Citigroup, IT Help Desk has a market size of $1.5 billion and is only growing at 7%, a figure that is hardly enough to justify NOW's 21x LTM revenue multiple. Wall Street estimates predict that NOW can grow its market share from about 10% to 15% in 2011 to 35% in 2014 to reach a revenue estimate of $530 million. Hitting these growth expectations will be extremely challenging since switching costs are high and Help Desk functionality is largely commoditized across competitive platforms.NOW must grow market share by about 7%/year to reach the Street's 2013 revenue estimates. As a data point, Salesforce.com has only been able to increase its market share of the Customer Relationship Management software market by about 2-3% per year, according to data from Gartner:Aside from IT Help Desk, analysts cite adjacent opportunities in areas such as Configuration Management, Workload Automation, and Asset Management to justify sky-high NOW price targets. Configuration Management ensures that the components of an IT ecosystem (user/software/network/server) are compatible with one another; Workload Automation assigns the order in which 'jobs' or batch processes run through the mainframe servers; and Asset Management is a financial tracking tool that itemizes all of an organization's IT 'assets' (e.g. smartphones, laptops, servers, etc.). Our research indicates that ServiceNow's existing suite of adjacent products (Discovery and Runbook Automation) are inferior compared to offerings from the large incumbents (IBM, BMC, and others) and that neither product presents significant near-term revenue opportunities. Many of these adjacent software verticals are more technically complex than Help Desk and require a greater depth of product capabilities within a wider IT framework. For that reason, certain vendors can distinguish themselves by providing a full suite of integrated software tools. This gives an advantage to software titans like BMC, HP, IBM, Microsoft, and CA who have all established much larger beachheads throughout the IT suite.Below is a helpful chart examining market share within the IT Operations Management (""ITOM"") sector from Citigroup:Note that this chart is from 2011; therefore NOW's 8% market share figure is dated.Source: Citigroup July 24th, 2012 Research ReportPlatform-as-a-ServiceNOW's promoters argue that NOW can distinguish itself from other SaaS competitors through its single-code platform architecture. ServiceNow's CEO views the platform as a ""Trojan horse"" (Q3 2012 Call) that is initially adopted for its IT Help Desk application and then entices customers to purchase other NOW applications or utilize NOW's professional services to add new functionality. We believe that this closed architecture could turn out to be a fatal flaw as it complicates the addition of third-party applications. Indeed, we believe that customers who want to develop customized applications via a PaaS offering would prefer more widely-used platforms like Force.com and Google App Engine. Below is a summary of certain PaaS solutions currently in market. We believe that NOW's platform is heavily outmatched.Thin Float IPO has Artificially Increased Share DemandUnderwriters of NOW's IPO initially anticipated an opening price range of $15- $17 and the bookrunners ended up pricing the IPO at $18. NOW shares then traded up to $25 by the end of a frenzied trading day, giving IPO investors an enviable 40% one-day return.We suspect that the IPO was helped by its ""thin float"" nature. In the IPO, ServiceNow only sold 13.4 million of its 123 million common shares, representing 10% of the float. This figure is even smaller if one includes the 37 million stock options with a weighted average strike price of $4.48. Taking into account these highly dilutive options and 1 million restricted stock units, the fully diluted share count jumps to 158 million. We believe that NOW's thin float may have contributed to the stock's inflated share price run.Both Facebook and Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) utilized similar thin float IPOs and investors have only recently woken up to the risk inherent in these stocks during their pre lock-up periods. In gifting institutional clients with one-day IPO stock pops, underwriters have scattered landmines all over the technology sector.Much of the Press, Analysts, and Financial Databases Overlook NOW's Highly Dilutive Option PoolOne of the most appalling valuation mistakes that we've noticed with NOW is the exclusion of the 37 million share pool ($4.48 strike price) of highly dilutive options from market capitalization calculations. Some Wall Street analysts, as well as reputable press sources, have excluded this option pool from their calculations of market capitalization, thereby underestimating revenue multiples, amongst other valuation metrics. To us, this seems like an embarrassing mistake; by excluding the dilutive effect of options, investors would be overstating their valuation metrics by an incredible 27%.Sources: NOW Prospectus, S-1, 10-Q, and CapitalIQ consensus estimates.We encourage investors to check their valuation sources thoroughly - frequently used research tools like Bloomberg, CapitalIQ, and Yahoo Finance are all misrepresenting NOW's market capitalization and price/revenue multiples.III. NOW Faces Competitive and Structural HeadwindsSaaS Help Desk Competition has IntensifiedThe Market Leader: BMC SoftwareThere's little doubt that BMC was too slow to embrace SaaS for the ITSM sector, and its complacency allowed NOW to enter the market and steal market share. That said, BMC's technological depth in ITSM is extensive, and we believe it has taken steps to stop the bleeding. The company now offers a rapidly growing SaaS solution as well as an OnDemand version of its market leading Remedy software. The pure SaaS product, RemedyForce, operates within the Force.com cloud platform, making it convenient for customers that already use productivity applications on Force.com. BMC has grown its SaaS customer base from ~315 in Q1 to ~475 in Q3 2012, implying about 20% sequential quarterly growth. This customer growth figure is about twice that of NOW. According to BMC's CEO, ""RemedyForce is an area we're really going to be putting some more dollars into and more focus on."" (BMC Q3 2012 Earnings Call) For larger enterprise customers who require greater customization, Remedy OnDemand is BMC's flagship product offered over the cloud. This gives customers a choice between a secure, fully-customizable hosted system and a simpler, configurable SaaS.On Tuesday, October 30th, BMC launched MyIT, the newest addition to its Remedy suite of products. MyIT is a social and self-service tool that integrates with Remedy to increase productivity. Amongst other features, MyIT allows users to self-diagnose IT problems, request the corresponding requests, and personalize their IT Help Desk application with their favorite tools. MyIT also integrates seamlessly with mobile hardware, such as phones or tablets, allowing the end-user to do things like request a conference room, access an application, or request a webinar remotely. MyIT has received favorable reviews by Stephen Mann from Forrester Research. Mr. Mann stated that, ""[MyIT is] a great move by BMC that pushes the proverbial envelope for ITSM tools."" Chris Dancy, the widely-followed ITSM executive who decided to quit ServiceNow to join BMC, says that MyIT was ""the real reason I joined BMC."" Mr. Dancy is the #2 most-followed ITSM pundit in the entire industry on Twitter (Mr. Mann is #1).BMC's MyIT:Source: BMC Software website.Finally, one of BMC's biggest advantages versus NOW remains its deep suite of ITSM products. Many times, enterprise customers prefer a single vendor that offers solutions across the IT service and operations management landscapes. ServiceNow may have a strong IT Help Desk product, but it's still technologically immature in Configuration Management, Workload Automation and its other ancillary product verticals. This gives horizontally integrated companies such as BMC, HP and IBM a significant advantage over upstarts like ServiceNow.The Three Incumbents: HP, CA, IBMBMC isn't the only incumbent making efforts to protect its existing customer base with new SaaS offerings. Last week, HP announced the release of HP Service Anywhere, which provides many of the same capabilities as HP's traditional ITSM offerings only under a SaaS framework. HP has designed this product for ""codeless configuration,"" which would allow users to add functionality without having to know a programming language. This could potentially give HP's product an edge over NOW for customers that want to lower their implementation and coding costs. HP Service Anywhere also introduced a significant social media component to its Help Desk suite. HP's Service Anywhere should make it more difficult for NOW to poach existing HP users as it has in the past.CA has also reacted to the ServiceNow threat with its CA Nimsoft Service Desk, a multi-tenant SaaS solution that allows configuration while limiting in-suite coding. Should a large enterprise customer require complex functionality, CA still offers its software in a customizable, hosted instance. This multi-tiered product approach, as used by BMC and HP, allows customers to choose between a more secure hosted offering or a SaaS-based approach.IBM remains a common brand of choice for large, complex enterprises that require a full suite of IT functionality. IBM integrates IT Help Desk, Configuration Management, Asset Management and Workload Automation through a single interface under its SmartCloud network. The SmartCloud is available for a single price and easily integrates with 10 incremental ""ITIL"" (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) products, such as IBM Rational and IBM Tivoli. IBM holds a leading 20 - 30% market share in many of these more complex computing areas such as Network Management and Application Development. ServiceNow does not have functionality in either segment, giving it a material disadvantage for complex Fortune 500 clients.Source: IBM Product Brochure.Emerging Competitors: Private ITSM CompaniesMoving beyond the large incumbents, several other private companies have recently emerged as competitors to ServiceNow. Each of these companies has a core SaaS Help Desk product supported by a few adjacent tools, putting their product depth in-line with ServiceNow. Cherwell Software, founded by former executives of FrontRange, is another strong SaaS competitor that is frequently overlooked by Street analysts, but often cited by industry experts. Unlike ServiceNow, Cherwell offers an all-inclusive, concurrent license rather than a piecemeal offering. This is a major selling point for some customers, who feel cheated when ServiceNow attempts to upsell them additional modules such as Discovery and Runbook Automation. Cherwell also owns its own data centers whereas NOW is still in the process of transitioning to wholly-owned centers. Cherwell has done well internationally; half of its sales are outside the United States. Cherwell can also engineer its product as a PaaS, pitting it head-to-head with NOW at nearly every sales pitch.There are other competitors that could emerge to chip away at NOW's edge as the leading SaaS provider of ITSM. One company we've heard great things about from independent experts is the Europe-based EasyVista. EasyVista is the successor to Staff & Line, which was founded in 1988 and has a deep heritage in the ITSM space. EasyVista has created a well-designed, highly functional product that some believe shows innovation much like ServiceNow did five years ago. EasyVista features a codeless SaaS architecture that makes it relatively simple to configure. According to the company's website, non-technical IT users can be trained to configure the product in under a day. EasyVista 2012 has been updated for full integration between the help desk solution and configuration/asset management, workflow automation, and other ancillary product capabilities. While EasyVista is still expanding its sales presence in the U.S., our research indicates that it is increasingly showing up in the final rounds of RFP meetings and could be primed to disrupt NOW's growth trajectory. EasyVista currently boasts a customer roster with the likes of L'Oreal, Mercedes Benz, HSBC, and Quicksilver.Hornbill is a third name that repeatedly came up during our discussions with industry professionals. Like BMC, Hornbill provides both hosted and SaaS ITSM software, providing customers a choice between on-premise and SaaS. Going further with its customer-centric approach, Hornbill's SaaS product is priced in three separate tiers (standard, pro, and expert). The 'standard' solution allows those who prefer fast implementation periods over complex customization to get their ITSM processes up and running as soon as possible.ServiceNow also faces opposition from the likes of Axios, LANDesk, SAManage, FrontRange, Serena Software, SunView Software, and dozens of other ITSM companies. Accordingly, we do not believe that ServiceNow has anything close to a monopoly in the SaaS market, as many believe, but instead competes with numerous offerings.We would also expect that investment bankers are currently banging down the doors of the fastest-growing private ITSM companies given NOW's valuation. New IPO funding could help companies like Cherwell become even more viable alternatives to NOW, especially among enterprise customers. This would slow down NOW's market share growth as well as pressure them on pricing.ServiceNow's Ancillary Offerings Provide Very Little RevenueNOW markets two ancillary products that it attempts to upsell alongside its IT Help Desk software. While Wall Street believes that these secondary products can quickly gain market share over entrenched competitors, these products continue to make limited headway even after several years in existence. Discovery, the Configuration Management tool that helps map server loads and computing operations, was launched in late 2007 yet still only has 0.2% market share, according to a Citigroup July 24th report. We also believe that this very low market share is not necessarily due to a lack of customers to cross-sell to, but rather because of the software's lack of functionality.A report on the Configuration Management market last year from Gartner doesn't even list ServiceNow as a player in this market. We believe that the chart below is particularly relevant since the $4 billion Configuration Management market size figure was put together by Gartner itself, and they would therefore be best placed to define the competitors for that revenue pie.Source: http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/configuration-managementServiceNow is nowhere to be found in the above diagram.ServiceNow's other tool, aside from Help Desk, is Runbook Automation, a tool that addresses part of the complex Workload Automation market (coordination of batch submissions and other computing-intensive data processes). Runbook Automation also has a meager 0.2% market share (Gartner/Citigroup figures) even though Runbook was launched in late 2010. Frank Slootman, NOW's CEO, commented that for Runbook Automation, ""the penetration is less than 10%"" (NOW Q2 2012 Earnings Call) of its existing customer base. Slootman went on to say on the Q3 2012 earnings call, that ""in terms of the model, our principal source of upsell revenue comes from incremental users, right, as opposed to incremental applications.""Below is the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Workload Automation. Gartner lists twelve competitors. ServiceNow is nowhere to be found. The world's leading technology research firm does not consider ServiceNow to be a meaningful vendor in Workload Automation.Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Workload AutomationSource: Gartner's February 27th 2012 report.Much like Help Desk, these adjacent fields are highly competitive and heavily populated by large enterprises as well as well-funded private companies. Data from Gartner supports our skeptical analysis of the revenue opportunity for Discovery and Runbook Automation.NOW's Platform-as-a-Service Offering Has Several Mortal FlawsBroadly speaking, platform-as-a-service (PaaS) products allow customers to integrate numerous disparate software products (including SaaS) under a single dashboard. This dashboard then manages each piece of software as an individual application. One can think of a PaaS dashboard as being akin to the home screen on an iPhone. Much like the App Store, the more applications that one adds into an ecosystem, the more valuable the platform becomes. Market leaders such as Force.com have 220,000 different applications made by leading software vendors like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), SAP, Microsoft, Facebook, and other developers who've become comfortable with the Force.com system.Source: Citigroup Research Report, July 24th, 2012As shown in the PaaS overview chart above, Force.com, Microsoft Azure, and LongJump are all examples of open platforms. ServiceNow, on the other hand, uses a largely closed, single-tenant system that does not easily integrate with outside software applications. While this might allow additional customization in some instances, it limits the ability to integrate best-of-breed tools that come from outside the ServiceNow ecosystem.Frank Slootman, ServiceNow's CEO, has essentially conceded that NOW does not compete head-to-head with more widely used platforms.We're skeptical that NOW's Platform-as-a-Service strategy will succeed. Competition in PaaS is fierce. It's one thing to disrupt dithering incumbents like BMC and HP in the ITSM sector; it's another to compete head-to-head with visionary, aggressive and well-funded companies like Salesforce.com and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).Single-Tenant vs. Multi-TenantThe differences between single and multi-tenant SaaS are subtle but matter when forecasting the future direction of the industry. Single-tenancy SaaS generally refers to fully-customizable software that can vary between each customer (including a separate database instance for each application); ServiceNow's customizable code firmly places them in this category. Some of the independent experts that we've spoken with believe that a multi-tenant architecture, or one where the underlying software is identical across customers, is a better way forward for the SaaS industry. Without variation in the underlying code, multi-tenant SaaS makes regular software updates much simpler for all end-users. This issue is significant since many of NOW's customer wins have come from clients who have been frustrated with the incumbents' cumbersome upgrades, and are looking for predictable, straightforward software updates. Yet a single-tenant system would typically involve complex upgrades given that different clients have customized their NOW platforms with functionality specific to their operations. Additionally, single tenancy usually involves substantial upfront coding costs and longer implementation times. For these reasons, NOW may lose certain customers over time to SaaS providers who offer more attractive multi-tenant solutions.ConclusionWe congratulate ServiceNow for creating a niche IT service management product with only $40m of R&D during the four-year period between June 2008 and June 2012. We also commend JMI Equity for its 105x return and Sequoia on its 1300% return, at least on paper. But recent moves by BMC, HP, and others to defend their turf in the SaaS space will make it much more difficult for NOW to win customers at its current rate, expediting the Company's growth deceleration. Several recently introduced products prove that in a rapidly changing and highly competitive industry, ServiceNow does not have a technological moat, nor should it be assumed that the Company can continue to grow market share indefinitely. Somehow NOW has achieved a $4.7 billion market capitalization, which is roughly the entire IT Help Desk ($1.4 billion) and Configuration Management ($4 billion) sectors combined. Since NOW only has about 15% share in the former and minimal penetration into the latter, we believe that investors have relied on pie-in-the-sky investor presentations instead of grounded financial analysis.We also do not believe that ServiceNow's Help Desk product is as ground-breaking as many believe. The Company's single-tenant SaaS model is susceptible to many of the same problems that have plagued hosted software, namely extended upfront implementation periods, ongoing professional services fees to maintain the code database, and high total costs of ownership over the cycle. While Fortune 500 customers may expect to incur these problems to achieve their desired level of customization, we believe that customers further down-market are becoming more sensitive to these issues. Some of the more nimble multi-tenant SaaS can actually offer long-term cost savings and rapid implementation cycles thanks to a simplified software platform. As ServiceNow begins to expand its customer base beyond the low-hanging fruit (i.e. dissatisfied customers seeking an alternative to hosted), these issues should increasingly come to light.These substantial growth headwinds combined with the Company's untenable valuation should increasingly come into focus as NOW's venture capital investors seek to unload their shares onto the public markets. In our opinion, the November 9th Amended S-1 is a clear showing of bad faith by the initial VC investors as it pushes forward share sales that were intended to be locked-up until December 26th, 2012 (according to the original prospectus). The Amended S-1 contemplates the sale of 11.5m by insiders and the issuance of 1.9m new shares by NOW itself, assuming that the full greenshoe is exercised, the combination of which will double the Company's 13.4m float. With 158m diluted shares outstanding, this offering only scratches the surface of the secondary sales that will soon come to market. Should NOW's growth continue to retreat to more sustainable levels, as is every indication, we believe that this selling pressure will only exacerbate the sharp fall that we expect in NOW's share price.Disclosure: I am short NOW.

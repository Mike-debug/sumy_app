4373488,40101,2020-09-10T08:12:18-04:00,"Insperity reported better-than-projected second-quarter results in early August. The share price topped $70 through most of August but has slipped below $65 of late.There's no doubt the pandemic negatively impacted small and medium-sized businesses. But the types of businesses hit the hardest do not represent the majority of Insperity clients.Moreover, its client retention topped 99% even during the pandemic because the company proved its worth.","Safety is a concept getting a lot of attention these days. In the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, it's quite likely each of us has taken time to redefine our risk tolerance.Insperity (NSP) reported second-quarter results in early August. Even though these results and the company's updated guidance for the second half of 2020 reaffirmed its safety as an investment, shares have been under pressure thus far in September. After topping $70 routinely throughout August, shares have slipped below $65. Potential investors would be wise to consider taking advantage of the opportunity.Insperity is an HR solutions provider. Initially, it operated as a PEO (professional employer organization), a business model where the employee is “co-employed” by an administrative employer, such as Insperity, and the worksite employer. Under its PEO umbrella, Insperity offers Workforce Optimization, a human resource and business solution which includes recruiting, training, employee management, payroll, benefits administration, workman's compensation administration and retirement benefits management.However, with Workforce Optimization as its only offering, Insperity was unable to service companies not interested in or not ready for a PEO. In early 2017, the company began testing, refining and modifying a traditional HR service. Workforce Acceleration is a self-service, human capital management software bundle with as-needed professional HR support.In 2018, Insperity developed an offering focused on the mid-market demographic, companies with 150-5,000 employees needing customized solutions.Though the company's solution offerings have increased, its target market has remained consistent - thriving businesses with a consistent employment demand. Its current profiling image is consistent with this one from 2013.(Source: 2013 Investor Presentation)(Source)By percentage, Insperity targets only approximately 39% of its potential client base. One would naturally question whether the pandemic has changed the actual number in that segment.Although many businesses pulled 2020 full-year guidance early in the pandemic, Insperity did not. With first-quarter results, the company did adjust its guidance downward for the full year and provided guidance for the upcoming quarter.It projected the range of average number of worksite employees paid would fall between 220,400 and 229,700, with a midpoint of 225,050. The range for adjusted EBITDA was $65 million and $79 million, with a midpoint of $72 million. The range for adjusted diluted earnings was $1.02 to $1.29 per share, $1.155 being the midpoint.On August 3rd, the company reported the average number of worksite employees paid at 227,894, 1.3% greater than the guidance midpoint and only 1.8% less than the 232,010 in the second quarter of 2019. Adjusted EBITDA was $91.96 million, 28% greater than the guidance midpoint and 62% more than the $57.7 million from the second quarter of 2019. Adjusted diluted earnings were $1.54 per share, 33% greater than the guidance midpoint and 85.5% more than the $0.83 per share in the second quarter of 2019.In a nutshell, results for the quarter fared much better than originally expected:With second-quarter reporting, Insperity again updated full-year guidance. But this time, the financial ranges were significantly increased.The average number of worksite employees paid was updated from a range of 221,400-233,200 with a midpoint of 227,300 to a range of 228,500-233,200 with a midpoint of 230,850. Through the first half of the year, the average number of worksite employees is 232,954, 1.8% more than the average for the same period in 2019. The average number of worksite employees paid for all of 2019 was 235,547. Thus, using the midpoint, the average is projected to decline just 2% year over year.The range for adjusted EBITDA improved from a range of $215-$250 million with a midpoint of $232.5 million to a range of $235-255 million with a midpoint of $245 million. Adjusted EBITDA to date in 2020 is $193.2 million, 22% greater than that in the first six months of 2019. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year of 2019 was $250 million. Using the midpoint, the year-over-year decline is also projected at 2%.The range for adjusted diluted earnings improved from a range of $3.19-3.86 per share with a midpoint of $3.53 to a range of $3.67-4.04 per share with a midpoint of $3.86. Adjusted diluted earnings through the first six months of 2020 are $3.24 per share, 15% greater than the first half of 2019. Adjusted diluted earnings for all of 2019 were $4.15 per share. Using the midpoint, the year-over-year decline is projected at 7%.In terms of outpacing 2019 on the bottom line, it is evident that, despite the positive update to guidance, Insperity is not expecting the last half of 2020 to keep pace with its first half. Third-quarter adjusted EBITDA is projected in a range of $29-38 million, compared to $51 million in 2019. Adjusted diluted earnings are projected in a range of $0.37-0.54 per share, compared to $0.75 per share in 2019.The shutdown slowed the delivery of all but essential healthcare procedures. As deferred treatments are caught up, Insperity expects those costs to hit the last half of the year.There is no doubt the pandemic has impacted the economic footprint for small businesses in the United States. In July, Yelp (YELP) reported the number of businesses remaining closed at 132,580 had decreased, compared to 140,000 in June. However, of those that were still closed, the percentage of those closing permanently had increased.(Source)By August 11th, both numbers had increased. The number of businesses closed had grown to over 155,000, and the percentage of permanent closures had increased to 59%.(Source)Despite this impact from the pandemic, there are a number of factors supporting a bullish stance on Insperity.As mentioned already, the company narrowed its potential client base years ago. A closer look at the image displayed above from 2013 reflects a key component of this narrowing: the NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) business code. Insperity simply does not target every type of business. Referring back to the business closures reported by Yelp, the pandemic hit specific types of service businesses harder - restaurants and retail, followed by beauty salons, spas, bars, clubs and fitness facilities.(Source)Even before the pandemic, the turnover rate in the restaurant industry was 75% in 2019, an all-time high. According to Leftronic, the voluntary turnover rate in the retail and wholesale industry topped 60%. Thus, those specific types of business have not typically been Insperity clients.(Source)Furthermore, Insperity retained the clients it already had at an impressive rate topping 99%.The second factor supporting a bullish stance on Insperity is, so to say, the proof in the pudding. Simply put, the company delivered during the second quarter.For dividend growth and income investors, the third factor supporting a bullish stance on Insperity is the safety of its dividend. The company's adjusted cash (excluding its payables for taxes and payroll deductions) has improved $161 million since the beginning of 2020 to $269 million. It did increase its debt obligation by $100 million in the first quarter to $369.4 million.The annual dividend rate is $1.60 per share effective with its March payment, which reflected a 33.3% increase. Using the midpoint of $3.86 per share in adjusted diluted earnings, this equates to a payout ratio of 41.5%.Moreover, Insperity's Board increased its share repurchase authorization by 1 million shares. To date in 2020, the company has repurchased 879,000 shares for approximately $61.2 million. There are now just over 38.8 million shares outstanding.For growth investors, Insperity is already anticipating a return to growth.And the company intends to incorporate that proof-in-the-pudding success discussed above into its marketing messages to be used during its Fall campaign.Using that same rationale, once the pandemic is in the rear-view mirror, potential investors will not want to look back and see they missed an opportunity in Insperity."
4344710,40101,2020-05-08T10:36:02-04:00,"Insperity reported first quarter results on May 4th. Its top-line improved. Its bottom line declined. And, as a service provider to small-and-medium-sized businesses, its focus is pandemic.The company also shared results from a client survey focused on the COVID-19 pandemic. The data was somewhat optimistic, perhaps a result of Insperity's demographic targeting.Still, the company, cautiously, decreased its full-year guidance. The level of uncertainty surrounding the pandemic remains high.","During an economic shutdown with high unemployment specifically impacting small-to-medium-sized businesses, it's hardly a surprise to see the share price struggling for a company focused on servicing small-to-medium-sized businesses. Such is the case for Insperity (NSP). The HR solutions provider is trading at only 35% of its 52-week high of over $144.Insperity's troubles didn't actually start with the economic shutdown. It hit its 52-week high in July 2019 before reporting 2019 second quarter results. With each subsequent quarter's report, its share price stair-stepped lower. The culprit of the disappointments was an unusual number of occurrences of large medical claims (defined as $250,000 and above).SourceIn early February 2020, Insperity reported 2019 year-end results and shares, subsequently, traded in the low $70 range. Since that point, shares are down another 30%. However, when Insperity reported 2020 first quarter results on May 4th and updated its full-year guidance, the company adjusted its projections by less than half that rate.Prior to the pandemic, Insperity expected to prove the fruitfulness of applying data science and analytics to its processes in 2020.Because its 2019 fall sales campaign had stalled late in the year, it began 2020 with a lower-than-expected starting point in paid worksite employees. As a result of the fall slowdown, the company extended the sales campaign through January. Ultimately, sales recovered and even exceeded campaign goals. Obviously, the push didn't help the 2019 fourth quarter. But, the 2020 first quarter showed promise.For the entire year, Insperity projected adjusted EBITDA would fall in a range of $250 million to $274 million compared to $250 million in 2019. But, the bottom line was not expected to show the same growth potential. Net income was projected in a range of $128 million to $145 million compared to $151.1 million in 2019. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were projected in a range of $3.73 to $4.16 compared to $4.15 per share in 2019.In the first quarter, Insperity generated a 6.6% revenue increase from $1.15 billion in 2019 to $1.23 billion in 2020. The primary contributor to the revenue increase was worksite employee growth of 5.5%. The average number of worksite employees paid in the quarter was 238,014. In the 2019 fourth quarter, Insperity had projected the average number of paid worksite employees to fall in a range of 238,000 to 240,200. The revenue per average worksite employee also increased just over 1% from $1,704 in 2019 to $1,722 in 2020.Unfortunately, Insperity's expenses grew faster than revenue in the quarter. Payroll taxes, payroll benefits, and workers' compensation costs increased 7.5%. Because its tax rate doubled from 12% in the 2019 first quarter to 27% in the 2020 first quarter, the income tax expense more than doubled. As a result, Insperity's net income declined 18.6% from $76.3 million in 2019 to $62.1 million in 2020. Adjusted earnings declined 14% from $1.98 per share in 2019 to $1.70 per share in 2020. The company had projected the adjusted earnings to fall in a range of $1.61 to $1.70. Adjusted EBITDA fell only slightly from $101.44 million in 2019 to $101.25 million in 2020. Insperity had projected the adjusted EBITDA to fall in a range of $98 million to $103 million.Though the company met its first quarter projections, in the past, Insperity has suggested analyzing worksite employee data points for measuring productivity.In the first quarter, gross profit per WSEE declined 2.1% year-over-year from $335 in 2019 to $328 in 2020. The culprit in the comparison actually stemmed from favorable cost trends in 2019 regarding workers' compensation and benefit costs trends as well as stronger pricing.Operating income per WSEE declined 5.6% from $126 in 2019 to $119 in 2020. The recent problem of the unusual number of occurrences of large medical claims was not a factor. Rather, one increased expense is directly related to future growth. Insperity continues to hire and train BPAs (Business Performance Advisors).The company also continued to repurchase shares. Year-over-year, the outstanding share count has declined by over 4%. In the 2020 first quarter, Insperity repurchased 878,000 shares for $61 million.It ended the quarter with $424.2 million in cash and securities. Accounting for amounts due for payroll taxes and deductions, its adjusted cash equates to $167 million. Insperity also has $130 million available under its credit facility.Insperity initially operated as a PEO (professional employer organization), a business model where the employee is ""co-employed"" by an administrative employer, such as Insperity, and the worksite employer. Under its PEO umbrella, the company offers Workforce Optimization - human resource and business solutions including recruiting, training, employee management, payroll, benefits administration, workman's compensation administration, and retirement benefits management.With only Workforce Optimization, the company left companies not interested in or not ready for a PEO unserved. In early 2017, Insperity expanded its solutions to include a traditional HR service. Workforce Acceleration was tested, refined, and modified for several quarters. It is now defined as a self-service, human capital management software bundle with as-needed professional HR support.In 2018, Insperity also developed a focused offering for a mid-market demographic. The company honed in on companies with 150 to 5,000 employees needing customized solutions.With each new solution, the company continued to target healthy and thriving companies.SourceThis focus should serve Insperity well as the company assists its clients in facing the COVID-19 pandemic. The company described the benefit of but one of its initiatives in the earnings call. By participating in the development of the CARES Act through the provision of information, the company was uniquely positioned to ready its clients. It was able to prep the necessary reports for clients that jump-started their loan application process.Of Insperity's clients applying for funds, 59% received funds as compared to the national average of only 20%.In the 2020 first quarter earnings call, Insperity reiterated its mission, especially in the context of the coronavirus.The company conducted a survey of its clients in the last week of April. Nearly 9 of every 10 respondents acknowledged the pandemic was negatively impacting business. Nearly 4 of every 10 classified the impact as significant. Over 80% of the respondents expected to apply for federal aid via the Paycheck Protection Loans program.Fortunately, less than 15% of respondents had been forced to close one or more physical locations. Over 3 of every 4 respondents had employees working from home. At least 2 of every 10 had employees working fewer hours. Nearly 3 of every 10 respondents had reduced staffing levels. Yet, only 35% considered the reductions permanent. Only 15% had lowered pay.The majority of respondents were still optimistic about the future. Only 11% expected to reduce staffing levels while 70% expected to either maintain or increase the number of employees. And, 72% expected to maintain their employees' compensation rates.Through the end of April, Insperity had not yet experienced a materially-significant increase in either client terminations or bad debts from financial defaults.Though the survey results reflect optimism, Insperity formulated guidance changes for the remainder of 2020 with caution. The level of uncertainty surrounding the pandemic is still high.Insperity's first adjustment to guidance was a decrease in the average number of worksite employees paid. Initially, the company expected a range of 249,700 to 254,400 with a midpoint of 252,050. The updated range is 221,400 to 233,200 with a midpoint of 227,300, a decline of nearly 10% by the midpoints.Financial projections subsequently decreased 7% to 20%. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 9% to 14% from a range of $250 million to $274 million to a range of $215 million to $250 million. Net income declined 12% to 20% from a range of $128 million to $145 million to a range of $102 million to $127 million. Adjusted diluted earnings dropped 7% to 14% from a range of $3.73 to $4.16 per share to a range of $3.19 to $3.86 per share.My investment club first invested in Insperity in 2013. Our investment doubled so we've recouped our original investment. Thus, our investment cost on this position is next to nothing and our yield on cost is quite healthy. There's little chance we'll divest our Insperity position.At some point, investors may judge companies by their corporate stewardship during this pandemic. I fully expect my investment club to do such. In that regard, I suspect Insperity will pass scrutiny as it is uniquely positioned to not only support but even kindle America's small and medium-sized business community."
4341612,24491,2020-04-30T14:44:28-04:00,"Insperity exited 2019 with a nice net cash balance, which supports its outlook during these challenging times.The company aggressively raised its quarterly dividend on a sequential basis in February 2020.While Insperity's historical free cash flows have easily covered its dividend obligations, those cash flows will likely come under intense fire from the ongoing pandemic.","Source: Insperity Inc - Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Earnings IR PresentationBy Callum TurcanOne company that has seen its stock price aggressively battered down due to the ongoing coronavirus ('COVID-19') pandemic is Insperity Inc. (NSP), which provides human resources and administrative services to small- and medium-sized businesses ('SMBs') in the US. In February 2020, Insperity increased its quarterly dividend in a big way, raising it by over 33% sequentially to $0.40 per share. On a forward-looking basis, shares of NSP yield ~3.7% as of this writing.However, investors still sold off shares of NSP over the past few months as stay-at-home orders forced millions of SMBs in the US to temporarily shut their doors. That being said, Insperity retained a net cash balance at the end of 2019 and, historically, has been very free cash flow positive, which lends strength to its payout coverage, keeping very serious exogenous headwinds in mind. Should many SMBs, unfortunately, go under during these harrowing times, that would likely put a severe amount of stress on Insperity's financial performance going forward.At the end of 2019, Insperity had $367 million in cash and cash equivalents, $49 million in restricted cash, and $35 million in marketable securities on hand versus no short-term debt and $269 million in long-term debt. Its current ratio stood at north of 1.1x at the end of last year. The firm exited 2019 with a strong liquidity position and solid balance sheet, which we appreciate.From 2017 to 2019, Insperity's annual free cash flows averaged a bit over $159 million, defining free cash flows here as net operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Its annual dividend obligations averaged a bit over $49 million during this period, and please note Insperity paid out a large special dividend ($1.00 per share) in 2017. In 2019, Insperity generated $149 million in free cash flow and paid out $49 million in dividends. To learn more about how to think about how important free cash flow is to dividend coverage, consider reading the book Value Trap.With that in mind, the firm has also repurchased a meaningful amount of its stock in recent years, share buybacks at times were partially funded by its balance sheet. From 2017 to 2019, Insperity's annual share repurchases averaged over $118 million and, in 2019, came out to over $203 million. Share repurchases compete with dividends for free cash flow, and given the pandemic, conserving cash and suspending share buybacks would be the prudent move, in our view.Going forward, Insperity's top-line and thus its cash flow generating abilities will come under pressure from the pandemic as demand for its services from SMBs dries up. Investors will get a better idea of the severity of that dynamic when the firm reports its first quarter earnings report for 2020 after the market closes on May 4. Additionally, we will see if management decides to suspend Insperity's share buyback program, at least in the short term. When the firm increased its quarterly payout back in February 2020, the company also expanded its share repurchasing authority, but times have changed materially since then.Insperity has yet to publicly update its 2020 guidance, but it is very likely the firm will be forced to give the deteriorating macroeconomic environment. Over the course of five weeks, over 26 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits as of the week ended April 18 as stay-at-home orders forced many businesses to close up shop (some temporarily, and some, unfortunately, will go under).While the $2.2+ trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ('CARES Act') is lending a helping hand to SMBs (largely through the payroll protection program, or PPP, provision), which was recently reinforced by the passage of another relief bill worth almost $0.5 trillion which added additional funds to the PPP, that may not be enough. The PPP offers loans and forgivable loans to SMBs through banks and other financial entities working with the Small Business Administration ('SBA'). Those loans can be used to cover payroll, rent, and utilities expenses. To become a forgivable loan, the small- and medium-sized businesses that receive those loans must retain their headcount (which in effect makes the loan a grant).However, many SMBs say the PPP isn't enough given the sharp downturn in the US economy and global economy at-large. When the US economy will begin to truly open back up remains to be seen, and it will be local and state governments making that determination (in terms of when to end stay-at-home orders). In our view, it won't be until a vaccine is discovered and made widely available that US households will stop ""cocooning"" in their homes.Some US states are already opening their economies back up; however, we caution that this risks another wave of infections as was the case back during the Influenza of 1918-1919, with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ('CDC') noting that the 1918-1919 Influenza came in three waves. For instance, President Trump mentioned that Georgia should reconsider the state's plan to reopen certain activities in late-April (such as spas, barbershops, beauty salons, and tattoo parlors), but that ultimately he would leave it up to Georgia (and US state governments in general) to decide their paths.As it relates to Insperity, the firm has a nice net cash balance and solid liquidity position to ride out the storm, but its business model and future financial performance will come under an immense amount of stress in the near term. Its top-line will come under pressure as many SMBs will be unable to keep paying for Insperity's services, and in the medium to long term, a lot of Insperity's clients may not make it through the storm without additional support from the US federal government. In 2019, Insperity generated over $4.3 billion in GAAP revenues, over $0.7 billion in GAAP gross profits, and incurred well over $0.5 billion in operating expenses. While the firm's capital expenditure requirements are relatively low, its corporate overhead could more than consume Insperity's gross profits should its top-line shift precipitously lower.Over the long-haul, management has laid out a strategy to grow Insperity's total addressable market ('TAM') through major initiatives including improving the way Insperity locates new leads as it relates to potential clients. Here's an excerpt from the firm's fourth quarter of 2019 conference call with investors:These efforts will need to contend with the negative dynamics of the ongoing pandemic, but improving its relationship with existing clients and growing its share of the pie through highly-targeted marketing/sales methods (even if the pie is currently shrinking in the near-term) should help improve Insperity's operational and financial performance over the long term.Shares of NSP have rebounded since hitting their mid-March 2020 lows but remain well below where they were trading in January 2020. The market wants to see how Insperity views its forward-guidance given the massive headwinds its client base is now facing, and whether its strong balance sheet and quality historical cash flow profile will be enough to protect the company's enlarged dividend."
4304680,40101,2019-11-08T17:31:30-05:00,"Insperity reported 2019 third quarter results on November 4th. It missed its own estimates on EPS and lowered full-year guidance.Market reaction resulted in shares losing over 50% from their high this year. While a reset may be justified, shareholders and potential investors shouldn't miss the forest for the trees.The majority of the contributing factors in the year-over-year comparisons do not warrant viewing Insperity as a low or typical growth company.","I don't ever want to miss the forest for the trees.SourceWhen Insperity (NYSE:NSP) reported third quarter results on November 4th and missed analysts' average estimates on earnings by so much, a staggering 26%, I had to wonder if I was indeed missing the forest for the trees.For the 2019 third quarter, Insperity, an HR solutions provider, reported revenue of $1.04 billion, 12.8% better than the 2018 third quarter. The average number of worksite employees paid per month (WSEE) grew 12% to 240,939 from 215,051 in 2018. For the first nine months of 2019, revenue has improved 13.2% to $3.24 billion on WSEE growth of 13.6%.Insperity's miss was on the bottom line. Adjusted earnings per diluted share declined 21.9% from $0.96 in the 2018 third quarter to $0.75. To date, for the year, diluted earnings are still registering a 16.7% increase in 2019, $3.57 per share compared to $3.06 in 2018. The company had guided for adjusted EPS in a range of $1.00 to $1.04 in the quarter. Analysts' average estimate was $1.01 per share.A few years ago, Insperity noted its true measure of growth was in the lower lines of the income statement.Though revenue grew nearly 13% in the third quarter, gross profit registered just a 2.7% increase. The culprit was a higher-than-expected benefit cost of approximately $18 million. On the outstanding share count, this equates to nearly $0.45 per share.In the past two quarters, Insperity has experienced an unusual number of occurrences of large medical claims (defined as $250,000 and above). The activity exceeding the company's expectations by approximately $27 million. Drilling down into the activity proved the randomness of the occurrences.But this wasn't the only ""tree"" worthy of focus in the report. Insperity also noted the growth of WSEEs is not pacing as it initially projected for the year. Initially, Insperity projected the average number of paid worksite employees per month would grow 14% to 16% to 238,400 to 242,600 with a midpoint of 240,500. Year to date, the average WSEE is 232,825.As a result, the company lowered its full-year expectation to a range of 235,700 to 236,300 reflecting growth of 12.7% to 13%. It is pertinent shareholders recognize this will still represent year-over-year growth at a double-digit clip and well within its long-term target of 10% to 15% annually.Insperity points at a combination of factors impacting its original expectations.The first factor Insperity noticed in the last quarter was there simply are not qualified applicants to hire.While this factor works against Insperity's WSEE growth metric, it does have the potential to benefit the company's hiring services.Second, Insperity, itself, had fallen behind in hiring and training BPAs (Business Performance Advisors) due to the tight labor market. In the second quarter, it reported the delay.In the third quarter, it finally caught up to its own needs.Third, Insperity developed a focused offering for a mid-market demographic in 2018. The company honed in on companies with 150 to 5,000 employees needing customized solutions. In July 2018, it closed its largest account in that segment to date. Obviously, this impacts the year-over-year comparisons.What is, again, pertinent for shareholders to recognize is the actual impact on growth.This combination of factors prompted the historically-conservative company to pare back its full-year guidance. Adjusted EBITDA was lowered to a range of $247 million to $253 million, and adjusted EPS was lowered to a range of $4.08 to $4.20. Initial guidance for the full year for adjusted EBITDA was a range of $268 million to $285 million and adjusted earnings were a range of $4.37 to $4.69 per share. After Insperity reported 2019 first quarter results, it bumped the adjusted EBITDA range to a range of $276 million to $289 million and adjusted earnings to a range of $4.55 to $4.80. The updated guidance now represents year-over-year growth of 3% to 6% in adjusted EBITDA and 9% to 12% in adjusted earnings.No doubt, the market was disappointed in Insperity's results. It was probably more disappointed in the full-year impact to guidance than in the actual third-quarter results since each factor impacting results sported a somewhat reasonable explanation.The share price has been sliding noticeably and has not yet settled. Insperity's share price closed at $107.67 on November 1st. It's dropped approximately 37% since reporting to less than $70 and set a new 52-week low on November 4th at $67.06.This slide follows a similar slide after second quarter results were reported. On July 26th, the stock closed at $144.63 per share. Shares then dropped as much as 38% to as low as $89.23 in the next few weeks.Since the beginning of the year, Insperity's share price has given up around 30%. From the high of the year, the price has given up nearly 54%. These resets are most likely focused on the multiple granted the company.Prior to 2019, Insperity's growth trends of the past four years were enviable. Even Insperity acknowledged such growth was worthy of a dose of hesitation.Prior to these resets, it was not unusual for the market to grant Insperity a multiple averaging greater than 25. Using the updated midpoint in the 2019 adjust EPS range of $4.14, at a share price under $70, the P/E ratio is less than 17.But the market is supposed to be forward-looking. And, Insperity offered an improving outlook for 2020.If Insperity grows the bottom line just 10% in 2020, the forward P/E ratio equates to less than 15.5. According to YCharts, the S&P 500 average forward P/E ratio is 18.18 based on IBES' S&P 500 2020 EPS growth estimate of 10% to 11%. Thus, the sell-off does appear overdone by nearly 20%.Insperity's own outlook for 2020 is bolstered by the results from its Business Outlook Survey. The survey responses reflected optimism.The survey also covered business concerns, and Insperity offers solutions geared directly at meeting some of these top concerns.Yet again, it is pertinent for shareholders to remember Insperity now has a broadened arsenal of solutions. Mentioned already, its mid-market solution targets businesses with 150 to 5,000 employees, and its Workforce Acceleration solution offers traditional employment services. The 2019 fall sales campaign represents just the second year of these solutions being offered.My investment club initially invested in Insperity in 2013, and we've long since recouped our original investment. The remaining shares continue to collect dividends that are then reinvested. Thus, though these price resets are alarming, they will not propel us into a paper loss scenario. In fact, for us, lower prices result in a larger accumulation of shares upon reinvestment.Still, just as the company is often awarded a rosy multiple on potential growth, Insperity's share price is often slaughtered on disappointing news. Activity following both the second and third quarters of 2019 exemplifies this type of market reaction.Insperity still targets growing its top line through the addition of paid worksite employees via its flagship service at a double-digit clip as well as its newer mid-market solution and traditional HR solution. A slowdown in its historical growth clip of 25+% may warrant a multiple reset. But it certainly does not warrant casting the company into a low or typical growth category.Shareholders and potential investors should not miss the forest for the trees."
4324823,40101,2020-02-17T23:30:00-05:00,"Insperity reported fourth-quarter and full-year results on February 11th. It also offered guidance for 2020. An uninspired market caused the share price to drop 50% off its 52-week high.Challenges in 2019 have proven to be pain points for the company. Insperity has already addressed or is in the process of addressing those it can.Its data science and analytics effort should be the most promising in 2020, as the results should improve efficiency and prove fruitful.","My investment thesis on Insperity (NSP) is not based on the short-term challenges being faced by the company, but rather on its long-term growth potential. But these short-term challenges have proven to be, without doubt, pain points for the company. From its high of $144.92 in July 2019, the share price has declined 50%.Insperity is now an HR solutions provider. Initially, it operated as a professional employer organization (PEO), a model still foreign to many. In a PEO model, the employee is “co-employed” by an administrative employer, such as Insperity, and the worksite employer. Under its PEO umbrella, the company offers human resource and business solutions, including recruiting, training, employee management, payroll, benefits administration, workman's compensation administration and retirement benefits management.To fuel its track record of double-digit growth, in early 2017, Insperity opted to expand its offerings for companies not interested in or not ready for a PEO model. It began development of a traditional HR service. By the 2018 second quarter, the offering had been branded Workforce Acceleration. Acceleration is defined as a “self-service, human capital management software bundle, plus professional HR support as needed”.Additionally, in 2018, Insperity developed a focused offering for a mid-market demographic. The company honed in on companies with 150 to 5,000 employees needing customized solutions.For each of its solution, Insperity focuses on selling to healthy and thriving companies. Its pitch encourages businesses focus on their core business and outsource the extraneous HR responsibilities. Insperity offloads the requirement to be well-versed and competent regarding employment laws, tax regulations, and government compliance. Especially for a small to medium-sized business, the idea of being able to focus on the core business while relying on a competent partner to handle administrative duties, is appealing. Plus, because of economies of scale, Insperity is able to offer more attractive benefits options than individual companies.On February 11, 2020, Insperity reported fourth-quarter and full-year results. Yet again, the company generated double-digit growth. For the quarter, revenue improved 11.2%, from $966.8 million in the 2018 fourth quarter to $1.08 billion in the same quarter of 2019. For the year, revenue climbed 12.7%, from $3.83 billion in 2018 to $4.3 billion in 2019.Gross margin declined 80 basis points to 17% for the year. As a result, the increase in gross profit for the year was only 7.5%, from $681.9 million in 2018 to $732.9 million in 2019.Additional headcount and the opening of nine new sales offices drove an 8.6% increase in operating expenses. This resulted in an operating income improvement of only 4.2%, from $179 million in 2018 to $186.6 million in 2019.An 18% smaller tax expense drove an 11.6% improvement in net income, from $135.4 million in 2018 to $151.1 million in 2019. As well, Insperity lowered its outstanding share count by repurchasing 2.1 million shares in 2019 at a cost of $203 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 10.7%, from $3.75 in 2018 to $4.15 in 2019.The company points beyond the top and bottom line to truly measure growth.At this level, for the full year, gross profit declined 4.8%, from $272 per WSEE in 2018 to $259 per WSEE in 2019. Operating income declined 7%, from $71 per WSEE in 2018 to $66 per WSEE in 2019.Despite the double-digit increases on its top and bottom line, the company faced significant challenge in 2019.In the last three quarters, Insperity experienced an unusual number of occurrences of large medical claims (defined as $250,000 and above). The total cost was approximately $37 million. Yet, its insurance carrier determined through multiple reviews the activity was indeed random.Insperity determined, had it not been for the extra costs from the large claims, it would have met its projection for adjusted EBITDA. Initially, the company projected adjusted EBITDA in a range of $268-285 million. After reporting first-quarter results, it bumped the adjusted EBITDA range to a range of $276-289 million. Including the extra costs, adjusted EBITDA totaled $250 million on the year.Another challenge was rooted in the growth of WSEEs, as it did not pace as initially projected for the year. At year end 2018, Insperity projected the average number of paid worksite employees would grow in 2019 to a range of 238,400-242,600. With third-quarter reporting, the company lowered its full-year expectation to a range of 235,700-236,300. The average number paid in 2019 was 235,547, barely missing the updated low end and 1.2% less than the initial low end of the range. It is pertinent to recognize the growth still represented year-over-year growth of 12.6%, well within Insperity's long-term target of 10-15% annually.A combination of factors impacted the expectation. First, Insperity noted there simply were not qualified applicants to hire. This same factor impacted the company's ability to hire its own BPAs (Business Performance Advisors).Yet, by the end of 2019, it had added 12% more trained BPAs.Also, despite tracking on volume, Insperity was unable to close as large an account in its mid-market business in 2019 as it did in 2018.Finally, its client attrition rose to 7.3%, 180 basis points above the 2018 mark. After analyzing the factors, Insperity determined mergers and acquisitions in its emerging growth and mid-market segments were the culprit for nearly half the difference. The next major factor related to cost or value. Approximately 60% of this group resumed operations in-house, while approximately 40% moved to competitors.Insperity reported its fall sales campaign was on track relative to goal through October. But November sales dropped off. Though the company extended the campaign through January, the timing meant sales were not closed until the 2020 first quarter. Ultimately, sales did recover, and even exceeded the campaign goals. The push should also benefit 2020 activity.Insperity began 2020 with a lower-than-expected starting point in paid worksite employees. Adjusted EBITDA is projected in a range of $250-274 million, compared to $250 million in 2019. Net income is projected in a range of $128-145 million, compared to $151.1 million in 2019. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected in a range of $3.73-4.16, compared to $4.15 per share in 2019.To address the risk of large medical claims, Insperity opted to add a new feature to its health plan. The company will no longer be responsible for reimbursing its insurance carrier on claim costs above $1 million in a calendar year on an individual participant. This will, at least, cap its exposure on large claims.M&A activity in its emerging growth and mid-market segments is not a factor the company can necessarily eliminate. And even though Insperity found the remaining attrition occurred in its “price-sensitive” or lower-priced clients, it intends to continue to focus on how to improve the retention rate by addressing the cost and value attrition factors.Insperity's goal for trained BPA growth in 2020 at 11% is lower than its 2019 growth of 12%. But the company's progress on data science and analytics should improve its sales efficiency.Insperity operates only 81 sales offices in the United States. It supports over 100,000 businesses employing over 2 million employees.The company estimates there are approximately 71 million employees employed in 7 million businesses with less than 5,000 employees. This would imply over 97% are available for pursuit. But it targets only healthy and thriving businesses.Using 20,000 specific and custom data points, Insperity's data science and analytics effort confirmed its total addressable market opportunity.No doubt, 2019 was a tough year for Insperity (and its shareholders), especially when compared to the previous four years. But growth does not come without a hitch here or there. The last year proved the company still has things to learn and room to improve, especially as it expands into the mid-market demographic.But 2019 also proved Insperity's model and processes do work. Adding the data science and analytics results to this should improve efficiency and prove fruitful. Thus, although the company is not expecting 2020 to show significant growth on the bottom line, 2020 should provide proof of the effectiveness of its focus.My investment club is a current shareholder, and we have long ago recouped our original investment. There's no need for us to give up on Insperity just as it establishes its footing before its next growth spurt."
4244420,40101,2019-02-27T08:15:00-05:00,"Insperity reported 2018 full-year results on February 11th featuring impressive double-digit growth on multiple metrics and offered conservative projections for 2019.In the 2018 fourth quarter, Insperity's board opted to repurchase shares rather than pay a special dividend as it did in 2017.Because of its ongoing growth potential, if Insperity's average multiple holds throughout 2019, shareholders should derive more return in share price appreciation than by receiving another special dividend.","This ancient proverb is worthy of contemplation as it relates to shareholder return.SourceWhen Insperity (NSP) reported record results on February 11th for 2018, prosperity abounded. Yet, this proverb immediately came to mind as I couldn't help but wonder if Insperity's shareholders were better served in the 2018 fourth quarter as compared to the 2017 fourth quarter.Traditionally, Insperity has operated as a PEO (professional employer organization) for small to medium-sized businesses. In a PEO model, the employee is “co-employed” by an administrative employer, such as Insperity, and the worksite employer.In early 2017, Insperity opted to expand its offerings for companies not interested in or not ready for a PEO model. It began developing a traditional HR service. By the 2018 second quarter, the offering was branded as Workforce Acceleration. Acceleration is defined as a “self-service, human capital management software bundle, plus professional HR support as needed”. Insperity highlighted the availability of Workforce Acceleration during its 2018 fall campaign.As well, Insperity developed a focused offering for its mid-market demographic in 2018. The company honed in on companies with 150 to 5,000 employees needing customized solutions.Insperity reaches potential clients through Business Performance Advisors (BPA). A BPA is responsible for account management from the initial sales cycle through support and maintenance. In 2018, the company expanded its BPA resources by 16%.In addition to its new offerings and resource expansion, the company also expanded geographically. In 2018, Insperity opened seven new sales offices across the United States.For the fourth consecutive year, Insperity delivered over 25% growth in its key metric, adjusted EBITDA. It also delivered double-digit growth across several metrics.Revenue improved 16% from $3.3 billion to $3.83 billion. The primary contributor to the revenue increase was the 14.5% increase on the average number of worksite employees paid per month (WSEE). The average WSEEs paid in 2018 was 209,123 as compared to 2017 at 182,696. Insperity's gross profit improved 19% from $572.7 million to $681.9 million.Insperity managed to decrease its operating expenses per WSEE per month in 2018. As a result, net income grew a staggering 60.4% from $84.4 million in 2017 to $135.4 million in 2018. Adjusted earnings per share of $3.75 increased 53% compared to $2.45 in 2017.Insperity considers adjusted EBITDA per WSEE per month as a key metric for measuring performance. It reflects the company's ability to manage expenses and set pricing. For 2018, adjusted EBITDA increased 34.8% from $177.7 million in 2017 to $239.6 million. From $54 in 2014, the adjusted EBITDA per WSEE per month metric has improved to $95 in 2018.Growth abounds on Insperity's horizon.There is still ample opportunity for expansion of its PEO services in the United States. Insperity estimates there are approximately 71 million employees employed in businesses with less than 5,000 employees. Only 4 million of these potential employees are co-employed by a PEO. This means 94% of this market is available for pursuit.As well, the mid-market and Workforce Acceleration offerings could still be considered in the infancy stage.Despite the potential, Insperity insists on maintaining a conservative stance. The phrase was reiterated seven times in the year-end earnings call.Insperity expects to employ 14.7% more BPAs in 2019. It plans to open nine more sales offices. Through this and organic growth, the average paid WSEEs per month metric is projected to grow 14% to 16% to 238,400 to 242,600 with a midpoint of 240,500. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to grow 12% to 19% in a range of $268 million to $285 million with a midpoint of $277 million. Adjusted earnings are projected to grow 17% to 25% in a range of $4.37 to $4.69 per share with a midpoint of $4.53.So, growth certainly remains on the horizon and it should be double-digit growth. When considering that old proverb about birds, it will also be pertinent to remember Insperity is purposely painting a conservative picture.Insperity's balance sheet is healthy with little debt. As the past two calendar years have wound down, the company has been fortunate to have opportunities to return additional value to its shareholders.In November 2017, Insperity's board approved several actions. In addition to the regular dividend, on December 18th, a special dividend of $2.00 per share was paid. Then, a stock dividend in the form of a 2-for-1 split was paid. Finally, an additional 500,000 shares were authorized on the company's stock repurchase program. The additional actions returned $41.7 million to shareholders or, per the proverb, put birds in their hands.But, in the fall of 2018, Insperity's board chose another option, one more akin to feeding the birds in the bushes.Though the market turmoil started in October for most companies, Insperity fared quite well at the onset. Shares closed at $117.95 on September 28th. For the next six weeks, shares dipped only as low as $103.21.But, on November 19th, shares dipped below the $100 mark. On November 30th, Insperity's board announced it had been repurchasing shares. Since October 1st, it had purchased 580,000 shares for $59.56 million at an average of $102.69 per share. By the end of the quarter, the company had bought another 406,409 shares for an additional $37.5 million. In total, 986,409 shares were repurchased in the quarter for $97.1 million at an average cost of $98.42 per share.Obviously, $97.1 million would have easily covered another special dividend of $2.00 on 41.55 million outstanding shares. But, the board opted, instead, to decrease the oustanding share count. Leading into the last quarter, the company had repurchased only 80,000 shares in the first three quarters. Comparatively, in 2017, Insperity had repurchased 901,000 shares. Perhaps the board felt compelled to “catch up” to a similar number in the last quarter of 2018. The cost of the 901,000 shares in 2017 was only $38.74 million for an average of $43.00 per share. The approximately 1.1 million shares repurchased in 2018 cost Insperity $113.3 million. In contrast, it distributed only $33.4 million in dividends to shareholders.The outstanding share count is now 40.9 million shares and is estimated to average 41.5 million for 2019. Based on Insperity's adjusted EPS projection, net income in 2019 can be estimated at approximately $188 million. Had Insperity paid a $2 special dividend in 2018 rather than repurchasing shares, the average outstanding share count in 2019 would more likely near 43 million. At that count, based on 2019 projected net income, the midpoint of the adjusted EPS range would be $4.38.Because of Insperity's impressive growth rates, the market has been valuing it the past few years based on an above-average multiple. It hovers at 25. But, of late, the multiple has topped 28. This means for every dime of adjusted earnings, the market typically values Insperity's shares at $2.50 and can value that dime by as much as $2.80. In that regard, the $0.15 difference calculated in the two EPS alternatives in the above table, should be worth between $3.75 and $4.20 in share price.So, if Insperity's average multiple holds throughout 2019, shareholders should derive a greater return in share price appreciation than they would have by receiving another $2 special dividend.The benefit could be even greater if the company's projections for 2019 are truly conservative. With its 2017 full-year results, Insperity originally guided for adjusted earnings per share in 2018 in a range of $2.96 to $3.08. As already mentioned, Insperity delivered $3.75 in adjusted earnings per share, a difference of $0.67 per share and nearly 22% more than the high end of its original range.Insperity need only be conservative by 5.5% in 2019 to bump the difference in adjusted earnings by one cent per share. And, for every one cent difference in earnings, at the average multiple, the difference in share price should increase by at least a quarter.When the difference in adjusted EPS reaches $0.16, at a multiple of 25, theoretically, the difference in share price should be $4.00. This difference represents a doubling of the bypassed $2 special dividend. There's usually outspoken advocates on both sides when debating whether a company should repurchase shares or distribute dividends. However, most investors would agree they'd rather a company not buy back shares when the share price is near its high.Without question, Insperity's purchase prices in 2018 were notably higher and in fact more than double the prices in 2017, $98+ compared to $43. Looking backward, the purchases would seem ill-advised.On the other hand, looking forward and considering the ongoing potential for double-digit growth, repurchasing shares under $100 will, most likely, end up being considered wise.As for its decision to forego the distribution of another special dividend, it is reasonable to believe Insperity's board determined the potential share price appreciation should be more valuable.When Insperity released full-year results and offered 2019 projections, the share price immediately spiked 19% to $132.00. Because of its growth potential, Insperity is probably worthy of an above-average multiple. As well, management is probably trustworthy in its assessment about being conservative with its 2019 projections. And, yet, the multiple Insperity has been trading at since the February 11th announcement seems lofty.Potential investors should watch Insperity on those days when the market pulls back to get in at a better price. But, first, they'll have to accept the notion that sometimes Insperity may decide to feed the birds in the bush."
4371863,20599,2020-09-01T02:42:12-04:00,"Outsourced HR services for small and medium-sized businesses in the US is still under-penetrated.H2-20 may see risks emerging such as collection and cancellation risks, higher costs and a general limbo on account of elections.Valuations are reasonable relative to history and the stock is currently on a good run but is close to resistance.","Optimism in the US services sector looks to have rebounded, as was evidenced by August’s services PMI number which was very strong, coming in at 54.8, the highest level it has reached over the last 17 months. Crucially, this also marks the first time the PMI has managed to cross the 50-mark, after 6 months of contraction. Insperity, Inc. (NSP) is a company that is well-positioned in the broad services space, offering specialized HR solutions to small and medium-sized businesses across the country. In my article, I will highlight some of the good and bad aspects of pursuing an investment in this stock. Let me first start with the good points.NSP is one of the established players in the US PEO industry (Professional Employer Organization), and the raison d'être of firms such as this is to play the role of a co-employer and help small and medium-sized business owners focus on their core operations, whilst they (PEOs) deal with various HR, legal and regulatory burdens. In essence, they help drive through greater productivity; as PEOs render services to a large number of employees, they engender significant economies of scale that allow them to perform human resource- related functions more efficiently and provide a greater variety of employee benefits. For instance, recently during the pandemic, NSP was able to help its clients cope with issues such as layoffs, PPP loan application and reporting, FICA deferral, WFH, return to work, etc. A small business with an in-house HR function would have found it challenging to deal with all these issues simultaneously.NSP’s target market - the small-to-midsize business employment market - remains severely under-penetrated (at only 5%) and will likely gain prominence with greater regulatory support. Currently, 42 states in the US have come out with legislative measures recognizing PEOs and their licensing.Source: NSPOne would think that in such a competitive and fragmented industry, there would be a lot of undercutting and price-cuts to gain business volume. Well, whilst NSP competes on quality, scope, and packaging of services with other participants, they certainly don't compromise on pricing, and despite this, they’ve still been able to maintain rather stellar client retention rates. Over the last two years, client retention has averaged c.85-86%, and most recently in Q2 when businesses were faced with dire consequences, NSP’s client retention rate came in at 99% (Source: Q2 earnings call). One key reason why clients stick with NSP despite a general obdurateness to not compromise on pricing is that the company provides a well-rounded, full-service approach, with a high level of service and tech personnel (staff support). Worth noting that over the last 3 years, their staff support ratio (corporate staff to Worksite Employees) was 52% higher than the industry average (NSP did not cut its support staff base in Q2, despite a 6% decline in worksite employees).As mentioned earlier, NSP is one of the most established and largest names in the PEO industry providing services to close to 9000 clients and enjoys wide market coverage across the nation. Besides, crucially, the company is also well-diversified across industries; no single industry accounts for more than 17% of their WSEE (worksite employee) base. This is particularly useful when catering to the small and medium-sized industry that often has to contend with volatile business prospects. In that sense, their operations feel rather well-hedged.Source: NSPSource: NSPNSP is also making serious inroads into the middle market (companies with an employee base of 150-5000), a market that remains grossly underpenetrated by PEOs in general. Last year, the average number of WSEEs (worksite employees) per month in their middle market sector increased 18.0% YoY, and currently accounts for about one-fourth of their total WSEE base. The sales cycle in this sub-segment takes a little longer to close, but the quality of clients and their credit profiles are better in this segment.Unlike some other small and mid-cap names that are overly leveraged, NSP's capital structure feels well-balanced. Whilst the company currently has a debt of c.$432m, it has always enjoyed a superior cash position (current cash position is $459m). Whilst the positive net cash position has declined over the last two years, it is worth noting that it has enjoyed a consistent net cash position for more than 10 years now. Not too many companies, let alone mid-caps, can boast of this.This healthy capital-structure is augmented by consistently generous returns to shareholders via both dividends and share repurchases. In H1-20, the company repurchased 728,000 shares and still has the firepower to repurchase another 685,833 shares as part of their repurchase program. At a time when a lot of companies have been cutting or canceling their dividends, NSP has increased its dividend in both Q1 and Q2 by 33% YoY (0.4 per share). At the current share price, the dividend yield works out to a rather attractive 2.36%.Having covered some of the potential benefits of an investment in NSP, let me now touch upon the potential risks associated with this story.Subscribers of The Lead-Lag Report would note that over the last month or so I’ve been attempting to gauge the solvency and liquidity profiles of the small business players. As you can see from the two separate survey results I’ve shared above, the outlook looks rather hazy and could go anywhere. Given the ongoing economic uncertainties, small and medium-sized businesses are at greatest risk, and may also question the merits of outsourcing their non-core operations when credit conditions remain difficult. NSP’s standard CSA (Client service agreement) for small businesses is rather precarious as it can be canceled with 30 days’ notice. In the case of middle-market clients, it is 2 years, and the replacement of middle-market clients will be even more challenging given the lengthy sales cycle.Also, consider that NSP may have to contend with collection issues. As part of the co-employment agreement that NSP shares with clients, NSP is responsible for the payment of the salaries and wages for work performed by WSEEs, regardless of whether the client pays NSP the associated service fee on the due date. Their DSO which only stood at 27 days 6 years back, has grown every year, and currently stands at about 40 days.Source: Compiled by the author using data from Seeking AlphaThen there’s the risk of the ongoing elections; NSP’s management did highlight that there tends to be a pause or hesitancy in decision-making during an election period; this could potentially stymie their sales growth initiatives in the coming quarters.In Q2-20, NSP posted impressive gross profit growth of 27% driven by benefits and workers' compensation costs that came in below expectations. This was mainly due to low utilization at the site, effective management of claims, and deferral in some of the elective healthcare spend. All these costs are likely to get pushed back into Q3 and Q4-20 which will impact the profitability.It’s quite troubling to note that with the exception of two small insider buying transactions last year, the majority of insider transactions over the last three years have been via insider sales. Crucially, the man at the helm of affairs - the Chairman & CEO of the firm - has led the insider sales, selling two large amounts this year - Paul Sarvadi cashed out for $3.6m in February and then followed that up with a $5.5m sale earlier this month.Source: GuruFocus NSP's current stock valuations are fairly reasonable relative to the industry and its historical average. The stock currently trades at a forward P/E of 21x which is a 16% discount to the sector median and a 15% discount to its 5-year history.On the charts, the stock has had a tough run for the last one year or so, trending lower via a descending channel and hitting the price levels of sub-$40 in March, which was also incidentally the previous breakout zone during 2016-2018. There has been some recovery since, and the current momentum is quite healthy, with the stock trading above its 200-DMA on the daily chart, and the 50-DMA crossing over the 200-DMA last week. That said, the stock is also quite close to hitting the upper boundary of the descending channel. I like NSP’s dominance in the PEO industry and productivity boost this industry can offer small and medium-sized businesses, but as I mentioned in my risk section, certain risks will likely crop up in H2 and this could keep the upside limited. I’m neutral.*Like this article? Don't forget to hit the ""Follow"" button above!"
4279171,40101,2019-07-30T16:03:51-04:00,"Insperity reported 2019 second-quarter results on July 29th. Revenue increased 13+% year over year. Adjusted earnings per share increased 22+%. The company reaffirmed double-digit growth for the full year.Because of two culprits, one that ultimately works to the company's advantage and one which is not likely to recur, Insperity's share price sold off by 36%.Alert investors should consider taking advantage of the sell-off. In recent years, the market has valued Insperity's double-digit growth on its top and bottom lines with a healthy multiple.As a result of the sell-off, the current valuation is anemic and not likely to last.","It's not the first time Insperity's (NSP) shares have sold off unreasonably. In fact, three years ago, the share price fell over 14% on heavy volume in reaction to healthy second-quarter earnings and a guidance update. Rather than trying to find the illogical culprit, it seemed much more appropriate to look forward.I concluded interested investors should consider purchasing shares below a split-adjusted price of $36.31. So, even after today's massive 36% sell-off, if one had purchased shares below that mark, their investment would have tripled.The culprits were easier to spot this time after the HR (human resources) solutions provider reported 2019 second-quarter results before the market opened. But, the sell-off ignored the silver lining. Because of Insperity's model, it performed well despite the two apparent culprits. As well, one culprit should actually fuel Insperity's growth.During the mid-morning earnings call, the sell-off was already underway and a point for discussion regarding share buybacks.By the end of the day, on heavy volume, Insperity's share price had fallen from $144.63 at market close on Friday, July 26th to $108.89.In its first-quarter report, Insperity projected the average number of paid worksite employees per month would fall in a range of 232,500 to 234,500, a year-over-year increase of 14% to 15%. It reported average WSEEs paid of 232,010, a 0.2% “miss” as compared to guidance. The company cited “lower than expected hiring in our client base”.But, it is imperative to note the setback was not due to a loss of customers or a lack of job openings. Client retention topped 99%. Rather, the culprit was actually a lack of qualified candidates for open jobs.It has become a job-seeker's market. Job-seekers find themselves able to pick from multiple opportunities while companies endeavor to compete. While the environment itself may appear to work against Insperity's targets, it actually highlights one benefit of outsourcing HR duties for small- and medium-sized employers.This driver to outsource helps explains how Insperity's new sales topped, at 101%, its forecast for the first half of 2019. Revenue in the 2019 second quarter improved 13.1% to $1.04 billion compared to 2018.Interestingly, Insperity, itself, is being challenged in this job market. Its growth is dependent on hiring additional personnel, specifically BPAs (Business Performance Advisors), to meet the increased outsourcing demand. As well, it intends to expand in five additional markets by the end of 2019 - Las Vegas, Chicago, Sacramento, New Jersey and Providence.This job market pressure is not expected to ease soon. In response, Insperity adjusted its guidance for the full year. Initially, it projected the average number of paid worksite employees per month would fall in a range of 238,400 to 242,600 by the end of 2019. It now projects the range will be 237,350 to 239,500.Since the WSEE metric is basically the company's unit of work, a lower number by year-end could certainly translate to a lower revenue estimate in the analysts' models. However, it should not be ignored, at the midpoint (238,425) of the range, the year-over-year growth will be still be in double-digits at 14%.Furthermore, Insperity has long encouraged investors to look beyond that top-line number, even in the 2016 second-quarter earnings call.Based on surveys in the PEO industry from 2015 to 2017, Insperity exceeded industry averages in both measures. Gross profit per WSEE exceeded the average by 140% and operating income per WSEE exceeded by 183%.Source: Author-created from company dataIt is imperative to recognize first-half numbers for 2019 are not indicative of full-year results. Gross profit and operating income per WSEE naturally adjusts with each subsequent quarter in the year.Source: Author-created from company dataThe second culprit in the results fueling the sell-off isn't actually evident in the numbers. Revenue is calculated by deducting WSEE payroll cost from gross billings. Payroll taxes, benefits and workers’ compensation costs are then deducted from revenue to determine gross profit. In the second quarter, the amount for payroll taxes, benefits and workers' compensation increased 13.3%, in line with the revenue increase of 13.1%. However, the amount actually included “higher than forecasted benefit costs”. The increased benefit costs were offset by lower workers' compensation costs.The increase in benefit costs was the result of “large” healthcare claim activity. To clarify, this meant claims for large amounts of $50,000 or more as opposed to a large amount of claim activity. In a typical quarter, Insperity reports large claims account for 18% to 20% of the activity level. In the second quarter, large claims accounted for 22% of the activity equating to an additional $15 million in costs. The company has determined the occurrence was simply random.In what can be interpreted as a vote of confidence in its assessment, Insperity tightened its full-year guidance for both adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. The company's original guidance at the end of 2018 for adjusted EBITDA was a range of $268 million to $285 million. After first-quarter results, the range was updated to $276 million to $289 million. Insperity narrowed the range to $278 million to $286 million with second quarter reporting. The midpoint represents a 17.7% increase over 2018 adjusted EBITDA of $239.6 million.Original guidance for full-year adjusted earnings at the end of 2018 was a range of $4.36 to $4.69 per share. After first-quarter results, the range was increased respectably to $4.55 to $4.80. With second-quarter reporting, Insperity narrowed the range to $4.59 to $4.74. At the midpoint of $4.67, earnings per share in 2019 would improve 24.4% over 2018's adjusted earnings of $3.75 per share.Alert investors should consider taking advantage of the sell-off, especially considering the second culprit is not likely to recur and the first ultimately works to the company's advantage.Insperity's guidance for adjusted EPS in the second quarter was a range of $0.81 to $0.86. Analysts had forecast it would report adjusted earnings of $0.83 per share. The company reported $0.83 per share in adjusted earnings, a 22% improvement year-over-year, despite the two impacts. The market may have missed the implication but CFO Douglas Sharp did not.A deduction of $15 million from benefits costs could have resulted in diluted earnings of nearly $0.95 per share compared to the $0.69 reported. Adjusted earnings per share would have topped $1.00 per share.Since 2014, Insperity has routinely traded at a multiple over 20. The market obviously values the company's long history of double-digit top and bottom line growth.SourceThe company is not backing off its goals and expects to continue to deliver double-digit growth in 2019 as well as 2020. Adjusted earnings of $5.41 per share in 2020 would account for the 2019 second quarter one-off in benefits costs and at least 10% growth.Since the market is forward-looking on its valuations, at a base multiple of 20, it could be argued fair value equates to $108 per share. Curiously, it's probably not a coincidence the stock closed in that range on July 29th.However, in the past five years, Insperity has rarely traded at a multiple as low as 20 and has delivered year-over-year adjusted earnings growth of at least 20%, in fact averaging 46%.Source: Author-created from company dataThis sell-off feels like a replicate. And, if that's true, it's not likely the market will linger at this level just as it hasn't in the past. Alert investors should take advantage."
4270232,40101,2019-06-14T05:15:10-04:00,"Insperity is one of few companies projecting double-digit growth for 2019, greater than 20% on the bottom line. In its first-quarter report, it even raised guidance.Certainly, threats of an economic downturn warrant reasonable assessment. Yet, Insperity and its clients are signaling optimism.The Insperity of today is, simply put, not the Administaff or Insperity of yesteryear.","Few companies are projecting double-digit earnings growth in this economy. For those few that are, it's not surprising when projections are met with a healthy dose of skepticism.(Source)Insperity (NSP) is one of the few projecting healthy growth under a veil of external doubt.For most of its existence, Insperity has operated a model still foreign to many as a professional employer organization (PEO). In a PEO model, the employee is “co-employed” by an administrative employer, such as Insperity, and the worksite employer. Under its PEO umbrella, the company offers human resource and business solutions, including recruiting, training, employee management, payroll, benefits administration, workman's compensation administration and retirement benefits management.Insperity has consistently focused its sales energy on healthy small and medium-sized companies. As displayed in this 2013 investor presentation, it profiled businesses based on risk and success criteria.Thus, Insperity eliminated 61% (40% + 35% of 60%) of its potential client base because they were classified as high-risk and/or struggling. This left only 39% of businesses, considered to be surviving, producing or thriving as well as medium- to low-risk.In early 2017, Insperity opted to expand its offerings for companies not interested in or not ready for a PEO model, yet still in its target market. It began development of a traditional HR service. By the 2018 second quarter, the offering had been branded Workforce Acceleration. It is defined as a “self-service, human capital management software bundle, plus professional HR support as needed”. Acceleration expands Insperity's reach substantially in its target demographic. The company has declared the offering a “game changer”.Additionally, in 2018, Insperity developed a focused offering for a mid-market demographic. The company honed in on companies with 150 to 5,000 employees needing customized solutions. This focus, too, enlarges Insperity's reach in its target market. Contracting mid-market clients should accelerate the company's historical growth rate.(Source)Each of Insperity's current solutions is rooted in a push for businesses to outsource and focus on their core business. The company offloads the requirement to be well-versed and competent regarding employment laws, tax regulations and government compliance. Especially for a small to medium-sized business, the idea of being able to focus on the core business while relying on a competent partner to handle administrative duties is appealing. Further, because of economies of scale, Insperity is able to offer more attractive benefits options than individual companies.Insperity's growth trends of the past four years are enviable. Moreover, it is not expecting any loss of momentum for 2019.Initially, the company projected the average number of paid worksite employees per month (WSEs) would grow 14-16% to 238,400-242,600, with a midpoint of 240,500.More paid worksite employees will generate more revenue. But the true measure of growth is in the lower lines of the income statement:Indeed, Insperity's initial guidance for the rest of the income statement reflected greater growth. Adjusted EBITDA was projected to grow 12-19% in a range of $268-285 million, with a midpoint of $277 million. Adjusted earnings were projected to grow 17-25% in a range of $4.37-4.69 per share, with a midpoint of $4.53.On May 2nd, Insperity reported 2019 first-quarter results. In line with its projections, the average number of paid worksite employees grew 15% year over year. Revenue for the quarter was $1.15 billion, an improvement of 13.7% over the first quarter of 2018. Adjusted EPS, though, jumped 40.4% year over year, from $1.41 in the first quarter of 2018 to $1.98 in the first quarter of 2019.With such a stellar performance, Insperity, normally conservative by nature, increased its full-year projections. The adjusted EBITDA range was bumped up from $268-285 million to $276-289 million. This now represents year-over-year growth of 15-21%. The adjusted earnings range jumped from $4.37-4.69 to a range of $4.55-4.80. Compared to $3.75 in adjusted EPS in 2018, this represents growth of 21-28%.Even Insperity acknowledges such growth is worthy of a dose of hesitation:After the company reported its impressive year-end results in February, one SA article warned about the risk of a slowing economy spelled danger ahead:The article referenced the inversion of yield curves in 2000 and 2006 leading to recessions. Thus, it is pertinent to review Insperity's actual performance in those two time frames.(Source: Author-created from company data)From 1999 to 2000, the average number of paid worksite employees per month grew 46.3%, from 42,479 to 62,140. The growth rate did slow in 2001 and 2002, but maintained a double-digit clip at 11.8% and 11.3% respectively. The WSE count did slip less than 3% in 2003 but resumed recovery in 2004. By 2005, double-digit growth was back on track. In hindsight, despite broader economic challenges, Insperity's average number of paid worksite employees per month doubled from 42,479 in 1999 to 88,780 in 2005.Likewise, the WSE growth rate in 2006 continued at a healthy, double-digit clip. It slowed slightly in 2007 and 2008 to 9.6% and 6% respectively, before slipping to a negative rate in 2009 and 2010. Positive growth resumed in 2011. Through this second instance of challenging conditions, Insperity's average number of paid worksite employees per month grew 31.6%, from 88,780 in 2005 to 116,839 in 2011.In both time frames, the greatest decline in the WSE metric was only 7%. However, Insperity's revenue growth fared far better. Year over year, revenue actually declined only once in the past 20 years. In 2009, it slipped just 4.1%, less than the WSE metric decline of 7%.(Source: Author-created from company data)Both metrics do appear to negate the thesis mentioned above. While the PEO industry may have been “hit hard”, Insperity's revenue and WSE metrics, while definitely impacted, were not “hit hard”. Furthermore, the impacts were felt years after the ""initial"" slowdown rather than “as soon as the economy started to slow down”.But as Insperity highlighted in 2016, it is the bottom line that truly matters. Adjusted earnings per share saw significant declines in 2002 and 2009.(Source: Author-created from company data)Prior to 2011, Insperity conducted business under the name Administaff. The culprit for the decline in earnings in 2002 to a loss of $0.11 per share, and the decline in the WSE metric in 2003 was detailed in the 2003 annual report.On the other hand, Insperity pointed directly at the challenging economy in 2009.Besides the WSE metric being less, benefits costs were higher.On the bottom line, Insperity's diluted earnings per share dropped 63%, from $1.79 in 2008 to $0.66 in 2009. The thesis that the company was “hit hard” due to economic challenges would be valid in 2009 in regard to the bottom line. However, again, the impact was not felt “as soon as the economy started to slow down”.Regardless of a historical review, the applicable question for potential investors is whether history could repeat itself. Of course, Insperity continues to list adverse economic conditions as a general risk to its business. At the worst, adverse conditions could result in reduced levels of employment, compensation, and benefits, as well as decisions to reduce or forego HR outsourcing services. Minimally, economic slowdowns could negatively impact the company's historical onboarding time frames.Yet, Insperity does not appear to be close to waving a caution flag.To reliably gauge a company's health and optimism, many recommend assessing its capital allocation strategy.Insperity began paying a dividend in 2005, though its yield is often thin. Still, it is notable that even through the financial crisis, from August 2008 to March 2011, Insperity did not cut or suspend its dividend rate but held it steady. Likewise, a dividend bump is considered a good indicator of a company's optimism regarding its business prospects. So, when the Board announced a staggering 50% increase in the dividend rate on February 28th, it would, sensibly, be considered a strong signal of confidence.As well, Insperity has an active share repurchase authorization and is actually quite active. The company repurchased 1.2 million shares during 2018 and another 230,000 shares in the first quarter of 2019. It is still authorized to repurchase 1.38 million shares under the program.Impressively, after both a dividend payment and share buybacks, Insperity had more cash on its balance sheet at the end of its first quarter of 2019, even when adjusted for the withholding for taxes and other payroll deductions.This shareholder-friendly strategy, reassuringly, is based on the company's anticipation of market opportunities. First, Insperity noted its clients were indeed still hiring in the 2019 first quarter.More importantly, as highlighted above, offering Workforce Acceleration and the mid-market solution, in addition to the traditional PEO services, means Insperity anticipates gaining a significantly greater market share. The first quarter of 2019 was already bearing signs of traction.And the traction continues into the second quarter. Insperity's client conference in April yielded anecdotal optimism.It's quite reasonable to keep an eye on the headwinds facing a company, especially the threat of an economic downturn. As well, it's been said the best predictor of future events is the past.However, the Insperity facing the next economic challenge is not the same company it was in 2000 or 2006. Not only has its geographical footprint expanded, but more importantly, its arsenal of solutions has been significantly expanded. For that matter, the company has even dropped identifying itself as a PEO.The Insperity of today is, simply put, not the Administaff or Insperity of yesteryear."
4244967,104340,2019-02-28T09:30:00-05:00,Insperity is a good company with good financial results.Insperity’s customers are small to mid-private businesses and greatly susceptible to economic slowdowns.Historically right now is not the time to buy.,"Insperity (NYSE:NSP) is a professional employer organization commonly referred to as a PEO. PEO’s provide HR services in the form of payroll management and processing, tax assistance and management of employee benefits for small to medium sized businesses with an emphasis on medium sized or middle market clients (150-5,000 employees). Insperity divides its services into Administrative Functions (such as payroll processing and unemployment management), Benefit Plans Administration (administering your HSA or other health plans), Insperity Premier (helps with onboarding employees and many other functions), Personnel Management, Employer Liability Management, Marketplace by Insperity (Now known as Insperity Perks at work and is an employee discount purchasing platform) and middle market solutions.Is on providing a productive and efficient product to its customers for both business owners, managers and employees to use. The platform has been praised for its intuitive nature and easy of use. This makes Insperity the choice of many medium sized businesses that are growing and need a great HR tool kit fast that won’t slow them down with implementation. This is the demographic that Insperity’s management believes has been historically ignored due to their ability to start their own HR department once they hit this size. Given Insperity’s history of profitability and client retention, it looks like their management is right.Only having one healthcare plan to pick from makes it simple for companies to manage, but it leaves a bad taste in mouth of the company’s employees. Many other PEO’s offer at least 3 or 4 options that employees can pick from. Not having options however allows for a more streamlined processes for getting new and current employees into Insperity’s HR systems fast and easy.Cost transparency can be hard to achieve for a PEO in general, but Insperity has suffered from this complaint for a while. The company has made progress changing this and moving forward for them it should not be a problem created by them, but rather employers struggling to understand how any PEO charges its clients.Requiring businesses to have a minimum of 5 employees might not sound like a bad thing, but it severely limits your clientele. While some competitors thrive on this demographic (JustWorks for example) Insperity isolates the sole proprietorship and small partnerships as a potential customer base. This does allow them to better focus on their middle market customers and keep providing the best solutions for their target market.Insperity just posted record revenues, gross profit, net profit and earnings per share beating expectations by 6% in earnings per share for Q4 2018. This is a 25% increase in earnings per share quarter over quarter and a 60% increase year over year.Gross margins have steadily increased from 16.7% in 2016 to 17.4% in 2017 and now are 17.8%. Revenue growth was 12.2% from 2016 to 2017 and this year is up 16%.The number of worksite employees (or WSEs) is a closely followed metric in the PEO industry as revenue is generated for each employee the customer has under their employment. An increase in WSEs can be driven by either existing customer’s growing their employee base or new customers coming onboard. In Q4 total WSEs increased by 17%, with WSEs from new sales increasing 36%.Insperity’s interest coverage ratio is down to 38.4 from 44.4 in 2016 however this is a far cry from the normal level of concern at 1.5. Insperity has increased their long-term debt to $144 million from $104.4 million in 2017. This appears to be a smart move as the company’s cost of equity is around 10.15% and it’s cost of debt is 3.8%. By increasing their debt but maintaining a healthy interest coverage ratio they lower their weighted average cost of capital without creating stress on the income or balance sheets. This does bring their debt to equity ratio from 1.57 to 1.86.Created by author from 10-KThe trend in Accounts Receivables-to-Sales ratio is however concerning, showing that customers are increasingly using credit to purchase Insperity’s services. However, due to the relative size compared to its revenue it’s not a red flag.This has also lead to an increase in days sales outstanding. Going from 34.15 days in 2016 to 38.2 days in 2018.After looking at the fundamental’s of Insperity’s line of business, it’s current customer retention rate (99% for this last earnings call with employee growth thus increasing its revenue) why is this company not a screaming buy?While the company is great, the stock is not for two reasons.In 6/08/2006 the yield curve officially inverted.3/20/2000 was the last time the yield curve inverted before a recessionAnd here’s where we are today.The yield curve has not officially inverted yet because it wasn’t the 10-year treasury that inverted. This is not a real inversion as defined by the signal for American recessions. This would be the 2-year crossing over the 10-year. However, any short-term yield rates going above long-term rates is a bad sign for the U.S. economy as borrowing costs get worse for companies and unemployment rates start to increase.Created by author using data from Front page | U.S. Department of the TreasuryTaken from Bureau of Labor Statistics DataTaken from Bureau of Labor Statistics DataTaken from Bureau of Labor Statistics DataWhile it’s impossible to find the exact inflection point of the economy, we are at dangerous heights as the unemployment rate hits record lows and the yield curve becomes less flat and trends to become inverted.Insperity is a good company that has good financials and a promising short-term future. However, historically it, along with the rest of the PEO industry, are hit hard as soon as the economy starts to slow down. There are no red flags currently to drop or short sell however, buying right now does not seem to be a good decision historically for a long-term holder."
4174883,40101,2018-05-16T21:20:10-04:00,Insperity has seen robust growth and share price appreciation since activist shareholders started applying pressure in 2015.The company managed to complete its five-year plan (established in early 2015) in just three years.The hardest thing about evaluating a stock jetting upward is whether it will continue to fly or whether it will fall.,"As the steward for my investment club's portfolio, I've taken on the responsibility for tracking the progress (or lack thereof) in each investment and staying abreast of news on the companies. I'm more likely to spend time trying to reconcile why an investment isn't working out the way we anticipated rather than why another succeeded. For the investments that are tracking as planned or ahead of plan, I've been known to fan the flames (yes, I'll literally fan my laptop screen as if it could possibly make a difference) as I scroll right past. But every now and then, a successful investment will spring ahead so quickly that it's worth a closer look.Such is the case for Insperity (NSP), a human resources solutions provider that historically specialized in PEO solutions.My club first invested in Insperity five years ago. At the time, the company's long-term objective was to be “the dominant player in a thriving PEO industry, serving the top 10% of the small and mid-sized business community.”A PEO is a professional employer organization. In a PEO model, a resource, the human, is “co-employed” by an administrative employer, such as Insperity, and a worksite employer, the small to mid-sized employer. This allows the worksite employer to focus on its core business, the employee to be better served from an HR perspective and the administrative employer to bundle services for multiple businesses at competitive prices for both employee and employer.By narrowing its focus to the top 10% of the small to mid-sized business community, Insperity was avoiding high-risk and struggling companies. It only pursued those clients that fit its business model. The plan was working. In the fifteen years from 1997 to 2012, Insperity grew revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 17%, an impressive feat considering the CAGR included the impact from the financial crisis. Like many companies, Insperity was dramatically impacted in 2009 and 2010. But, by 2011, its business had recovered.In 2013, things stalled. Revenue growth dipped and, then, flat-lined in 2014. In response, Insperity's share price lost traction.SourceIn early 2015, activist shareholders put on the pressure. Despite one activist looking for Insperity to be acquired, the company continued to stand alone and things did change. By the spring of 2016, the activist began unloading its position.In the following eighteen months, the share price climbed to over $100. In December 2017, Insperity executed a 2-for-1 stock split. This was actually ironic as the company had been aggressively buying back shares, retiring approximately 15%. Now, less than six months later, the share price is again flirting with $90. And, Insperity continues to repurchase shares.Headed into 2015, Insperity focused on a five-year improvement plan. It actually managed to complete all the objectives in just three years. By the end of 2017, Insperity was sitting on wealth it was intent on distributing to shareholders.Insperity added almost $1 billion in revenue, specifically $942 million, in the three years from 2015 through 2017. Its adjusted EBITDA had grown 31%, 28% and 26%, respectively. The end result was adjusted EBITDA had almost doubled from $84 million at year-end 2014 to $177.7 million at year-end 2017. Adjusted diluted EPS had more than tripled from $0.72 at year-end 2014 to $2.45 at year-end 2017 (adjusted for December 2017 split).Besides doubling the number of outstanding shares in December 2017, the company also paid a special dividend of $1.00 per share (after the split or $2 before). The company's regular dividend had already been bumped in early 2017 from $0.25 per share quarterly to $0.30 per share quarterly. When all was said and done, shareholders holding through the whole of 2017 received $3.15 in cash and ended up with double their share count.The company credited several ingredients of its recipe for its success.Insperity expanded several ways in the past three years.Geographically, the company expanded into additional markets, including Fort Lauderdale, Indianapolis, Milwaukee and Bellevue. Even more importantly, as evidenced below, there is still plenty of room to branch out. In 2018, five new sales offices are slated to be opened.SourceIn the first quarter of 2017, Insperity expanded its business offering. The company introduced a traditional HR service dubbed Workforce Administration. By any standard, this could be seen as ironic. The company looking for perfect-fit clients would now serve clients who weren't a perfect fit.This traditional offering serves to capture those companies who don't feel ready for a PEO or co-employment model.During the fall of 2017, in a pilot approach, Insperity offered both its traditional PEO model, Workforce Optimization, and the traditional HR model, Workforce Administration, side-by-side to potential clients. Offering both options upfront to the client not only highlights the differences between the two programs but also highlights the difference between selecting Insperity compared to going it alone or opting for another service firm.SourceConsulting with this expanded field of clients are an expanded number of BPAs. At year-end 2017, the company had 470 employees in the role. Business Performance Advisors are responsible for account management from the initial sales cycle through support and maintenance. Insperity believes the BPA role is a critical key to growth. Years ago, Insperity found its training and a year's worth of experience are the difference-makers.The charts below highlight the impact of that experience.Source: Author-created from company dataSource: Author-created from company dataAssuming trained BPAs with a year's experience do indeed tip the scales in Insperity's favor, the next five years should see marked improvement. The company expects to add 14%, approximately 65, to its BPA count in 2018. At the end of the 2018 first quarter, the count was up to 500 total BPAs. Their productivity should be evident throughout 2019. Adding another 10% to the headcount in both 2019 and 2020 could mean Insperity's gross profit approaches $1 billion in 2021.Source: Author-createdAlthough introduced and tested throughout 2017, Insperity has not truly rolled out Workforce Administration for traditional employment solutions with full press marketing.Even with its “dipping a toe in the water” approach, the solution is already selling. Insperity anticipates a subset of Workforce Administration clients will eventually transition to Workforce Optimization users.It's natural to have some apprehension about Insperity's ability to support the addition of such a substantial program. In the 2018 first quarter, its sales efficiency was actually higher. But, more time is needed to measure factors such as sales efficiency, profitability and retention.The average number of worksite employees Insperity paid per month in 2017 was approximately 183,000. The company expects 13-14% growth in that number in 2018 or a range of 206,400-208,400.Insperity estimates its total addressable market at 70.2 million worksite employees in companies staffing from 5 to 5,000 employees. When it offered a solution only for co-employment, that TAM shrunk to less than 4 million employees. Insperity's TAM now expands based on geography and its trained BPA count.Insperity is finally seeing the companies in its addressable market finally starting to hire. But, it is cognizant those available for hire in the workforce may not be qualified for the positions opening up. As such, even though demand may increase, supply may fall short and competition for qualified employees may intensify. Because Insperity can provide “big company” benefits to small and mid-market employers, those employers can be positioned to win those battles.The hardest thing about evaluating a stock jetting upward is whether it will continue to fly or whether it will fall.With Insperity crossing this threshold toward such expansive growth, it certainly could be argued its share price appreciation of 50% since the 2-for-1 split in December is justified.After adjusting the forward P/E ratio for the company's cash store of nearly $9 per share, based on recent share prices near $90, the ratio does top 20. But, based on its growth prospects, it could be argued such a ratio is justified.Dividend growth investors could be impressed with the latest 33% bump. But, Insperity's yield is still less than 1%. Along those lines, it would be unfair to overlook the shareholder friendliness of Insperity's special dividend and stock split last December. But, that cannot be expected every year.As well, the 40% growth Insperity is projecting for 2018 over the 2017 adjusted EPS of $2.45 should not be modeled going forward. The midpoint of the $3.36-$3.44 range is $3.40. But, $0.22 of the gain is a one-time benefit of tax reform.For both growth and income investors, Insperity is now priced at a point where it makes justifying a new investment difficult. Potential investors wanting to initiate a position should consider waiting on at least a 10% pullback.There are risks to this approach and they are very real risks. Insperity's Workforce Administration platform could explode in popularity. As its training is honed, the company could find newly-hired BPAs reach peak productivity in less than a year. Additional opportunities to expand geographically could present. And, small to mid-sized companies eager to expand their workforce may find the benefit offerings in Insperity's co-employment solution tip the scale to their favor.When it all comes together at once, the impact is akin to striking a match."
4193628,40101,2018-08-02T10:48:07-04:00,"Insperity reported 2018 second quarter results on August 1st. Across the board, there was double-digit growth - as much as 76% on one metric.More impressively, this is the 13th quarter for double-digit growth in the company's key metric - average number of worksite employees paid per month.The company is projecting this double-digit growth will continue through 2018 and into 2019.There are reasons to believe Insperity will reward shareholders with another special dividend or a significant dividend rate increase.","As Insperity (NSP) flirted with a $90 share price in May, I recommended potential investors wanting to initiate a position consider waiting for at least a 10% pullback. Yes, I qualified the approach as very risky.Needless to say, the share price tipped $90 the day after the article was published on May 16th and, by month-end, never looked back. On July 25th, the share price broke the $100 mark for the first time since Insperity executed a 2-for-1 stock split in December 2017.In its first quarter earnings call, the company, itself, had likened its potential to striking a match.With its second quarter reporting on August 1st, the human resources solution provider poured fuel on the flame.(Source)Offering both its traditional PEO (professional employer organization) model, Workforce Optimization, and the traditional HR model, Workforce Administration, revenue increased 16% over the same quarter in 2017 to $922.3 million.The average number of worksite employees paid per month in the quarter increased 13% year over year and exceeded the high end of the company's expectations. Double-digit growth is always impressive. But it's even more impressive that this is the 13th consecutive quarter of such growth. The first quarter of 2015 was the last quarter to post single-digit year-over-year growth in average number of worksite employees paid per month.This client growth was supported by the company's ramp in trained BPAs (Business Performance Advisors). And, client retention exceeded 99% in the quarter. Adding another feather to its cap, Insperity added the largest client in its history, with approximately 29,000 employees.Further, Insperity expects the trend of double-digit growth to, at the very least, continue through the remainder of 2018 and into 2019.Some of the growth can be attributed to economic improvement domestically. Insperity saw definite signs of improvement in the labor market in the United States. It even commented that the supply of employees is experiencing limitations.But Insperity likely would have grown regardless as it expanded its addressable market to include ""mid-market"" businesses. This market, businesses with 150 to several thousand employees, enables growth in the average number of worksite employees paid per month metric without adding Business Performance Advisors. In the past, Insperity helped a client grow to mid-market status only to then lose it to in-house operations. With a mid-market offering, this ""penalty"" is alleviated.Even more impressive than its top-line growth were the increases in net income and earnings. Net income improved over 75% year over year to $24.56 million. Diluted EPS improved nearly 76% year over year to $0.58. Adjusted EPS totaled $0.68, a 66% increase compared to the 2017 second quarter.For the first six months, revenue totals $1.94 billion, net income totals $74.6 million, and adjusted earnings per share total $1.77.Obviously, this bottom-line improvement is being spurred from more than top-line growth. Insperity's adjusted EBITDA has improved at least 25% for four consecutive years. On a per worksite employee per month basis, operating expenses actually declined year over year. Like many companies, Insperity is also benefiting from tax reform.With six months of production on the books, Insperity raised its full-year guidance for 2018. It now expects a 42.4% to 44.1% improvement in adjusted EPS compared to 2017. Adjusted earnings per share in 2017 were $2.45 meaning the 2018 range equates to $3.49 to $3.53. Tax reform is providing a one-time benefit of $0.22. For the six months to date, adjusted EPS total $2.09, a 57.1% improvement over 2017. At this updated range for the full year, adjusted EPS will have more than tripled in three years.Insperity also confirmed it expects to expand geographically in 10 to 12 greenfield locations in the next few years.On July 23rd, Insperity announced its latest greenfield opening in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Known as a ""flyover"" state, Oklahoma and its capital city of Oklahoma City, it may seem this locale would offer little opportunity to Insperity. But a closer look reveals otherwise. If every upcoming greenfield location is comparable, the company's perception in identifying opportunities should be considered advantageous.Oklahoma is traditionally a red state. It will be electing a new governor in November. The leading Republican candidate is Mick Cornett, former mayor of Oklahoma City.In his four terms as mayor (the only OKC mayor to be elected four times), Mr. Cornett is credited with the creation of nearly 10,000 new businesses in OKC and 100,000 new jobs. He is also credited with bringing the NBA's Thunder to OKC. During his tenure, the city became the 12th fastest-growing city in the United States. Since the financial crisis in 2008, Oklahoma City's unemployment rate has been lower comparatively, its downturn was less severe and its recovery faster. If Mr. Cornett is elected in November, it would be reasonable to expect his business-friendly demeanor to spread across the state.But, in this traditionally red state, electing the leading Republican candidate will not be a given in 2018.The biggest influence in Oklahoma's November election will likely be the state's educators. On April 2nd, educators walked out for nine school days. Despite media claims that teachers were not satisfied with an increase received just prior to the walkout, the real reasons for the action were numerous and received far less attention. Teachers and school support staff did receive a salary increase, but it was a partial increase compared to the proposal sent to lawmakers in December 2017. Oklahoma educators' salary schedule had not changed in over a decade. Their pay ranked 49th in the nation and last in the region.Further, the increase lawmakers offered was not fully funded. A pay increase did not address the need for additional teachers to relieve overcrowded classrooms. Funding for students was also not addressed. In education circles, Oklahoma was known for its repeated cuts to its education budget. Within a few days of passing the increase, lawmakers even repealed some of the funding it had just passed.The walkout, by design, coincided with Oklahoma's deadline to file to run for state office. When educators hit the brick wall of Oklahoma's legislators, the walkout theme turned to the upcoming election. If lawmakers wouldn't communicate and interact, they'd be targeted for replacement in November. The number of filers over the three-day period in mid-April set records, and many of those filing were teachers.There are two factors at play in Mr. Cornett's favor - 1) his mother was a teacher and 2) he kept his mouth shut during the walkout as compared to current governor Mary Fallin who alienated educators at every turn. And, yet, Mr. Cornett is facing headwinds. First, he still must win the party's nomination and faces a run-off on August 28th against Kevin Stitt. Then, Oklahoma educators and education supporters may opt to vote for the Democrats' candidate, Drew Edmondson, in November.On one hand, regardless of the upcoming election, Oklahoma City's growth over the past decade offers Insperity opportunity. But, realistically, from Insperity's viewpoint, a Republican party win with Mr. Cornett in November would be an ideal scenario for its newly-opened office.In mid-May, it seemed a down day in the market may offer potential investors an opportunity to establish a position. But that did not happen.Again, the company is firing on all cylinders - productive BPAs, geographic expansion, a growing labor force - and its share price reacts accordingly. After releasing second quarter results before market open, the price appreciated over 10% and closed at $105.55 on August 1st.There are very few times when it's wise to chase a stock. Yet, Insperity is a great company to own.Its dividend yield, at less than 1%, is paltry because of its rapid share price appreciation. But there's ample room for the dividend rate to improve. In 2017, Insperity bumped its dividend 20% and paid a special dividend as well as executed a 2-for-1 split. So far in 2018, Insperity has bumped its dividend 33%.The company's average payout ratio in the past four years nears 60%. Yet, the payout ratio in 2018, based on a dividend rate of $0.80 and the midpoint of the adjusted earnings projection at $3.51, would be less than 23%.There are reasons to believe Insperity could pay another special dividend at the end of 2018. After the first six months, Insperity's adjusted cash balance (exclusive of federal and state income tax withholdings, employment taxes and other payroll deductions, as well as client prepayments) is over $110 million. Furthermore, the double-digit growth remaining on the horizon should build Insperity's cash position. With approximately 41 million shares outstanding, it certainly appears there will be ample cash to execute another special payment.Or, there's viability for Insperity to double its dividend rate in 2019."
4206628,40101,2018-09-17T09:01:26-04:00,"Insperity snapped the last piece of its Workforce Acceleration puzzle into place on August 22nd when it announced an agreement with Mylo.With and through Mylo, Insperity will offer brokered benefits as well as business insurance to clients choosing traditional HR services through Acceleration.The traditional PEO will now accelerate its marketing of Workforce Acceleration program to small- and medium-sized businesses. Acceleration significantly expands Insperity's TAM.","When working a jigsaw puzzle, have you ever noticed there always seems to be one or two key pieces you just can't seem to find at the right time? That's probably exactly what leads to a feeling of accomplishment when a puzzle comes together. Insperity (NSP), a leading human resources solution provider, just snapped a key piece into place on its latest puzzle.Insperity has been a rapidly-growing PEO (professional employer organization) for small- to medium-sized businesses since it began in 1986. In a PEO model, a resource, the human, is ""co-employed"" by an administrative employer, such as Insperity, and a worksite employer, the small- to mid-sized employer. This allows the worksite employer to focus on its core business, the employee to be better served from an HR perspective and the administrative employer to bundle services for multiple businesses at competitive prices for both employee and employer.Insperity estimates the TAM (total addressable market) of companies staffing from 5 to 5,000 employees at approximately 71 million employees. It also estimates only 5.5% are served by a PEO. It originally narrowed its focus to the top 10% of companies to avoid high-risk and struggling companies.In the four years from 2014 to 2017, both Insperity's average number of worksite employees paid per month and total revenue grew over 40%. Since 2015, diluted earnings per share more than doubled.In the first quarter of 2017, the company decided to expand its business offering and introduced a traditional HR service, Workforce Administration. This traditional offering would serve to capture those companies not interested in or not ready for a PEO or co-employment model. Acceleration significantly expands Insperity's TAM.Though it tested throughout 2017, Insperity had not truly rolled out Workforce Administration with full press marketing.In the 2018 second quarter, Insperity rebranded the offering as Workforce Acceleration. Acceleration is defined as a ""self-service, human capital management software bundle, plus professional HR support as needed"". The options include payroll and tax administration, time and attendance processing, HR administration, onboarding, performance management and employee-related compliance support. And, in the 2018 second quarter, Insperity added its last key puzzle piece to the solution - brokered benefits management.SourceFor its co-employed worksite employees, Insperity provides insurance and benefits through a variety of vendors including UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Chubb (CB). United provides group health insurance coverage. Chubb provides workers' compensation coverage.But Workforce Acceleration presents a different situation with unique needs. For this program, Insperity is partnering with Mylo, a division of Lockton Companies, to provide brokered benefits such as group health, home, auto and individual health insurance as well as business insurance.Mylo provides access to ""a wide range of policies from top-rated carriers"". Insperity's business relationship with Lockton is not new. In a client story featured on Lockton's company website, Insperity highlights its reliance on Lockton:That ""issue"" arose when Insperity opted to meet the needs of small- to medium-sized businesses partnering with the solutions provider for traditional HR services.This particular agreement exists between Mylo and Insperity's Insurance Services. This segment of Insperity operates in all 50 states. It assists Insperity clients in finding customizable but affordable insurance coverage.Even before the Mylo agreement was in place, Insperity was able to conceive this new puzzle's image. In the 2018 first quarter, it was already reporting acceptance of the new offering.In the 2018 second quarter, Insperity adjusted pricing and still saw success.It is worth repeating that Insperity just labeled the program as ""fully ready for roll-out"". Its business performance advisors (BPAs) have been challenged.Insperity has not seen a dent in its sales efficiency to date by having the BPAs offer both programs. Offering both options to the client at the onset not only highlights the differences between the two programs but also highlights the difference between selecting Insperity compared to going it alone or opting for another service firm.SourceInsperity anticipates a subset of Workforce Acceleration clients will eventually transition to its PEO offering, Workforce Optimization. In reverse, it can now offer clients shifting away from co-employment traditional services through Workforce Acceleration.Insperity is hardly in a rut. In 2018, for the full year, the company expects to increase adjusted EPS by 42.4% to 44.1% year-over-year to a range of $3.49 to $3.53. Through the first half, it has improved adjusted diluted EPS 57.1% from $1.33 to $2.09.But 2018 will be but a springboard. It should not be overlooked how significantly Workforce Acceleration can expand Insperity's reach into its marketplace. Of the 5.5%, or 4 million, served by a PEO, Insperity estimates it will serve an average range of 213,700 to 215,600 monthly. Further, even if limiting itself to the elite 10% of small- to medium-sized businesses, the potential employee count impacted would inflate to over 7 million; over 14 million at 20% and nearly 18 million at 25%.Alert shareholders will want to track Insperity's progress with Workforce Acceleration in the last half of 2018 as the company ""pushes the pedal down"". But it will likely be 2019 before the company shares actual numbers on the program.That's now the missing puzzle piece for analysts and shareholders...where ""missing"" means ""not apparent"" rather than ""disappeared"". It will assuredly snap together soon enough."
4221689,40101,2018-11-13T11:04:45-05:00,"Insperity reported third quarter results and updated full-year guidance on November 1st. For the fourth consecutive year, adjusted EBITDA growth should exceed 26% and may reach 33% in 2018.
        In its fall campaign, Insperity will be pushing its latest solution, Workforce Acceleration, designed to meet the needs of small to midmarket businesses not ready for co-employment.
        Conservatively, the company is confident it will achieve double-digit growth again in 2019.","In its latest earnings call, Insperity (NSP) CEO, Paul Sarvadi, encouraged analysts to validate the potential of its latest solutions offering.Traditionally, Insperity has operated as a PEO (professional employer organization) for small to medium-sized businesses. In a PEO model, the employee is “co-employed” by an administrative employer, such as Insperity, and the worksite employer.The company's growth has been spurred by geographic expansion and resource expansion through the recruitment and development of Business Performance Advisors (BPA). A BPA is responsible for account management from the initial sales cycle through support and maintenance. Years ago, Insperity found its training and a year's worth of experience were difference-makers relative to a BPA's productivity.Through the third quarter of 2018, Insperity had opened six new sales offices and hired and trained 16% more Business Performance Advisors compared to the 2017 third quarter. In its core segment, new sales accounted for a 26% increase in the average number of worksite employees.In early 2017, though its growth potential was not slowing, the company opted to expand its offerings for companies not interested in or not ready for a PEO model. It began developing a traditional HR service, Workforce Administration. Insperity tested Workforce Administration throughout 2017.In the 2018 second quarter, the company added brokered benefits management to the solution and rebranded the offering as Workforce Acceleration. Acceleration is defined as a “self-service, human capital management software bundle, plus professional HR support as needed”. The options include payroll and tax administration, time and attendance processing, HR administration, onboarding, performance management and employee-related compliance support. Brokered benefits management was the last key piece needed to round out the offering.Insperity's 2018 fall campaign will highlight the availability of Workforce Acceleration. BPAs have a green light to push the service.In the third quarter earnings call, Mr. Sarvadi verbalized key information relative to the offering's potential.So, Insperity's BPAs convert approximately 8-1/2% of sales calls to potential customers. That means a glaring 91+% of small to midmarket businesses representing over 67 million employees are potential candidates for another solution. “Running these numbers” should indeed illuminate the potential.Year-to-date revenue through the third quarter of 2018 is $2.86 billion. This compares to $2.47 billion through the first three quarters of 2017 and $3.3 billion for all of 2017. To date, year-over-year revenue growth equals $388 million. It should equal approximately $490 million for the full year.The growth in revenue is not wholly generated from new sales. Wage increases and the like do contribute a small portion. For example, in the 2018 third quarter, the average pay for comparable employees grew 4% compared to 2017.But, if 3,000 new sales would have generated the whole of the $490 million in additional revenue, the average Workforce Optimization sale would be worth around $163 thousand. Using the factor of 1/3 to ½, a Workforce Acceleration sale could be worth $53.9 thousand to $81.6 thousand. And, if the ratio of Workforce Acceleration sales to Workforce Optimization sales is 2 to 1, annual revenue potential would equal $323 million to $490 million.Running the numbers using the average number of worksite employees (WSEE) metric should validate the potential. Through the 2018 third quarter, WSEE was 204,895 as compared to 180,424 through the 2017 third quarter. Thus, year-over-year growth is 24,471 worksite employees. Insperity's guidance for average WSEEs for the full year of 2018 is 208,300 to 209,200. This compares to the 2017 average of 182,696 for the full year and would make year-over-year growth approximately 26,000 employees. Based on approximately 3,000 sales, the average number of worksite employees per sale equates to 8.7. Insperity's average revenue per WSEE per month is $1,552. If Insperity's BPAs can generate 6,000 sales of Workforce Acceleration at average revenue per WSEE per month in a range of $517 to $776, additional revenue for a year would equate to $324 million to $486 million. The estimate aligns with the revenue projection.Insperity considers adjusted EBITDA per worksite employee per month as a key metric for measuring performance. It reflects the company's ability to manage expenses and set pricing. From 2015 to 2017, Insperity's growth in adjusted EBITDA exceeded 26% annually. For 2018, the company expects adjusted EBITDA to grow 33%. The adjusted EBITDA per worksite employee per month metric improved from $54 in 2014 to the current projection of $95. Insperity is hardly backing off the adjusted EBITDA growth trend.Adjusted earnings per share through the third quarter of 2018 equal $3.06. For the year, Insperity is now projecting adjusted earnings to range from $3.69 to $3.73 per share. In 2017, adjusted EPS totaled $2.45. Thus, at the midpoint, adjusted EPS will have increased $1.26 per share.In formulating an impact to adjusted earnings relative to selling the Workforce Acceleration solution, it is pertinent to remember the employees are already on board, the time and effort is already being expended. The initial contact will be structured to “explain both options right up front and then slot them into the right option that's best for them”.In the 2018 third quarter, with net income at $35.7 million and revenue at $925.13 million, net income margin equals 3.86%. For the first nine months of 2018, net income margin is 3.82%. Considering Workforce Acceleration sales should grow without corresponding increases in expense, Insperity should experience net income margin improvement. The company has already seen a similar impact related to its midmarket initiative.Nevertheless, at current net income margins, on additional revenue of $323 million to $490 million, net income should increase $12.4 million to $18.8 million. With 41.5 million shares outstanding, adjusted earnings would improve in a range of $0.30 to $0.45 per share.With its third quarter results, Insperity updated its 2018 full-year guidance. First, it raised the low-end of its range for WSEEs from 207,400 to 208,300 for a year-over-year increase of at least 14%. The adjusted EBITDA range improved from $225 million to $229 million to a range of $236 million to $238 million. Thus, year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA will grow at least 33%. Its projection for adjusted EPS was upgraded $0.20 on both ends from a range of $3.49 to $3.53 to a range of $3.69 to $3.73, now equating to year-over-year improvement of at least 50%.The upgraded projections are some of the numbers used to estimate the potential of the Workforce Acceleration offering. Yet, “running those numbers” is based on the same 550+ BPAs conducting business in the same locales.Insperity expects the number of paid worksite employees to grow in the low-to-mid teens for 2019. As well, it is tracking trends in the marketplace confirming a lack of qualified employees. This deficit tends to drive up both salaries and overtime costs.Insperity estimates its BPA count will grow 13% to 15% in 2019.The company's geographic location expanse now covers 75% of its target market. The number of new sales offices to open in 2019 should number more than six but they will likely open in smaller markets.Insperity will continue to pursue the “midmarket” segment of the market, those businesses with 150 to 5,000 employees. In the third quarter, it did enroll its largest account to date. As well, the company has formed an “enterprise” division for 1,000+ employee companies and national accounts.At a broad glance, Insperity will see more resources in more locations offering more solutions in 2019. And, it expects its adjusted EBITDA growth to outpace the growth of any one of those factors. Still, it believes this is a conservative stance. Market turmoil in October has spilled over into November. Yet, Insperity's share price has fared better than others. Thus, its multiple is holding up and is still above 25 looking forward. For a company experiencing earnings growth at a similar clip over the past four years, such a multiple isn't necessarily unreasonable.Ignoring market turmoil and acknowledging shares are trading at a multiple comparable to its growth rate, Insperity does offer a healthy balance sheet. Cash of $408 million exceeds its debt obligation of $104.4 million.Its dividend payout ratio is less than 20%, as much because its yield is slight at less than 1%. Besides infrequent growth, Insperity has also paid three special dividends since 2012 and has conducted a 2-for-1 stock split.Because of market conditions, there could definitely be better bargains available. But, the projection of double-digit growth for a fifth year is hard to ignore, especially considering two of Insperity's solutions are in their infancy and the company typically adopts a conservative stance."
3995076,52382,2016-08-03T10:32:31-04:00,"The company continues to deliver on the initial promise of operational improvement and consistent growth.Profit booking and recent concerns over the uncertain labor market as well as weak gross profit at the worksite employee level negatively impacted the stock, but the correction seems premature.The relative valuation, successful push into the middle-market segment and continued aggressive sales push may work in favor of the stock.","I have been Bullish on the Insperity (NSP) story for a while, as reflected in here and most recent here, and that is why when I look at the market's extreme reaction over what seems to be profit booking after the strong stock performance mixed with confusion about gross profit per worksite employee and uneven hiring trends during the quarter, I find it compelling enough to put my opinion out on the name.The doubts, somewhat overblown as they may be, mostly revolve around the health of the broader labor market and the relatively weak gross profitability, especially the gross profit per worksite employee per month that was down almost 4.9% for the quarter. The concerns are understandable; given a poor labor market can act as a headwind for the broader HR outsourcing industry that includes PEOs (professional employer organization) like Insperity and soft gross profit per worksite employee per month does raise questions on operational productivity.Looking closely at both the issues, it seems a bit early to get worried. Even with the dip experienced mid-quarter, net hiring remained positive among the company's clients for the full quarter and overtime as the percentage of base pay, a key indicator to gauge the strength of the labor market in the SME market, was down over the last year, but remained over 10%, indicating a need for hiring. The commissions paid by clients to their sales staff, up 5%, remained close to the average levels of last few years. Even though the gross profit increased on an absolute dollar basis, up 9%, the gross profit per worksite employee decline does raise concerns, but part of the decline was due to elevated seasonality visible during the quarter.Overall, some signs are worth monitoring closely, but hardly worth panicking, especially when the stock is backed by a continuous buyback program, more than 3 million shares during the first half, and dividend, almost $10 million.The improvement story continuesBarring these hiccups that may be proven temporary, the story of improving execution and decent double-digit top and bottom-line growth continues. Operationally, double-digit growth of average paid worksite employee continues, helped by high client retention, decent attachment rates and an increase in BPAs. Going forward, upgrades in PEO as well as traditional employment platforms and the expected completion of the certification process under the Small Business Efficiency Act should help improve the competitive positioning as well as the profitability of the business.The improvement in the middle-market segment, which has been historically weak for the company, is continuing, thanks to an increased focus on penetrating the market segment and the cascading down effect of the Affordable Care Act impacting the small-medium market. With the strongest to date pipeline and revenue growth of close to 20%, the middle market segment that constitutes almost 25% of the worksite employees should be a significant growth driver going forward. The sales infrastructure seems ready to help the growth, given the 15% increase in BPAs, leads to sales team growth of more than 80%, upcoming fall sales and retention campaign and hiring of another 25 BPAs by the end of the year.Trading at 16-17 times forward earnings with double-digit growth expectations, the name continues to trade at a discount to peers like Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP), Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) and TriNet (NYSE:TNET)."
3178576,52382,2015-05-14T09:39:54-04:00,"Any consolidation after the stock’s decent performance and jittery market may be an opportunity for fundamentally driven investors.
        Fundamentals turning around and the pace of improvement may accelerate with the addition of new activist investor on board.
        Improving top line growth rate, improving margins, high leverage in the model, good cash flows and decent valuation position the stock well.","With excitement over improving fundamentals and activist investor on the one side and strong stock performance and macro concerns on the other side, Insperity Inc. (NSP) stock price may swing between excitement and pessimism, providing opportunity for investors, especially the ones keeping a close eye over the core value of the business.The stock is up close to 70% over the last one year and trader talk calling for consolidation is just starting to get audible. Besides the run up and valuation, other major concerns raised are the impact of job growth data on the HR (Human Resource) outsourcing companies like Insperity and market getting competitive with startups joining the fray, including the likes of Zenefits, which was valued at $4.5 billion last week and plans to offer services for ""free"". Overall, hardly anything that is usually not associated with a company performing well.But, as the developments, drivers and their financial impact discussed below suggest, the story has long legs, even beyond the benefits associated with the operational changes suggested by the new activist investor on board. The business offers a stable, decent organic revenue growth rate with highly sticky customer base and potential to expand service offerings, while high operating leverage from a Cloud like business model has potential to throw decent cash flows.The Activist viewIn January, a well-respected activist investor disclosed a 13% ownership in the company and spurred management to make changes. Please read the full text of the letter that is available online, but the gist of the message is - improve execution, reduce operating expenses, leverage balance sheet and get rid of 'poison pill' to create value for the shareholders.The letter also suggested that changes could take the stock up to $65, which is merely 20-22% higher from the current levels, but a more granular look at the developments suggest that this $65 goal may be conservative. The target seems to be capturing the operational improvement part, but underestimates the upside potential when combined with top line growth and potential gross profit improvement.The company outperformed expectations for the last three quarters in a row, most of which was before the investment was announced, and now the company is working with the fund to put together a joint plan, the update on which is likely to get announced on the next quarterly call. So overall, new investor on board may have just helped the sentiment so far and real financial improvements should start to flow through soon.Beginning to deliverEven without doing anything revolutionary, there are enough catalysts at hand for the business to drive revenue growth and cash flows. A closer look at the numbers, including the sheet below, would highlight the following key metrics having a major impact on the finances and major drivers for the business- Average worksite employees- Gross profit per worksite employee- Salaries, Wages & Payroll taxes- CommissionsGrowth of average worksite employee holds the key to the revenue growth and the business should be able to rebuild momentum after a brief lull. The growth in 2013 and 2014 slowed down to low single digit rates, partly due to weak additions to new clients, flattish growth from existing clients and poor client retention rate.But the average worksite employees grew more than 9% last quarter and should be able to pick the pace from here to grow at 10-12% this year. Increasing the number of BPAs (Business Performance Advisor) in the sales team, expanding into the middle market segment, improving the productivity of the sales team, monetizing cross-selling opportunities and reducing client attrition should help achieve this growth.The last quarter's growth of more than 9% was achieved by a sales team of 311 trained BPAs and just four additional BPAs from last year same time. The company is planning to ramp the BPAs from an average of 330 in the last quarter to almost 400 by the end of this year, including the trained BPA count of almost 350. Over 60% of the team have tenure of more than 18 months now, which is when the sales team's efficiency start to flow through.Insperity investor presentationBarely represented so far, the middle market segment, which the company defines as 150-5000 WSEs (Worksite Employees), is another segment where the company should gain an edge, especially now that sales and service initiatives to crack that market are starting to bear fruits. The company trained nine of its core market BPAs to handle more middle market leads since the middle market required high level of customization. Company's alignments of incentives across the entire sales team helped increase the number of sales leads for larger accounts and should help monetize cross-selling opportunities.Client attrition decreased from 13% in the first quarter of the last two years to 10% in the most recent quarter. Initiatives to improve service across segments along with efforts to broaden service offerings should help maintain the reduced attrition rates.Modeling out these developments, even conservatively, should lead to decent top line growth for a while.Last quarter, gross profit increased by 22% from the year before and the gross profit per worksite employee increased by 12% to $314 per month. The recent improvement in the gross profit due to the company's efforts to optimize pricing for new and renewing clients, shedding off some lower margin customers and lower healthcare utilization, which was due to the lower COBRA participation and better options offered in the healthcare exchanges. There is limited to suggest that improvement is not sustainable and worth noting that gross profit per employee for 2014 was up close to 11% from the 2010 levels.There is high leverage in the model, which was quite evident last quarter when the worksite employees increased by 9%, revenue increased by 10%, adjusted EBITDA increased by 74% and EPS increased by 105%. This high leverage gets easier to understand when one looks at the breakdown of the operating expenses, as shown in the sheet above.Since incentive compensation is tied to and fluctuates with the operating results, it should result in higher accrual during good times. The company has been able to reduce advertising spend, while improving upon the leads. Having an activist investor should help reign in general & administration costs and depreciation should benefit from the company getting rid of corporate jets as suggested by the activist investor.Gauging the financial impactModeling out the developments should highlight the cash flow potential of the business, high leverage in the model and consciousness in the Street's estimates.ValuationIf 17-20 times this year's earnings or 8-9 times EV/ this year's adjusted EBITDA does not impress much, then a quick DCF analysis may help, especially considering the sustainable cash flows and high visibility offered by the business.Relatively, competitors like Automatic Data Processing (ADP), Paychex (PAYX) and TriNet (TNET) also seem to be trading at least 30-40% premium, based on the EV/ EBITDA basis."
3994429,40101,2016-08-02T07:31:41-04:00,"Insperity reported 2016 second quarter results on August 1st. The company met every guidance mark it had previously offered. It even raised full-year guidance for adjusted diluted EPS.But the company missed analysts' average estimate for revenue by less than 2%. The stock declined as much as 17% on five times the average volume in reaction to the report.The revenue ""miss"" is not likely the culprit for the sell-off.Regardless of the culprit, investors should ask if this is an opportunity to initiate a position in a company now growing revenue and EPS at a double-digit pace.","SourceInsperity's (NYSE:NSP) recent history with an activist firm, Starboard Value, is well-documented. Starboard purchased a majority ownership in the PEO (professional employer organization) in January 2015. In March, the two entities reached a compromise resulting in three directors recommended by Starboard being appointed to the Insperity board of directors.Starboard believed Insperity was undervalued and considered the stock price's potential as much as $64.80 in 2016. It had also defined a list of actions to drive value. The list included Insperity putting itself up for sale. Obviously, that hasn't happened. But, there has been progress on other items from the list:The two firms also created an independent advisory committee to advise on capital allocation plans, expense reductions and targets for margins.When Starboard initiated its interest in Insperity, its revenue growth had dipped in 2013 and stalled in 2014. It is clear that trend line has been improved.Source: Author-created from company dataRevenue grows in line with the number of worksite employees paid. Besides being able to increase the average number of worksite employees paid per month, Insperity also decreased its expense structure. Adjusted EBITDA grew nearly 31% in 2015 over 2014.Source: Author-created from company dataIn March 2016, Starboard notified Insperity more changes were necessary. It acknowledged the company's improvement in 2015. But it still believed the company was undervalued. Starboard sought to add two more directors to Insperity's board.On May 18th, 2016, the two companies reached a second agreement, which superseded the first. Former Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) CFO, Mr. John Morphy, was immediately appointed to the board. Insperity also began a comprehensive search for a tenth independent director. Days later, Insperity increased its dividend to $1.00 annually and authorized a buyback for an additional one million shares.Insperity reported 2016 first quarter results on May 2nd. The company's share price shot up 10% to $62.58 in response to the EPS beat of $0.16. Revenue missed the mark by approximately $3 million.Shares climbed another 11% between May 3rd and May 18th. The announcements detailed above increased shares by as much as another 4% to a high of $72.25.On May 23rd, Starboard started unloading its position. By June 2nd, it had sold one-third of its position at prices ranging from $70 to $72. Still the share price climbed. On June 23rd, Insperity hit a 52-week high of $76.24.On June 27th, the stock pulled back to as low as $72.45. The 5% decline from a new high caught Jim Cramer's attention. He highlighted the Insperity/Starboard story on his show, Mad Money, on June 28, 2016. The share price took off again. Some call it the Cramer effect. Shares soared to $82.18 on July 26th.On August 1st, Insperity reported 2016 second quarter results. The company missed analysts' average revenue estimates by $13.5 million. It beat the average EPS estimate by $0.01.In its first quarter reporting, the company offered guidance for adjusted EBITDA in a range of $24 million to $27 million for the second quarter. It reported $25.6 million. The guidance range for average WSEEs was 163,000 to 164,000. Insperity reported 163,521. Its guidance range for adjusted EPS was $0.54 to $0.62. Adjusted EPS registered $0.60. The company easily delivered in every guidance range it set.As well, even though revenue did not meet the analysts' average estimate, it did improve 12.7% year over year. Operating income improved 31.2% and net income improved 32.8%. Adjusted diluted EPS improved 42.9% compared to 2015.For the full year, Insperity improved its guidance range for adjusted EPS. In the first quarter, Insperity's projection was $3.46 to $3.58 with a midpoint of $3.52. In the second quarter, the range increased to $3.50 to $3.60 with a midpoint of $3.55.In reaction to the report, Insperity's share price fell as much as 17% from a close of $78.29 on July 29th to a low of $66.73 on August 1st. The price closed at $67.22. Volume of 1.5 million shares was over five times the three-month average volume.Two pieces of statistical data could be considered the culprits for the sell-off. Revenue per worksite employee month decreased 1.4% from $1,462 to $1,442. In turn, gross profit per worksite employee decreased 4.9% from $243 to $231. Insperity's management credited seasonality with the decline.Operating expense also decreased per worksite employee per month. The net effect was an increase of over 17% in both operating income per worksite employee per month and net income per worksite employee per month.Another comment about revenue in the earnings call could have triggered a mild sell-off.It could be that panic impacts hearing.Source: Author-created from company dataIt's possible the sell-off was profit-taking. It's also possible the sell-off reflected the next phase of a purposeful unloading. The question is really whether the sell-off provides an opportunity to initiate a position.At a midpoint of $3.55 for adjusted diluted earnings per share, the current year multiple, after the sell-off, is approximately 19. At the midpoint, adjusted diluted EPS in 2016 will grow 62% compared to 2015. The multiple could easily be considered too conservative.However, it is quite appropriate to look forward rather than backward. For 2017, analysts are projecting growth over 17%. Coincidentally, the historical five-year average P/E ratio for Insperity's industry is 17.5. At a multiple of 17.5, Insperity's stock would be fairly valued at $72.63. Thus, any ability to purchase below that point should provide upside as well as at least a 1.38% yield."
4060459,102758,2017-04-05T12:24:32-04:00,"Insperity is poised for success as companies outsource more and more.The company presents a fair value, solid growth, and a dividend.Insperity is well diversified, adding to its stability.","ThesisInsperity (NYSE:NSP) has a lethal combination of things going for it. As (other) companies outsource, Insperity prospers. I believe this trend of outsourcing will continue. I believe Insperity will succeed and continue to reward its shareholders.About The CompanyInsperity provides human resources and business solutions to small and medium-sized businesses in the United States. The company's human resources solutions handle things like benefits, payroll, workers comp, record management, employer liability, recruiting, support, and training. It has also taken to the cloud with the Employee Service Center. This is a cloud-based all around HR solutions system. Its clients are, well, everyone. This is shown in Figure 1.Figure 1: Insperity's ClientsSource: Insperity Investor PresentationThe company is comfortably mid cap with a $1.8B market cap. It is largely owned by institutions and insiders. Insiders own almost 13% of the company which I like to see. Average daily trade volume is 150,000 shares. This suggests the company is underfollowed.What I LikeInsperity has a somewhat high P/E at 27.7. However, forward P/E is a much better 17.4. PEG is 0.59, suggesting the company is a good value based on expected growth. I am okay with the high P/E in this case. But, it is up to you to decide if you think the company's growth justifies this valuation. It is worth noting that the company trades roughly on par with future cash flow.The company has posted some excellent growth. Year over year, quarterly revenue was up 12% and quarterly earnings were up 50%. Earnings are expected to increase 22% next year as well. Past and future earnings for the company are shown in Figure 2.Figure 2: Insperity Past And Future EarningsSource: Simply Wall StWhat I like, a whole lot, about Insperity are its powerful performance metrics. The company boasts a return on equity of 56.6%. This is way ahead of the commercial services average. Return on assets for the company is 7.9% and slightly ahead of industry average. Return on capital is 34% and miles ahead of the competition. This is shown in Figure 3.Figure 3: Insperity Performance MetricsSource: Simply Wall StThe company has some debt. Current debt/equity is 172%. However, total debt is well covered by operating cash flow. And, interest on debt is well covered by earnings. It is something to keep an eye on, but not a deal breaker in my opinion.The company has also returned a ton of cash to shareholders. Since 2014, it has boosted its share repurchase plan a lot. It is worth noting that Insperity pays a 1.15% dividend with a payout ratio of 24% as well.Opportunities And DriversThe first driver I would like to address is the demographic shift to outsourcing 'desk jobs'. In this article titled: The End of Employees, there is a quote. The quote is ""We will outsource every job that we can that is not customer-facing."" I highly recommend you read the article in its entirety, but that quote seems to summarize the popular opinion of the C-suites. So, as companies outsource business, software, insurance, and advisory services, Insperity stands to flourish.This trend shows! Insperity has grown its average worksite employees from 130k in 2014 to 186k (estimated) for this year. As an added bonus, adj EBITDA per worksite employee has grown just as steadily. The company also offers a competitive advantage in its breadth of services. This is shown in Figure 4.Figure 4: Insperity Breadth Of ServicesSource: Insperity Investor PresentationIn Figure 1, I showed the diversity of the company's clients. This is as much a driver as it is a risk mitigator. Insperity has something to offer everyone, across all industries. This means the opportunity for the company is virtually limitless.RisksThe risks stated in the company's 10-K are pretty standard. Insperity is subject to general economic conditions. It assumes liability for payroll, taxes, and benefit costs. Healthcare reform could affect its health insurance business. These just come with the territory as far as I can tell.Despite being owned by insiders and institutions, there has been a lot of selling by both parties. Like, a serious amount. I haven't been able to come up with a reason why. And, insiders at the company still own 13% of it. I don't see any cause for worry but I do see something to keep an eye on.It is worth mentioning the risk in a P/E of 27. Should the company fail to continue its growth or fail to grow enough, it may experience multiple contractions. This is not something I am too worried about, considering the growth history and opportunity. However, it is worth keeping in mind.Final ThoughtsAs companies continue down the road of outsourcing everyone that isn't customer facing, Insperity is poised for success. The company is a fair value in my opinion. I believe it will produce substantial growth going forward. I believe it will reward its shareholders. I think the insiders know this as well with their significant ownership despite recent selling. I believe Insperity is a long-term winner."
2990216,20568,2015-03-10T19:44:39-04:00,,"Insperity Inc (NYSE:NSP) has seen its estimates increase due to solid Q4 14 earnings results, beating both the Zacks Consensus Earnings and Revenue estimates, and management increased guidance in 2015 due to higher average worksite employees and higher gross profit correlated to healthcare. Due to these factors Insperity has become the Zacks Bull of the Day.This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company is engaged in providing an array of human resources and business solutions. Services offered by Insperity includes, Workforce Optimization in the marketplace, Midmarket Solutions, Performance Management, Expense Management, Time and Attendance, Organizational Planning, Employment Screening, Recruiting Services, Retirement Services, Business Insurance and Technology Services. The company is headquartered in Kingwood, Texas.During the most recent earnings announcement, Insperity's management increased guidance due to three major factors: Management expects a 10-12% year over year increase in average paid Worksite Employees (WSE), adjusted EPS to increase 26-32% to a range of $1.82-$1.92, and adjusted EBITDA is now expected to grow 20-25% year over year. This news caused the stock to jump over 8% after the announcement, but it is expected to continue to increase due to management's history of being extremely conservative in their guidance.Positive Earnings SurprisesThe table below shows EPS surprises and the subsequent price appreciation. As you can see Insperity has consistently beaten the Zacks Consensus Earnings EPS estimates, and has seen solid positive price movements post earnings. Further, the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate for the past 5 consecutive quarters, and has posted an 4 quarter average positive earnings surprise of +21.79%.Increasing EstimatesDue to their strong Q4 earnings and increased guidance, the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimates have increased significantly over the past 30 days for Q1 15, and for FY 15; Q1 15 increased from $0.41 to $0.62, and FY 15 rose from $1.31 to $1.71.Bottom LineWith solid Q4 results, and increased guidance, Insperity has positioned itself for increased earnings and revenue growth in 2015. According to CEO Paul Sarvadi, ""Our successful fall selling and retention campaign has reestablished momentum in growth and profitability and set Insperity up for double digit unit growth in 2015. Our long-term strategy to offer a wide array of business performance solutions to establish a broader platform for growth is now in place and producing excellent results."""
2838746,41741,2015-01-22T18:47:06-05:00,"Starboard Value is a major owner of NSP after a 13D filing yesterday -- owning over 13% of the HR company.The big news is that a buyout could now be on the table, with Starboard urging NSP to hire a bank to sell itself.This comes as NSP has been a notorious underperformer over the last few years.","Seemingly, the guys over at Starboard Value never sleep. They are in the running with ValueAct Capital for one of the most active activist investors over YTD. Their latest endeavor is Insperity Inc. (NYSE:NSP). Per a 13D filed yesterday, Starboard owns 13.2% of the company. The recent buy puts NSP as high as seventh in Starboard's pro forma portfolio:Source: stockpucker Starboard portfolioIn conjunction with the 13D filing, Starboard has also sent a letter to NSP's board. Here's the crux of the thesis:With these capital allocation and cost improvements, Starboard sees shares reaching $53.84 to $64.80 over the next year. Starboard has a $33.75 to $34.00 a share cost basis. Shares have already spiked nearly 10% on the Starboard news -- putting shares up 38% over the last 3-months.Quick overview of the situation: NSP is one of the largest human resources outsourcing companies in the U.S., offering payroll service and HR-related services. Most investors know ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) in this space, but with just a billion market cap, NSP is often overlooked.Part of that is because the company's stock price has underperformed the S&P 500 by 11 percentage points over the last half decade.The company does have a 99% retention rate and operates in a stable part of the market. And as Starboard has pointed out, there's plenty of growth for this industry, where the market is underpenetrated -- with just 10% of small and medium businesses in the U.S. using outsourced HR services.The big issue: It's worth noting that NSP has managed to underperform the market and its major peers on a stock price basis over the last few years. But in terms of revenue growth, NSP has managed to grow revenues by 41% over the last five years, better than either ADP or Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX).And shares of NSP do appear to be in value territory, trading at 10x forward EV/EBITDA, while a blend of peers, including Trinet Group (NYSE:TNET), ADP, PAYX, Towers Watson (NASDAQ:TW) and WageWorks (NYSE:WAGE) trade at an average multiple of over 16x. NSP also trades at the cheapest EV/FCF and forward EV/sales amongst that group.But there's more to the story than just that. Much of the hype is around the fact that Starboard is pushing for a buyout of NSP. The other thing (and more underrated) that Starboard will be pushing for is cost cuts. That's where we think the big opportunity lies.NSP's EBITDA margin is just 2.7%, while the likes of ADP is at 22% and PAYX at 43%. What's more is that NSP's return on equity is just 10% (the lowest among its major peers), and below its 5-year median ROE of 12.5% and 10-year median of 15.3%.So what's the fix for costs? Part of it is ad spending. It spends a lot on TV advertising and sports events. And the company also spent over 20% of its revenue on general and admin expense over the last twelve months. As we outlined here, Starboard Value's Letter To Insperity, here's an example of where Starboard thinks NSP can cut costs:Other catalysts? Beyond just a buyout and margin improvement, there is an opportunity for share buybacks. NSP carries no debt and has over 20% of its market cap covered by cash on the balance sheet. Its business is not capital intensive and many of its peers carry leverage. Even still, Starboard thinks NSP could buyback 20% of its shares without taking on any debt.There is some risk with Starboard: The idea of having too many ""irons in the fire"" is a big strain on management bandwidth -- which is a finite asset. When you get companies doing too many things, that's generally a bad thing, because management only has so much time, ability to focus, core competencies, etc.This is also true for hedge funds, and Starboard has a lot going on right now. They are pushing for the Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO)-AOL (NYSE:AOL) merger, as well as the Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS)-Office Depot (NASDAQ:ODP) merger. Did the big win over at Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) give Starboard a god complex? Perhaps. This is the fourth activist campaign that Starboard has started within the last quarter.Where we stand: Starboard's fair value for NSP is 35% to 63% higher than where shares currently trade. Granted, Starboard could be spreading itself thin of late, some of that risk is alleviated with NSP, where there's another activist involved.Stadium Capital also owns over 9% of the company and launched an activist campaign back in March. Together the two own over 20% of the company and they agree that the private jets at NSP have to go. If you have some time to kill, check out Stadium Capital's 150-plus page presentation on NSP from back in April, located here.Much of the market is focused on Starboard's buyout thesis, where the activist has said that a sale would provide for a better risk-adjusted return versus a standalone plan. But I think the rightsizing of its cost structure would go a long way in getting shares higher. Either way, NSP appears to have a number of catalysts for boosting value."
9966,20127,2006-05-03T10:28:56-04:00,,"Administaff Inc. (ASF) got killed in the marketplace yesterday dropping $10.82 per share, almost 20%. The PEO business model (professional employer organization) is attractive in that it affords small businesses the opportunity to outsource HR functions like payroll and workers comp and other employee benefits to an outside expert rather than build internal administration. 
The risk in the business is that ASF remains liable for payroll, benefits, and insurance costs of the hired employees whether or not the client pays. Hence, the company's margins could be squeezed at times of rapidly changing health insurance premiums, not to mention, if the client were to run into financial difficulties and fail to meet payroll. Despite the growth in the best of times, in my view, there is economic sensitivity in this business.
The returns on capital over time have been reasonably impressive coming in at around 14%. However, despite the sell-off, the EV/EBIT remains at about 20 times, still too expensive in my view.
From the standpoint of returning capital to shareholders, ASF has bought back little stock in the last five years on a net basis. A dividend was instituted last year of 7 cents quarterly which was recently stepped up to 9 cents providing a current yield of 0.76%.
Wall Street estimates of growth rates going forward have been cranked up from 20% to 28% in the last twelve months. In my view, the Street's dreaming!
An interesting interview with Jim MacDonald and Tom van Fleet of First Analysis Securities discussing this space can be found here.
Judging from the insider transactions at ASF, particularly those of the CEO, I find little reason to get involved even at these prices.

3976116,52382,2016-05-19T15:36:55-04:00,"Performance has started to improve, but the prospects look even better from here onwards.Operational improvements and close monitoring from the activist investors offering a strong tailwind.Changing board should allow the stock to benefit from improvement in finances as well as financial engineering.","Insperity Inc. (NYSE:NSP) stock has performed well since my last note and before questions about profit taking take prominence, taking a closer look at the fundamentals might serve investors well, especially those who are less bothered about the short-term volatility related to the profit taking. The business is performing well and most operational metrics seem to suggest that the momentum of improvement going forward may even improve.One of the biggest positives for the company has been the involvement of some prominent, and effective (considering the operational improvement of the business) activist investors. More importantly, the improvement seen in the business is not driven by financial engineering, which is what some of the short-term focused investors tend to focus on and usually provides a 'sugar high' to the business, but driven by improved execution and strategic changes that have a relatively 'long tail' and may continue to deliver for the shareholders.Stable environment and performanceImage Source: MarketwatchEven though job growth may continue to shadow the broader HR outsourcing industry (including payroll processing, payroll tax compliance, employee administration, benefits management and enrollment, reporting and analytics), the company as a leader in PEO (professional employer organization) services should be able to hold its own. Readers who are new to the name, please refer to my previous note for a detailed background of the business. From a macro demand standpoint, metrics like overtime pay/regular pay (which was up 10% among the company's clients) or commissions (up 11% among the company's clients) are encouraging.Source: InsperityThe company has performed well, which may be evident from the recent stock movement, and the move towards improved growth and profitability seems established. The revenues grew by 15 percent in the most recent quarter, a welcome change from the usual mid-high single-digit type of growth rate, while net income more than doubled over last year. Other operating metrics were equally impressive.The next leg of improvement is already beginning to take shapeOff course, rather than the past performance, what matters is the next leg of improvement and looking at the leading indicators of the business, success achieved by the company in the different market segments as well as other initiatives to improve profitability, the confidence in the pace of improvement grows.There has been a consistent improvement in terms of attrition and retention rates, providing insight into future growth trends. The attrition rates came down to 7.6% in the most recent quarter, near all-time lows and significantly lower than the attrition rates of 12-13% seen two years ago as well as the usual volatility that is seen at the start of the year. Since the lower client attrition rate has a positive bearing on the average paid worksite employees that grew at 15% last quarter (up from 3% in 2014 and 12% in 2015) and revenues, one can expect positive top line growth momentum to continue. The client retention rate of 85% is also significantly higher than the long-term average of 80%, providing an elevated level of revenue visibility.Historically, the company has been successful mostly with small clients, but now the trend seems to be changing with the help of improvement in sales processes, offering a range of service options, customized offerings and an increased level of engagement with senior management. The result is an improvement in the mid-market segment, which saw attrition in the largest clients reduced by 74%. The attrition for small and emerging growth segments also declined, by 37% and 32%, respectively.The size and execution of the sales process has also improved, the early benefits of which are already visible. Last quarter, sales were 10% ahead of the budgeted sales, the number of trading BPAs (business performance advisors) increased by 12% and the sales efficiency improved by 4%. The corporate leads increased by 76% from last year and unique visitors to the company site increased by 40%, a handsome tailwind for any business, especially if the market expectations are for a low double-digit type of revenue growth, like in the case of Insperity.Just as the top line growth is getting established, operating profitability has also started to improve. Operating expenses per worksite employee per month declined 11% during last quarter. Even though the business has a 50/50 mix of fixed and variable costs, the improvement is a result of cost-cutting initiatives, besides the usual operating leverage in the model. Just as a reference to measure the company's ability to deliver profits, the company's gross profit per worksite employee and operating income per worksite employee exceeded the industry (consisting of ADP (NASDAQ:ADP), Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) and TriNet (NYSE:TNET)) averages by 151% and 120%, respectively, during 2012-2014.Sometimes a nudge is all it takesStarboard Value, a renowned activist fund, got seats on the board and since the issues raised by the fund and other investors are still relevant, shareholders can expect continued pressure, and improvement, going forward. The common investor concerns were that the business is deeply undervalued, partly due to high and unproductive spending as highlighted by private jets for senior management and golf tournament sponsorships, and an independent advisory committee to make recommendations on spending and other financial decisions, including a sale, should help.So far, some of the easy pickings have been picked, be it getting rid of the jets, changes at the board level, dividend increases and buybacks, but from an operational improvement standpoint, the improvements have just started to deliver and there is still significant potential to create value for the shareholders. Besides the operational and corporate governance improvements, the stock should be able to benefit from stretching the balance sheet a bit and exploring other strategic options, including a sale, things that should gain prominence now that the board has a wider representation of the outside investors.How much higher from here?Even if directionally the positive momentum seems to be established, the big question as to how much higher from current levels still remains. Even if one ignores any possibility of a strategic action, including sale or merger, the business continues to trade at a discount to other major players in the space. Considering the paid worksite employees can grow around 10-20%, leading to an equally decent revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA growth of 15-25%, not just the expectations look conservative, but the business also deserves to trade at a premium rather than a discount.Source: InsperitySecondly, now that the company has a Board member with previous experience at Paychex, entertaining the idea of a sale or other strategic deal might be apt and looking at the size of the balance sheet required to pull a deal like this through, there are only a handful of players that come to mind. In terms of valuation benchmarks, the Cast & Crew, which was expected to generate less than $10 million of free cash flow for the current fiscal year while growing revenue at low-double digits, was acquired by Silver Lake for $700 million."
1552292,40101,2013-07-17T07:54:45-04:00,,"Insperity (NYSE:NSP) is a professional employer organization (NYSE:PEO). It offers human resource and business solutions to small and medium-sized companies. Its array of solutions is comprehensive. It spans a bucket load of services from recruiting to training, employee management, payroll, benefits administration and workman's compensation administration all the way through retirement.Though the PEO industry has been around 30 years, it is relatively young by acceptance standards. Its roots are in the outsourcing movement. It fits with the trending concept encouraging a company to focus on its core business. For a small to medium-sized business with a workforce that is stretched thin and overloaded, the idea of being able to focus on the core business while relying on a competent partner to handle administrative duties is appealing. Yet, the concept of an employee being ""co-employed"" by an administrative employer and a worksite employer is still foreign to many. And yet, the worksite company is not the only beneficiary in a PEO arrangement. For the employee, a PEO will be well-versed and competent regarding employment laws, tax regulations and government compliance. Because of economies of scale, a PEO should be able to offer more attractive benefits options than the individual companies partnering with the PEO.According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics, through the first quarter of 2012, there were over 58 million employees employed by companies with less than 500 employees. The PEO industry reports that its average client has 20 employees. The majority of PEO clients have between 10 and 100 employees. This narrows the prime market to 28 million employees. In the next step up, the market for firms with between 100 and 500 employees is 19 million. Insperity estimates fewer than 5% of the employees of small businesses are co-employed by a PEO and a worksite employer. This equates to only 2.35 million co-employed employees of the 47 million that exist in the market of businesses with 10 to 500 employees.In 2012, Insperity paid an average of 125,650 employees a month. Its guidance for 2013 is a 3.5% increase to 130,000. By these metrics, Insperity has captured 5.3% of the existing 2.35 million in the market and has its sights set on 5.5% by year-end 2013. Insperity's long-term objective is to ""serve the top 10% of the small business community"". If growth continues to track at 0.2% per year, that objective is ""long-term"" indeed - namely, it could be a 22-year term.Insperity profiles small businesses based on risk and success criteria as displayed in this slide from its most recent investor presentation:As shown, Insperity immediately eliminates 60% of small businesses as potential clients because they are high risk and/or struggling. This leaves only 40% of businesses that Insperity classifies as surviving, producing or thriving as well as classifies as medium to low risk. With Insperity narrowing its demographics to the top 10% of the market or the top 25% of the choice 40%, it may appear the potential is too limited. However, converting the percentages to actual numbers, the view becomes clearer. It is a broad assumption to state that the choice 40% of the businesses also employ exactly 40% of the employees. But, we'll use the assumption strictly for illustration purposes. So, 40% of 47 million equates to 18.8 million potential employees narrowed by Insperity's criteria. The long-term goal of the top 10% or Insperity's top 25% of the choice 40%, the field is narrowed to 4.7 million employees. As a reminder, Insperity's current 2013 projection is to serve 130,000 employees. That leaves a staggering 4.57 million in its sights.It would be a fair question to wonder where, by estimations, will 4,000+ additional worksite employees lead in terms of financial gain for Insperity?Insperity's 2012 revenue was $2.159 billion equating to an average of $17,181 per year or $1,432 per month per worksite employee. Direct costs, such as payroll taxes, benefits and worker's compensation insurance, are deducted from this average. Inperity's net income was $40.4 million at year-end 2012. That amount equated to $26.80 per worksite employee by one metric and to $1.56 of earnings per share by another. In 2008, Insperity averaged $32.62 of net income per month per worksite employee but dropped to $12.70 per month in 2009. It has steadily increased by an average of 29% from 2009 to 2012 as depicted in the table below.Applying the average increase of 29% equates to a projection of $34.41 per worksite employee in 2013. Thus, between the estimated increase in worksite employees and the average profit upside trend per worksite employee, it is a simple projection to expect 2013 net income of $53.68 million. That income would then equate to earnings per share of at least $2.10.However, Insperity is not projecting $2.10 per share for 2013. It is projecting a range of $1.51 to $1.61 with a midpoint of $1.56 per share. That midpoint means no growth over 2012's endpoint. When a company guides flat or lower for the current year compared to the prior year, it can be puzzling. When a company guides flat or lower without offering a valid reason, it's frustrating. Investors will usually tolerate a well-planned change of direction. Some investors will even stick it out through challenging periods such as financial restatements if they believe in a business long-term.Now, the fair question seems to be is Insperity puzzling or frustrating or offering valid and transparent explanation to shareholders and potential investors?Insperity did not provide revenue or direct cost per worksite employee guidance for 2013. It did provide a gross profit per worksite employee projection ($260-$263) equal to a 3.35% increase over 2012 ($253). The increase is being offset by an increased projection ($218-$219) for operating expenses per worksite employee of 5% over 2012 ($208). This results in a projected ($42-$44) operating income midpoint of $43 per worksite employee. That midpoint is a decrease of 4% compared to 2012 ($44.76).One explanation for the increase in operating expenses is the intention to increase the number of trained ""business performance advisors"" (BPAs) from 245 in 2012 to 300 in 2013. The 2012 operating expenses totaled $314.7 million. The projection for 2013 is $340.5 million to $342.5 million with a $341.5 million midpoint. So, the difference in operating expenses between 2012 and 2013 is an increase of $26.8 million. However, salaries and benefits for 55 additional employees does not fully account for $26.8 million. In fact, Insperity reports this increase at approximately $4 million. Insperity forecasts:Business Performance Advisors are responsible for account management from the initial sales cycle through support and maintenance.Another operating expense impact focuses around health care reform. In the spring of 2012, Insperity focused a task force including 2 full-time employees on the task ""to study all aspects of the 2,500 page legislation and to develop and implement appropriate strategies"". In 2013, the number of full-time employees will grow from 2 to 14. Insperity reported:This expense accounts for another $2 million of the operating expense increase. According to Insperity, this equates to a cost of $0.05 per share. Insperity expects health care reform to give it the opportunity to expand its health benefits offerings.Other operating expenses are expected to grow as well:These expenses equate to $12.3 million which is clearly the bulk of the increase in operating expenses. Adding in the $4 million for BPAs and $2 million for health care reform, that still leaves $8.4 million to reach an increase of $26.8 million.While there is definitely a seasonality impact to Insperity's quarterly reporting, first quarter reporting can still reveal how Insperity is tracking compared to its 2013 guidance. Even though gross profit per worksite employee for the year was projected at $260-$263, the first quarter projection was $287-$291. First quarter results averaged $292 per worksite employee, beating the high end of the projection. Operating expenses are somewhat more evenly divided by quarter with the first quarter projection at $86 million. First quarter operating expenses totaled $86.1 million.Besides tracking well on financial projections, Insperity is also easily on track to have 300 trained BPAs in 2013. Training itself takes 2 months. Insperity has hired an additional 114 BPAs since October 2012. Insperity expects to reach the goal of 300 trained BPAs before the second quarter of 2013 ends. In Insperity management's first quarter prepared remarks, the CEO stated:The growth starts to show 6 to 12 months after staff is trained.There are two major reasons having more trained BPAs is critical for Insperity: 1) the introduction of its ""Customer for Life"" philosophy and 2) health care reform. Insperity's own explanation of its maturing business model describes it better than any attempt to reword it:Compliance for businesses regarding health care reform commences January 1st, 2014. Insperity has spent over a year analyzing the thousands of pages in the act. It has condensed the concerns into five areas:Business owners have no choice but to spend 2013 figuring out the health care reform requirements or finding a partner such as Insperity to trust with the responsibility. Insperity expects if it can portray a confidence to both existing and potential clients that it can alleviate the anxieties associated with health care reform, its business will grow.While things may be aligning for growth at Insperity, it also has some shareholder-friendly historical positions worth noting. Insperity has no debt. It pays an annual dividend of $0.68 which translates to a yield of 2.1% based on its 50-day moving average of $31.06. Insperity also has an active share buyback program. As of year-end 2012, over 829,000 shares were still authorized for repurchase.So, at first glance, it may appear Insperity is expecting to plateau in 2013 because earnings per share are projected to be flat. However, further review reveals Insperity may well be just pausing and setting up for revenue, profit and share price ascensions. The market is certainly not yet saturated and the motivation of the marketplace should reach a frenzy before the year ends.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

In Insperity's (NYSE:NSP) case, we think the firm is significantly undervalued. We think the company is worth $41 per share.For some background, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation and relative valuation versus industry peers is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index, which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. We show how the performance of our VBI has stacked up per underlying score below:If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis, it scores high on our scale. Insperity posts a VBI score of 6, reflecting our 'undervalued' DCF assessment of the company and its attractive relative valuation versus industry peers. We use Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP), Korn/Ferry (NYSE:KFY), Manpower (NYSE:MAN), and Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) for our peer group analysis.Our Report on InsperityIn the spirit of transparency, our expanded pdf report on Insperity and hundreds of other companies can be found here. imagesInvestment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsInsperity earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 35% during the past three years.Insperity's valuation is compelling at this time. The firm is trading at a nice discount to our estimate of its fair value, even after considering an appropriate margin of safety. The firm's forward earnings multiple and PEG ratio also look attractive versus peers.Insperity's cash flow generation and financial leverage aren't much to speak of. The firm's free cash flow margin has averaged about 2.8% during the past three years, lower than the mid-single-digit range we'd expect for cash cows. The firm had no debt at the end of last quarter.The firm's shares have underperformed the market benchmark during the past quarter. Although Insperity's valuation appears attractive, the company is currently exhibiting characteristics of a potential value trap, and we'd still be cautious at these levels. There may be a better entry point yet.The firm sports a very nice dividend yield of 2.3%. We expect the firm to pay out about 36% of next year's earnings to shareholders as dividends.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Insperity's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 35%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.8%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Insperity's free cash flow margin has averaged about 2.8% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively MEDIUM. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Insperity, cash flow from operations increased about 596% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 292% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Insperity's shares are worth between $31.00 - $51.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $41 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 20.6 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 9.8 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 8.1% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 6.1%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 2%, which is below Insperity's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 0.8% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Insperity, we use a 10.8% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $41 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Insperity. We think the firm is attractive below $31 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $51 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Insperity's fair value at this point in time to be about $41 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Insperity's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $52 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $41 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
